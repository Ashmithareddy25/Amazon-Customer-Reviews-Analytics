B00009YOQW|5.0|my 3 yr old has had this drum for 2 yrs now and still loves it when I pull it out! (we rotate toys)  It is fun to hit and makes a VERY satisfying sound.  It's light tone is beautiful and listening to her play is is wonderful and not ear piercing.  It is also VERY durable, so whenever we have a \\"rough and tumble\\" friend over for music group, I don't have to worry about damage!<br /><br />We LOVE this toy!
031250926X|5.0|I love this book! I had just the original hardback version of Brown Bear, but when shopping for a gift ran across this one. I love that the slide and find is another way to help teach predictions, recall and sequencing along with other skills that were teachable with the other version, such as color, vocabulary and rhyme. Overall a GREAT book for young children.
0553212419|4.0|I first read Sherlock Holmes when I was six years old, and if you read him every ten years they are as good as new. (I'm now 64). Stern and arrogant, but fair he was: though concerning the Giant Rat of Sumatra he may have been a little reticent.<br />The typeface is a bit too faint, but these novels and short stories excel in the Bantam editions because they are in chronological order. This makes it easier to understand \\"His Last Bow\\" for example.<br />I purchased both volumes at the same time so this review serves for both.<br />Conan Doyle gets all the credit! Try all the rest of his books.
B00005QB42|5.0|The Essence DVD ,!is a great music! not only  for a restorative clase,I used it for a regular Asana class. I highly recomended it,all my students loved it, (I play it a lot), for that reason, I buy a second one since the first one went bad. Everybody ask me for it!
B0041KKYEM|2.0|After reading the reviews I wonder if I watched the same movie as many others. :-)      I like the director Darren Aronofsky as I think he is a very creative director, but for this movie therein lies the problem. I kept seeing ads for how great a performance Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis gave, not to mention the psychological twist that was evident and promoted in the trailer. But what a downer of a movie. One word sums it up: obsession. So if you want to watch an almost 2hr movie about obsession, it might be your cup of tea. Portman and Kunis DID give excellent performances deserving of the accolades, but the movie failed on numerous levels and there wasn't a likable character at all or any that the viewer could really identify with. And without spoiling too much, the movie got to where you didn't know what was real or what was a dream very quick and I think this works with a less is more approach, but on this one Aronofsky, himself, I think got confused and the movie really falls apart at the seams in the last 3rd. With that said, it IS an interesting and disturbing movie and has some graphic girl on girl sex scenes (which seemed out of place and gratuitous--you'll understand when you see it). If these scenes have a point, great but it was like they were thrown in to keep the husband's (who got dragged to see it) attention. So it's hard to rate. As a movie, maybe 6/10, slightly above average. Yet the performance of at least Portman was easily a 8 or 9/10 and was the best I've ever seen from her. Just wish it had been in a better movie!
B0041T4ML4|2.0|I had high hopes for The Windup Girl, but about ¼ into the novel I wanted to put it down. I couldn't get over how poorly it is written, rife with dubious use of grammar (too many simple sentences, use of the passive voice, stilted sentence fragments, and much more!), mechanical errors, and clich&eacute;. Around 20% of the novel could have been edited out due to redundancy. Especially irksome were random and repetitive insertions of uncommon English words among banal lines of prose. Thesaurus, anyone?<br /><br />Character and scene development were limited due to the author TELLING us what is happening rather than SHOWING us. Because of this, I couldn't build empathy for any of the characters or feel especially present in the scenes. Meanwhile, my intelligence felt increasingly insulted with every passing chapter.<br /><br />The eco-warefare and environmental repercussions concepts of the story intrigued me, but I was disappointed with the erratic flow and a lacking denouement. All of the action happens in the last 10% of the book. I only slogged through The Windup Girl because my friend seemed to have enjoyed it and I wanted to be able to talk about it afterwards. Overall, a poor use of the English language.
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|I was very excited to purchase this game because I thought it would be similar to Lego Creator: The Race to Build it Board Game and this game was very different. Instead of racing to build an item you had to create an item from scratch with very few legos.  If you are not a skilled builder no one can guess what you just built.  My kids are 8 and 5 and this just frustrated them entirely.  They weren't skilled enough to build an item from a picture with out directions like they give you on the other game.  I preferred the Lego Creator and not Creationary.  This game is clearly for older kids that are very skilled at building.  I just wanted a fun family game. Lego should consider bringing back Lego Creator.  It is a much better game.
B004FEFZU2|3.0|Saw's Final Chapter does everything it set out to do: It ties up all the loose ends, is done in 3D, is exceptionally gory, brings back characters throughout the earlier films, and ends the long-running story-driven plot. The problem is, most of these weren't accomplished in the best ways they could've been.    When a long-running horror franchise ends, it's nice to see everything fit together and make sense by the conclusion, which The Final Chapter achieves. But somehow, even though the film debuted within the timeframe of all the others, it feels rushed and insignificant. Perhaps this is due to what was to be Saw's biggest twist of all. It was not only suspected by most Saw die-hards, but the filmakers chose to introduce this colossal twist within the movie's first 10 minutes, ruining the effect. From that point on, it's a dead giveaway.    This isn't to say The Final Chapter doesn't have its moments. The acting is as good as it's always been for returning characters, so if you liked/disliked them before, nothing changes here. There are a few twists and turns along the way, which for better or worse, is entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, Tobin Bell(Jigsaw)'s screen time is significantly reduced. He appears in only a scant few scenes, and the perfomances are very brief. This makes the rest of the film's shortcomings all the more conspicuous.     The gore is top-notch, and is done magnificently throughout; perhaps better than ever before. The 3D effects are good as well, but let it be known you don't see a whole lot of it. Horror fans will likely find My Bloody Valentine 3D to be far more satisfying in the 3D department. The overall look is similar to what you'd come to expect from a Saw film, though there is a very interesting trap setpiece done in public while in broad daylight. It's new for the series, and is a very welcome addition.    Saw: The Final Chapter is an interesting film, and ties up the numerous loose ends from the earlier installments, making theannual horror series come full circle. Most die-hards will enjoy it, as it accomplishes all it's primary objectives. It's just that it seems if that was the filmakers' only goal, and to do it as quickly as possible. The Final Chapter manages to come together, but something's missing. It's a good movie and a good Saw film, but it may not be the epic finale you were hoping for.
B00001SIES|4.0|I'm a \\"new\\" fan of theirs. I loved their music since \\"Time is Running Out\\", but never really bothered getting an album until \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\". And to be honest I didn't know expect from this album (okay maybe I was expecting songs like Sing for Absolution or Starlight). I love this album and it's going to be in my heavy rotation on my iPod. Everything on this album is absolutely raw and honest. Drumming, bass, guitar, and vocals are very well done for many of the album. And there's songs that seemed to be rushed. But I don't blame them since they haven't honed in their craft to reach what they have done in the past few albums (The Resistence, Black Holes and Revelations, and Absolution).  Don't expect songs to be like their new material since this album is a bit \\"immature\\". Its definitely an album that any Muse fan should have in their collection. I'm still trying to figure out how this band and Radiohead sound anything a like. There two separate bands and two awesome bands.
0792843584|3.0|\\"Heaven's Gate\\" is a 3 hr & 39 min long, at times slow moving saga, based upon a true story of the bloodshed between the cattle barons and the immigrant settlers in Johnson County Wyoming in the 1890's.

Originally, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" started out as being 5 hr & 25 min, but when it wasn't given approval, got trimmed down to what it is on this DVD.  Officially released in November of 1980.<br />Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, Jeff Bridges, John Hurt, Sam Waterston, Brad Dourif, Joseph Cotton, Paul Koslo, Ronnie Hawkins, Tom Noonan, Geoffrey Lewis, Richard Masur, Terry O'Quinn, Mickey Rourke, and William Dafoe star in \\"Heaven's Gate.\\"  The western theme of the time period tries to blend with Harvard University business men, cattle barons, and wealthy land owners, and then European immigrant settlers are added.<br />The movie has enough star power.  Isabella Huppert gets naked and gives us full frontal nudity more than once.  \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is a confusing title, because I'm not sure what it refers to.  The director wanted to call this film, \\"The Johnson County War\\" but producers said the name didn't have the right feel to it, and finally all those involved agreed upon \\"Heaven's Gate.\\"  When you watch this film, you know right off, the title change made no difference in the outcome for this movie.  But the real problem for this film was Alexander Hague (serving under the Ronald Reagan administration) advised movie making studios, \\"There will be no more films made with a negative view of American history, like `Heaven's Gate.'\\"<br />Although it meanders far and wide, the movie isn't all that bad, except for the depiction of poverty clashing with wealth.  It is a theme far too many people are personally familiar with, and the outcome doesn't always have to include death to impact that experience.<br />I neither hated nor loved \\"Heaven's Gate.\\"  But if Isabella Huppert wasn't showing off her assets, I doubt if I'd watch this film more than once.  Critics apparently agree, and this movie has been listed among box office failures such as \\"Cutthroat Island,\\" \\"Treasure Planet,\\" \\"Red Planet,\\" \\"Gigli,\\" \\"Ishtar,\\" \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,\\" \\"Catwoman,\\" \\"Battlefield Earth,\\" and \\"Waterworld.\\"  The tastes and interests of people vary as much as flowers in a meadow, therefore you may think \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is the best movie you've ever seen.

B001FB4W16|5.0|This is such an awesome series that HBO has brought to viewers. If you're not offended by nudity, sexuality, blood or guts, and are fascinated with vampires, this is a show to definitely check out. I'm a fan of Twilight but I'm beginning to like this show more because for lack of better words, it's more adult appropriate. There is such great chemistry between all of the actors and the cliffhangers that are intentionally put in many of the episodes keep you guessing and wanting more. I've never read the books but from what I've read about them it seems that the show loosely follows the same plot.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Pixair does an amazing job and I know that's an amazing understatement.  They make magical films, year after year and they create characters who are enjoyable and lovable. The beauty of the Toy Story series lies in both its believable and deep characters, as well as the story lines which are unique and relate-able. I greatly enjoy how despite the advances in technology and how the characters themselves are a technological marvel, the story is what sells here, not the technology.     This is a great movie and fun for the entire family. I can't recommend it enough!

B00000AFGM|5.0|Easily one of Marilyn Manson's greatest albums to date. This record is full of glowing white robes, glitter dust, blue lipstick, fire red hair, bi-sexuality. super glam and a tad industrial rock. By far the most \\"pop\\" Marilyn Manson has ever gone.....one of my favorite albums by this artist. Includes a few classic gems such as \\"Dope Show\\", Coma White\\", Rock Is Dead\\", and \\"I Don't Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me\\".

B004DMIIVO|5.0|My Christmas eve 2010 was spent with my extended family but I had the pleasure to spend that Christmas day in a movie theater with the Jinnouchi family. I went to see the movie Summer Wars in San Francisco on that rainy Christmas day and it was well worth the 100 mile drive.     In my humble opinion Summer Wars directed by Hosoda Mamoru is the best animation I've seen in a long time and I just per-ordered this dvd on Amozon.    The heroes of this exciting, hilarious and heartwarming movie are Kenji and the Jinnouchi family.  The best animations have authentic believable characters and here we find several of them most notably Sakae, the family's charismatic matriarch. If there was an Academy award for best supporting actress in an animation it should go to her.  In what could have easily stayed a simple scifi adventure alone, Hosoda has seamlessly weaved in an extensive cast of charming heart and togetherness.    The male lead Kenji is a shy math geek who has never even dated a girl before. He agrees to a summer job escorting Natsuki, the most popular girl in school, to her family's gathering. A sprawling earthy ancient rural family estate where the Jinnouchi clan has gathered to celebrate the family matriarch's 90th birthday. This is the real world setting where the enemy strikes however the movie doesn't just take place in this world. It starts introducing you to the white sterile appealing online universe called OZ that has all but completely taken over all the worlds workings. As in \\"the Wizard of OZ\\" something there declares it self as \\"all powerful\\" and starts stealing peoples very identities and online privileges.     Kenji stuck in the middle of nowhere like a fish out of water has to ask for help from the people he just met and instead of saving the day alone, is becomes the catalyst that helps unite the family together in battle.     Yes it gets deadly serious, and just when you think the battle is over the villain strikes back once more and then once again putting you on the edge of your seat.    Not being Japanese, I enjoyed being introduced to things like the ancient card game of Hanafuda Koi Koi and the anime cliche wherein a shy boy gets a nose bleed when kissed by a beautiful girl.    If you liked Mamoru Hosoda's the Girl Who Leapt Through Time (and why shouldn't you) then you'l definitely love this movie.
0062502182|4.0|This novel shows us the importance of following our dreams. Too many times we go through life and work day to day in a job we hate, just living for the weekend. We forget what our vision was as a child, we forget what it's like to dream big, and instead we accept a mediocre life. This fable will help wake you up, this story will be the spark that reignites that flame inside you. It's never too late to follow your dream and believe that you can be something more. And while we start again, with a new found boldness, let's remember how the journey is what is most important, and those we impact and inspire on our way to fulfilling our dreams.<br /><br />Don't knit pick at the character development, or the feeling that the author is not describing every detail. Remember that this story is written like a fable, so follow the simple story and enjoy the flow. Their are those who will understand this tale, and those who won't, this is just the way things have to be. You can't have one without the other, for opposites define each other.<br /><br />PS<br /><br />This book inspired me to pursue my own dreams so much so that I started writing my own novels and am now on the brink of becoming a full time writer. My vision was to be able to support my family through my passion, and soon I will be able to do this. The Alchemist worked for me and can work for you too.
0061914177|4.0|One good thing about this book: its short. You can read it in 2-4 hours, its like 130 pages long. There are good ideas in here too: websites you might not have heard of, plus a lot of good inspiring rhetoric. Basically, its like 'you can do it, just go out there and do it' and he stresses about living true to yourself: do what you love, and be honest to people.<br /><br />Why 4 stars and not 5? Its a bit over the top on the rah-rah-rah. He's like 'Hey you ever heard of Facebook? Well, get on there and make yourself a million dollars, its like so easy.' Another thing is that he seemed to make money doing something else, and is now lecturing about making $300 here and $50 there by using Twitter and Facebook and you can be so successful like he his. Details missing. But at the end of the day,<br /><br />The author puts his actual email address in the book several times which is a nice genuine move to prove he really is there to try and help people succeed. It's an inspiring book and as I said at the beginning, even if he sometimes is an obnoxious New Yorker, he does make the point well to just stop sitting around: LIVE YOUR PASSION today. So, read it, just don't pay much more than the price of a movie for it.
B002M3GPOI|5.0|Yes this album has been re-issued a lot and most fans of the band must have at least 3-4 different versions on varying formats.<br /><br />But this one is special.<br /><br />What you have here is a box set dedicated to one album spread over 5 cds and one DVD which includes:<br /><br />The 40th Anniversary mix of the album by Steve Wilson and Robert Fripp<br />5.1 surround version<br />2004 mix<br />Transfer of the original vinyl release from Island records (declicked)<br />Transfer of the original Mono Atlantic promo pressing (declicked)<br />Alternate mixes and versions<br /><br />2 buttons<br />A book<br />Two band promo photos from the era.<br /><br />This is got to be the best version released due to the discovery of the original 8 track session reels and sub mixes so the sound is more spread out and not as muddy sounding as previous offerings. I owned an original Atlantic 1st press of the album and even that was a little muddy and dense sound wise so this is a vast improvement. The 5.1 mix is logically done without losing the impact of the 2 track mix. In other words Wilson and Fripp did not try to re-invent the mix.<br /><br />Honestly, this is really for a fan of the album and at the current price it is a bargain for what you are getting. And it is limited. Of course after sitting through this straight through you may not want to ever hear it again. Or will you?

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Even though most people hated the results, St. Anger at least began moving Metallica away from MTV hard rock back toward a heavier, more metal sound.  Death Magnetic builds on the baby step that St. Anger took, incorporating some actual elements of pre-1990 Metallica and helping the band enjoy a sort of revival in the metal world.  Thrash riffs present themselves more than occasionally, and I love the return of Kirk's guitar hero solos, which were forsaken for rock solos starting with the Black Album.  There's a solo on Judas Kiss that melts my brain, and even though The Day That Never Comes gets knocked around, the second half is one of my favorite extended instrumental sections on just about any Metallica song.  Some of it sounds like Kill 'Em All guitar work to me, and the overall sound of those few minutes is the purest thrash music Metallica has played since And Justice for All.  I think it deserves four stars for having some of the best music this band has come up with in many years.<br /><br />I don't think it gets a full five stars because it does have weaknesses.  A lot of those great thrash riffs come early in the songs, then give way to more crunchy, rock-metal riffs in the verses.  And I've never been a fan of James's vocals since the Black Album.  I know Metallica has two sets of fans, the metal fans and the rock fans, and I belong to the metal camp, so I wish James would go back to his gruff delivery of Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Justice.  Overall, Death Magnetic makes me happy that Metallica are okay with playing metal again, but I hope they shed even more of the mainstream elements on their next album.
B000001ELP|5.0|I've never understood the dislike of this album expressed by Mr. Simmons and Mr. Stanley. No, it was not what people expected, but since they had the guts to create it they should have had the guts to back it.  Yes, Ace Frehley would leave after this album, but he was on his way out anyway.  It seems that Simmons and Stanley were trying to stop the Ace fans from jumping ship by agreeing with his assessment of the album and blaming it on Bob Ezrin.  This was a mistake that I'm sure they are aware of, but won't admit.  Gene and Paul are proud men and don't recant odten.  From the first track to the last this is a great record. I play this when I want to shut down KISS haters.  I put it on without telling them who it is.  When they ask they are amazed at the answer.  Many of my friends own this CD as the only KISS in their collection.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|....but after the first episode, I sat down and watched the entire season in a two day marathon. It was surprisingly good. Yes, there is excessive language,excessive blood (it IS called \\"Blood and Sand\\"),and very sexually explicit. The acting wasn't academy award worthy, but it all fit together with the dialogue and storyline. It kept me shocked and surprised and almost sad as you grow attached to some of the secondary characters (Barca,Varro). You can't wait for others to die (Illythia, Ashur). Any show that can get me that emotionally involved deserves 5 stars. Can't wait for Gods of the Arena and eventually Season 2!
044024367X|1.0|Mostly a half-baked political diatribe that meanders around with incoherent starts and stops.  The worst Reacher novel I've read, and I've been through most of them.

0811870413|3.0|I love Tartine, the bakery.  Who doesn't?!  And I can see why so many other reviewers love this book.  Chad Robertson's passion for bread is obvious.  If you're looking for inspirationj and a pleasant read, this book is for you.  But if you are looking for thoughtful recipes for beautiful breads - if your goal is to produce great bread at home - I am afraid this book falls short.  The book's format, and the author's style, make it very imprecise and harder to follow.  For example, there are dozens and dozens of photos, but none have captions or numbers, and it's often difficult to know which pictures illustrate which steps.  Don't get me wrong, the photos are attractive, but they're not helpful if you are hoping to see and repeat his techniques.  Recipes are presented in a chatty style that may be pleasant to read, but which tend to be cumbersome and imprecise if your goal is to actually produce good bread yourself.  (That's particularly true of the 24-page recipe for basic country bread, and while it was interesting to read, it's not practical as a precise, useful recipe.)  Also, there seem to be more recipes for things to make with bread, and fewer actual recipes for the breads themselves.  And there are typos.  I know this chef is an amazing bread baker, and I eat his spectacular bread whenever I can, but his skills are in the kitchen, and not necessarily in writing books.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/31/12:  It seems a few other reviewers misunderstand my initial review, one going so far as to call my perspective \\"hogwash\\".  Let me be clear - I've made the Tartine Country White Bread successfully.  And I've had the pleasure of eating the \\"real thing\\" at Tartine and Bar Tartine many, many times.  I've met Chad Robertson, and he's a nice guy.  And passionate.  And talented.  I simply believe that the book is poorly constructed.  One should not have to read 20+ pages, and study numerous photographs, to understand how to make a loaf of bread - even a wonderful loaf like this one.  His passion is inspring, and if that's what you're looking for, bravo. But there are other outstanding (and often exceedingly passionate) books that provide much more accessible instruction and advice.  Try any of the books by Peter Reinhart, or Jeffrey Hammelman, or the most complex and technical of all, Advanced Bread and Pastry by Michel Suas.s one.

0307588343|5.0|This book gave a first hand account of what really took place at Lehman Brothers.  The opinions are brutally honest and give a rare inside glimpse of the world of Wall Street.  This book gives the reader a ground floor view of the biggest collapse in modern times.  This should be \\"must\\" reading for anyone aspiring to have a career in Banking or Finance.  I had worked at Lehman for 11 years and I can confirm everything that was written in the book.  For anyone who worked there, reading this book may help bring closure to a very painful time.  It certainly did for me.    The author also gives a layman's explanation of how the Lehman debacle affected the world economy.  In addition, you get a better understanding of how the whole mortgage mess happened in the first place.  This is certainly needed as most of the country does not fully grasp that the lack of personal responsibility by many coupled with the greed of a few caused one of the biggest bubbles in recent times.    A great read!
B0044KU7KU|4.0|I really like this band.  As with all MCR albums this one is themed and it feels like I am roaming the wasteland in Fallout 3 or the Book of Eli.  MCR has the ability to write catchy tunes, in a variety of styles and frankly is never boring.  This album has some punk, some techno, some NIN sounding stuff, some 80s stuff but they handle it all with great skill.  There are still the MCR transitions and quirkiness. And the radio DJ (read Three Dog at Gaaxy News Radio) was pretty cool.  The band is a bit hard to define but I call that high praise.

The watch straps are weak, and Swatch only honors any suggested warranties if the seller has some kind of authorized dealer stamp, which my seller - an Amazon partner - did not.    My strap broke within a month of purchase. Neither Amazon nor the seller could help me fix the strap or get any kind of refund.    I know it was not a once off because I mailed my watch in to the seller to be replaced and they accidentally sent me back two watches with the same problem (one to my old and one to my new address). Obviously they must have watches with broken straps just lying around.

1416550534|4.0|The House at Riverton by Kate Morton is part mystery and part a tale about loyalty between sisters. Told from the point of view of Grace Bradley, an elderly woman at the end of her life, the story depicts young Grace's employment with the Hartford sisters and her relationship with Hannah, the oldest sister. The plot has many engaging twists and turns that kept me reading, and while parts of the mystery are described throughout the novel, the key to the story isn't revealed until the very end, which really heightened the intensity. While Grace is the narrator, it sometimes seemed that she was not the \\"main character,\\" which is not my favorite style. I like the main character to be the focal point, so the focus on Hannah sometimes wasn't to my liking. It had nothing to do with Morton's talent as a writer; I've simply never been overly fond of stories told in that manner. I liked the older Grace versus the younger from the past; she was more complex and more of own person. However, young Grace did seem to depict the mindset of one in service to a large, oppulent family, so it made sense for her character. It doesn't have the typical happy ending, but there is a clear sense of resolution, which I liked. All in all, it is a great read, especially as a mystery in the days of the vanishing victorian era.

Some of the things he says, i.e. about learning to being able to paint perfect color chips could of come out of my thoughts. The color theory class I had when I was studying wasn't any different. This book is a very solid collection of transferring the theory into real use. I highly recommend it for anybody who wants to learn more about painting and drawing, not just for the realist genre, but for the abstract as well.
0792839730|3.0|Huge all-star cast, though not all of them distinguish themselves. For example, Elliot Gould is ridiculous as the cigar chomper who gets a Bailey bridge built during the Market Garden operation. Anthony Hopkins still had his hair in 1977, so that's interesting to see. What drove me nuts was the annoying marshall music soundtrack every few minutes, as the Americans and Brits would have little victories on their way to the major defeat later on. None of the big stars are particularly impressive, though Michael Caine, as usual, shows some restraint and his performance holds up well. Robert Redford was in his pre-wrinkle days here. Having read the stolid Cornelius Ryan book upon which this 3-hour plus epic is based, I can say the movie is extremely faithful to the historic record. Overall, it's almost a docu-drama, of sorts. Will you watch it raptly? No, it seems a bit dated overall. This came out two years after the Vietnam debacle ended, so  I wonder if audiences then wanted a WW2 movie showing a defeat?
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I always loved horror movies now I get them with two adoreable guys w/great senses of humor to boot.  Love the relationship between them and never have I seen a dull episode.  It's just terrific.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I've watched a lot of good movies lately, and this one suprisingly is at the top of the list.  Superb action scenes and plenty of mystery and suspense during the whole movie.  And as for the end, it couldn't have been better.  Jolie is a great actor.  Definately pick this one up!
B004CEUEWE|1.0|The title should be changed to the \\"F\\" word because that is all you hear from the beginning to the end.  Almost every dialogue has cussing or profanity.  The acting and the story line are below par.  I cannot believe this was rated 4-stars by the reviewers.  Don't waste your time and money on this movie.  It is not worth it.  Don't be fooled by a 4-star rating.  One-star is more like it.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|This movie was supringsly well.  Only thing is the ending.  It's bad.  The story keeps you puzzled throughout and the end gives everything away and it's just bad and makes you wish that there's gonna be another Ghost writer.  But anyways, it's basically about this guy who writes an autobiography of this politician about why he got into politics, etc.  There's lots of cheating with spouses, etc going on and everything.  Overall it was a good movie.  I watched it at 2am-4am and it kept me up so it was pretty good that I didn't want to stop watching it.  The ending just really disappointed me.  I would rent it and see if you like it before you buy it.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|This book seemed like it took about 2 weeks to write. It's basically about a bunch of music industry losers who have delinquent childhoods and mundane, uninteresting, failed adult lives. It's written in a sort of Tarantino-esque cross-cut style, where each section/chapter is a different person at a different time. That is about the extent of creativity. There are about 40 pages of powerpoint slides out of around 220 pages total... I thought the first person characterization of males was poor.  The 'goon squad' is the author's metaphor for time, which apparently gets the best of everybody and makes them all complacent, save one person who really craves a shambolic salvation. The theme I got from this book is that most 40+ year olds in the dying music industry have miserable lives, but find abbreviated solace through random nostalgic gatherings. As a musician and a scholar, this book failed to entertain me. If this book is one of the best of the year, I fear for the state of literature.
B000009EAD|5.0|This album in my opinion is the best Iced Earth album out there, from melodic to in your face thrash, Jon Schaffer and the boys definately put it all together in this metal masterpiece.  It has been in my top 5 metal albums since I bought it, originally 3 years ago, but as life would be somebody borrowed my original and I've had to get a new one.  Well worth it, it is a must for true metalheads!
B00001QEE9|5.0|Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) is one of the best animated movies that I have ever seen. The movie is based on the fairy tale written by Carlo Collodi. One could easily say that Pinocchio can be included in the golden days of Dinsey animated movies and can easily be compared in quality with the likes of Bambi, Dumbo and Snowwhite. The animation is astounding and to imagine that &iacute;t was drawn by hand is amazing. \\"When you wish upon a star\\" is a timeless classic and this movie will be seen by generations of children to come. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|First of all I want to comment on the Amazon shipping: I am a cheapskate so I went with super saver option and it was delivered to me within 3 days. Ordered it on Monday and received it on Thursday even though according to Amazon estimated delivery time was next Tuesday (technically it should still be en-route). Needless to say I was HAPPY!     As far as the bag itself goes it is great for that price. I actually wanted a no name brand so I wouldnt announce to the whole world that I had camera gear in my backpack because it was screaming Canon all over it and I was not able to find anything comparable for that kind of money. I only had it for few days so cant honestly comment on the durability or comfort but padding, layout and construction seem to be right on.  Only \\"issue\\" I have with it is that my [[ASIN:B001XURPQS Canon EOS Rebel T1i]] with the [[ASIN:B001HK6AN8 Opteka Battery Pack Grip]] fits in there pretty tight. when the bag is open the top of the camera clearly raises above the rim of the bag. I wish it was a bit deeper but you cant have it all for $36.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|This item arrived in perfect condition and very quickly which was nice since I had to mail it to Michigan before Christmas! Thanks!
0316098337|5.0|This marvelous tale grabbed me and never let go!  It is the second book on my GREAT Reads list for 2010, and 2011.  The story that this author spells thru the eyes of this brilliant and insightful little guy is like none I have ever read.  I do not know how she did it.  Quite an accomplishment and very pleasurable to read.  Story moves along fast and you tag along with it.  It is a big story that must have been difficult in concept to write.  If you loved this, as I did, try \\"Cutting for Stone.\\"  It is a marvel, too.
030746363X|3.0|I follow Tim's blog, I watch videos, read the four hour work week and really enjoyed it.  Like previous reviewer this book seems to have a fair number of holes.      Pros  Interesting read and Tim is an amazing individual and you can learn a lot from him, especially with regards to \\"don't follow the rules.\\"  If you have read a lot about diet and exercise this might give you some new ideas  My guess is if you follow it, it will work.    Cons  Has holes or gaps, or some apparent conflicts  Not super focused on health  Seems like a temporary drop, not long term plan.  He recommends going up and down in down in weight (cycling, which might be good as he suggests), but does not really give a life plan on how to keep this going.      Ultimately I would say this feels a little like someone trying to sell a book, not necessarily help people maintain a lower weight for life.  I have not followed the book, although I have done some similar diets, and low glycemic does seem to be effective, although can be a little hard to follow.  His super cheat day might help, but seems too unhealthy for me to want to follow it.    Anyway thanks Tim, keep writing. I would suggest a little more care on long term health of your readers.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|I eagerly anticipated seeing this movie and must admit that my initial was \\"wow\\". Wow, how could a movie actually be this bad?  Surprised? Maybe I should confess that I can't honestly say that I actually \\"saw\\" this movie. This was because the entire film seemed to have been camoflauged by darkness! Sly, Invest in lighting! Action scenes were night scenes! Day scenes were mostly shot in dimly lit bars. It makes a viewer wonder, \\"what is it that they don't want me to see\\"? Poor acting and a bad script don't change due to the absence of light. Boring dialogue was consistant in that it was boring at the beginning, at the end and throughout the middle of this cenematic disaster. Characters appeared to be taken straight from a comic book.I would like to add that this movie did have one redeeming factor. If I find that factor, I will add it to this review. Pass on this one!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Amazon always meets expected delivery dates and that  is very important during the Holidays.  The Bones series arrived promptly and in perfect shape.
B002ZG98CS|4.0|Jan 3, 2011:  This isn't so much a review of the film itself, but of the product.  I'm writing to inform people of a future Double Dip.  In an interview in October 2010, Robert Rodriguez said that there is going to be an \\"Ultra-violent Director's Cut\\" of the movie to be released on home video.  No release date has been announced for that DVD yet, but I assume that version of the film will have the usual Rodriguez extras such as a commentary, a film school, and a cooking school (all of which are not on the current DVD/Blu releases).    If you like \\"Machete\\" enough to buy it, but don't care about different versions, extras, etc., then go ahead and get this version of the film.  If LOVE \\"Machete\\" and you want to hold out, then save your money and wait for the next version of the DVD/Blu that will come out.  Fair warning: looking at the double dips for other Rodriguez films such as \\"Grindhouse\\" and \\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\", the next release could be possibly several months or years from the date I'm writing this review.  If you can't wait, go ahead and pick up this version.
B001UDPAB0|5.0|My college aged daughter loves this series. It is a set you can watch over and over to pick up new clues.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|***SPOILERS INCLUDED ***    I finally had a chance to watch this movie and I will say that while I enjoyed it, there were moments in the movie that made it drag out.  The whole sex scene between Clive and Elsa, then Clive and Dren, and then of course Elsa and Dren were way to drawn out and really dragged the movie down.  A few simple seconds to show this would make sense, but to waste about 5 minutes on it was pointless.  I was wondering why they kept showing this, until the end where they actually showed that Elsa was pregnant.  The other problem with this was when Dren changed to a male and went on the attack; they only had this last about 10-15 minutes at the most.  I wish they took alot more time to show more of the attack scenes, and have this creature go crazy.    However overall I loved how they showed the development of Dren, and I thought the characters were relatable.  I almost expect a Splice 2.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Okay - we all love this movie and it is a great item for your DVD Library. The Best Movie Yet...
0385732554|5.0|I decided to read this book after a couple of people said Hunger Games reminded them of this book.  I loved Hunger Games and decided to give it a try.  Wow, they were right.  In some ways I think it was even better.  I loved being able to witness the day to day life in the community.  The concept of no colors intrigued me and is a little scarey.  Could science ever go so far? I would love to see this book turned into a movie.
0765326353|5.0|Elantris was fantastic. The Mistborn trilogy was great. I threw out the Warmaker. This one is a keeper! As stated by other reviewers, you can tell be is building the foundation for a LONG series of books with this one. His imaginative world building is amazing. The action is fast enough to keep you occupied, but not so fast that you can't put it down. Hopefully he won't be side tracked by other writing projects and will be able to finish this series on target, and hopefully he won't fall into the chasm of greed and extend his series beyond his ability to generate en excellent story.
B000002JOH|5.0|Wow what a great heavy metal album to have every song is great your not a true heavy metal fan  without this  album i have been playing this outstanding album since high school i loved it then and i love it now dimebag darrell is the effin riff master no questions asked his guitar playing is awesome i love the riff on a mouth full of war thats a awesome riff a new level has so much energy i love that song and walk is great this cd is a wake up call its fast and i love it buy this if you have never heard it

B004BLJQOK|5.0|First of all, let me get one thing out of the way: As a huge admirer and fan of the original \\"Let the Right One In,\\" Matt Reeves's \\"Let Me In\\" delivers a wonderfully told and executed story supported by an exceptionally talented cast.  \\"Let Me In\\" is absolutely one of the best remakes I've seen to date and is on an entirely new level when compared to modern horror flicks.      If you loved the original, I guarantee that you will fall in love with this movie or at least come to admire the large amount of quality work that has gone into making this film in terms of directing sequences or the cast's believable performances, which are just as great as those of the original.      The story here follows the same path as Tomas Alfredson's original, which was based on a novel by author John Ajvide Lindqvist.  The author has publicly stated he is pleased with the new retelling of his novel.    The author states:    \\"I might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. Let The Right One In is a great Swedish movie. Let Me In is a great American movie. There are notable similarities and the spirit of Tomas Alfredson is present. But Let Me In puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs. Like the Swedish movie it made me cry, but not at the same points. Let Me In is a dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful. Again.\\"    --Pretty awesome review there by the author himself, eh?!    Anyways, let's get back to MY review of the movie.  What else can I say?  The story here is once again true, real, believable (despite built of vampire lore), gritty, heart-breaking, sad, uplifting, emotional, thought-provoking, etc....Oh, I could go on and on about how great this movie is.  The story, characters, setting, and script are all brought alive by a truly wonderfully excellent cast, all equally talented and exceptional in conveying the emotional grief and feelings felt by the characters.  Thought Richard Jenkins may not say much, his face reveals all there is to know about his character, which is no easy task.      The ending, once again, is thought-provoking and open-ended.  It hasn't changed much, but I suppose it's Matt Reeves's way of showing his unwavering respect for the original film.  Really, I fail to have any idea as to how any other ending could have surpassed the original ending.  Both endings carry so much weight and meaning to them as the ending itself has carried this and the original film to new heights in the horror/vampire lore genre.      Now, I hope that the DVD version of \\"Let Me In\\" contains the same amount of features and extras as the blu-ray version.  I'm really starting to grow tired of all of these blu-ray exclusive extras and digital copies found only in blu-ray.  The majority of the population out there still have DVD players and will continue to purchase DVDs for a very long time and I just wish studios out there recognize that fact and support the DVD just as much as they support the blu-ray versions.      Here's my final verdict:    Consider this:  You're a fan of the novel, you're a fan of the original movie, you love vampire movies, you love horror movies, you love movies that carry a deep meaning and weight, you love movies with an exceptional cast, you love movies and you want to have a great time watching one.    If any of those categories above fit you, you NEED to see \\"Let Me In.\\"      5/5!     BUY IT!
B000BMSTMS|3.0|This album wasn't bad at all. Unfortunately, it wasn't Korn either. I know a lot of Korn fans hated this album and their \\"Untitled\\" album. I loved untitled and only somewhat liked this album. Coming Undone, Politics and Throw me Away are the Main highlights, the rest of the tracks are just OK. I think this album was over-produced and lacked korns signature sound. Like I said before Coming Undone, Politics and Throw me Away are the only real \\"Korn Songs\\". I was disapointed.
B00004TL21|5.0|This album is really good. I love the Deftones, and this is their best. It has a Creepy feel to me. It is a very artistic album, which is hard to find in modern music. I love it, and I'd say it is a modern classic.
B00005JPO1|4.0|SPOILER ALERT    I love this movie.  Though it's nothing like the previous three, I still think it's got at least some elements of them here.  Sexy women, good action (not stellar, like previous installments), and an emotional aspect to it via the fact that Indy's father never made it to this period of Indy's life.
0307592839|2.0|This is a fine novel, but certainly not, to this reader, deserving of all the praise being heaped upon it. The integration of the various storylines is done well, but the character development - especially important when you have this many - is lacking. If you took the names off each chapter, you would not be able to tell who was speaking at any one time, save for maybe one or two of the perhaps two dozen characters in this book. To me, this is the difference between an ordinary book and a great one - being able to write distinctive, memorable characters. The writing is nice, and clearly reaching for insightfulness, but never really manages to get there.
B000001ESF|5.0|This album blew me away when i first heard it and i am still amazed by it this album is just that good anyways every song is good on this album and the very first song rocks so does passage to bankok lessons is great alex lifeson geddy lee and neil peart are great musicians i think anybody that likes to rock would love this album dont pass this classic by trust me
B000UX6THK|5.0|My husband and I have wanted to watch this series for a while.  When we saw it as a Gold Box deal for such a great price we couldn't pass it up.  The product arrived exactly as described.  We are enjoying the riveting story and quirky characters.  Definitely worth watching!
1439152780|5.0|The Distant Hours had the same elements as Morton's other novels - deep-seeded family drama and secrets, long lost loves.  I really enjoyed the first two, but this one is by far the best.  The story was extremely captivating and the twists at the end were unexpected but also completely logical - while I liked The Forgotten Garden, that twist in that book was a little too odd to be believable.  All the characters were likable despite flaws and I honestly wanted things to work out for all of them.  The ending had very nice closure.  I would highly recommend this book.  I look forward to Morton's next work.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a story about a serial killer, who kills other serial killers.  Rereading this, I've realized just how flat some of Dexter's world seems as he narrates to us, but this only emphasizes how little he feels to me.  It's a brilliant move on Linday's part, although I do feel as if the subtle humor and pokes at Miami get better as the series goes along - that is, Lindsay improves with each book he writes.  (With the exception of the plot going horribly astray in book three, which I'll get to when I reread that book later this year.  But even then, the writing gets better, and the humor itself keeps getting sharper in each book.)<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I was rereading this as I got my friends hooked on season one of Dexter, and I'd forgotten all about the differences in the show and the book.  I kind of missed a lot of the layers added in the show, and feel they would have worked nicely in the book as well, but again - I think that's part of the improvement over the series.  This is, overall, a nice setup to the series, and beyond the intrigue of the serial killer who targets his own, there is some nice social commentary thrown in about how Miami residents drive, and even the political games one has to play to rise in the ranks of the police force.<br /><br />There are some nice twists along the way, some nice differences from the television show - including a wrinkle I'd forgotten, that added depth to Dexter's plight as he weighs if he's going crazy or not - and a couple changes at the end that I like - although I won't spoil those.  Needless to say, I'm looking forward to rereading the books; the only real decision I have yet to make is whether or not to get the rest of the series in Kindle and ditch the DTBs that I got before I went over to the Kindle side, or just reread the paper books.  (The latter is tempting because I got a handmade blood drip bookmark that hangs over the side of the books.)
B0041QSZJM|5.0|I like Pink Martini.  I think their music is different but not off the charts.  Their Christmas CD - Joy to the World - suprised and delighted me.  It had traditional music mixed in with something different.  A good mix.  Was my favorite CD during the Christmas season.
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|It's a horror movie with a moral message. It was well written, well acted, and suspenseful. The only thing I could have done without was being told what was about to happen, why something was happening, etc. However, that narration didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film. I have nightmares about elevators, so those of you who have seen it should know why it scared a few tears out of me. I like a movie that is creepy and has a little bit of a twist. What I really liked was that the makers of the movie knew that they didn't need huge, overdone, wild special effects to make it scary. They put into practice what John Carpenter did best; they kept it clean, it made sense, it was believable, and they made the viewer feel vulnerable.
B0016PM722|5.0|My kid loves this toy.  He's 14 and totally into Star Wars.  he walks around with it constantly, to the point of being outta control.  He feels that the Light Saber was one of the greatest gifts.
030726999X|5.0|Stieg Larsson's 'The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest' is a well written tale that leads the reader through a series of unfortunate circumstances involving the Sweden government and many other unsuspecting characters. Just like Larsson's other two books, this too follows the same page turning feeling of finding out. It is a terrific thriller. Suspenseful. A true mystery. I am only sorry that there will no longer be another book in this series of Scandinavian literature.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH ANY PURCHASES FROM AMAZON AND WASN'T DISSAPPOINTED THIS TIME EITHER.  GREAT MOVIE!!!  THANK YOU!  RITA RAMIREZ, LORAIN OH
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This beautifully presented set was a great Christmas present, and despite scratching on 2 of the over 40 disks, the episodes were still able to play.   It is a wonderful series, seamlessly integrating drama, comedy, and politics into an interesting an intriguing product. One of my favorite shows ever, and the feeling of having it all in your hands is perfect.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|Awesome movie and this multi BR and DVD pack brings it to both formats, so I have copy for the house and one for the car/travelling.
B000I5XOVY|4.0|I had just finished watching Swordfish laughing all the while, not because it stars Martin Lawrence and is a comedy, but because it glorifies hacking as a wonderous world of quad lcd screens, ds3 connections and advanced cell processor technologies. It is none of that. It is a dark and dingy existence, with nary the notoriety or excitement of a silly hollywood script. You only find loneliness, seclusion from others and civilisation. It's a world where peeping tom's look inside your hard disks rather than your bedroom window.<br /><br />There is a scene where Halle Berry's boobs are shown while she sunbathes while reading Dante's Inferno. It was a very awkward scene that felt out of place because there was no logic to it. It wasn't the same as Phoebe Cate's immersing from a swimming pool dripping wet as her top comes off in Judge Reinhold's bathroom fantasy, that was classic. It was more like that scene in Walk Hard during the gangbang where guys walk around naked and guys watching find an excuse to get something from the kitchen. Ok it wasn't that bad. (I was kidding about the Dante's Inferno)<br /><br />John Travolta's depiction of the patriotic terrorist was spot on. Like his part in Broken Arrow, he seems more suited in the part of the villain. My favorite travolta role was in Face Off, that weird thing he did while smoking a cigarette, when I smoked I tried doing that thinng many times and failed, looking more like the frazzled smoking girl played by Jeneane Garofalo in Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion. That soul patch he was sporting seemed to add to the nefariousness of his character.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman as the notorious hacker, the part was played very well but not very realistic. Realistic hackers look like DJ Qualls in the movie The Core. Either skinny and awkward or rotund obese fella's that make Jack Black look like the latest Jenny Craig success story. Hugh Jackman is more the Calvin Klein underwear model type in this role. Having watched the bonus content on the bluray, it's interesting to note that the actors in this movie are asked about their real life experiences with computers, their answers are humorous and amazing.<br /><br />There are two alternate endings to this film presented. My favorite being the one where Hugh Jackman gets the better of John Travolta and not vice versa. Do yourself a treat and watch them. At the current price of the bluray it's worth the money.<br /><br />Overall it was an entertaining movie and the action was well paced. The bluray transfer was very good. If you haven't gone bluray yet you are really missing out. The level of detail is staggering. It breathes life back to old forgotten movies.y, it's interesting to note that the actors in this movie are asked about their real life experiences with computers, their answers are humorous and amazing.

B0024FADAQ|4.0|I think this is just a fun movie to watch.  I like the story and the people in the movie.  It's got a little bit of everything for everyone.
B000WQW988|5.0|Nirvana's unplugged performance is absolutely amazing.  I sat on my couch in awe as they played and felt the intimacy of the once in a lifetime concert.  The interviews are great and the rehearsals are interesting to watch because some songs, such as Pennyroyal Tea, are played differently.  The only problem I have, is that the cello is really loud at times and kind of overpowers the performance (maybe it's just my settings?).  Anyway, shipping was wayyyy fast and it's a must have for Nirvana fans.
B004CEUEWE|1.0|Overall Summary:      I exerted the least amount of force I possibly could by clicking my remote and downloading this movie to my TV and it was still a waste of my energy. Unless you're an Affleck fan or a city of Boston fan, I don't recommend renting this movie.  There are much better crime/police thrillers. Watch Out of Sight, The Usual Suspects, or Heat again instead.    Details:         I saw an interview where Affleck said he actually talked to Charlestown inmates and so I was interested to see this film.  I expected some authentic perspective about bank robberies, the people who plan them and how they are executed.  Sorry, there is very little of that and whenever it comes up and the movie starts getting interesting...it goes away quickly.      The Town has an identity crisis, it doesn't know whether it wants to be a gritty crime thriller or a sweet love story.  I think someone must have pitched it as the perfect date movie but unfortunately, it doesn't do either very well.  This is because The Town would rather take large chunks of time for heavy handed and cliched dialogue scenes that seem to go on forever.   I mean seriously, at one point there is a violin playing when the main character is walking into prison to see his dad.  \\"Cue the violins\\" is a punch line to a joke, not the direction for a scene.  Every plot point is so telegraphed that you just want the movie to hurry up and end.     With the exception of Pete Postlethwaite (RIP), none of the actors feel correct in their roles and most of their performances are over the top (and not in a powerful Al Pacino way).  Yes people, this includes Jon Hamm.    Not to get too technical but the most surprising bad decision in this movie was to go with such a boring film look.  Get ready for some bland color correction and uninspired cinematography.  Where is the swagger?  Where is the attitude in this movie?  Why are most of the scenes filled with sunshine and happiness?  Was I watching Wedding Crashers or adown and dirty thriller?      Conclusion:      It's a good story but poorly executed.  Don't believe the hype, Affleck is not the next Bryan Singer.  He is still Ben Affleck.
B000PAAJYW|5.0|It took me a while to decide if I liked this film or not.  I put it in the player late one night after a long and stressful day, thinking I'd watch only a little before going to bed.  At first it seemed like some overly ambitious young LA piece of work.  I think the scary-hilarious performance of Tom Cruise as the male dominating sex guru really grabbed me.  Cruise was almost too good at the role...makes you wonder....But it was certainly an attention grabber.      Then I was hooked and stuck it out for the whole, long duration.  The only times my attention waned were during the scenes with the dying man, Jason Robard and his over-the-top drugged out wife, Julianne Moore.  The problem with this twosome was that we were never shown anything positive about them to make us care.  Robards was practically gone and displayed nothing deeper than cranky crustiness and Moore was so overly dramatic that I doubted the truth of her statment that she had really learned to love her husband.  The fact that she left him, in his final hours to the care of the paid nurse while she chose to drug herself away showed the vacuity of her character.  I did like her explosion in the drug store but it was, again, way too much.  She could have accomplished the same shock with fewer exclamatory f-words.  She played the range of hysteria-to-blankness grandly but those extremes are ultimately boring.     If you can stick through the early parts of the film that bring you to the brink of despair as you witness the depths of the pain of these characters, you will be rewarded by the depths of simple goodness and warmth of some of them.  That role is carried mostly by John C. Reilly as the good cop.  At first he's portrayed somewhat simplistically, kneeling by the bedside to pray.  Yet he's the one who makes a strong and simple stand for goodness and love that gives the film its redemptive quality.  The relatonship between Reilly and Melora Walter, who is Wonderful! as the emotionally fragile drug addict are the center point of the film. For my money, Reilly, Walter and the alway-affecting William H. Macy are the true stars of the film.    Yes, Hoffman has a depth that is rare in film actors and he is very affecting here.  I only quibble that so much of his technique seemed to involve standing mute with his mouth open.  I really didn't get the incredible anguish that his character, the nurse, experienced here. He is obviously an experienced hospice worker who has witnessed many deaths; we were not shown anything to justify his special feelings about this man.  That's a quibble, though, and the fact that he went to such lengths to contact Robards' son is one of the moral strong points that makes this film more than a horror show.     Henry Gibson gives a brilliant bit as a cynical character Macy meets in a bar.  His callousness is a perfect foil to Macy who is trying, in his terribly messy way, to open his heart and declare his love (here for the bartender). Gibson puts him down at every attempt and seems to win until Macy finally rises to the challenge.  It's a terrific scene...one that I think acting students might use in class assignments for years to come.     This is a film that attempts grand themes...Biblical in scope.  And it pulls it off wonderfully.  Personally I missed the allusion to the falling frogs and it lost me while I watched the movie; I can only appreciate it now, intellectually.  I loved the suggestion of another reviewer---that huge hail stones in July in California would have been surprising enough while still keeping the credibility of the story. Deus ex machina, indeed!    I can see why there are so many negative reviews.  The film isn't for everyone.  Maybe it's a question of one's ability to relate to the pain of others.  At any rate, the acting is uniformly first rate.  I rarely watch a film more than once.  But this is one that I think I will see again.
B001E45XT4|2.0|When i received this product i was excited to put it to use, but after i got it out and put it on, it all just went down hill. Sure it looked cool and sounded good, but it was extremely uncomfortable. the speakers were concealed under plastic that would hurt my ears after about 5 mins of use. Also the mic worked terribly and all my friends could hear was an obnoxious clicking noise. I would not recommend this product.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|I don't know which edition is the best to buy.  I don't think the Dude would much care what format you put him into or if a bowling ball came with the DVD or not.  In the end the Dude just takes each day as it comes, seemingly content to having survived another odd experience.<br /><br />The movie pretty much starts and stops and occasionally comes to a crashing halt just like the Dude's car.  It is a pastiche of noir and kitsch elements loosely held together by the Dude having to deliver a ransom for a rich man's young girlfriend, Bunny, and soon finds his life completely turned upside down by events.  The Coen Bros. humorously capture the laconic LA scene, forcing the Dude to have to face some rough rides and tough broads (Julianne Moore), before finally getting a clue to what is actually going on.  Walter is there to help him out, played with the bravado you have come to expect in John Goodman, but usually ends up making an even bigger mess of things.  Buscemi comes across as odd man odd out in this strange bowling trio.<br /><br />If you are used to the tight, plot-driven movies of the Coen Bros. you may be disappointed by this one, as it is played entirely for comic effect.  There really isn't much there to hang the Stanger's ten gallon hat on.  It is what it is.  Best to just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B001B51B9M|4.0|I bought this movie as a Christmas gift. I enjoyed the ease of purchasing and the price. The movie is a classic and my friend enjoyed it very much.

0316067938|5.0|I've read the really negative reviews and must agree with every flaw identified but I disagree with the bottom line. This is a fairy tale written to please those who love em. I saw a movie the other night with my wife that had a critic's review that 9% liked it and 91% thought it was crap. Ironically, 84% of the people who saw the move loved it. Critics, start understanding your job is to tell people what's good to read and watch based on our tastes, not yours.    The book is fun and great!
0439023513|5.0|I loved these books because I felt the books were realistic. I can never do Harry Potter magic or meet Edward Cullen. While the world of Panem is mythical, it is not far fetched. Think of all the people who live in the Capitol. The decorated and enhanced people who live life in excess. It seems like Hollywood celebrities to me who are very disconnected. The Hunger Games are extreme but similar to what happened in ancient Rome. We have reality shows where people are pitted against each other for some prize and our society gobbles it up.   - SPOILERS STOP READING--  In this book there is a war. War is hard and causes mental trama. The book did not try to sugar coat what many people feel in a war. People are sometimes tools who are manipulated without ever knowing the full truth and when the fighting is done they still have to live with it all.     This is not your Harry Potter/ Twilight ending where the lovers get married and live blissfully ever after without a second thought about the horrors they observed. That's not real life. Real life does not always suck, but it is not perfect. I loved that this book was able to portray the good and bad in the world and give me a completely satifying ending that I can't stop thinking about.

B001VNB54A|5.0|For the past fifty years, the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II has never been given the \\"definitive\\" treatment. Now, there have been some very good movies made about the events of the Pacific War (\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" and the underrated \\"The Great Raid\\" are two very fine films), but none (save for maybe \\"The Great Raid\\") have really captured the full brutality, realism and heroism that shaped the war in the Pacific. But all that finally changes with \\"The Pacific,\\" the ten-part miniseries from executive producers Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Gary Goetzman, the men who brought us the award-winning \\"Band of Brothers,\\" the definitive look at combat in Europe.<br /><br />Whereas the European and Pacific wars were vastly different entities unto themselves, the producers chose to take a different approach to \\"The Pacific\\" than was taken with \\"Band of Brothers.\\" While the previous miniseries focused on the camaraderie that forms between men during war, this one focuses on the brutality of war, and how it affects the individual. It focuses on three Marines: Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie and \\"Manila John\\" Basilone, and their actions in battles at places named Guadalcanal, New Britain, Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and how the war changed their lives forever.<br /><br />Does the new miniseries achieve the same power and gravitas that its sister miniseries did? It does come very close. The only thing that keeps it from becoming a perfect companion to \\"Band of Brothers\\" is the first four episodes of the series. Although very good, there are a few minor problems with them. Unlike the previous miniseries, which gave us a chance to get to know the men before throwing them into battle, we are briefly introduced to the characters before quickly being thrown into the conflict. So there really isn't a lot of emotional connection with the characters at first. Also, episode three of the program, a look at the 1st Marine Division's time in Australia during R&R after Guadalcanal, provides the series' real weak point. Although a pretty good episode, was there really need for an entire hour devoted to the break between battles?<br /><br />However, things take a turn for the excellent with episode five, the beginning of a three-episode arc about the Battle of Peleliu, a battle unfamiliar to those who have not read either Sledge's or Leckie's memoirs, or frequent the History Channel. It is hear that the show finally achieves the quality of \\"Band of Brothers.\\" The battle scenes go from great to fantastic, bringing us into the hell of the battle, and the challenges those men faced.<br /><br />Episode Eight of the series, one of the more mixed-reviewed episodes, is actually a well-written and performed episode that looks at the relationship between Basilone and Lena Riggi, the woman whom he marries before shipping out to Iwo Jima. While some people complained at the fact they focused on the love story, what sets this one apart from films such as \\"Pearl Harbor\\" or \\"From Here to Eternity\\" is that the love story isn't a flight of fancy; it actually happened. And as Tom Hanks said in an interview, \\"it's damned good drama,\\" and really helps us to feel an emotional connection with Basilone as he leaves the love of his life to return to the war effort, and his fate at the Battle of Iwo Jima.<br /><br />The penultimate episode of the series, Episode Nine, looks at the battle of Okinawa, and proves to be the series' best. Of the twenty episodes made of \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"The Pacific,\\" this is by far the most harrowing, graphic, and emotionally-draining episode, throwing us into a hell we could scarcely imagine. The final episode of the series shows the men return home, and the challenges they faced while readjusting to civilian life after the horrors they faced on the islands of the Pacific, and provides a powerful sendoff to this incredible series.<br /><br />As a whole, \\"The Pacific\\" is the definitive look at combat in the Pacific Theater of World War II. It shows the absolute horror that these men faced fighting an enemy that they didn't understand, on islands never heard of before. Most important of all, you get a real sense of the brutality of that war, and the sacrifices these men made upon the altar of freedom. \\"The Pacific\\" is a near-perfect companion piece to \\"Band of Brothers,\\" and one that will change the way one sees how that war was fought, and its impact on the participants!<br /><br />Program/Blu-ray Grade: Ar that these men faced fighting an enemy that they didn't understand, on islands never heard of before. Most important of all, you get a real sense of the brutality of that war, and the sacrifices these men made upon the altar of freedom. \\"The Pacific\\" is a near-perfect companion piece to \\"Band of Brothers,\\" and one that will change the way one sees how that war was fought, and its impact on the participants!

0545123275|5.0|If you're in the mood for a good romance with a fantasy kick, then this is the book for you.  It's first person, but from both the main characters point of view, you get to see what's inside the boy's head just as much as the girl's.  It's a little light on the action, but there is enough suspense and urgency throughout to keep you wanting to read just one more chapter.

B000OY8NII|3.0|I received this series a few months ago but just started to watch it yesterday.  It seems to be interesting and funny but the quality of the DVD is questionable as it seems to skip in several places. This is soooo annoying.   I think it is too late to return it and I am hoping that this is an isolated problem.   I have ordered many, many DVDs on Amazon with no problems ... so far.. I still have to watch most of them and will update this review and any others I have problems with.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Earlier reviews of SONY's MDR-W08 mini-phones describe an in-line volume control. The set I received in January of 2011 doesn't have this extra.<br /><br />Their one-meter wire is the precise length of the cord on the bright yellow phones that came with a SONY Walkman cassette player I bought a quarter century ago, but there's definite design and function differences. Those old phones were metal and plastic; these are only plastic and weigh less. The wire is now a thinner gauge as well, but not by much.<br /><br />The old headphone drivers were more disc shaped and always chafed my ears just a little. These new ones are nicely contoured and fit so much better; no discomfort at all.<br /><br />Audio quality is lusher with these but clearly their response favors low frequencies over high. It's not at all a sacrifice, but if you're looking for phones that will reproduce a dog whistle with no loss of DBs, these aren't for you.<br /><br />I don't recommend the MDR-W08s for anyone who will be moving around while using them, as the wire probably won't take much tugging before shorting out. However, if as I do, you plan to plug into a DVD player or notebook computer while sitting quietly, they should serve you well.<br /><br />I'm satisfied with my purchase.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Pros:  I purchased this album when it was first distributed and I was amazed.  Completely underrated guitar work.  Probably the very best heavy metal guitar work I have ever heard.  Incredible riffs, speed, cleanliness, uniqueness, power, emotionally driven, not just technique.  You will enjoy this album and every single song on it.  Totally underrated guitarist...deserves the highest accolades!  Remember how Creams \\"Disraely Gears\\" was supposed to be the must have album for rock guitar and wha wha effect?  Well this album is the same for heavy metal guitar, although I don't want to pigeon hole it with a title.  Outstanding writer and composition as well...a must have album no matter what your in to...  Cons:  Not applicable...

B003YOZNBU|4.0|\\"Jonah Hex\\", though not a great movie, certainly doesn't deserve the invective heaped it's way.  If I could nutshell Hex he's a cross between Josey Wales and Bruce Wayne.  Some may call the film unremittingly depressing but I found it uncompromisingly true to it's dark vision.  Director Jimmy Hayward displays a real sense of style and the film shows real visual artistry.  My only real gripe is that the film ends abruptly and it seems somewhat underdeveloped ergo it's economical 82 minute running time which includes credits.  Released in the Summer Warners probably thought they had a franchise a la \\"Ironman\\".  Instead they received a grim revenge tale revolving around a morose disfigured bounty hunter.  They probably took the film out of their neophyte director's hands and whittled it down to something they thought was marketable.  I would love to see an extended version of the film or see what was left on the cutting room floor.  The ad campaign for the film was even confusing.  For those with an open mind I would recommend \\"Jonah Hex\\" as a rental but not for purchase.

B002ZG977Y|2.0|While the creature special effects in this movie are outstanding, especially regarding the kraken and Medusa, the movie itself has no heart.     The original, though dated, was a movie about heroes that were likable and that you could care about as they set out to save the innocent and it is still enjoyable today. The story was well written and well executed on the screen. Overall, it was a story about triumph.    This new movie is about arrogant jerks overflowing with undeserved and overabundant pride in themselves. The story itself was choppy and only redid a lot of scenes from the first with better special effects, but without actually tying them together well. In the first, it was clear why the heroes traveled to each place and had each encounter. In this version, the only reason seemed to be the fact that there was a similar scene in the original.    The overall message seems appropriate for the times, however. A bunch of pride filled people thinking they are so great, but having no accomplishments to back up that belief, and deciding they will openly rebel against \\"the gods\\", because people don't need the gods. Of course, then it also shows (unwittingly perhaps) that, no matter what man can do for himself in life (and they certainly weren't doing much for each other in this movie), after death, their fate is still in the hands of the gods they've rejected, as seen in Calibos's fate.
0891419063|5.0|Eugene Sledge's account of his service with the 1st Marine Division on Peleliu and Okinawa is simultaneously inspiring and heart-wrenching. To read of what these young men endured and accomplished in the faithful service of their country, with the perspective of 60 years of hindsight, is occasionally overwhelming in its poignancy and intensity.<br /><br />Sledge served his country well, both as a Marine in WWII and subsequently, with the publication of this classic account of men at war. It is an account that will endure and will remain indelible in the minds of all who have read it.

B0030Y11XS|4.0|Brilliant filmmaking. Like all Michael Moore films, \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" is a bit propagandistic, simplistic, and extreme. The question explored in the film, however, is a darn good one: Who gave the corporate/financial/political classes all the power and why don't we the people take it back?

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|The Tourist sets out to be a romantic mystery in the footsteps of Alfred Hitchcock.  Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp may not be 21st century versions of Grace Kelly and Cary Grant but a Jolie comes close being an ice princess. She is so impeccably dressed and poised that she deflects all emotion.     Spoilers below.     For me Angelina Jolie's character needed more of a past. We need to know to know that she has crossed the line from a Scotland Yard agent to compromising herself with Alexander Pierce.  Perhaps Inspector Acheson (Paul Bettany) should pick her up for questioning early in the film instead of Jolie walking into a police office to report after a year of saying nothing.      Scotland Yard is motivated to capture Pierce because he owes the British government several million in taxes.  Since Pierce has stolen a huge amount a money from a crime boss one wonders where the taxes are coming from.  Pierce's character does not seem to warrant so much attention from the police. Maybe if he was also selling government secrets or had something that both the British government and the crime boss wanted there would be a more plausible reason for all the international fuss about capturing Pierce.     There also is the problem that Jolie is not supposed to recognize Depp's Frank Tupelo as Pierce yet be drawn to him at the same time.  The lack of recognition places some distance between the characters at the conclusion when Jolie and Depp go off together it all seems abrupt. Unfortunately, Rufus Sewell doesn't get enough screen time as the phony Pierce to convince us that he might be the man everyone is searching for.      End Spoilers    The Tourist has good performances by Paul Bettany, Jolie and Depp, but their performances were more on the average side than exceptional.  Steven Berkoff made a demented villain but I had some trouble taking him seriously.  For me, the backdrop of Paris and Venice gave the film its appeal.  Having Johnny Depp running across the rooftopsof Venice in pajamas made the chase far more interesting.  The Tourist is interesting to watch, especially if you have an affection of Paris or Venice, but the story could have been thought out.
0486650677|5.0|The book is very readable, and goes into depth about the principles that it was written to cover. As a chemist, I bought this book to learn about calculus of variations for a stat-thermo course as well as understand the reasoning behind the Hamiltonian. It does lack problems, save for asking the reader to clear up some trivial details. If you want a book loaded with exercises and cookbook recipes for solving problems, look elsewhere. If you want to feel like you're sitting through the best physics lecture of your life, get this book.
B00192IV9U|3.0|To cut to the chase - Michael Jackson's mother appeared on Oprah and not only attacked Sony but noted that at least 5 songs on this recording were not created by Michael. I haven't read any updates since then so if anyone wants to chime in about that...it would be greatly appreciated! Also, to be fair, other music critics have noted that some (if not all) of the songs are Michael's work. They include publications such as Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and others. Does this prove that the compositions ARE Michael's work? Nope.<br /><br />Another question - would Michael have been satisfied or ready to release this?<br /><br />Potential buyers have to decide whether this is worth purchasing and where they stand on the ethics of buying something that may not contain a significant number of works by Michael or be something he'd have allowed to be released - if given his choice. Perhaps you'll want to go ahead and buy it and decide whether you like the music or not.<br /><br />My stance? The music is above par and if you've been a fan of Michael Jackson for years you'll most likely have a \\"feel\\" for what rings true and what might be suspicious. When it comes to the works, they get a 3 out of 5 rating from me because some do feel incomplete to me. I don't believe Michael would have given final approval for this to be released.<br /><br />However, I do believe that some of the songs were created by Jackson, including (I Like) The Way You Love Me\\", a song that creates images of the young Michael Jackson.
030746363X|2.0|First of all, do you really want to buy a book from someone who fakes Amazon reviews so that his books are all 5 stars and have a gazillion positive reviews within the first few days of the book's release, all with about two sentences (i.e. \\"Tim is the greatest, everything he writes is gold!! I cAN'T wait for his next book!!!\\")?    The author is someone obsessed with \\"hacking\\" life and maximizing certain results while minimizing work. In other words, he likes to treat himself like a machine. This book will be highly appealing to teenage boys who frequent bodybuilding websites and are all about testosterone and alpha-ness and impressing other people with their looks (which is a very unmanly thing, when you think about it), but it will be a complete disappointment for everyone else, especially those who are more internally focused than externally. The book is written very poorly, as if it was done in a mad 3 AM rush, and I am certain that the author simply took his own personal notes and smashed them together into a book for the sole purpose of making money off of something he was already doing anyway. He's a very bright guy who knows exactly how to get millions of people to fill his pockets while doing little service to any of them and doing the least possible amount of work.     You'll probably find that a few pages here and there will be worthwhile to you. The only section that has given me some ideas is the section on swimming. I knew about Total Immersion Swimming, but never really committed to learning it. I might just have to get that DVD and learn it. That's why I'm giving the book an extra star.    One book is not going to give you all the answers, especially with a ridiculous title like this. If you want to learn about nutrition, find the best books on nutrition. If you want to start working out with weights, find the best books on that subject. Learn from the most lauded experts, not from a guy who has no qualifications and has made a living telling peoplethey can have everything in life while doing the least possible amount of work, just because it is true for him (and the way he does it is by telling other people that they can do it -- very crafty). I think we've all had that feeling where we've figured something out that works for us and makes our lives easier, and we want to run around telling everyone we know (and people we don't) about what we've figured out, but what works for us doesn't always work for others. We all want the answers to everything, but sometimes it's best to find them for ourselves instead of in a book or through a Google search. Who's to say his tips on incredible sex will work for you? You have a brain of your own -- don't rely on someone else's for every aspect of your life.

B002C6A6N6|4.0|I read the reviews of this item prior to purchasing and was a bit reticent due to the complaints of the sound and the video not being matched up.  I purchased anyway, because it was a good price and I figured I could deal with that problem on a few episodes.  The packaging was fine, except that one of the bindings on the part that actually holds the DVD was broken at the spine and that has proven to be a bit of a pain.  Otherwise, it seems to be in good shape and is compact enough for just about any location in my room.    Upon loading the actual DVDs, I did find a few episodes where the sound and visual didn't match.  This was at first very annoying and I couldn't even watch it.  However, this was easily remedied by pushing the STOP button on the remote, waiting a few seconds, and pushing PLAY again.  The DVD was able to then match it and it worked fine from that point forward.  I gave this product four stars because of these two minor problems, but am nonetheless pleased with my purchase and look forward to enjoying every episode for a long time.      PS, Sully is hot!

0767827694|5.0|This is a great adaptation of V.W.'s book in that the spirit of the book was very alive and a comedy of manners of sorts concerning, of course, sex and the eternal question: what is it like for a female?  what is it like for a male?<br />Tilda Swinton and many marvelous actors pull it off wonderfully and I was despairing I'd never see it again after I loaned it on VHS to a non-returner sort of idiot.  Very happy it's on DVD now and it certainly stands the test of time.  If you purchase this item, the first viewing might be a bit of a shock......it is not traditional cinematic fare.  I promise that upon the second viewing various small sly smiles will begin to slip in here and there as you catch the many layers of quiet comedy.  EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE ONE.  Cheers.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released in 1986 and fell in love with it. The blu-ray produces a crisp, life-like picture, making it definitely worth the investment. Jim Henson was a puppet genius and the world created is fascinating. The humor is appealing to children and adults alike. David Bowie is the best goblin king ever and the voice talent of Frank Oz makes this one worth watching again and again. I can't wait for my children to grow up and enjoy this the same way i did.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I'm a big fantasy/sci-fi geek.  I watch it all (or almost all of it).  And I can safely say that I haven't seen a show this entertaining and engaging since The X-Files.  Before I started watching, someone described the show to me as a mix of The X-Files and CSI.  I think that describes this show exactly.  It's the perfect mix of crime show whodunit with a heavy sprinkling of sci-fi to take it juuuust outside the norm, keeping mainstream viewers and die hard geeks like me hooked.  And episodes range from icky to disturbing to heartbreakingly thought-provoking.  This is a tv series I will watch over and over again.    And the cherry on top?  Walter and his classic one liners.  I love this show and pray that Fox doesn't screw up yet another fantastic series when they moved it to the \\"kiss of death\\" timeslot:  Friday evenings.  Program those DVRs!  Buy the DVDs!  You won't be disappointed.
B000WDS1OC|5.0|I ordered the shoes from Amazon and they arrived promptly. These shoes were made in the Dominican Republic. That pissed me off, however the finish was first rate and the sizing and comfort were as good as any shoe I've worn. They feel great and look like quality. They're not heavy or clunky.  I feel as though I've gotten my money's worth. I highly recommend. I'd like to think Americans can do just as good a job in making these shoes.
B0049VGTGA|5.0|Face Value is simply a wonderfully enjoyable record and it's a pleasure hearing these great Phil Collins songs and hits in a new light thanks to this remastered version of the classic solo debut album. Every track breathes a new life, hearing elements of familiar songs that I hadn't heard before. I always hope that's the case when I purchase remastered recordings and it seems to me that the Audio Fidelity releases are consistently delivering the goods.   I need to be fair and point out just how subjective acceptable \\"superior sound quality\\" is - it is certainly a matter of personal taste. How do you enjoy your rock and roll music - ask one hundred people and get one hundred different answers. This is exactly my premise, for my money and to my ears this most recent addition to my Phil Collins stash is the best sounding Face Value I've ever heard.  \\"In the Air Tonight\\" sounds full and rich and fresh. \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy\\" promises again to tear-out your heart while soothing your ears. \\"This Must Be Love\\" and \\"I Missed Again\\" are other highlights on a compact disc filled with sonic surprises. This Face Value is priceless, thus highly recommended.
0316044938|5.0|My opinion of The Lovely Bones is that it is a very good book with not-being-able-to-put-the-book-down reasons, and extraordinarily written. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense, romantic stories, figuring out how to solve mysteries, and learning the thoughts of the dead. With being written in a point of view so that you can see and hear everyone's thoughts, this book makes you feel like you are really there while the story is happening. While Suzie Salmon, the main character, is watching her family and friends in \\"her heaven\\", Suzie's father is going crazy trying to catch her killer. The way he goes about doing it all is both powerful and heartwarming.  Through the ups and downs of Suzie's family after her loss, they work together to get through her death and spontaneous glimpses of her on earth after death. I overall rate this book 5-stars, and I hope that everyone else who reads this book will think the same.

1441851895|5.0|Of the four (or five if you count \\"A Wallflower Christmas\\") Wallflower series novels, this is my personal favorite.  Who would have paired the shy and stammering Evangeline (Evie) Jenner with the scoundrel Sebastien, Lord St. Vincent?  No one, if you had the slightest \\"411\\" on their respective backgrounds! But they do get together, and the transformation that takes place in both of them is wonderful ... talk about a \\"love match!\\"    This is a great book to listen to (or read) when you want to escape from the harsh realities of \\"real life\\" - comfortably ensconced in a favorite chair or in your bed.  Having a cup of tea, and burning some sandalwood incense (that's Sebastien's cologne scent) as I do whenever I listen to this disc just adds to the atmosphere.  I enjoy being able to get comfortable and let my imagination \\"visualize\\" while listening as opposed to turning the pages of the actual book.      I recommend this audiobook (or printed novel) to anyone who has become acquainted with the Wallflowers.  St. Vincent's transformation because of Evie is comparable to Ebenezer Scrooge's in \\"A CHRISTMAS CAROL.\\"  While the rake may reform, there is still enough of the \\"bad boy\\" left to tantalize.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|When Philippe Petit, after astounding the world with almost an hour of antics - walking, jumping, dancing and even reclining - on a steel cable strung between the Twin Towers on August 7th, 1974, before giving himself up to the New York police, the enigmatic entry under which he was booked read \\"Man on wire.\\"     This is how the police viewed his act and also how most of the world viewed it - as the act of a crazy individual who, balancing on a steel cable rigged precariously at a height of 1,368 ft above the streets of New York, had astounded everyone by crossing and recrossing eight times before rain brought an end to his performance.    If the thousands watching Petit had been asked what they had seen they would probably have answered, like the police, that they had seen a man on a wire. However, it seems clear from the movie that many of the onlookers, far from merely having seen a man on a wire, had experienced something so beautiful and profound that it could only be described as religious or spiritual; they had seen a man becoming truly a man or even something more than a man; they had witnessed him demonstrating the full potential that lies buried deep within all of us. I think this is why they were so moved that some of them wept.    Awakening normally takes place in isolation. No-one actually saw the Buddha become a buddha. But when Petit, courting death and moved by some inexplicable force, took that first grim step onto the swaying steel cable and we saw his face suddenly melt into an ecstatic smile, at that very moment he triumphantly conquered the universal fear of death, shattered the prison of ego and, buddha-like, became one with the cable, the towers, the watching crowd, the city, the world and the universe itself and I'm sure some in the crowd must have felt this. The ancient Indian philosopher Nagarjuna (c.150 - 250 CE) explains:    \\"When buddhas don't appear  And their followers are gone,  The wisdom of awakening  Bursts forth by itself.\\"    Theworld, in short, was granted the privilege of witnessing the awakening of a man, human as we are human, beautifully bursting forth into his full potential as man on wire became buddha on wire.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I've always enjoyed Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.  I was not able to watch the show as much as would have liked, but now with this set, I'm able to watch it at my leisure. The quality is just wonderful and I was lucky to get it while you had it on sale!  If you enjoyed the show...this set makes a great addition to your DVDs. So many of the shows I missed out on, so this set is a real treat for me...it's like watching it fresh and new! It's a much better value to get it as a set so you really won't go wrong in purchasing it.  They also shipped it to me in a timely matter and because it was over $25, the shipping was free!! Yes, I'm extremely happy with the purchase!  Thanks!![[ASIN:B002C6A6N6 Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series]]
B002N5N4M6|4.0|This show always makes me think of the characters of [[ASIN:1596911050 JPod: A Novel]] re-written with the dry humor of [[ASIN:1432752480 No Hope for Gomez!]].    As with NoHope, BigBang's characters are hilariously consistent. The things they get up to make perfect sense to them, and after a while they will to you too. Getting to know and understand the characters is half the fun of the show. The other half is the slew of awkward social situations that is thrown their way, much like we saw happening to Ethan in JPod.     The third season finally sees Leonard and Penny becoming an item, Sheldon finding his nemesis in Will Wheaton from Star Trek, Howard developing a relationship with a woman who is not his mother, and Raj finding a way to talk to women.    Not to be missed by fans of the previous seasons (or of [[ASIN:1432752480 No Hope for Gomez!]] or [[ASIN:1596911050 JPod: A Novel]] for that matter :)
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Ordered this on the 30th, with one day shipping in mind. Got here on the 31st, just in time for my birthday. I must say, this headset is amazing. It feels very light, which is perfect for me because I forget it's on my head. However, it seems slightly flimsy. I've had it for a few days. no problems yet. The Bass Boost is nice and yes, you can tell the difference in the game music when you turn it on. I can hear footsteps in Black Ops now, no one can sneak up behind me! Sound quality is nice, and I love how it eliminates the \\"clogged ears\\" feeling. I can hear myself talk! Finally! When it arrives you can expect the common clamshell packaging, nothing fancy. If for some unfortunate reason my Turtles break, I'll gladly buy another pair.
B00493AD74|1.0|The only reason I watched this movie is because I thought it would be a time where the movie could exceed the book, as the book was so spectacularly awful. I couldn't have been more wrong.  Same self-centered drivel, same narcissistic brooding, and the movie drags at the same god-awful pace of the book.  A couple hours felt like 10.  I had to take periodic breaks just to regroup and steel myself for the next 15 minutes, at which point I'd break again.  It's just terrible.  I should have just given up on it, but didn't want to waste my money, fatal mistake.  I will never get those hours of my life back, and I loathe the producers for that.  I have no idea how this book became such a phenomenon (well, yeah I do, thanks Oprah), and it's a pity that because of that, a terrible movie was made from it.
B002JVWR4U|4.0|I had nearly forgotten the first series, but could not wait to see how it turned around after the final episode on series one. The first episode left me cold, but I was determinded to continue. It just got better and better, back to the original plots and by the end the twists were coming left, right and centre. It was sad to see it end again. Well worth the wait.
0240816250|4.0|I'm not going to write a long review as others have already done so; however I would recommended Way Beyond Monochrome 2nd edition as an excellent starting point or tutorial for the intermediate worker or dedicated beginner, as well as a reference for the more experienced darkroom practitioner & photographer. The highlight of WBM 2nd ed (and certainly improved over the 1st edition) is perhaps the authors' practice of providing solid and accessible technical, craft, and theoretical understanding without getting distracted by science, or appealing to mysticism; making the book suitable as a general introduction for high schools and colleges.

I've played a few visual novels in the past on my PC, so I was expecting the standard \\"GOOD END\\" and \\"BAD END\\" banter.

One piece of information that seems trivial in one playthrough, will become important in another. I can't say much without giving too much away, besides for the fact that I ended the game with my mind blown and shaking for more. I can see why Aksys brought this to the states.

B0041KKYEM|2.0|Note: Few spoilers, but the sixth paragraph has a pretty major spoiler, but is vital to the comprehension of this review. AND believe me, I loved Aronofsky, and just couldn't enjoy it as I should have. Peace!<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky usually has a set of routine characters who have lost their way in life. From the drug dealers in Requiem for a Dream to Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, this has been a common theme in his work. However, here, he is trying to establish a different central dynamic, and the weakened character is the secondary character, Beth, the Prima Ballerina, who will be soon retiring. Many may claim that Ryder's character is vastly unimportant, but it just may show that Aronofsky cannot separate himself from his long held familiar themes.<br /><br />Aronofsky 's film centers on ballerina Nina who, along with countless other ballerinas in her company is auditioning for Swan Lake.  The Director, Leroy, wants to cast the same person as the Black and White Swan. White so many options, he eventually chooses Nina despite having better black Swan candidates, such as Lilly played by Mila Kunis. Apparently, Lilly is filling for another ballerina, and as so, Nina, is not very familiar around her, nor comfortable. Nina is very shy, reserved, committed to her art, and extremely focused who has no concept or understanding of Lilly's offbeat sense of humor, her directness, her strange and sudden attempt at friendship. Their conflicting attitudes, if nothing else, are evidence of arising problems.<br /><br />One of the main complaints of the film is how unfit a protagonist Nina is. As a shy, reserved character living at home with a mother, played by Barbra Hershey, who creates abstract and nearly identical, in form, abstract portraits, and is intrusive, Lilly seems to have the perfect arsenal to bring out the Black Swan. If the Black Swan is supposed to be emotionally crippled and vulnerable, it seems strange that Nina fails in this regard, and actually succeeds at portraying the White Swan. Stranger, however, is that Lilly succeeds at portraying the Black Swan better, even though she would naturally seem as better suited for the Black Swan. Another oddity is how oddly different Nina is compared to all of Aronofsky 's other characters. They all seemed extroverts, and displayed more overt emotions than Nina. Maybe this adds to the mystique of this character as we don't know what she will be capable of as the film develops. She expresses a lot of emotion, but all of it is internal, and that makes her not only mysterious, but capricious.<br /><br />Aronofsky is without doubt one of the most talented directors of the last decade, but here he is of his element. With the Wrestler, most of us westerners have watched wrestling and sometimes laughed at and admired their countless shenanigans that is labeled at times sport and other times entertainment. However, not most film viewers are going to have gone to the ballet or have a deep understanding of it. As such, we do not accept the details of this art, as we might with a film centered on Wrestling, boxing, football, but his film delivers none of the intricacies of ballet. Many may claim that no film is responsible, or must dwell in the details of the craft they are set in, but Black Swan is different.<br /><br />Leroy consistently haunts Nina about the imperfections of her Black Swan, her inability to be \\"flawed,\\" her lack of necessary aggression,  talking about how Lilly is better prepared for this Swan, but none of this is actually show clearly. Aronofsky would have done better showing Nina attend a performance of Swan Lake, so that the audience can gain, at least, a little insight into this world. In its current state, it is quite certain that this was written by authors who had no deep knowledge of the ballet world, and just wanted to create a film. That is fine, if this film was mainly an acting film, like Winter's Bone, but Leroy and Lilly's interaction make this much more than acharacter study, and with some study it could have successfully turned in to a \\"limited\\" study of Swan Lake. Leroy's complaints of Lilly is confined to her lack of ferocity, aggression, and inability to \\"let go,\\" give credence to the claim that these writers knew very little about the details of a ballet performance, or were simply uninterested in giving multiple angles to the performance and its preparation. We see lots of kissing, groping of breasts and crotch between Leroy and Lilly, and it would be sexy, if it were not part of Lilly's preparation; and with this knowledge these scenes become quite depressing, considering that these are the only advice she gains from her instructor. There needs to be more insight to Leroy's character than his unashamed seductions in preparing his ballerina. Sure, ballet is very sexualized, but the advice and period of preparation must not ALL be sexual.<br /><br />There is a line between what is real and what is a fantasy, a dream, or works of the imagination. There are many directors who cross this line, and then there are those that mock it, like Aronofsky does in this film, for the benefits of paranoia and obsession. Nina's obsession is very well understood from all the physical injuries she suffers, but it is the paranoia that Aronofsky is quite inept at capturing. He begins to play a horror game which involves a monster, with the body of a man, having sex with Lilly. Actually, when the paranoia seems to become quite intriguing, it has more to do with drugs than Lilly's altered personality. One especially offensive scene occurs near the very end when Nina and Lilly fight, and Nina pushes Lilly in the path of a large mirror, and stabs her with shards of glass, and drags her to another room; leaving her alternate for dead, while she begins her performance. When she later returns to the room, she hears a knock on the door, and of all people it's LILLY. As it turns out she was fighting herself, and so it can be presumed she pushed herself in the mirror! This is where Black Swan becomes even more ludicrous, because at this point Lilly finds the shards of glass in her body, and finds that she is bloodied. So, get this: The NINNA VS. NINNA match occurs, then Ninna does part of her performance (as the Black Swan), she returns to the room, and suddenly the shards of glass that punctured her body take effect. This is like a Western where two cowboys shoot at each other, and none of them are injured, but after ninety minutes the bullet exists from their body, causing incurable harm, and we are supposed to be believe and accept that the bullet, and in our case, the shards of glass manifested till the right time came, and then it started to cause observable bleeding. This is not paranoia, but desperation of the filmmaker.<br /><br />Natalie Portman will be undoubtedly nominated for Best Actress for her performance, and considering that there are no veteran actors competing this year who are without an Oscar-Kidman, Berry, etc have won at least once-she might win her first Statue. But God knows this is the wrong performance. This is a good performance, but it is not an exceptional performance, as Ninna is not subdued, but simply nervous and hesitant to trust anyone. Unlike Winter's Bone where a subtle performance was cleverly done by Jennifer Lawrence, Portman's performance is miniscule in comparison. Her character is so jumpy that it could be played as well, if not better, by most actors. The performance is quite one note, because the character is designed as such.  The rave reviews that Kunis is getting are simply baffling. She plays the sweet tempered, yet clever opportunist who seems to be plotting for the main role of Swan Lake. Again, this performance is not a stretch for Kunis and she bring a familiar and monotonous charm to the character that is deeply reminiscent of every other performance she has done-be it on TV or film.<br /><br />Vincent Cassel's performance:  WOW! Now here is a performance that deserved a nomination, but received none. Despite my problems with the sole sexualized advice of Leroy, Cassel plays this character with so much confidence and grandeur, creating a captivating instructor admired by all. Cassel's performance is exceptional because Leroy is open to much analysis, and is not as one note as the female roles that occupy this film. Barbra Hershey gives a respectable performance, despite her limited screen time. Bound to get an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Overall, this is an below average film from a great filmmaker who is just of his element, and is dealing with an issue that he does not have extensive and exhausting information. However, considering the crap in theaters, this would be recommended for Portman, Kunis, and Aronofsky fans.lack Swan becomes even more ludicrous, because at this point Lilly finds the shards of glass in her body, and finds that she is bloodied.

B002VECM6S|5.0|Hollywood has been reduced to remakes of classics (usually with lousy results), resorting to comic books and TV shows and the occasional biopic. This is the latter, and this reviewer was shocked. BLIND SIDE sports an intelligent script, outstanding performances, maintains the viewers interest, and doesn't feel like a \\"rip off\\" of some other movie.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock in an Oscar winning portrait gives a multi-layered performance (quoting the movies \\"like an onion, you have to peel each layer). She is totally believable and is the focus fo this movie.<br /><br />I am not a sports fan and this flick deals with football, and like Eastwood's \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" about boxing, it did not intefere with my pure enjoyment of this film about an affluent Southern family that takes in a homeless, lunky 18 year old and turns his life around.<br /><br />Many reviews before me will give you more of an inside scoop.

0240816250|5.0|I've been seriously involved with photography for a long, long time and serious means a home darkroom, processing color film, the works.

There is no digital camera that is their equal for unobtrusive street photography.<br /><br /> \\"Way Beyond Monochrome\\" is dedicated to the continuation of film or, as the authors prefer, analog photography. And, by photography, they mean monochrome - black and white.<br /><br /> I don't know if the book will attract anyone to analog photography. In its thoroughness, it shows that serious film photography is a complicated, messy affair. But the prints in this book are too die for. Incredibly lush landscapes which any experienced photographer, analog or digital, will recognize as products of the application in one way or another of Ansel Adams' famous Zone System. In a chapter on creating a print of a photo of Stonehenge, the authors demonstrate a mastery of black and white photo printing techniques, while simultaneously enhancing my appreciation of Photoshop. The following chapter is one a print of a farm field. The tonal range of this print is stunning, practically unbelievable. But I seriously question if I would want to devote the time to creating this kind of perfection.<br /><br /> In 500 or so pages, the authors provide a very complete course in virtually every aspect of monochrome photography, mechanical, chemical and to a larger extent, creative as well. By the time I finished this book, I was aching for my long-gone Leicas and a couple of dozen rolls of Tri-X.<br /><br /> The authors don't fudge that analog photography is a demanding and challenging path. They also point out that with digital photography so prominent, that fine analog equipment is available for a song on the used market.<br /><br /> The reality is that Mssrs. Lambrecht and Woodhouse are gifted photographers - and, as was true of all monochrome photographers, gifted technicians as well. Photoshop has changed the world - but this book is enough to make you want to journey into the increasingly forgotten world of analog photography. If I thought I still had the patience and time to get the results the authors achieve, I'd consider it. But despite how beautiful \\"Way Beyond Monochrome\\", I'll stick with digital, but how this book made me long for those Leicas. I should never, ever have sold them.<br /><br /> Whether you contemplate entering the world of film photography or not, anyone who wants to understand the art of photography more fully should at least seriously browse this book. The photography is, for the most part, excellent and the beautiful prints jump off the page. There's a lot to learn in these pages.<br /><br />Jerryphers, gifted technicians as well.

B0042MEQVG|5.0|This movie is the best of the series that has yet been made, all of them have been good but this is the best so far.
0786939532|5.0|This book was a thriller from page one.I have had to pull my self and caught myself lost in time reading this amazing adventure of Drizzt Do, Urden. I am buying all of the set as i can not be without the rest of them.Great buy great price
1439156816|5.0|This is a great book about writing fiction, and also a fascinating memoir of Stephen King.  I have to admit I knew very little about his life.  The fact that it is about writing as well as his life makes sense because writing is his passion and so central to his life.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Worth every cent! The words, the words, the words! Bruce has always spoken to me and for that I am grateful.
B000AQJPQE|1.0|This toy is a piece of junk. There is a requirement that it be toggle-bolted into the ceiling with two toggle-bolts (provided) and the ceiling must be one of drywall.  So if you give your child or grandchild this toy and you have a wood ceiling, forget about it! And who wants to toggle-bolt something to their ceiling and WHY DON'T THEY MAKE THAT CLEAR BEFORE YOU GIVE IT TO THE CHILD???  Our solar system is sitting on our coffee table, the remote control that makes it revolve is already broken.  I emailed the company about alternative ways to hang the item and never heard back.<br /><br />I suppose if you have the right kind of ceiling and are an owner (not a renter) and you know up front that you are going to drill holes, it might work out.  Otherwise, buy something else.
B003X73QA8|4.0|After waiting several years for the next release for the stunning Canadian indie group, Arcade Fire, The Suburbs landed in my hands. I immediately started listening to their latest, and was drawn into this beautiful world this group has crafted with their latest effort. I was enthralled with each and every song to some degree, and was immediately left wantin the next CD released already! Also, I was greately pleased with the length. Most artists are releasing CDs under 45 minutes. This CD is 63 minutes long. Yes, Arcade Fire fans, over an HOUR of a wonderful experience.<br /><br />The Suburbs - (7/10) - At first listen, I was rather skeptical of where this was going, but I've been listening to it more and more, and its rooting its way into my head bit by bit. I find myself tapping my feet to the fun rhythym, and humming along.<br /><br />Ready to Start - (9/10) - In a word, stunning. This song takes what The Suburbs started, carries on right from the end from a happy tune to a more dark and powerful song. It holds a wonderful musical scape on its own, the lyrics are fascinating, and the voices mix it perfectly.<br /><br />Modern Man - (8/10) - A slightly more uptempo song, that drives along at a steady pace. The lyrics are soft, and almost mocking of what we are today, but the driving guitar line makes this quite a listen.<br /><br />Rococo - (10/10) - Amazing. Simply amazing. Even the way it begins, with the wail of strings and the stumming of guitars is fascinating. It too is a bit mocking of modern life, but the song flows so perfectly, and the lyrics are dark and captivating.<br /><br />Empty Room - (8/10) - One of the few shorter songs on the album, which starts with a scream of strings, and the thudding of an electric guitar, and the segues perfectly into a soft female voice. The way it is sung makes you beieve every word/<br /><br />City With No Children - (8/10) - A strange little mix, with a soft drumline, a distorted guitar effect, and a uptempo tune. Thechorus is definently the high point of the song, a swelling mix of voice and instrument. This song is a beautiful song of yearning.<br /><br />Half Light I - (6/10) - While it is pretty, it got quickly repetitive and dull, as the same guitar line repeats over and over and over. The lyrics are nice, and the singing is great though.<br /><br />Half Light II (No Celebration) - (10/10) - A creepy and dark song, with an amazing guitar line flowing throughout the song. The lyrics are a plea to run away, and save one from the sins they have committed. The background music ebbs and flows throughout the song like a perfect wave, and the blend of male and female lyrics make this song excel.<br /><br />Suburban War - (7/10) - A fast paced drum lead song, with an almost african feel to the drumline. The guitar swirls through an amazing riff over and over, and the soft vocals compliment the music.<br /><br />Month of May - (5/10) - I never really good get into the song. It sounds like a strange garage band song, and the lyrics aren't amazing, nor is the singing. Its catchy, sure, but I just didn't like it very much.<br /><br />Wasted Hours - (8/10) - A soft and slow balad, swimming comfortably in a soft musicscape, with subtle lyrics, and soft guitars.<br /><br />Deep Blue  - (5/10) - A slow song, with not much to it. I didn't enjoy it terribly much.<br /><br />We Used to Wait - (7/10) - A strange song that makes up for Deep Blue's slump. The lyrics are fascinating and the song is very catchy.<br /><br />Sprawl I (Flatlands) - (8/10) - A shorter song, but a joy to listen to. It's slower tempo, but a nice song all around.<br /><br />Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) - (10/10) - Easily the highlight of the album. A beautiful mix, sung marvelously, and played beautifully. The lyrics are soft and sweet, and speak of the Mountains Beyond the Mountains, the neverending nature.<br /><br />The Suburbs (Continued) - (7.5/10) - It was slow and odd, but it offered a nice, soft endingto the album.<br /><br />All in all, a SOLID album, with very few bad songs in my opinion.<br /><br />Highlights: Rococo, City With No Children, Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)
B004498KPU|5.0|I was so excited when I received this.    There were quite a few videos that have not been shown in the US, which were great.    I HIGHLY recommend this.
B0000067L2|5.0|I heard this album on FM radio in Toronto around 1967 and I ran straight to Sam's or A&A records and bought it.    To put it in context a bit I was playing in a band at the time and I used all my powers of persuasion to convince the guys, particularly my friend the guitarist, we had to play this song called Sunshine of Your Love. All the songs were a fascinating mixture of poetry, rock, blues, jazz, you name it but this one stood out. We never regretted it and got great response from the audiences we played to. A year later were heading out for burgers at Harvey's as was our custom and what should come on AM radio but Sunshine Of Your Love. You could have knocked us over with a feather. We were ahead of the wave.    Great songs played by great musicians who burned themselves out in the effort. What more could you ask for. That's Rock And Roll.
B0001E5TOM|5.0|This man should really be a household name, his music and performance is so soulful and powerful. Then again, in these times, he's just too good to be famous....this is real Soul music, mostly on the mellow, introspective side. Really beautiful, heartfelt and if you are a fan of soul/r&b a must have.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I've been a fan of Maroon 5 ever since their debut album, Songs about Jane. But I felt that all the music they made afterward didn't live up to it. However, this does. It has that same wistful, melodic rhythm and great lyrics. Adam Levine's voice is just getting better and better.
B002VWNIAY|4.0|What am I missing?  Certainly \\"Casablanca\\" is a solid movie with a wonderful theme, a movie so very appropriate for its time.  Humphrey Bogart, an icon in his day lingering in that regard for many to this very day, plays a strong-willed though broken-herted tough guy.  A tough guy - what a surprise!  I always found his acting stiff, and he is no different in \\"Casablanca.\\"  Claude Raines, as Louie the Chief of Gendarmes, despite his stated lust for women, behaves and sounds as though he lusts for Rick, the Bogart character.  \\"Putting one over on the Nazis,\\" I suspect, is what catapulted this film into the favor of its original critics and audiences.  Still it is a strong movie with all the pieces of the puzzle fitting neatly together at the conclusion, but with the feeling that if the puzzle isn't glued, it could easily fall apart.  I've seen \\"Casablanca\\" a few times, so obviously I like it.  I just don't place it up there with the greatest films ever.
B0000714BP|5.0|What a clean movie considering what it's about! It's nice to have a movie like this that you can still show your kids and know that nothing bad will be seen! Patrick looks great as a woman, as do Wesley and John; hat's off to these great actors who could pull this off! Patrick - we miss you! :(
B000TGJ80I|4.0|Of all the series of the \\"underworld\\" movies I like the first and the second one the best; they keep you interested during the whole show.  The picture quality although they can't compare with some of the new movies, like \\"Ironman,\\" they are still very good. If you like vampire and werewolf movies, these are the best movies to watch.
0446195529|4.0|I enjoy David Balducci's books but this is the first Camel Club novel of his that I have read. I must say that I enjoyed (although the Camel Club takes back seat to the story). Oliver Stone is recruited by the President to investigate and destroy an international drug syndicate. But before he can start his mission, while taking a walk in his favorite park (Lafayette Park), a bomb goes off and he gets involved in trying to locate who is responsible and why. Every time he gets close to the truth, someone is killed, putting his life in more danger. Although, some found this story tedious and unbelievable, I found it thrilling and a great escape.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I played this game with my 8 and 4 year old grandchildren over Christmas.  The 4 year old liked the game more than the 8 year old, and never tired of it.    You do have to be willing to modify the rules, and \\"help\\" the very young players.  Anything over the easiest set of cards is actually pretty challenging. This really is more a game you use to encourage your young children or grandchildren to spend time with you, rather than purely play like Chutes and Ladders, or Parcheesi.  For that purpose, it was great!.    I ended up buying it for myself, because I love the selection of unusual pieces that let you build dozens of simple lego models with nice detail. I am a lego fan with a number of old and new sets.  The pieces in this set added nicely to my collection.
B000G75994|5.0|Like other reviewers who have given this set five stars, I think Maria Joao Pires is the finest living interpreter of Chopin and I love her feel for Mozart in this definitive set of recordings. I can only approach the simplest movements of the Mozart sonatas but her interpretation is my standard and to get anything like the sound of her performance is a thrilling achievement. Her playing is remarkable for clarity, precision and conveying a convincing sense of emotional connection with Mozart's intentions. We'll never know what Mozart's intentions were but her playing persuades you that this is it!
B001QUYAMW|5.0|This collection of tunes is music that Mark Knopfler has contributed to in movies Cal, Last exit to Brooklyn, The Princess bride & Local Hero. You can hear the ease with which he performs his majestry, and if you've seen any of the films, you'll be taken right back to the movie. You'll understand that the music contributed enormously to the movie script. He is a master.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|iv seen the show Castle and became an instant fan. when i found my favorite show releasing books from the show i did not miss my chance. this book had everything for a great mystery novel. And because of watching the show i can place their faces into the pages of the book. readers will not be disappointed. I am looking forward for more richard castle books
B000NIWI9K|5.0|If one were to see only one opera, many would argue that the opera should be Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte (All Women Behave Like This).  In Cosi, both Mozart's music and the libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte are unsurpassed. Collaborating on Cosi both men in 1790 were at the height of their professional careers. The opera was the last of three opera buffa (comic operas) that the two men completed during a three year period. Considered salacious, Cosi became an immediate hit.     Going beyond the technical brilliance, the opera has a moral. In fact, the conductor of the orchestra, Ivan Fischer, in the Glyndebourne production, talking about the opera, mentions that seeing the opera saved his parents' marriage. The excellent Glydebourne production was put on in 2006 in Sussex England with imported Italian singers.     The story begins in a bar where two young noblemen are bragging one-to-another about their fiancés and how their women love only them. A man with greying hair, Don Alfonso, unable to stand any more of their talk, interrupts them to say that they are young and naive. Initially, the two young men challenge Don Alfonso to fight, but Alfonso dismisses their challenge as foolish bravado. Over drinks Don Alfonso explains that it is likely their fiancés would forget them in as little as 24 hours, and bed other men. The two young men are incredulous, demanding that Alfonso back up his statement by making a sizable bet. As one would expect, Don Alfonso wins the bet.    In the seduction scene, Fiordiligi's handsome suitor sings to her a gorgeous aria. The female cast sympathizes with the young woman saying: \\"Who wouldn't be seduced by such beautiful music?\\"
B002ZG981E|5.0|Story is original.  Cast is fantastic. Visual FX are out of this world.  The ending blows you away!
B004856SQ8|5.0|This was a special request from our son for Christmas.  He was DELIGHTED to get this on blu-ray.  It was the best buy around AND we got our copy before the store did.
0316789720|5.0|When I was a youngster back in the 1970s, there was not a book in our public library that I checked out more times or more regularly than Ed Emberly's \\"Make a World,\\" and I'm thrilled to be able to pass it on to my children today.  This book shows you how to quickly turn simple shapes and lines into wonderfully detailed little doodles that can be combined to literally \\"make a world.\\"  The fun part is mixing and matching them together in unlimited ways to make highly detailed scenes of teeming little communities -- honestly, this was SimCity or one of the Tycoon games (Rollercoaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, etc.) for the pre-computerized days...and it's still fun today.  There is a review here that derides this book as \\"clip art,\\" and the drawings are of that level of simplicity, but it's not about recreating the Mona Lisa, it's about taking fun little drawings of everyday things and combining them into your own little masterpiece.  If giving \\"Make a World\\" as a gift, throw in a large sketch pad and a gigantic set of fine-point magic markers, which are the ultimate medium for bringing Mr. Emberly's magic world to life.
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|I bought this camera for my son for Christmas and encountered some  problems.  Although the instruction sheet doesn't mention it, a exclamation mark icon shows up when the memory card is full.  Removing all the pictures from the card removes the icon.  That was easy enough to figure out.    Also, I had a problem with the exclamation mark showing up after removing the pictures from memory.  I'm using Snow Leopard on a Mac.  The OS adds some hidden directories for external drives, such as the .Trashes folder.  Removing these hidden directories via the Terminal gets the camera back in working order.  Basically, any file that the camera doesn't recognize forces it into an unusable state whereby no useful feedback or documentation is provided.    Also, I contacted Digital Blue, the manufacturer, via their support site.  It took 8 days for them to respond.  I called their toll-free number, and it plays a recorded message directing you to the website.  You can leave a message on their answering machine, but they don't seem to respond to those either.    My 5-year-old son loves this camera.  He can take all the pictures he wants.  The picture quality isn't that great, but it doesn't matter to him.
0517118297|5.0|The book, even though it was not \\"new\\" was in excellent condition, and very appropriate for giving as a gift. It's a great book to have if you are a Jane Austen fan, as all her novels are in one book, so the collection is complete. It was packed well, and it was received within days of the order.  Easy Christmas shopping, thank you!
1416583432|4.0|Although I have not owned a dog of my own for several years now, I have always been a dog lover and I still very much enjoy getting to know the dogs that belong to my friends and family.  And, like most dog lovers, I have often wondered what was really going on between the ears of those critters while they look me so directly in the eyes.<br /><br />With Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell and Know, Alexandra Horowitz provides answers to most of my questions.  Some of her answers are amazing and some are a bit disappointing, but all of them are interesting - and make great conversation starters.<br /><br />Let's begin with one that will probably disappoint and crack up an equal number of dog owners: the doggy kiss through which they and their animal supposedly express their affection.  According to Horowitz, \\"our mouths taste great to dogs.\\"  They are, in fact, falling back on a method they used as puppies to get their mothers to regurgitate some partially digested food for them.  Just think how often you have disappointed your kissing-dog by not following through with the hoped for snack.<br /><br />I was surprised, as I suspect many people will be, that our modern-day wolf is not the ancestor of the dog, but that they instead share a common ancestor.  While today's wolves and dogs do share many characteristics, they have many differences.  One of the most noticeable differences is the dog's willingness to look humans directly in the eye as it seeks their guidance.  Wolves, on the other hand, want nothing to do with eye contact.<br /><br />Inside of a Dog is filled with chapters that explore a dog's tendency to \\"see\\" the world through his sense of smell, the supposed psychic powers of dogs, the meaning of growls and barks, how to read a dog's body language, what a dog sees through his eyes (including dealing with the myth that dogs do not see color), a dog's sense of time, and what a dog does all day at home alone.<br /><br />One of the more fascinating topics visited is the highly structured play techniques of dogs, even when meeting a strange dog for the first time.  We have all witnessed a tiny dog taking on a huge canine opponent in mock battle - and living to play another day.  Horowitz through hours and hours of watching slowed-down videos was able to identify the signals that dogs send to each other during this kind of play.  She noted the willingness of the larger dog to handicap himself when taking on a dog much smaller than himself, either by falling onto his back or crouching low enough for the other dog to look him in the eye.  What she describes is quite remarkable and I would love to see some of the video she describes.<br /><br />Dog lovers, this one is for you.  It works particularly well because, for the most part, Horowitz avoids getting too sentimental or cute in expressing her personal love for the dog.  I am definitely not a fan of \\"dog novels\\" (or \\"cat novels,\\" for that matter) so I thoroughly enjoyed all the dog-stereotype debunking included in Inside of a Dog.niques of dogs, even when meeting a strange dog for the first time.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Great for any Sci-Fi fan. The video is awesome quality, while still remaining grainy, as the show was truly meant to be viewed. Also has more bonus features than the DVD from what I can remember.
0670827592|5.0|This book is awesome! I bought this for my 5 year old and we both enjoy this classic tale with a twist! It is great for boy or girl and has beautiful pictures. The story line is captivating and is a frequent read in our home.
B0046UGSNS|2.0|The acting was good, the idea had potential, but the story wasn't particularly compelling. It's interesting to tell a store about marriage and recovery in the setting of an old lesbian couple. But, I just didn't believe it. Neither of the choices the female leads take are particularly believable. It broken my disbelieve and ruined the movie for me.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|Great Movie But I can find no noticeable difference between blue ray & DVDs<br />That warrants paying the extra bucks.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Did you notice the cover how the their pants match.  Sandra Bullock in this role is tough enough to play football.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie was so awesome! Cher is still gorgeous and still has it! Plus the sarcastic humor and singing...sexual dancing and permiscuous Christina makes it all the better! A perfect chick flick that even your guy will go see! Great movie to watch on a girls night!
B000053V7O|4.0|The story moves slowly, but with dignity.  The music is the star of the film.  The musicians are the best in jazz - Dexter Gordon (who also plays the lead character), Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Ron Carter, John McLaughlin. I just recently discovered this film, and I'm glad I did.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|Like other people have written, this is a good piece of hardware for the money, but the supplied (and upgraded) software is terrible.  I run Windoze 7 and had no problems installing iTunes or the application software \\"EZ Vinyl Tape Converter.\\"  Using them is a different story.  I bought this unit because of the auto track separating feature.  It's ok, although it misses a split here and there.  But iTunes absolutely reeks.  It puts the songs in a location WAY down deep on the system drive with no way to set a desired location.  I guess the folks at Apple don't want people knowing where their files are.  Since I run a 60gb solid state disk as my system drive, I have to be very careful with what gets put on there or I run out of room real quick.  iTunes just makes it that much harder.      The record queuing is awkward and usually results in a click when the needle is \\"dropped\\" even with the tone arm lift/lower lever.  As others have mentioned, there's no pop/click filter in the s/w and I have to process each track with Audacity to clean 'em up.  If I wasn't fairly proficient with that program, I can see how I'd be tearing my hair out.  From now on, I'll just use it to do the recording and bypass the supplied junk.      I can recommend the turntable, but definitely not the software.
B00068C7WA|5.0|I love this CD, but then what is not to love about the musical genius of Billy Joel? This is a very good selection of some of his best songs.
044656740X|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad is packed with words of wisdom. It clearly sends the message--Take Responsibility For Your Life.  This book has come out of his own personal experience and I must commend him for sharing that experience in this book. It is an eye-opener for the young as well as the naïve. For too long people have viewed good paying jobs as security blankets and allow themselves to use this to obtain high-limit credit, including credit cards, then when the job vanishes overnight, everything they possess vanishes with it.    As Robert rightly points out, this world is full of bullies--that being said, a job no matter how secure it may seem could vanish very quickly if you have to deal with bullies and mean-spirited people. Robert's own father  was a high income earner who was fired from his job at 50 and went broke.  A fall from the corporate ladder is generally a disastrous one.    I highly recommend this book as a guide - As drivers, we first learn the rules of the road before we get behind the wheel of a vehicle, likewise, we should prepare ourselves to take control of our financial well-being.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|I am by NO means a fan of Ryan Reynolds. That said, I must say that he is tremendous in BURIED! This 90 min. one-man-show seems effortless for him. Trapped in a wooden coffin, several feet underground, his character runs the gamut of emotions, from calm to anger, to frantic terror. Reynolds is flawless in his role as the bewildered, increasingly panicked captive. BURIED covers everything, including: imbecilic bureaucracy / politics, hideous terrorism, and mindless corporate greed. While horrible and tragic, it also has sublime moments of black comedy (i.e. when talking to any government officials or company drones on the cellphone). BURIED is a perfect suspense / mystery / and psychological thriller, all w/ one guy who can barely move! Superb...

Three formats in one was a great deal.  Plays on the good old fashioned DVD player, the fancy new Blu-ray player and right from my Windows Media Player or iPod!  I recommend the movie and the bargain.

I - the royal We, bought this product, but you haven't bought it yet.  Since you have failed to achieve, even in the most modest task that was in your charge,  since you have stolen my money, since you have unrepentently betrayed my trust, I have no choice but to tell these bums to do whatever is necessary to recover their $12 from you.  And with Brandt as my witness, I will tell you this: Any further harm visited upon your personal enjoyment of a Lebowski mouse pad and coffee cup will be visited tenfold upon your head.  My God sir, I will not abide another toe!    Perhaps I was a little harsh.  It's.. it's, it's a fun mouse pad okay man?
0199267170|5.0|This volume is wonderfully arranged and researched.  Personally, I very much appreciate its chronological order and top-notch scholarship.  I've seen a number of reviews rating it fairly lowly because it isn't for \\"first time\\" readers of Shakespeare.  I would hope that a volume compiled by Oxford scholars would be a bit over the heads of Shakespeare initiates.  This book delivers what it ought to deliver: the Bard, beautifully published.
B001HC8516|5.0|This is a difficult book to read because it's not what you want to hear but if you look back on your past relationships, you know this guy knows what he's talking about.  It's definitely a great guide to not wasting years on recycling men who just aren't that excited about you.  Takes the guessing game out of dating and just pull this book out the next time you start wondering about \\"mixed signals\\" or other games these guys are playing.  I highly recommend this book.

B000FC12Z0|3.0|I feal a bit bad giving such a low rating for one of Christies mysteries,but I found this book to be slow moving and draggy in the middle and towards the end. This is worth the read, but you may get a bit bored!
B002JODV3S|4.0|Just note....... is a Blu-ray....sort of  , but ONLY 720p ,ONLY Dolby Digital(no DTS Master HD audio or the like) and no usual Blu-ray functions ( such as pop up menus over playing video). If you already have the dvd and have gear that 'upscales', DON'T bother buying this version.  :)
B001UV4XHY|3.0|The Half Blood Prince and HP7 have lost the charm and magic of the stories; no one expects the movies to be the same as the books but these leave the viewer (me) cold. I wonder was J.K. Rolling an advisor on these movies?    There is no time spent on the death of Dobbie, and many other touching sections of the book that bring the drama of the decision to go after the \\"Hollows\\" or the Horcruxes.  I found the changes in \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" totally useless; Malfoy's mother is a complete wreck emotionally because of Lucius' imprisonment and the task set for her son and yet she shows up at Snape's all dressed up in makeup, heels, etc., oh well thankfully it will finally be over in July.  Perhaps in 10 years or so someone like Peter Jackson will take a look and say \\"let's do these stories justice\\" or not.
142311339X|5.0|This book was amazing! I couldn't stop flipping the pages. I was hesitant to read it at first because I thought that the \\"Percy Jackson\\" series was wonderful, and I was scared that this was not going to be as good. Well, boy was I wrong!! Rick Riordan has outdone himself. \\"The Lost Hero\\" was better in my opinion; it was longer which I thought made it easier to grasp the vivid detail of the characters. Mythology is such an interesting topic, and I think that the longer Mr. Riordan continues to write about it, the more popular it will become. The way this continues with the other series is very clever and makes the reader happier because, like me, they didn't want the \\"Percy Jackson\\" series to end. The expansion of the amount of gods was a great idea because it helped people learn more about the powers of the gods. I like in this book how the demigod's parents weren't all major gods; it made the plot more exciting and interesting. I have no bad feedback about this book and I can't wait until book 2.
B003VYAVGA|5.0|This album is amazing and without sounding obvious is actual Progress. As great as the 4 man band albums Beautiful World and The Circus are the band needed to develop and include other elements. So this album not only has the pop/rock elements but also some electronica which isn't to surprising as Howard himself is a famous House music DJ in Europe in his own right. This album on first listen was odd not for Robbie coming back in the band, he actually sounds natural and again adds his particular dimension to Take That but the electronic sound of the record. However that said the second play of the record i loved every track bar two (Wait and What Do You Want From Me). Favourite 5 songs off the record in no particular order are The Flood, SOS, Eight Letters, Kidz and Pretty Things.  The album is full of energy and excitement and isn't pulled down by the pressure of huge anticipation and expectation from the British public, who have shattered records for Take That including fastest selling tour in UK music history (Progress 2011) and also the fourth highest first week sales of all time behind Adele '25' (2015), Oasis 'Be Here Now' (1997) and Ed Sheeran '÷' (2017). The album has already sold 2.4 million copies in the UK alone 7 of these weeks at #1 and the album has been #1 across Europe. As to whether or not this is their greatest album i'm not sure but it definately ranks highly.  Take That also went on to win Best British Group at The Brits (UK Grammys) in 2011.  Fun Fact: Huge demand for the Progress tour actually caused disruption to British Telecoms on ticket release and the network in Britain to go down momentarily!t history.  Album (weekly): UK #1 (6th) / Europe Hot 100 #1 (3rd) -  World Chart #1 (1 week).  10th biggest selling album Worldwide in 2010 (no US sales)  Total combined career weeks UK #1: 58.  Career album/singles sales in UK: 16.3 million/9.4 million = 25.7 million
B000FCKBCU|4.0|This was a good book, don't get me wrong, but I thought parts of it were a little predictable.  It was still entertaining and I had a hard time putting it down once I started it.
B001FE4I6C|5.0|After my husband and I viewed this movie last year he bought the book for my birthday. Although it took a few weeks to pick it up and get 'into' it I loved the way Carlin wove in the charachters. yes I had heard some of the names before, but I was born in '68 so I was just finishing college and in my own world when apartheid was making the news. This was a great way to learn about the SA political theater, the timing of freedoms on other continents, and the love frenzy associated with the Afrikaaners' rugby.
B0001FUHV6|5.0|One of the re-releases I've actually enjoyed and bought.  Keeps the original signature with a little bit cleanup where needed.  I love this soundtrack and still keep it in my car CD changer to this day.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|incredible concert.    just a little bit dark, i think sometimes lights were missed by producers, but it's just a little issue... the concert is awsome!!!
B0044430H8|4.0|I'm not going to lie, with the exception of the row boat scene, the score never stood out to me. As a result, I was hard pressed remembering that most of this album actually took place. Maybe it was because I was too distracted by the brilliant dialogue and compelling drama, or maybe it was Reznor's intention that his electronic atmospheric machinations accent and compliment the film rather than overwhelm it. And at this, I'd say the soundtrack is quite effective.<br /><br />At times sounding like a Mario game, at others a ghostly landscape of fog in a woodland forest, while still at others, it sounds like the work of a drugged-up and mad composer on a binge of energy drinks. It's certainly original, and it's certainly unlike most anything you're likely to hear this year, but if I described this album in one word, it would be Quiet. For the purposes of the film, I imagine it serves it quite well, for the listener however, any moment not spent in wonderment of the music could easily be led to sleep. Not a bad thing per say, it's just not something I want to return to often.<br /><br />Still, the soundtrack is a work of wonderment and deserves to be listened to at least once. Does it deserve an Oscar? No, but it does deserve a huge amount of respect directed towards Trent Reznor. The man created something unique and of quality here, and it deserves your attention.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5/5 Stars
B001UV4XFG|5.0|i pre-ordered this dvd literately hours before it was released, payed for regular shipping and still got it within 2 days! that was great seeing that i was expecting the 7-10 buisness days! :)
030726999X|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing continuation and conclusion to the first two books in the trilogy.  Larsson picks up where he left off in the Girl Who Played With Fire and keeps you hooked throughout the entire third book.  The ending will leave you more than satisfied and wishing there was a fourth book!
0525950079|5.0|I found the purchase to be effortless and economical. The book WORLD WITHOUT END is super. A fitting sequel to PILLARS OF THE EARTH. I only wish it was a trilogy!!
B001EYGOG0|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of songs that will really brighten your holiday!  Tony is in EXCELLENT voice! Please dont listen to the naysayers who say differently!  One review says that he clips his notes and speaks phrases and \\"improvs\\" Well,THAT\\"S JAZZ! Mr Bennett is singing with the Count Basie Band for goodness sake! Basie gives Tony's singing a very jazz inspired feel that is a different to his more Pop style crooning on other CDs. This album is a testament to the gentleman's versatility, and will be appreciated by those who love Jazz and straight Pop. Buy it and you will enjoy it!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The first two books were so great.  I had to force myself through most of this one.  The beginning was slow, the middle forced and weirdly paced, and the end was unsatisfying.  My advice is read the first two and then make up your own ending for the series.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Percy Jackson is a twelve year old boy with dyslexia and ADHD who has a habit of getting kicked out of school. He comes to find out, lo and behold, he is the son of the sea god. Young Jackson is quickly thrown into a world where the greek gods from the old stories are very much alive and kicking (and committing adultery left and right). The gods need Percy's help because the \\"master bolt\\" of Zeus, king of the gods, has been stolen and they think he did it!<br /><br />The Pros: Fun. This story is fun. When I was learning about the greeks gods in college I always wondered how a modern story like this might be handled. Now I don't have to wonder. Rick Riordan is brilliant in the sole fact that he wrote very well for his audience. This is very much a young adult book. Greek mythology is really not for the faint of heart. Murder, betrayal, adultery, fornication, war, love, lust, you name the greeks had it. Mr. Riordan does a good job of glossing over those elements, which you can't absolute ignore, and focusing on the story. He is able to create innocence where none really exists and does so in a way that fun and interesting. The characters are good and likable if not overly deep. The dialogue is decent and the plot line straight forward but with some good twists.<br /><br />The Cons: Alas the pros can also be the cons in this case. I thought the story was a little TOO young. It would be interesting to see an older rendition of this book with all the things that Riordan left out. I would say that this was probably written for 10 to 12 year olds. The writing style, which is first person, the verbiage used and the plot pacing says as much. For me, I had a hard time connecting with a 12 year-old as the main character. It worked in a book like Harry Potter because the conflict felt like something Harry could handle. That was not the case in this book. I think that is my major complaint.<br /><br />Overall, however, this story is very much worth the read If you like Y.A. fantasy that is straight forward, simple and fun. You'll like this story.ght forward, simple and fun. You'll like this story.
0962477060|5.0|This book is an amazing insight into shapes and patterns that occur on the guitars fretboard that are prevalent in western music.  I was introduced to this book when I took a free \\"Guitar 101\\" introduction class at a local independent music retailer.  The part time instructor, who was also a salesperson for the store, and a gigging musician, used the book to show how chord shapes and their relation to specific scales occur.  While he was only able to cover a small portion of the material presented in the book, he highly recommended anyone interested in learning to play the guitar to pick up a copy.  Based on his recommendation and the reviews on this site I took the plunge and bought the book.    The book, as stated in the description, is a value/special edition in that it combine volume 1 and volume 2 of the Fretboard Logic series.  Volume 1 starts from the beginner guitar player by explaining the musical notes and intervals that make up western music, on to constructing basic chords, then the pentatonic scale and lead tones.  Throughout the books explanations, it uses the C-A-G-E-D sequence to present each subject.  This approach shows how to learn 5 basic forms whether it is a chord, scale, or lead tone, and link those forms across the fretboard to construct play any progression (chordal, scalar or lead) in any key.  While this seems peculiar just based on reading this review, trust me and the other reviewers, this approach is a truly unique way of learning the guitar fretboard and is possibly the best way of putting all of this somewhat convoluted music theory together to where it actually starts to make sense, especially to those like myself who has almost zero music theory background.  Volume 2 expands on the concepts presented in Volume 1 by constructing additional chord types, going through modes of the Diatonic Major scale and corresponding lead tones and more.  All the while the books author presents the material with additional insight, humor and plentiful examples.    One major piece of advice that was given to me from the music store instructor that I want to pass onto anyone that does take the \\"plunge\\" and purchase the book: Read every single word on every single page from beginning to end, not moving past a page until you have understood the basic concept being presented and have practiced the given examples until you can play them near flawlessly.  By doing this, the instructor believed, the book should fully take approximately a full year to complete, with the appropriate followup practice on earlier concepts taught in the book when in the later portions of the book.    To sum it up, I found this book to be quite possible one of the most unique ways to present the forms and patterns that develop across the guitar's fretboard, and the easiest presentation of this material for a novice like myself to grasp.  I highly recommend it.
030726999X|5.0|If you picked up this book to find out how the trilogy ends, you will be satisfied--you'll have to slog through some mire, but you know that already. If you haven't read the first two books in the trilogy, (slap back of hand) put this book down. Now.<br /><br />Plot Summary:<br />Picking up right where Book 2 leaves off, Salander is hospitalized and awaiting trial. Blomkvist, the police and a new SIS team work to expose the secret Special Section that is trying to keep the Zalachenko conspiracy silent.<br /><br />My Opinion:<br />The page-turning continues with some of my favorite characters. You just have to read what happens, it's so compelling. The only time I actually put it down willingly was when we got into 20 pages of the history of the SIS (pp. 78-98). Some of the investigative scenes and a lot of detail could have been cut, but overall a gripping story. The \\"head-hopping\\" (showing multiple points-of-view) grows to 44 POVs in this book. Fortunately, we know most of the characters from the previous two books, but this is very complicated and detailed--more than necessary, imho--but I gladly put up with it for the great characters and story, and somewhat addictive quality of Larsson's writing.<br /><br />If you read the first two books, read this one. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />***ENDING SPOILERS****<br /><br />Gratuitous Romantic Element Comments:<br />`Cuz I'm a sucker for a romantic element, I loved that I couldn't predict the romantic resolution. Figuerola blindsided me as \\"the one\\" for Blomkvist--and I didn't quite buy it. I predicted Berger's husband would get fed up with her not even knowing what country he's lecturing in and leave her. I thought Blomkvist and Berger would wind up together, which actually makes the most sense. But not Figuerola. I thought that affair existed to compromise the investigation in some way, finally adding a consequence and plot point, not just one more broken heart, to Blomkvist's sexcapades.<br /><br />Interesting ambiguous ending with Blomkvist showing up at Salander's door six months after Figuerola. The fan fiction must be rampant along the lines of: \\"Lisbeth drops the towel and the affair is back on again. Then the rightly insecure Figueola finds out and leaves, Then Blomkvist slips up with Berger again - old habits and all - and then Salander crashes Millennium's network, tattoos \\"heartbreaking slut\\" on ex....etc.\\" Hard to accept the Figuerolla relationship when we all like Salander so much.

0812550706|5.0|I don't often read a book over and over again, but I cannot help but do so with this book.  It seems different and more exciting each time I do.
030745455X|5.0|Before you open this book, first read Book 1 \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\". You shouldn't read these out of order -- they're confusing enough in order. Then make sure you have Book 3 \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" ready to go, because this book's ending is a cliff hanger.<br /><br />Plot Summary:<br />Magazine publisher Blomkvist tries to discover who killed his coworker, a reporter who was investigating sex trafficking. The police want his ex-girlfriend Salander for a triple  homicide. Blomkvist's tries to prove her innocence by researching the killers and uncovers a complicated network of crimes and an evil gangster threatening Salander.<br /><br />My Opinion:<br />I love reading any scene with Salander and/or Blomkvist in it. I think Salader may be the most interesting character I've read in fiction in years. And Blomkvist is the perfect foil to her personality. Though I thought the police characters such as Bublanski, Faste and Modig were well-rounded, for me the story dips when the police investigation goes on and on. This book has a bunch of loose ends, such as the Caribbean murder and the ending that stops mid-scene. So it's not a stand alone or a fully satisfying read by itself, you really feel it's part of a trilogy. Still, it's a page-turner extraordinaire and a fine story. There are 32 POVs in this book, compared to only 9 in the first book, so it gets pretty complicated and detailed, and I do think it could have been edited for length and clarity in some places.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS to p. 114****<br />Gratuitous Romantic Element Comments:<br /><br />\\"Memo to `Millennium' secretary: Today we are having a quarterly shareholders' meeting.

The Blomkvist seducing Harriet Vanger scene made me pause. Blomkvist is certainly an odd hero, but here he's almost crossing a line into sleazy. You know your hero is flawed when he's alone with his managing editor (p. 297) and your reader is thinking, \\"Oh, please don't sleep with her, please don't sleep with her.\\" And, yuck, 75 percent of the shareholders of \\"Millennium\\" are sharing bodily fluids. What are the internal company newsletter headlines like: \\"Board gets the clap,\\" \\"Our company flu shot will include penicillin this year.\\" Ok, end of silly rant.

B003H9MSPG|1.0|This toy is a piece of garbage.  Shoots 30 feet?  Yeah right. Maybe if you shoot it in a 45 degree angle with wind to your back.  For the sleek design and the hype on the front of the box, my eleven year old thought this Nerf gun was a piece of junk. I'm very upset with this toy.  We have purchased most of the nerf guns and this one by far is the worst. I'm sure it will sit in the closet until the next gargae sale.  Don't waste your money
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Exciting, dramatic,gripping and believable - this movie shows you around town in a very convincing way. I kept thinking about it for days after seeing it !What a thriller !!

B000W4D94I|5.0|If you're a child of the 90s like I am, you'd know that the 90s was basically struck by the the \\"bug of disaster movies\\". Basically, movie after movie was a disaster movie most of them being brainless (yet silly nonetheless). It wasn't until \\"Twister\\" got released that there was finally a be all end all of disaster movies, and it was a summer smash. I, at 6 years old, was too young to watch it in the theatre, but I remember seeing the trailers on TV. And when it got released on VHS, my parents made a mad dash out to buy the video.<br /><br />This was one of my childhood favorites. I used to watch it a lot, even to the point where the videotape was worn out so we'd have to buy a second tape. However as I got older I hadn't seen it as much, in fact I remember the last time I saw it before back in April was when I was 9 or something. I dunno how this detachment suddenly happened, but who knows.<br /><br />Cut to April 2010. I'm in HMV to buy Avatar on blu-ray, and when I reach the \\"T\\" section, guess what movie I find? That's right, Twister. I had no idea the classic was out on  blu, and so I rushed it and Avatar to the counter to suddenly buy. It was only 7.99 too! And watching it for the first time on blu was a real nostalgic rush. Oh, the memories...<br /><br />Basically this nothing more than a cliche fest with special effects, but hey, it's done well, to the point where you're too busy having fun to even notice the cliches. It has a great cast including Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt not to mention Cary Elwes, a FANTASTIC soundtrack (I loved the usage of Tori Amos near the beginning!), tornadoes, great special effects and is overall just really fun to watch. And who could forget the scene where they are inside the tornado near the end?<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is actually very good. The video quality is pretty good, not great though- not a whole lot of depth, but at least colors are good, and Oklahoma looks pretty. The audio... holy cripe, I had to keep checking outside my window to see if there was a tornado! It is THAT good. Debris hitting the windsheild, a house rolling onto a road having been torn from its foundation, and an exploding tanker truck has never sounded so lovely before. I swear, this is THE ultimate audio experience if you want some good disaster fun.<br /><br />Overall, if you've never seen Twister, put the disc in the player, crank up that sound system of yours, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't pay attention to the negativity from people who don't know how to have fun and watch a movie. Just expect a fun filled Tornado flick, and try not to get too paranoid about tornadoes hitting your area!ere was a tornado! It is THAT good.

006123141X|2.0|The first 50 pages are about the wonderfulness of genetically modified food and coporate America, with evil eco-terrorists slaughtering people with automatic weapons.<br /><br />The plot may have developed from there but that was all I could take.<br /><br />The writing is mediocre at best.
B003O85W3A|4.0|I acually, in my opinion, like this album OVERALL better than their other two. I dont find myself dreading any song, but looking foward to the next one. I can hear the influences in some of the songs, but it didnt bother me.   Maybe the album is just hitting me at the right time, which would sway my opinion...living back in the city I grew up in, seeing how its changed, and hating it anyway. :)  I think this album is faboulous, my favorite tracks are...Roccoco and Spawl 2, if I have to pick some. Alot of the songs, but these two in piticular will stick with you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though it has nothing to do with vampires or that sort, i think its MUCH better than twilight. The Hunger Games is full of love, adventure, suspense, and characters that are hard not to love. I fell in love with this book from the first chapter! I could not put the book down! I think pretty much anyone would love this series.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I purchased my first Seiko divers watch over 30 years ago, and had to replace it only when my daughter decided that it was a fashionable item that she could wear in 2010.  I was surprised to find that the identical watch was still available for less than I paid way back when.  I bought two of the new ones, one for me and one for my son so we are all now watch buddies.  Still a great looking watch that feels rock solid and so far is keeping very accurate time.  I ordered the watches from Long Island Watch - delivered on time with no issues.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I rate this 5 stars because this is a cool little sharpener that is light wheight, fully functional, and pretty usefull when on camping/backpacking trips as well as maintaining your knifes at home! I bought this and I was suprised to see it arrive 3 days before the expected arival date but I did notice that the wraping of the actual sharpener comes in had been opened and then taped shut and then put in a box and shipped out. The sharpener wasnt damaged that I can tell I just thought it was a little strange. Overall I'd reccomend buying this because for the money you will get a lot of use out of it.

1416550550|5.0|A wonderful story that Im still thinking about days later. The story is about a woman who was found on an Australian pier when she was 4-years old. She was raised by a family that was not her own. When she is older, she tries to find out where she came from ... who her parents were. The story jumps from 3 different time periods. The early 1900s, 1975 and 2005.    I found the story to be very interesting and entertaining.
0380778556|5.0|This was a selection for our book group.  I was quite disappointed...were we really reading an ancient romance?  I then read the book, and was quite astounded.  Suffice it to say this is a great book.  This is what modern authors should strive for.  A great story with awesome characters and development.  It is not over-wordy, and the author never goes on self serving or confusing rants.  Pure entertainment with strong messages perhaps more relevant now than in 1938.  Great, great, book.
B004856SQ8|5.0|This was a great adaptation and made the story very current. The acting is over the top but that is the whole point. If you want a hilarious action movie that is just a ton of fun to watch then you must see this film!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|A great movie.  Lots of action and humor.  Great cast.  DVD doesn't indicate any outakes - - what, no outtakes? - - there should be just because of the actors.
B00005NTN5|5.0|I heard about this movie long before I ever actually got to watch it. Gina Gherson and Jennifer Tilly, are AMAZING in this movie! It was shipped fast and plays perfectly. (But, this movie is definitely NOT for children.)
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter season 3 definitely tops the first and second seasons, which were also amazing!  I didn't read anything about this season, and the season took a direction I never expected after seeing the first two episodes.  Hope it continues to get better and better...already got season 4 too, and can't wait to start them!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The Muppets are still the best. We watch this every year and the humor and wit never fail to entertain. Our family is now composed of 4 teenagers and we still delight in the catchy songs and the funny interaction between Rizzo Rat and Gonzo (aka Charles Dickens). Much of the dialogue is straight out of the book. Michael Cain did an excellent Scrooge, though a so-so singer. There's really nothing not to like about this movie. We had it previously on VHS, so when we found it on DVD, there was absolutely no doubt about getting another copy.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Rumor has it that even God was rolling in laughter at the insightful sleights leveled at the overly righteous inquisitors that are found lurking in every backyard. Witness this Pastor's line: \\"The Christian Church recognizes the existence of hell. Right below our feet, right above the Orient.\\"  For those of you who are not up on stereotypic & racially charged terms - Orient, and it's derivatives is one of those terms. Of course, the location part is funny in it's own right.   Or, this line about finding the Bible in a bookstore shelved with Twilight. Does that mean it's shelved in the popularity section and competing for attention with vampires.  Or, does it mean it's in the myth section.   Or, is it in the Biology section subcategorized under sucking-life methodologies.   But, the best line was the comment about reading 600 pages of single spaced Bible text: \\"And as every war that's ever been fought can tell you, there are many ways you can interpret it.\\" \\"Except the civil war. That was pure racism.\\"    Religious fervor aside the script and acting were top notch with expressions, gestures, insights, comebacks and retorts constantly coming at you at the highest creatively intelligent level.
B004856SQ8|4.0|I really liked this adaptation of A-Team, and the cast was very entertaining.  The plot turns were fairly predictable in spots, but is that so bad?  The time period appropriately changed to modern time, and the crew is still specializing in completing impossible missions to my delight.  This isn't a deep movie or one I could watch repeatedly but a light hearted, unrealistic flick that I thoroughly enjoyed.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I enjoyed this book... after I figured out how to read Jack's 5-year old language. It was awkward at first and even towards the end I had to use my imagination to understand what he was describing. Also, there are parts where the story drags along so I had to tough through them as well. All-in-all, it was a good read with some thought-provoking topics but I don't think it was worth the hype it has received.
B001BWQVSG|5.0|There are two incredible things about this boxed set: the quality of the music, and the price.<br /><br />I well remember the day when CDs sold for $16 each, and weren't very good.  (AKA \\"The Good Old Days\\")<br /><br />Now here we have some of the best music ever recorded, and the cost per CD works out to something like $4.  Less valuable dollars, too...<br /><br />Buy it for yourself, as a birthday or Christmas present.  You won't be sorry!
0765326353|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was a great one.  I decided to try Brandon Sanderson's books after reading his 2 co-writes of Robert Jordan's wheel of time.  Since he did a good job with those, I thought I might like his own works.  I am so glad I did.  I loved it.  I can't wait for the next book.  I don't think it will be as detailed and with as many characters as Jordan's, but I did like it on a different level.  It was different.  I liked how he took his time developing the characters and the stories.  I liked how it took about 500 pages to see how the characters and stories would blend or fit together.  I was liking them on my own and had to skip ahead a bit to continue the storyline of that character a little bit more, and then come back and continue with the book, re-reading the parts I had jumped ahead to.  It was an interesting world that Sanderson created.  A different perspective.  The shardblades were really cool too.  Neat concept.  I think you'll like this book if you are into this type of story.  Was pretty neat how it all came together in the end.  Can't wait for the next book in this series.  I am hooked.
0060557818|3.0|As a fan of dystopian literature (Brave New World and The Handmaid's Tale in particular), I was drawn to Gaiman's creation of an alternate universe beneath London. His story begins when his protagonist, Richard Mayhew, discovers a young girl on the side of the road. After bringing her to his flat and helping her get back to her world, he discovers that he no longer exists in London Above, the London he has always known. Instead, he can only be seen or heard by those living in London Below, a dank, dangerous, and unpredictable world. With the companionship of Door, the girl he aided, Richard embarks on a perilous journey to discover who hired assassins to kill Door's family and to find his way back into existence within London Above.<br /><br />Having seen this novel on many lists and read dozens of raving reviews, I expected to get sucked into Gaiman's universe, unable to leave until I finished reading. While I certainly enjoyed the novel, I read through it at a relatively leisurely pace and, until I neared the end, had little trouble putting it down. Gaiman's story is unique, darkly humorous, and at times gruesome enough to make me shudder, but I suppose it leaves something to be desired. London Below is an interesting place, but it is also confusing, maze-like, and definitely an underdeveloped part of the story. While at times it exists in the sewers, literally beneath London, most of the time it is more of a parallel world to London, containing the same places in another dimension. Perhaps this was Gaiman's intent--to leave the world hanging in between London and a complete parallel universe--but it tends to make the novel a bit confusing. What I did enjoy, however, was Gaiman's use of real places--particularly tube stations--within the world of London Below, giving backstory and meaning to strange station names like Earl's Court, which, in London Below, truly houses an earl with his court.<br /><br />Although certain aspects of the plotline were predictable, it had many interesting twists (and Richard's sheer ignorance) to keep it away from the overused hero's journey movie plotline. But unfortunately, by the end of the book I did not feel that I really knew the characters, beyond Richard's whininess and very slow ability to comprehend all that happened to him. While I certainly enjoyed the novel, I could not say that it \\"blew me away\\" or that it had any lasting impression on me. Perhaps it is one of those books that require a rereading to pick up on all of the little details and references, but I doubt that I will reread it.<br /><br />All in all, I do not regret reading Neverwhere and would recommend it fans of fantasy, dark humor, and Neil Gaiman.had many interesting twists (and Richard's sheer ignorance) to keep it away from the overused hero's journey movie plotline.

0743298039|4.0|With many twists and turns, Setterfield keeps you going throughout the novel. Though I found the bits of story about the narrator to be a bit weird and perhaps unnecessary, the main plotline--the real story within the story--is great. Whenever I thought I knew what was going on, something else came up that changed my perspective entirely, keeping me on my toes.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|One of the worst tools I have used. The \\"diamond rod\\" is rough and ineffective.The carbide bits are duller than ones I bought at WalMart over 15 years ago. The ceramics are okay but just so.  I have sharpened edged tools and weapons for 20 years, and this is my opinion.
0143118420|4.0|I enjoyed Gilbert's story, and found her descriptions of the people she met and the cultures she was immersed in very interesting. I particularly liked learning about Bali, which I had known nothing about prior to reading this. Gilbert did get a little...whiny, I suppose, at times, but I didn't mind that too much. For a fun, relatable travelogue, I think Eat, Pray, Love is worth a read.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I really liked the scene where he downloaded the Viking language and it was actually pretty painful. Not sure why the executives seemed to have slashed the budget in post production. I don't think the creature was fully realized. In other words, it seems they felt the film would not be a blockbuster so cut the CGI budget and opted for a cheaper version of the alien?

B0047CN1MG|5.0|I was late to the party as far as Fringe is concerned. I don't watch TV series but this program was recommended by my daughter, so I bought the first two seasons on Blu-ray and my wife and I became hooked even though the first season took a while to ramp up. Having caught up to the third season I knew that I couldn't wait for the Blu-ray release in the Fall so I started buying episodes on Amazon to catch up. I purchased and downloaded this episode to my HTPC and played it later in the evening. Using Amazon's \\"Unbox\\" setup the file played flawlessly with great color, contrast and sound. Recommended.

I have a new appreciation for Julia Childs and her talent.  Sometimes a few of the items are hard to find, but the most are easily found at your local grocery store.  I have made a few of the recipes and they were really good.  You will get a new understanding of how to put things together.  I love it.  Thank you so much.

B003UESJFG|5.0|I've always loved Dreamworks Movies, with Monsters VS Aliens, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon being the best of the bunch. But Dreamworks has reached a new level of awesome with Megamind.    The movie is not only hilarious and entertaining, but it also has a lot of emotion. There are scenes where you really feel for the main character. You relate to him, everyone can relate to being pushed into becoming something you didn't want to be. All the characters are strong and not annoying at all. The action is superb, and I am so getting this on Blu-Ray because the animation is just great! You can tell Dreamworks has come a long way since Shrek. The relationship between Megamind and Roxanne (the female lead) is funny and sweet at the same time. I love everything about this movie, and I don't think I can find anything wrong with it if I tried. Critics may say it's predicable and cliched, but there are a few twists thrown in that even I didn't expect. This movie, like Megamind, is something special :)    The lesson \\"Choose your own Destiny\\" shines through in this movie, and it's great for both kids and adults. I would definitely by the Blu-Ray dvd (comes with a mini movie and a ton of extras) or at least buy the single disc. This movie is just great, and everyone who loves animated movies, superhero movies, or just loves having a good time will love this movie.    Good job Dreamworks, keep it up! (and if it's possible, PLEASE make a sequel!)

B0021L8V0M|4.0|Evelyn Salt isn't your fancy, high-kicking heroine. She does whatever it takes to get the job done. She doesn't give an ef about style points. In combat, her application of Muay Thai and Krav Maga allows her to dispose of her opponents directly and viciously and often permanently. Evelyn Salt is a highly skilled, highly lethal CIA operative. When she's set up and fingered as a Russian sleeper agent, her immediate concern is for her husband's safety. Evelyn Salt goes on the lam, and so re-enforces the accusation placed against her. The CIA goes on the warpath. But so does Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />Decades out of relevance, the Cold War strikes again. Somewhere, John Le Carr&eacute; and Robert Ludlum are smiling. SALT is an engrossing espionage thriller and so twisty it had me half-convinced that I'm a Russian mole. It's not long before you start questioning Evelyn Salt's every move. Who is Evelyn Salt? What's her true agenda? Where is her allegiance? You don't learn for certain until deep into the film, when Salt is put in a position to prevent a nuclear holocaust... or trigger it.<br /><br />This is old hat for Angelina Jolie. Her mojo is such that she carries the film effortlessly. I'm not even that surprised to learn that SALT, in its early stages, intended to feature Tom Cruise as \\"Evan Salt.\\" Jolie belongs to an elite club. She's one of those very few actresses who is sexy, can act, and do some serious buttkicking. Off the top of my head, there are Jolie, Yeoh, Jovovich, Hamilton, and Weaver - and all have presence. Jolie has great acting chops. She commits to her role, not only tonally, but physically. Although, fine, I don't think she quite pulls off her disguise as a Russian officer. Still, it's an impressive sight watching a seriously pisssed Salt embark on a killing spree. Let me say, though, that it's just really wrong how, from the back seat of a speeding car, a captive Salt remote controls the cop driver thru rampant application of her taser (and yet I couldn't stop laughing). And like Yeoh and Jovovich, Jolie relishes performing her own stunts, so she's no wilting lily. Speaking of stunts, the most spectacular one involves Salt's various insane leaps onto the roofs of various trucks criss-crossing on the freeways. My jaw got all agape.<br /><br />Don't mean to dis the menfolk. Liev Schreiber lends gravitas as Salt's CIA friend and colleague who reluctantly joins in the (wo)man hunt. Dude is a good actor and makes a good foil for Jolie. Meanwhile, Chiwetel Ejiofor - playing a by-the-books government agent - becomes the Tommy Lee Jones to Jolie's Harrison Ford. SALT is more action-packed than it is cerebral. More BOURNE IDENTITY than THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. And with the cliffhanger ending positioning SALT to be another film franchise for Jolie, it looks like Tom Cruise made a booboo opting out.ldn't stop laughing).

B001DPC52C|5.0|This was my first CD & DVD from within Temptation.  I really liked the music and the live performance DVD was Great!!!!!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This DVD was a life-enriching experience.  It portrayed a woman who not only made the best of her disadvantages but managed to overcome them.  She didn't stop being autistic - but she learned to cope and to understand what she DID have to offer was of exceptional value.  The story of her life is inspiring as it teaches us the value of persistence, soul-expanding as we examine our own reactions to those around us, and the most dramatic moment of all for me was when she perceived her Creator's love.  The movie is in no way religious but it reveals great insight for common everyday living.    And the story reveals the many people along the way that helped her become what she is - simple acts of kindness extended that we can all do in our own lives with those around us - and yet what a magnificent difference they can make.  The mother too is an inspiration via her loving persistence, fraught with sadness and a struggle to understand, but ultimately victorious in seeing her child become a happy fulfilled human being of much service to her fellowman as well as the animal creation.      For me it was eye-opening in another manner as I started life in much the same state as she. But by looking thru her eyes I was able to comprehend why others respond to me in ways that at times feel so disappointing. And never will I forget the mother's motto - \\"different but not less.\\"  This is a DVD that you will watch many times and enjoy sharing.

0240816250|5.0|I am in film photography for 10 years and I was always looking for an advanced book like this. If you are a beginner the book may not be for you, but if you want to progress and want to have an idea of what is possible in film photography this is the book. Of course it does not replace practice , but  you have an excellent  starting point with all the technical explanations  for example on how to customize the film speed and development in order to get the \\"best\\" negative for printing, on how to do masking and unsharp masks to get a better control over the tonal values and on how to make a digital negative for contact printing, thus mixing the digital and analog worlds as well as a whole bunch more of topics covered in the book.  I can only be grateful to the authors that despite the digital tsunami having taken place since 2003, they had the courage to undergo this project and publish this book, maybe very technical and very scientific, but a great source of information for every analog/film enthusiast, as well as a joy to read. Film photography may have become a niche product, but it is still not dead as witness the thousands of [...] members and this book is an invaluable and comprehensive  resource for every film photographer and maybe some digital photographers too.
1423113381|4.0|Tired of those typical historical and fantasy books?  Well then, if you are like me, you should try reading the Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan.            Sadie is a 12-year-old girl who is angry with her life and her father who travels the world and spends only two days with her a year.  She has a strong personality and always tries to do what she wants.  She was separated from him and her brother when her mother died when she was six.  From that point on she was raised by her grandparents and lived with her cat Muffin in London.  Sadie lived a regular life and went to a regular public school.     Carter, the brother of Sadie is a 14-year- old boy who travelled with his dad all over the world and is home schooled by him.  Carter's father Julius is an Egyptologist but has some sort of magical power Carter is does not know about.  He is more formal and he is always well dressed.  Carter's personality is not as strong as Sadie's and they do not get along well.   As the story goes along, Carter and Sadie change. Sadie becomes less bitter and learns how to admire and respect her older brother Carter more.  She also understands why her father and mother had to risk their lives by freeing Bast-- the Egyptian god of cats and Osiris-- god of the dead.  She realizes her fate which is to be a magician and accepted the responsibilities that come with it.     Carter changed too he became a braver and stronger person.  Just like Sadie, Carter learns that he needed to accept being a magician and all the difficulties and hardships that came with it.  He also learns how to trust himself and build his self confidence and his sister more.   The antagonist of the story is the Egyptian god named set who is the ruler of chaos.   In the story he tries to create the largest storm ever know to destroy the entire North America.  He needs to do this by creating a red pyramid in Phoenix and entomb Osiris, who uses the form of their father.  To get close the kids as possible, he disguises himself as their uncle Amos who is suppose to take care of them.  With their powers and some help from friends, Sadie and Carter will challenge him.   The climax of the story is when Sadie and Carter have to defeat Set and stop him from completing his pyramid which will give him the power for the storm.  This will occur during the \\"demon days\\"-- the birthdays of the five main gods at the end of the year ( more specifically on December 29, Sets birthday).   But to get to this point our two main characters had to go through a lot of training.     Personally, my favorite part was when Carter and Sadie were able to fool Sekhmet--the goddess of war who was trying to obliterate them.  When she was chasing them they lead her into a salsa factory where she was tricked into drinking the salsa which she thought was blood.  After that she dozed off she turned into her other form Hathor, the goddess of love.   The part that shocked me the most was when Sadie was about to destroy Set by reading from a spell book.  Sadie realized that destroying Set was not what she needed to do.  The real danger was Apophis--the giant snake that could destroy the world.  Sadie understood that if they used Set's powers, they could destroy Apophis so she let Set go.  I think that this is a very wise act because she saw the real danger and instantly knew what to do.   The theme of this story is good always triumphs over evil and destruction.  This story also reflects the values of a family and how people sacrifice for one another.   This is shown in the relationship between Carter and Sadie.  At the start they were very different and could hardly relate to each other, but in the end after all that they'd been through Sadie and Carter learned how to cooperate and work together.           The story is told in the first person through two different perspectives-- Carter's and Sadie's.  While Carter makes the story sound serious and dramatic, Sadie tells it in a quirky fashion.  She is sarcastic andfunny, especially when she describes people.  Over all the story is exciting and there is always action which persuades the reader to keep reading.  The endings of chapters influence you to read more to find out what is going to happen next.   I would recommend this book to fourth graders up to young adults because it is very heart warming and portrays moral choices and yet is very easy to understand.   It is a great book and I hope you like it.

While waiting over the years,we've all seen tons of unseen footage from this on UTUBE. I certainly expected this to be a 2 disc set,add 10 dollars and give the fans something more,footage and interviews.What we receieved was a Colonel Parker re-release of the the same material. Regardless of this,it is a must have for Elvis fans!!! I rate this 5 stars for Elvis and his original performance,but lower for overall repackaging.

The one song I tend to skip over is Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum, but I must have listened to the rest of the album about 100 times. He does have a greatest hits album I like as much. I find that his recent stuff doesn't seem to be as original or shocking as his 60s stuff, but I like it better in general and certainly reflects a more mature point of view.
B001USHRCK|5.0|This lego village is one of the best lego sets.it is extremely detailed and has lots of neat features.  Some which include a water wheel for the blacksmith shop and two fireplaces.  Lots of windows that open and lots of cool little pieces like a seller's stand and a cow that can pull a buggy with hay in it.  Just be sure not to lose any pieces because there aren't really any extra pieces in this set. But, you will not be disappointed even for the price tag on it!
006109594X|3.0|As someone who finds almost all crime/suspense fiction today unreadable, I was satisfied with this book, which kept me occupied for two days when I needed such occupation. Yes, it has flaws, but it also avoids the typical, disqualifying flaws of today's popular fiction: it's not loaded up distracting and irrelevant detail (though it does have some details that slow things up a bit at times); and it is not oversensationalized. The story develops in a way that keeps you interested, the plot twists are believable and can be followed, and the naval details, such as the almost superhuman skill it would require to take a submarine underwater through the Bosporus, are absorbing and realistic.     Here are some of the book's major flaws:    1. The author doesn't explain how Benjamin Adnam could have been on the Russian sub giving orders to the captain every step of the way without the crew knowing about his presence and therefore knowing that they were not on some top secret mission for the Russian navy, as their captain had told them, but were under the command of an English speaking foreigner of unknown nationality.    2. No U.S. president would absorb an unprovoked peacetime attack destroying an aircraft carrier and killing twice as many servicemen as the number who died at Pearl Harbor without waging war on the country that launched the attack. The idea that the president would be satisfied merely with sinking the sub that carried out the attack is absurd.     3. It is unbelievable that the terrorist submarine takes 2 1/2 months to get from the Arabian Sea, where it performed the attack, to South America, allowing the protaganists lots of extra weeks to do their researches.    4. After the test-passing through the Bosporus is carried out, which was the President's condition for treating the destruction of the carrier as an enemy attack and launching a global search for the culprits, the whereabouts of the culprits are suddenly dropped into his hands, meaning that the whole Bosporus test, which occupies a good part of the book, was unnecessary plot-wise.     5. I agree with the hostile reviewer who points out that the book portrays every military character as a Red State conservative superman.     Still, despite these and other flaws, the book was an absorbing, intelligent, and satisfactory read.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|I received this collector's edition as a Christmas gift and being an Avatar fan, I watched the collector's extended cut immediately. I was rewarded with more depth and answers to little questions I had from the first movie. No spoilers here so I won't go into it.     I was very happy when I discovered that there was a family friendly audio track (the collector's extended cut doesn't have it, but the other two versions of the movie that are included do). My daughter had been driving me crazy with her requests to watch Avatar, but we didn't feel like the language (of which there is very little in the first place) was appropriate. Problem solved. That's worth 5 stars right there for me.    If you liked the theatrical version, you'll love the collector's edition. The family friendly audio track makes this a must have for parents that are concerned with objectionable language.
B00125WAWS|5.0|I chose this movie to be viewed by students in my speech class (public speaking). They were emotional, although it wasn't my intent, but it was to make them (a class of mexican women) culturally and ethnically aware of things other races from earlier generations had to endure. Excellent movie!

You can't go wrong with this book.  If your child loves Legos then your child will love this book.  It is great that they give extra stickers in the back.
B000006FVE|5.0|Excellent film!  Great production values well depicted in the black & white format, which is exactly what was needed to convey the message of this movie.  Every single performance is top-rated - each role perfectly cast and acted.  Don't pass this one up - it belongs at the top of your \\"must see\\" list.  Lancaster, Douglas and March give superb dramatic performances that should not be missed.

I'm not about to give this collection's secrets away, that's half the fun of this deluxe collection, but I can tell you that it was great to find the secrets.

B0046MOVD0|3.0|First if you enjoyed the previous Resident Evil movies then you will probably enjoy this one as well.  Likewise if you hated them, then there is nothing new in this one that will change your mind.  This movie for the most part suffers like most sequels; the fact they are not as good as the one before.  The same is true with this movie.  I enjoyed it and do not regret buying it, but it does suffer in the fact it was obviously made for 3D and I bought the 2D version.  Don't get me wrong I have enjoyed 3D movies, but this movie seemed to be one Matrix-like bullet time scene after another connected by brief segments of story.  This movie would have been better with a few less of these bullet time scenes and the money spent on authors to develop the characters.  As for suspense, I found there to be very little.  It was all too predictable.  It does setup the inevitable sequel during the closing credits.  Let's hope they spend the money on writers and move closer to the quality of the first and even second one in the series.  For the first time Resident Evil viewer, do yourself a favor and watch them in order, the first one is the best of the series and the second and third weren't bad and then watching this one will be easier to take.    As to my rating, I can't give it 5 stars that would be Gone with the Wind like and this wasn't.  I would give it 3 and a half but that's not a choice.  I gave it 3 because of the poor execution of the Blu-Ray.  At least in my player you had to watch two Sony commercials and then several trailers totaling over 8 minutes.  During this time my player's menu and chapter advance buttons were not operative.  Fortunately I could fast forward, but that still took time.  I strongly object to being forced to watch commercials on disks I have bought and I will think twice before buying another Sony Pictures disk.

1582701709|5.0|This book totally changed my view of life positively. I recommend this book for everyone who wants to find unlimited happiness in life. I used to be serious and stress in whatever I plan to do. After I read this book, I felt delightful, happiness, hope, encouragement, and love everyday ^O^. I want many people to read this book and create a new world with peace ^O^.
0393316041|5.0|This book is so very charming and enthralling. I could not put it down until I finished the whole book. I was captivated by Feynman's incredible imagination, incessant questioning, cleverness, and his dissatisfaction with anything less then the correct answer. You will be laugh with delight at his antics and some of his life experiences as well as being thought provoked on some aspects of life which the normal person gives no thought to, but when seen through Mr. Feynman's eyes, gives new perspective.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|i loved the movie,and wanted to listen to the music over and over, so i purchased the sound track,, love hearing it in the car and some times take it into the house, for more,, great to drive with as it has so many different sounds on each segment..

B000000WJ2|5.0|Simply the greatest Stones-relates LP since Exile. I have no idea why this didn't sell truck loads.     More muscular than Talk is Cheap and voice in fine fettle, it's all still there: the space, the funk, gospel, reggae, Chuck Berry, Hi, Motown, open tunings and drone, Memphis and above all The Blues, The Weaving and The Roll.     I'd love to hear a real weep-into-your-beer country LP, covers would be fine from the classics to the newer greats like Richmond Fontaine's brilliant Post to Wire.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I bought Genius Love Company after watching a Biography Channel special on Ray Charles. The film included footage of Ray Charles making this final album. Listening to the album fulfilled the promise that the film implied. This is Ray and Friends singing covers of major popular tunes.
B00267N3DQ|2.0|I would say this is not really a blu-ray.  The disc is blu-ray, but the quality is not up to par with the other Disney classics that have been converted to blu-ray.  I also noticed a similar product in actual blu-ray packaging (one in a clear blue box, like all the blu-rays). This one came in a DVD box.  Oh, and it's not widescreen.  I'm curious to know if the one in the actual blu-ray packaging is the same quality.
1401310400|3.0|With all the hype of this meta tie in, it's a readable story in concept. However, at least the mass market paperpack is using a painfully small font. Whether the reason was creative or economical, it's taken me three times as long to read as I'd expected as I keep having to put it down because of eye strain.  The font is painfully tiny, even for this avid reader.  And the gutter (that margin by the binding) is very small, making it very hard to read the ends of lines.  So buyer beware, unless you have better than normal vision, you might want to have a magnifying glass on hand when you read it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I loved this film when I saw it in the theater (my personal favorite of 2010).  This is a richly complex film that requires several viewings and you will pick up new details with each viewing.  So I was excited to purchase the Blu-ray version as soon as it was released.  The visual and audio quality of the Blu-ray is outstanding.  This is a film I will enjoy many times.  I was equally looking forward to the extra features, but was disappointed by what was available in the Two-Disc Edition.  Nolan's last DVD release (The Dark Knight) had an outstanding amount of \\"behind the scenes\\" content and I was hoping to find the same with this film.   However (and this is a BIG \\"however\\"), I was not able to access the BD-Live content (my connection seems to be down).  So that content may be available once I fix my BD-Live connection problem.
0393327655|5.0|Because of this book I am no longer a christian. This book should come with a warning though. Because becoming an atheist means having your reality flip upside down. And this can be a very difficult process.   I have read this book multiple times. bought it in paperback and audio CD. Every time I read it I discover something more. My favorite part is at the very end. Sam Harris discusses rational mysticism. This is controversial among atheist. But Sam does not try to cater to atheist. Rather he challenges you. Sam if your reading this, please write a book on rational mysticism.

B002ZG993Q|3.0|The American features George Clooney and an excellent unknown European cast, but the screenplay has been stripped of backstory, context, and most of the things that a viewer needs to care about a film.  I'm guessing the filmmaker despises films that are full of out of context exposition (the kind of dialogue that is ridiculed in the animated \\"The Incredibles\\"  - where villains monologue rather than doing away with their foe, giving the hero time to counter-attack and get away from the villain.)  \\"The American\\" moves along without exposition.  I don't mind if a movie requires me to use my own intelligence and imagination to \\"fill in the missing parts\\", but this film doesn't add enough to make it clear that it is worth my time to do so.<br /><br />Clooney plays Jack... or perhaps Edward.  We're shown that he is a skilled killer, and that \\"the Swedes\\" are on his trail.  Jack answers to Pavel, played by Johan Leysen, but we're not told or shown why, or Pavel's place in the universe.  Are they mercenaries?  Spies affiliated with governments?  Corporate or mafia hitmen?  We don't know.  We only know \\"Jack\\" is a bad dude, and Pavel is his boss.<br /><br />Jack goes from undercover in Sweden to Italy, where he hides out in Abruzzo, one of those scenic medieval towns built into the side of a mountain.  He is befriended by Paolo Bonacelli as Father Benedetto, a priest who knows when a man has something to hide.  The Father has secrets of his own.<br /><br />Relationships  are deadly disasters for Jack, and Pavel warns him not to make any friends in his new hideout.  \\"I thought you had learned that by now,\\" Pavel admonishes Jack after a lady friend dies in Jack's wake in an early scene.<br /><br />Jack tries to comply, making human contact only with the Priest and Prostitutes.  He tells a hooker \\"you don't have to act for me - I'm here for my pleasure, not yours.\\"<br /><br />Pavel sends an emissary with a new job for Jack - to build an assassin's weapon with a silencer, the range of a rifle and the speed of a machine gun.  These scenes were superficially interesting, but without context narrative tension is not generated.  Jack doesn't care what the gun will be used for - only that he has the assignment.  Since he didn't seem to care - I didn't either.<br /><br />It is worth mentioning that Violante Placido is good as Clara, a prostitute who doesn't know about Jack's life.  Clara seems to become genuinely interested in Jack, but since assassins are sent one after another to kill Jack, you share Jack's paranoia that Clara may only be an employee of Jack's nameless enemies.<br /><br />The actual narrative tension is generated because Jack, with a job that absolutely cannot allow human relationships, is only human.  In his world everyone is suspect - someone who could possibly have been sent to kill him.  Can Jack find love?  With the rest of the movie so coldly methodical it is worth asking: do we care?e gun.

B0041T52S6|4.0|This video came in fast and had no problem with the seller. The only thing I did not like about this item is that it had a \\"Rental\\" sticker on the DVD. This was a gift to someone for Christmas and I felt embarrased that I gave them a Rental copy of this movie. I wish it had been noted in the description because I would have bought this item from another seller.
076535618X|3.0|\\"The Last Colony\\" was a little disappointing to me, which is pretty much how I felt about \\"The Ghost Brigades\\".  Nice enough ideas, but sloppy execution, spotty writing, and terse dialogue bring it down.  There's also a very large plot point that suddenly gets dropped off with no further mention or elaboration, quite odd.  In spite of its shortcomings, it's still a fairly enjoyable read, just don't come in with high expectations (though the ending was pretty nice, and I don't mean that in a sarcastic way).      Anyway, I highly recommend \\"Old Man's War\\" (the first book in the series), it's quite excellent and is far superior to the sequels, I might actually read it again someday.  \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" and \\"The Last Colony\\" are pretty flat and feel like rush-jobs and simply aren't up to par with the original novel, but they aren't necessarily bad either and are a decent enough way to kill some time.  I won't be reading \\"Zoe's Tale\\" so I can't comment on that, I'm just not interested in re-reading this same story from another point of view.  For more discerning readers: Stick to \\"Old Man's War\\" and ignore the sequels.  For everyone else: The sequels are worth a look if you just can't get enough of the series, just don't get your hopes up too much.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|I bought this for my Kindle having found it under \\"Literary Fiction\\" at the Kindle store. It is definitely not literary. The writing is repetitive, the main characters are weakly drawn, there's way too much summary, little first-person action...and it's just implausible in so many ways. It's obvious this writer never took an undergrad writing workshop.     At the end of the book, characters do things that are out of character and there is absolutely zero subtext, which I consider the hallmark of \\"Big L\\" Literature. I keep hearing how the white girl considers the slaves to be family and visa versa, but little is done beyond superficial cliche to show how that is true. Too much tell, too little show.    So much more could have been done to draw parallels and distinctions between indentured servants and black slaves. This would be a great topic for a more developed writer.
B002ZG981E|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever!  With a great cast, fast paced action, in depth story, this is the type of movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of because you realize things that you didn't realize before the first time watching!  I absolutely loved the extras on the BD, especially the making of the film and Christopher Nolan's commentaries.  It is mind blowing how he was able to create such a magnificent film with a budget of $160M.  The zero gravity scene is still one of my favorites because he didn't have to use any CGI!  He is truly this generation's genius Director, a hybrid between Stephen Spielberg's story telling and Michael Bay's action sequences, with Nolan's extremely clever plot twists.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|I still havent finished the 8 discs yet but I love this purchase..it is a real collector's edition.. Now, I can watch the older versions of this movie up to the latest..With the price, it's worth spending... I strongly recommend this for purchase. You won't regret.

037571457X|5.0|This book was a heartbreakingly funny portrait of a young girl growing up in Iran. The drawings are simple and easy to digest, the dialog is also simple but very witty and insightful. This is not your typical graphic novel, but it is wonderful. I highly recommend this to any graphic novel fan, or to anyone who wants to learn more about middle eastern (Islamic) culture.
B001DLWF8U|2.0|Primary theme: Pursuing some knowledge can be devastating.<br /><br />This movie is a dark and depressing experience.<br /><br />I think the movie \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" explored the same theme but in an enlightening way.
B003PIUC02|5.0|They overdid the blood - the viewer gets the violence and devalued human-life of gladiatorial contests and environment without additional giant CGI sprays of blood. The predominance of nudity and sex seems gratuitous until you consider Rome and its culture at this time. Well done! Gutsy production! Good acting, great writing, and incredible period sets and costumes. All add value to this based-on-truth story. You'll like it; except for the blood perhaps... we get it...
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Very different from his previous albums; but, definitely his best work to date.  Not one song on this album is just \\"okay\\", much less a \\"dislike.\\"  The singer-musician has expanded into an artist-composer - what a wonderful debut!  Looking forward to many more works of amazing quality in the years to come.
B001R60ESE|5.0|I'm an AV fiend. A small portion of this BD was demo'd on an LED TV/Surround Sound System display at a local   Best Buy Store. And, I was captivated by Chris Botti's performance that was on screen. What can I say:   a) Accompanied by the Boston Pops Orchestra; b) Fantastic HD video of concert and c) in awesome surround sound.  Of course, this all would not have been possible if it wasn't for the Audio/Video System that I was viewing/listening to, at the time. [I noted the name of the BD Title/Artist, looked it up on Amazon and ordered it]  Mr. Botti's guest performers (Katharine McPhee, Lucia Micarelli, Sting, Josh Groban, Yo-Yo Ma, John Mayer and  others) contribute to this phenomenal (concert in my home)viewing experience.

B0041T52S6|5.0|When I went to see this movie the first time, I went in totally cold, not really knowing anything about Scott Pilgrim at all, except that it was based on some comic books I had never heard of.  After reading the books and 12 viewings later, I am absolutly in love with this series.  This movie has a lot of what Hollywood movies have been missing recently.  While a lot of recent main stream movies have been remakes, sequels, or based off tired characters we've seen a million times, Scott Pilgrim is totally fresh in that it's not afraid to be original.  It even holds up great to repeat viewings, as you will notice a lot of different small jokes every time you watch it.  My only real complaints with the movie itself are with the second half.  After some great character development in the first half, after Evil Ex number 3, the movie goes from one ex to the the next with very little in between, totally glancing over exes five and six, who don't even get any lines.  Although, even with that said, it isn't enough to detract from how good the first half and final act are.  My other complaint that I do have is with the DVD.  Okay I get that they want us to buy Blu-Ray players, but why do we have to get totally jipt on the special features.  I mean at least give us a 2 disk version.  Don't get me wrong, the special features on this DVD are great, the commentaries are each worth the price of the movie by themselves, but this DVD has less than half the special features that the Blu-Ray has.  As someone who is going to stick with the DVD format until they stop making them, I think that putting so few special features on the DVD version is an injustice.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I don't consider myself political, but this movie really gets me angry.  There is something very wrong with the way the big corporations (Monsanto, Tyson, etc) are making money.  Not only are animals mistreated, but we as human beings are as well.  Watch the movie and get involved!  The only way we can make a change is by demanding it with our wallets.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Loved this CD, she has such a beautiful voice and I appreciated the wide variety of musical pieces that were chosen for it.  What more can I say, it was beautiful and we listened to it in the car and at home all holiday season.  I wish all my music purchases were this perfect.
B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|For starters, I'm very surprised to see all the 5 stars that this album has gotten.   Clearly people either: A.) bought into the reviews (someone at Pitchfork is going to need to be surgically removed from Kanye's rear-end) and are making themselves seem \\"cool\\" by liking it, or B.) they don't have a broad/diverse enough musical palette to know better.   Musically, this album is a 5-star record for sure.   It is very well produced, catchy, interesting, and certainly ahead of it's time.   Once the lyrics start, this record drops down to a single star.   If Kanye could just keep his mouth shut, he'd be on to something.   Each time I listen to it (and I do listen to it) I find myself cringing at bunch of parts.  Am I just too uptight?   Hardly.   It just sounds so......sophomoric.   If you asked a horny 15 year old boy to write about anything he wanted, this is what he'd come up with.  It just seems sooooo unnecessary.   Is there supposed to be \\"art\\" in there somewhere?   One example ---- the Chris Rock bit at the end of \\"Blame Game.\\"   I think Chris Rock is great, but this is not his funniest bit (and it's 2 minutes long, urgh).   After I heard it once, I had heard it enough.  Now each time that song plays and that part comes on, I have to flip to the next song.    And you will too.   Make sure you have easy access to your mp3 player.    And Pitchfork thinks that's a perfect 10?   Wow....
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This is a very good movie for adults and/or children, I don't really like cartoons that much and this movie was very entertaining for me, well done.
B004C3DLJS|3.0|I love Pixar movies, I really do. They are full of charm and wit and the animation is always stunning, and remains stunning even years after original release. But something has never sat right with me about the Toy Story movies, especially the sequels. I think I've finally hit it on the nose, though. These movies are tantamount to consumerist propaganda, tapping into our most basic wants and needs and it's being shown to children. Children are growing up with the idea that their toys are PRECIOUS and even if you lose them or donate them or whatever they'll always try to come back to you because they NEED your love. Our toys need us as much as we need them? Sure, it's a charming premise but it's actually kind of a dangerous ideal to implant in young minds when you really think about it. I've a friend who says that her daughter, upon watching Toy Story 3, actually resisted when her mom wanted to donate some of her toys to charity because in the movie toys who get donated are miserable. In fact, donating a toy is pretty much the WORST thing you could do, according to Toy Story 3, which they hardly redeem in the ending.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is an onslaught of depressing imagery around loss and abandonment. The Big Baby was once innocent and stopped giving a crap to the point where she was ragged and almost inhuman in her movements (like the scene where she was on the swing, staring blankly at the sky, without hope). Most of the movie centers around the sickeningly loyal protagonists being pretty much tortured by sinister toys all around them.<br /><br />TERRIFYING.<br /><br />We already have such an emotional attachment to objects and toys, which is one of the reasons Toy Story relates so well. And the movies reinforce this feeling by showing us a world where our toys are just as loyal and caring as we anthropomorphize them to be. But is this a positive concept to reinforce? Shouldn't we be reinforcing the thought that interpersonal relationships are more important than material ones? Isn't this just aiding in our bred-and-born inherent need to consume objects because they provide Great Meaning(tm) to our lives, or am I just CRAZY.ones? Isn't this just aiding in our bred-and-born inherent need to consume objects because they provide Great Meaning(tm) to our lives, or am I just CRAZY.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|When I first downloaded this to my kindle I didn't read any of the reviews or even the book description.  I saw what the rating was and thought I'd give it a try.  I think that not knowing what the story was about made it more intriguing.  I was hooked from the very beginning.  It took me two days to read it and was at first disappointed in the ending.  However, after thinking about it the past few days, I believe that the book finished the way it should have.      I am glad that I chose to download Room:  A Novel.      Bravo!!!  Wonderful book.
B003KGBISY|5.0|This is certainly one of the greatest films ever made, considered by many to be Kurosawa's greatest. A village of hapless farmers in 16th century Japan has been raided by a band of outlaws. In the opening scenes we see the outlaws ride to a hilltop overlooking the village. They decide to return shortly when the barley has ripened to conduct another raid.    The bandits have been overheard by a villager, who returns to the village to tell his neighbors about the imminent threat to their livelihood. They are in despair. Finally they decide to consult the village patriarch, and a delegation of men go to seek him out.    The old man tells them to hire samurai (apparently this was unprecedented in this historical period. Kurosawa may have heard or read of an anomalous incident, which gave him the idea for the story). The men protest that samurai wouldn't work for food alone. \\"Find hungry samurai,\\" is the old man's counsel.    A group of villagers is dispatched to go in search of samurai. Eventually they find a ronin, Kambei (Takashi Shimura) who is sympathetic with their cause and proves his mettle by rescuing a child who is being held hostage by a thief. This is a powerful sequence in which Kambei shaves his head to disguise himself as a priest, overpowers and kills the thief.    Kambei undertakes to recruit six more samurai. They include the young disciple Katsuhiro Okamoto (played by Ko Kimura); a clownish (but effective) figure, kikuchiyo (played by Toshiro Mifune) and the master swordsman Kyuzo  (Seiji Miyaguchi).    The assembled band of men heads to the village, only to find it seemingly deserted, the streets empty. The villagers have hidden inside their houses in fear of the samurai. Kikuchiyo berates them for their cowardice and lack of gratitude, and eventually they come out of hiding to interact with the samurai. One of the villagers has forced his unwilling daughter to cut her hair short and wear a boy's clothing, but she is later discovered by Katsuhiro andfalls in love with him.    Impatient for action, the samurai decide to go on the offensive. They ride to the bandits' camp, set the compound on fire and slaughter several of the bandits as they are fleeing. One of the villagers who has accompanied the samurai sees his wife, who was taken prisoner by the bandits and made their concubine.    From this point on, action dominates the film. The bandits launch several raids, each time being repelled and losing several of their number. In a final raid, less than half of them remain. In a bloody battle all are killed, along with all but three of the remaining samurai. The villagers rejoice, while Kambei reflects that \\"it is these villagers who are the winners, not us.\\"    Seven Samurai represents perhaps the pinnacle  of Kurosawa's genius--the genius of a filmmaker who stands at the top rank of world directors, a director who was inspired to take on Shakespeare and Dostoevsky. The pace never flags, action building relentlessly to the powerful climax. Characters are superbly drawn, and consummately acted by a stellar cast including many of Kurosawa's regulars (Mifune, Shimura, Miyaguchi). A favorite of American directors, including Steven Spielberg, Seven Samurai inspired the (vastly inferior) Magnificent Seven. Three hours long with an intermission midway through, Seven Samurai will keep you riveted to your seat. Don't miss this one.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|I thought this was an incredibly entertaining movie, and I was impressed that they were willing to expose the diamond industry for what it is.  Highly recommend.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine is full of characters. Most of which have less than 5 minutes of screen time. The cast includes: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth, Kevin Durand (LOST) as Blob, Dominic Monaghan as Bolt, Taylor Kitsch as Gambit, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, and Tim Pocock as Cyclops. Plus many many more.    But like I said most characters are a fleeting guest. This movie revolves around Wolverine vs Sabertooth vs William Stryker. An officer who is trying to \\"build\\" a team of super-humans. I quote the term build because it's a plot device. I don't want to spoil the film if you haven't seen it.    The movie shows Sabretooth and Wolverine to be related. They both survive multiple wars until they are recruited by Stryker.    Things have a way of going bad and Wolverine quits.    Flash forward a few years and someone is killing off the team of super-humans on Stryker's team.    But there's more to Stryker than building a team.    This film has some cussing in it. The violence is PG-13 which means there's hardly any blood (if any). There's no sexual content except for a scene with Wolverine and his girlfriend? resting in bed.    X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a good summer eye-candy flick. Some of the diehard fans of certain characters won't be happy with what was done to their favorites, but I thought it was a fun film.    Be sure to stick around after the credits for a short scene.
B0048IMZMG|1.0|This cd is a big disappointment in comparison to Taylor's earlier music. Although I do have to admit I like Mine and Back to December, the other songs have no flow and honestly she just comes off whiney....Thank goodness I didn't pay for this cd or this review would have come off more resentful.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|This is my first amp for headphones and it does what it suppose to do well.  I'm currently using it for d2000 and seems to power it sufficiently.  I do notice that as an amp, some headphones benefit more while other benefit little.  Like for example, I don't think the M50 benefit much where as the d2000 and XB700 that I own does well with it.  Also bass boost is good for only a certain point with certain headphones.  With the d2000, I am only comfortable bass boosting it to only EQ1 and any more than that I find it to be losing sound quality where as the XB700 can handle all the way to bass boost EQ3 with no problem.  Although the D2000 is to me limited to bass boost EQ1, I don't think the D2000 needs the bass to be boosted any more.  The XB700 is another story, I like them all the way and man this thing can hit with max EQ.  I think the XB700 and Fiio E7 is a good match to bring out its bass.  For those who crave bass, get the xb700 and the Fiio E7. A very good combination for bass.      The OlED screen is a nice feature.  It is always nice to see what you are doing. Although I can't imagine what I would do if it doesn't work anymore as I heard the OLED screen doesn't last long.  Another problem I find with the amp is the menu screen, I find it lag slightly when switching between features.  Not a big deal, but would be nice.  One last issue I have with the E7, The amp screen is made of cheap glass or plastic. It's very easy to scratch, you can scratch it with your finger nail.  I would get a screen protector for it.  For the money, the amp does well for what it suppose to do. If you never had an amp before, this amp will do you well. I was never a believer in an amp, but after trying the E7 with my headphones, I'm liking what I hear.  I can't say the same for IEM as I don't own any real good ones.  Also, Just keep in mind that each amp is only good for some headphones and not all.  The E7 has plenty of volume, produce clean sounds, has bass boost, works as a DAC and as a portable amp, has a menu screen, and comes with a good amount of accessories.  I know amp are expensive, but I think I would be more satisfied if the amp would be slightly more cheaper.  I guess this is how this hobby works, you have to pay a little more to get the sharpening edges. I say if the fiio were around $50-$70 I would say it's perfect. At close to $100, I say I would give it a 4.5 stars considering to get a good headphone only cost around $100 to $200.  As an amp overall, I give it five stars.
B003DZX3US|5.0|Just had to have this movie as I have a collection of Disney movies from when I was growing up.  Love the Movie!
B0029NY9YO|2.0|Watched this film on opening day. Watchmen stars Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II (her mom was the original), Billy Crudup plays Dr Manhattan (the only character with super powers in the film), Jackie Haley plays Rorschach (my favorite) the sole remaining vigilante who did not quit when the government ordered the \\"masks\\" to stop fighting crime. Jeffrey Morgan plays The Comedian (see picture) whose death begins the story. And Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II (think Batman).    Okay, there are many more characters but I don't feel like writing about all of them.    The plot, The Comedian is thrown out of a window and Rorshach believes someone is targeting the old crimefighters.    His mission is to warn those who he was affiliated with.    Meanwhile, Dr Manhattan, a being who can manipulate matter, is working on a way to harness his energy to create the perfect source of fuel for the world.    So is someone going after the Watchmen? And will the world end up nuking themselves to oblivion? Watch the movie.    Or don't because it's really long and really boring.    Really - really boring.    It's directed by the guy who made 300 (another film based on a graphic novel) so there's a lot of slow-motion action scenes with lots of bloody violence and too much nudity.    \\"Too much\\" you ask? Yes - there really doesn't need to be any. We're talking about a man who glows blue and doesn't wear a single article of clothing...    Die hard fans will watch this, but I won't be getting this on DVD
B000MRAAJM|3.0|The content of this DVD is simply amazing. It takes you on a trip around this incredible planet of ours. The fierce power of nature, both beautiful and treacherous, is documented in this spectacular presentation. Thn only drawback was a technical one. I was disappointed that the video did not look to be Blu Ray quality.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I got the movie in great condition, but was horribly disappointed with the most boring movie I have ever had to endure.
B001E75QH0|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my husband.  He absolutely loved it.  He did not know that this collection existed when he asked for all of the Indiana Jones movies, neither did I.  However, Amazon had it and it was in my price range.  Thanks Amazon.
B000PMG16U|2.0|Lucas can really be a butt.  Yes, everyone wants the Blu-Ray version, but they also want a version without all the meddling new edits and butchery added to the original version that made Lucas famous and rich.  He thinks he knows what we want better than we do, he ignores our pleas and does what he wants regardless. To claim the original negative was DESTROYED to make the new versions is like saying they destroyed the Mona Lisa to do a modern-art version of it (that no one really wants).  But Lucas knows \\"best\\"...  the BUTT!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I get talked into watching these scary movies. I don't know why.    Paranormal Activity was an independent film that Paramount Pictures decided to distribute.    Because Paramount got involved, some of the original film was altered (the ending and placement of certain shots in the film's timeline)    Steven Spielberg himself suggested the ending you see in theaters.    Micah Sloat decides to videotape some of the nightly activity in his house. His girlfriend, Katie Featherston, isn't as excited. She claims that ever since she was 8, there's been some sort of presence following her.    The video you see is the tape authorities found inside the house.    The stuff during the daytime is great. It's funny and entertaining; just like watching anyone's home movie.    Then they get into bed. In fact, this plays to your psyche. Whenever you see them in bed, with the night vision turned on, your stomach turns over because you know something is about to happen.    You get a heavy dose of thuds and screams, add in some powdered footprints and a psychic who is too afraid to stay in the house.    This movie plays to your basic fear. If it was some alien monster, this wouldn't have been as scary. But because there's always a sliver of question concerning the existence of demons, what you don't see frightens the scream out of you.    I came home with my ears perked for any little sound. Paranormal Activity is a solid \\"homevideo\\" scare.
089898890X|4.0|this is an excellent book for people interested in beginning to explore jazz drumming. it contains examples of samba and merengue (i think thats what its called) as well. Buy this! and the other 2 books too. you will not regret it. This series is no joke. It will be useful for the rest of your life as a drummer. Its not one of those DVDs that you master in 4 months and throw out the window because you were able to skip working on half of its content. Buy this and the other 2 books! take advantage of the audio CD!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you are interested in the hardy boys and buffy the vampire slayer this is the series for you.  love the characters and the story line. does not disapoint.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie.  Emma Stone was Excellent.  Her character had a big heart, which was very sweet.
B0041KKYEW|2.0|There is no question that Darren Aronofsky is a master filmmaker.  The acting was great.  But watching this film was a painful experience for me.  \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" was a powerful film and one would expect drug addicts to end up badly, but the experience of an artist in the free world should not be this tormenting.    You would not go and see this movie for the dancing - the film contained little of it.  The camera tastefully dealt with great difficulty of the choreography by showing a few brief glimpses of relatively easy practice and performance sequences, and only fragments of dancers' bodies, like faces and feet, at other times.  This \\"over the top\\" production with neat computer-generated special effects and blurred lines between reality and fantasy must have been an attempt to make a grand statement about the world of art.  You would like this film if you have a professional interest in the way visual stimuli are used to convey an idea, or if you can only appreciate art for style and not substance.  If you are looking for a good plot, however, you will find this film lacking.  Natalie Portman's character was wretched.  She completely lost her way as a human being.  If you met that kind of woman in real life, you would instantly feel her misery and pain.  Her self-mutilation scenes made me cringe.  All the other characters were either mentally ill or seriously flawed.    When I came home, I put in the Bolshoi Ballet's Swan Lake DVD with Maya Plisetskaya.  I wish Darren Aronofsky's film about ballet was based not on some phantasmagoric nightmarish scenario but on the life and career of this great ballerina, who faced many serious challenges and nevertheless managed to achieve the kind of success that could be an inspiration to all of us.  In the hands of a competent director, a good story could make the difference between a trendy flick and a potentially classic film.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Found Beowulf for super cheap, d'never seen it, thought I'd watch it.    The movie is shot using the same motion capture technique as The Polar Express - except the characters look a lot sharper.    Starring: Ray Winstone (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) as Beowulf, Crispin Glover (Back to the Future) as Grendel, and Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother. Co starring are Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn and Brendan Gleeson.    This is the story that spawned many of our legends including King Arther. The film version is told by Neil Gaiman is full of grotesque monsters, seductive demonesses, dragons and blood.    Beowulf was not as horrible as I was led to believe. Outside of the title character being obsessed with his name and screaming, \\"I. AM. BEOWULF!\\" whenever he gets the chance, this film is quite entertaining. And if you had to suffer through the boring poem in Middle School or, like me, never read it - you'll find this action movie a nice thrill ride.
B003Y7AR7C|5.0|If you are looking for a great updated copy of the Nutcracker, this is it!!!  The store line stays ture to what most of us know already.  I enjoyed this so much I watched it twice back to back!!!  Beautiful dancing!!  Just a great buy for the Nutcracker fan!!!!
0307454541|3.0|I struggled getting through the 1st third of this book because it is extremely slow. There is entirely TOO MUCH detail about things that are just not neccesary. I understand an author's need to develop characters, but JEEZE!  TOO MUCH INFORMATION.  After I got through a couple hundred pages, (yes, I said 200+ PAGES!) I found myself intrigued...it started getting \\"meaty\\" and held my interest. The mystery/secrets of the family being investigated kept me reading on, but the story itself was not blockbuster.  The story is not extradinary, in fact it is quite ordinary. It's about an investigation of a 40 year old murder/missing person that reveals a series of other unsolved serial murders. The investigation evolves into a mysterious game of hunt & seek that has 2-3 eventful moments.  The protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, even though the author developed her character astutely, I still felt void; something was missing in the essence of her character that didn't allow me to really connect with her.  Ex:  Her falling in love ????  This is a person who, for the most part, was a non-emotional type \\"A\\" personality, who saw no need to be tied down to anyone or anything other than her computer.  I plan on reading the 2nd novel \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" in hopes it will redeem the 1st novel (and also because I heard it was better than the first).  I decided not to watch the movie when I found out it is subtitled. (After reading such a laborious novel, who wants to 'read' the movie too?)
B002ZG981E|5.0|Probably the best scifi movie to date. All aspects of the movie are a- class stuff.    Shouldn't miss!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is a great one for the whole family to enjoy together. The picture and sound on the blu-ray is outstanding and the 3 bonus minion movies are also pretty funny. I would highly recommend this movie to just about anyone and everyone.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This Is It is a fascinating documentary-style behind-the-scenes video of what would have been Michael Jackson's final concert tour.    With multiple cameras and angles, you will watch Jackson rehearsing with the crew and then mixed together to the actual songs.    Say want you want about Michael: weird, bizarre, etc... the man had a great talent of dance and song. He made a huge impact on popular culture. If you have any doubt, just look at the number of awards he won throughout his career.    Outside of this being about Michael Jackson, the video itself is fascinating to watch how a would-have-been blockbuster concert event was put together.    The special featurettes show how they selected the 11 dancers out of hundreds of applicants, and how the concert would have ended with Jackson taking off in a jet. You get to see how every outfit was created for this concert and just how much he loved crystals.    My favorite part, of course, was the music. Nothing can stop you from moving (in some fashion) to songs like Bad, Beat It, Thriller, Billy Jean, etc...    This is a great video for fans and casual listeners of Michael Jackson.
0066620996|4.0|The modern classic business culture book. Many of the author's findings are now considered conventional wisdom, but his insights are derived from good fundamental research and analysis of a variety of companies.<br /><br />While at first it seems like a \\"wishy washy\\" new age self help book, it quickly turns to real examples, real solutions, real prescriptions on how operational decisions can be made to avoid the systemic failures he describes in his negative examples (e.g. confront brutal facts, don't be an ostrich).<br /><br />This book is tightly focused on case studies of organizations and management teams which found a way to take \\"it\\" to the next level or found a way to reverse a declining tack. The ideas focus on getting the right people in the right positions, ways to organize and crystallize ideas/identify problems, and how to take action with that team and solutions.<br /><br />Some of the concepts mirror other technical disciplines (the \\"lifecycle\\" and iteration in project management leaps to mind in the author's \\"flywheel\\" concept), but all of the ideas mirror the central theme - how to use the lessons of the example companies to better organize your own team, organization, company, even country.<br /><br />What makes a \\"great\\" company - How can your organization be changed to \\"hit on all cylinders?\\" - The book is effective in its presentation of the answers to those questions, citing real world examples and statistics. But of course, the hard part is actually doing it - the book is a tool, a set of guiding principles and exercises that, with a little serendipity, one can use as input to make positive changes in one's own organization.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Got the cheap 1-disc DVD of TS3.  Will definetely buy all 3 on BD later.  If this wasn't the best of the 3 then it was pretty close.  Spanish Buzz was great, especially with the dancing,(to funny)and thinking that Woody was a rival for Jessie's love.  In all 3 movies they've had the running gag of Buzz being in Space Ranger mode, this one was probably the funniest.  Woody stepped up to the leadership role that he's always had, but even more so when he told the toys that they should all go back to Andy.  Good spots with him trying to escape, then the Hogan's Heroes scene where Woody plays the Col. Hogan role in coordinating the escape.[[ASIN:B0007KIFK0 Hogan's Heroes - The Complete First Season]]  All in all, get this movie and watch it several times.

B002ZG983M|1.0|Kick Ass is not quite the movie I was expecting. After watching this pseudo-Superhero movie, I thought I had just watched my first Quentin Tarantino movie. With all the F-bombs and extreme violence, I will not recommend this movie for anything.    Seriously, the characters say the \\"F\\" word about 100 times! That is enough to sicken me - for any movie.    The violence and gore is over-the-top. Simply not needed. I don't care if this is based on a bloody graphic novel.    This movie stars a bunch of no-namers who desire to be superheroes (you can tell by the cover of the DVD. I haven't read the graphic novel so I wasn't sure what to expect.    The only -ONLY- redeeming value of this movie was the storyline of Nicolas Cage's character, Big Daddy. His superhero costume resembles Batman's and he even talks like Adam West's version of Batman.    It was fun to see Cage beat up the bad guys. But again, the blood and gore was too much.    As a taste of what's in store for the gore: they microwave a guy!    Insane and a waste of time.    Do not watch this movie.
0385495323|4.0|This book is basically an examination of how codes (vis-a-vis secrecy) developed from the ancient world through to today's modern encryption systems.<br /><br />I initially began reading this book to help my neighbor's daughter with a school project, but by the first chapter it was clear that I would be reading this for myself.<br /><br />For anyone with a layman's interest in historical spy rings, medieval kingdom communication, or modern encryption systems (i.e. fans of Dan Brown's \\"Digital Fortress\\"), this book will explain the contextual reasons this kind of secrecy was developed as well as how codes technically work.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have a professional predilection for having an interest in the history of encryption, but this book can be enjoyed by a wide readership if the curiosity exists for the topic. The author has a very accessible writing style which I found to be key to unlocking (pun acknowledged) this technically difficult subject matter.<br /><br />One of my favorite examples the author uses to describe the idea of \\"security through obscurity\\" is of the Dark Ages-era messenger whose head is shaved and tattooed with a secret message. Then the messenger's hair is allowed to grow back and then he is set on his way to his destination. The idea is that the recipient of the messenger will have his head re-shaved to reveal the tattoo message, while being able to pass through checkpoints and endure physical searches successfully.<br />A secondary insight of that anecdote is the timeline - i.e. how slow communication and decision making moved in that era in stark contrast with today's instantaneous messaging systems.<br /><br />For those wanting to know what \\"encryption\\" really is, now that it has entered the public vernacular, this is the book which will explain it at both the high and low levels. Be prepared for some puzzle and math concepts/exercises, but it is not intimidating or exclusionary.

B002BJGYV2|3.0|The  Dvd series from the Gilmore Girls was bought a  gift. It was brought to me by the receiver. we opened the box and found the reason for the noise was the plastic filing system was broken and floating arouns in the box.    I know the dvd's was listed as repackaged. I didnt expect the boken plastic and would have liked to has seen that  in the description. The discs  looked fine.  I was disappointed. I suggest better product information.    regina
0316726729|3.0|The description on the condition of the book I purchased was 'like new'.  However, it arrived without the cover jacket. In other words, it did indeed have a hard bound cover. However, it was completely blank and looked like cardboard.  The carefully designed outside 'cover jacket' was missing. I'm in the business of design, so this was extremely disappointing. However: this co-authored book about the life of Anthony Kiedis was a much better read than the (also co-authored) story of Keith Richards life I also purchased (new) over the HOliday. Thanks.
B000J103PC|4.0|I picked up this movie for my wife; figured it'd be a nice chick-flick and don't all girls like romance and fashion    The Devil Wears Prada is about an aspiring journalist, Anne Hathaway, who gets a job as the second assistant to a ruthless fashion magazine editor, Meryl Streep.    At first, Hathaway's, Andy Sachs, thinks the fashion business is a joke and only stays on board to pay the rent until she can get a real job for a newspaper.    After days of ruthless, stinging barbs about her weight and sense of style, Sachs decides to join the team and begins wearing the latest trends.    As she gets deeper and deeper into the business, her relationships with her friends begin to suffer.    Things come to a head when Sachs is invited to Paris with her boss.    For a girly movie based on a book, this film wasn't too bad. I'm a hesitant fan of Hathaways. I'm not much of a Streep fan (does she have to cry in every movie?) but the music and the style of this film kept it interesting.    There was enough humor in it to keep me on the couch on a Valentine's Day.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is as powerful as any feature big screen movie or novel. I think people will watch it 30 years from now like we do the classics like Gone With the Wind. It's like War and Peace.  My father in law was with the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal and some of the other hellholes. He barely missed Pelilu.  He met his wife (my mother in law) when they went to Australia for R&R (I'm sure they were more reserved than some of the characters in the show).  About 10 years ago we went with them to Guadalcanal and toured the battle fields - Henderson Field, the Ridge, Alligator Creek, the Tenaru, and aross Iron Bottom Sound to Tulagi.  We had good insect repellant, but the 'no see ems' still bit us.  Imagine what a nightmare it was for the Marines and soldiers with mosquitos and all kinds of other vermin biting them, and the constant heat, rain and mud.  My father in law hardly talked about the bad, and never bragged. He told me funny stories, like 'borrowing' supplies from the Army, and having a Marine in his platoon who was a chef in civilian life. They enjoyed cakes and pies for a few days, after months of eating nothing but rice with weevils.  He passed away two years ago, but I think he would have liked this show.  We could have fast forwarded through the sex scenes.  The really violent scenes might have bothered him though, like, as others have mentioned, the horrific battle scenes on Pelilu and Iwo Jima, and the scenes on Okinowa where the men are close to losing their minds. These men literally saved Western Civilization and Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg have done them and the nation a great service with this tribute.
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|What a good movie. At first I thought it was going to be stupid because it was all in an elevator. The movie made me jump, and gave me chills. It had a twist to it. I like the story line, because growing up we also believed somewhat similar when the devil may lurk. About time they put something realistic on film that has to do with how twisted life is, and how everything has a way of bringing events together. If you think one white lie may save you from going to hell, you better think again!
B000E41MS6|5.0|I was introduced to the Tenth Doctor, and didn't really think I'd like # 9. This is exciting, funny, sexy and filled with quotable lines. The Companion, Rose Tyler, is one of the best heroines I have met, in sci-fi or otherwise. She is gutsy, intelligent, thinks on her feet and has a real knack for enjoying herself. We are taken to the destruction of the Earth, World War II Britain, and introduced to Jack Harkness, \\"Captain of the Innuendo\\".
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The follow-up/sequel to Batman Begins came out this morning. I woke up for the 9:30 AM show. Before we get into the review, you need to know that this movie is long. It clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes and there are times where you might feel it. I think I checked my cell phone twice to see what time it was. I came out of the theater feeling like I had been watching Batman all night. But I felt that way because of the early hour.    I was excited to see the early reviews for this monster - Rotten Tomatoes had 100% positives. I was anticipating this movie like a 10 year old waiting for his birthday!    Having said that, this movie is dark. I would not recommend taking small children to see this movie. It isn't promoted like Spider-man and is nothing close to Spider-man. While mainly bloodless, there are countless deaths.    You feel despair from the first bank robbery.    Christian Bale does a fine job as Bruce Wayne and The Batman. The problem comes with his \\"Batman voice\\". We heard a small amount of it in Begins while he yelled and gave us one word phrases, but with Knight, Batman is giving longer speeches and his hoarse/gruff \\"be afraid of me\\" voice comes across as a bit silly.    The other actors, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart do fantastic jobs in their roles. The issue continues to be the Rachel Dawes character played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. For some reason I just don't enjoy any screen time with her - for both movies. For The Dark Knight, she's dating Harvey Dent (Eckhart) while waiting for Wayne to quit being Batman.    Wayne sees his chance in Harvey Dent. Dent is the new District Attorney for Gotham and is cracking down on the mob. The citizens have a \\"hero with a face\\" and cheer him on in his quest.    Enter The Joker. Heath Ledger is the master of this movie. Any time he isn't on screen, you're wishing he was. And when he is on screen, his performance is so disturbing you never want it to end...Makes one feel a little dark for enjoying the crazy antics of the psychotic killer.    Because The Joker has no deep, hidden reason for what he does, anyone can be killed in this movie at any time...anyone. Christopher Nolan and his brother have written a script that holds nothing back.    Even with the small flaws (I'm thinking of the policeman constantly saying \\"This is not good\\") The Dark Knight is the best Summer movie I have seen...Ever.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|A funny light read. I recenly finished a heavier police drama, so I was thrilled to read this fun book!  I laughed through the whole book (sometimes even outloud)!  I'm sure many woman will be able to relate to this book. I highly reccomend it!
B000BB1MI2|4.0|This 2005 movie features Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka. Weird. A very weird portrayal of Wonka. I think Johnny Depp is one of the great actors out there, but I really didn't care for how he played the role of Wonka. Those sunglasses, the pale skin, the smile, it all makes him resemble Michael Jackson in a way. His personality seems low-key and quiet.  No spunk.  In contrast, Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) was much more energetic and enthusiastic.  I realize this 2005 movie follows the book, but I prefer Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka.  Sometimes changing a character's personality in contrast to the book works out for the better.<br /><br />I must say that the blueberry scene in this movie was overdone. It seems that everything was overdone and had lots of CGI.<br /><br />The kids in this movie weren't as memorable as they were in the 1971 movie. Some of them have the really snotty attitude, but not quite reaching the same level as in the 1971 movie.<br /><br />The Oompas weren't nearly as good as they were in the 1971 movie.  The Oompa song from '71 was great.  The songs in this 2005 movie were fair to pretty good at best.  The musical score by Danny Elfman, however, was good.<br /><br />To sum up, it's a pretty good movie, but I still prefer Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory.

B001OQCV2E|4.0|Director Roland Emmerich's supposed final disaster movie, 2012, follows the mythical belief that the Mayan's predicted that the world will end on December 21, 2012.    Before we get to the film, it should be noted that the Mayan's did not believe the end of the world would happen on this date at all. The fear/prediction came from freaked out Westerners.    2012 stars John Cusack as author Jackson Curtis (get this, he is named after 50 Cent whose real name is Curtis Jackson). Jackson and his wife, Kate (Amanda Peet) are divorced with two kids.    Jackson takes their kids on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park.    Meanwhile, back in 2009, scientist Adrien Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) informs the President (Danny Glover) of the impending doom. This gives the nations of the world 3 years to build ships to survive the coming end of the world.    Jackson and his family flee the destruction of California, and hitch a ride with a Russian billionaire and his sons.    Flash to scenes with the President and the destruction, flash to another story about two old men on a cruise ship, flash back to Jackson and his family.    This is Emmerich's way of giving us an intimate/emotional connection amongst the global end.    Jackson learns that the leaders of the countries have been building Arks in the mountains of China, so it's a race to the big boats before the big waves crash into them.    The moral of this movie is: if you want to survive the end of the world you need to have 1 Billion Euros or be closely attached to the leader of a country. Everyone else is doomed. So sorry. And it's not even the end of the world; the planet survives. I was hoping to see ultimate extinction ala Vulcan on the new Star Trek movie.    2012 is a heart-racing thriller. It's a fun, popcorn flick. Don't expect any Oscars though. While it's global destruction is on a new level, I found the special effects to be lacking. When an aircraft carrier tumbles into the White House, you can totally tell it's a miniature.
B001VLXNLU|3.0|This book was too much like the &#34;Ugly&#34; series. they undergo a change. It is hard to go thru. To much alike!
0307454541|2.0|I did not read any of the reviews before I bought this book.  I bought it based on the fact that my three friends said it was great.  I thought it was so boring.  It dragged on and on about the Wennerstrom (sp?) affair in the beginning and then on and on about the family (who could keep track of who was who).  I kept reading based on my friends' reviews.  I just couldn't get into this book and don't understand all the \\"hoopla\\" about it.  Unfortunately, I also bought the second book at the same time that I bought this one.  I'm about one third through the book and I see the same problem with this book.  I guess I just don't like Larsson's style of writing nor do I like his subject matter.  I don't even like the character of Salander.  I'm not going to even bother finishing the second one and both books will get donated to the local library.  They have a long waiting list to read them.
B000Q6GUW0|1.0|I wanted to buy the first season of Dexter so that I could finally catch up on what all the fuss is about. I love this series however the copy of this series is CRAP!

Will never buy a movie from amazon.com again!
B001C08RHA|5.0|What would you do if you were a weapons developer; find out that the weapons you manufacture are used to kill innocents and then learn that you have shrapnel near your heart that could kill you at any moment?<br /><br />If you are anything like Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) you'd build a mechanical suit and fight to end your own weapons. And, to prevent your death, you'd create this little gizmo based on a new energy source to prevent the shrapnel from entering your heart. It's this energy that powers your suit.<br /><br />But of course, the bad guys don't want you to succeed, so they'll build a gigantic robot to stop you.<br /><br />This movie is packed with fabulous actors: Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Howard, and Paul Bettany as the voice for Stark's butler, Jarvis.<br /><br />I think this film is better than the Spider-man movies and just up there with Batman Begins. Everything about it is top-notch: acting, writing, chemistry, etc... Some of the best comedic moments are between Tony Stark and his robot assistance as he builds his updated Iron Man suit.<br /><br />The bottom line for my experience of this movie was creativity. The creativity found in this movie was astounding. Everything is crisp and great looking.<br /><br />This is going to join my DVD collection. Can't wait for the sequel!

0312600844|2.0|After reading all the great reviews from various critics I thought it would be a sure thing.... I have about a 100 pages left to go and it's absolutely painful! I've already picked up 3 other books and finished them while slogging through this one. Don't bother...
B0044R98XK|2.0|Kindle for iPhone/iPad version:<br />When I purchased this version of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I thought the illustrations were mainly by Sidney Paget and reproductions of The Strand Magazine Sherlock Holmes stories. What I got were some Sidney Paget illustrations, color photos, and pictures from the latest Sherlock Holmes movie.  The photos really detract from the stories.  Save your 99 cents and buy the \\"The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes\\" for $9.99 in the paper version for a real Sherlock Holmes experience as they were published.
B0010X745K|4.0|The Mist has been on my, \\"want to see\\" list since I saw a trailer for it how many months ago. I remember listening to the audiobook of Stephen King's novella when I was younger. I picked it up because it has this great cover of some tentacle reaching up under a door and boasted of a \\"fully surround sound experience\\".    The Mist was directed by Frank Darabont who directed The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Two Stephen King books that translated very well onto the big screen. I was looking forward to another Darabont/King collaboration.    Starring Thomas Jane (The Punisher) as David Drayton, Marcia Gay Harden (Mystic River) as the religious-crazed Mrs. Carmody, Laurie Holden (Silent Hill) as Amanda Dumfries, and William Sadler (The Green Mile) as Jim this movie was held to a strict budget and time frame which created the perfect mentality for a horror film.    Following a freak electrical storm, a mist creeps into a small town. David and his son travel to the grocery store the next day for supplies. While there a man, bleeding from his nose, comes running in warning the people to stay away from the mist.    The crowd looks on as the mist envelops the parking lot.    There are those who aren't sure what to do, some who want to go home to their children, and others who think something sinister at work. Mrs. Carmody believes it's the wrath of God come upon the town for their sins. Before the end of the film, she will have converted a large following to her beliefs.    How will anyone escape the mist? Whenever someone tries to escape to their car, they are \\"taken\\" or eaten by whatever inhabits the mist.    There is alot of foul language in this movie and the graphic content is high as well. Plus the ending may not be what you're expecting and, depending on how you look at it, could very well upset you.    The film makers did a fine job with what they had. (Actor/budget-wise)
1430233834|4.0|This book is well written, clearly explaining everything. It's absolutely written for people with no prior or little programming experience. I liked the use of a table to explain the code line by line. It's the first book I've read using this approach.   A lot of concepts are repeated in several chapters. I think this is a good thing for people with some or no programming experience. Besides this makes it easy to skip around. The book clearly showcases the new features of HTML5.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I just used this DVD for the first time last night. I am now sitting at work with really sore arms and legs, haha. I am 5'5 about 115lbs and just want to \\"tone up\\" I don't really want to lose weight..  I run on and off but that gets boring so that is why I bought this DVD. I wasn't expecting it to be so intense, but it really makes me think that I am in awful shape, especially since it was only level one.   I have a few concerns..is it expected that we do this workout for 30 consecutive days? She is out of her mind, I am too sore today to even think about more squats...& I wish she would have given a little extra time to explain the moves beforehand because I think that is why some people are reporting injury from this workout. It is strenuous, but if you are doing the moves properly your knee's, back, feet..etc should not be hurting you.
B0043VCPW8|5.0|The Bare Bones CD is the VERY BEST album by Bryan Adams.  If you have gone to one of his Bare Bones concerts, you know how great he sounds with just the guitar, piano and his incredible voice.  After seeing him at the Bare Bones concert last year, I hoped he would do a CD.  Anyone that enjoys Bryan Adams music, will LOVE this album!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|James Cameron returns to the theaters with Avatar. Despite the promotion as an original film, Avatar resounds with comparisons to Pocahontas.    On the planet Pandora, there is a valuable mineral that The Company desires. They send in the military and scientists to retrieve it.    However, there are humanoid natives on Pandora called the Na'vi who do not wish their world to be plundered.    The humans create an empty shell that is part human/part na'vi in which certain people can upload their mind to. These are called avatars.    The avatars are used to infiltrate the na'vi population and, after being accepted as one of their own, convince them to relocate.    This world is mind-blowing. The details to the creatures, the scenery, and atmosphere is astounding. You should see this film in 3D to get the full effect. James Cameron is a great creator of worlds. He created the look of the Terminator and the fuller look of the Alien. It stands to reason that, after so many years, he would create the ultimate new world for us to enjoy.    Avatar stars Sam Worthington as Jake Sully whose job is to convince the na'vi to leave. Zoe Saldana is Neytiri - the na'vi who befriends and trains Jake. Sigourney Weaver is scientiest Dr Grace Augustine who does everything she can to be the diplomat to the na'vi.    Rated PG-13 for intense epic battle sequences, you may also want to be mindful that the female na'vi do not wear shirts. They get away with this because they are aliens I suppose.
0061765236|5.0|This is an amazing story, Picoult really knows how to capture you in the first chapter, I didn't want to put this book down EVER! She was very good at getting into the minds of the characters and taking you in there with her!<br />This was an amazing book, as are all her stories!

B001DHXT20|2.0|Special effects was the only plus side to this film. Edward Norton as Bruce Banner (aka The Incredible Hulk)? No. Liv Tyler (aka breathe heavy in all lines girl) as Betty Ross? No. William Hurt has big mustache military man? No. This film was horribly miscast. I lost count how many times I thought Norton was pathetic (I am, of course, biased. I don't care for his acting) and how annoyed I got at Tyler's heavy breathing moans.    The best part of this film, outside of the special effects, was the very end when Tony Stark made an entrance and spoke about \\"forming a team\\". BRING ME IRON MAN!    The Hulk did look better in this film than the previous film. But the story for both films was awful.    In this version, Bruce Banner is hiding from General Ross and the US Army in a far away country. He is taking steps to prevent himself from getting \\"worked up\\" and turning into The Hulk.    Because some of Banner's blood drops into a bottle of silly juice and comic creator Stan Lee drinks it and dies, the army Special Forces is on the hunt.    The Special Forces team is led by a man who wants to get stronger and faster to take on the green creature. Thanks to General Ross, he becomes another Hulk-type and they call him Abomination. The final fight between the two behemoths was touted as this fantastic eye candy...it left me wanting to watch something else.    This is why I waited for a friend to loan this movie to me. There is no way I would ever pay for something like this.    Let's hope the upcoming Captain America and Thor are more along the lines of Iron Man and let this film go away.
B00062RCBW|4.0|This is a review for the collection of the individual silver boxes.<br /><br />After hearing the horror stories stemming from the 20th anniversary collector's edition, I thought it would be best to order this set. The packaging may be bulky, but it as far superior to that of DS9, VGR and ENT (I ordered those off the official site, so they are legit copies. The packaging is as cheaply made as others have noted).<br /><br />The video quality is obviously not 1080p, but I didn't think it looked as dreadful as others have complained. In fact I thought it looked really good upscaled, especially for a TV show shot in the 80's. The effects shots usually dip in resolution as they were not committed to filmstock, but I didn't think they detracted from the experience.<br /><br />Until we see a digital remastering of the transfers, this collection will have to do.
0312370849|5.0|The book had me going from beginning to end. It told a story that I wasn't aware of and felt so true/real that I forgot I was reading fiction. I liked how it switched between the past and present day. It was an all around good read and would highly recommend.
0762408480|5.0|Captivating and beautiful.  I had expected to read this to my family over our Christmas vacation. But before I got a chance, the kids read it to themselves.  This was their first time through \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and they were excited.<br /><br />This is an oversized format -- a very large picture book -- with an abridged but not dumbed-down reading level.  5th graders can certainly read it; ambitious younger readers can tackle it with a bit of vocabulary help.  The book keeps to the original Dickens language, but it is abbreviated a bit.  YOunger kids will love the striking illustrations as you read it to them.<br /><br />Beautiful book.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Have you seen Pandorum? Starring Dennis Quaid (G.I. Joe) and Ben Foster (X-Men 3), this movie is sci-fi entertainment.<br /><br />Before I get into it, let me caution that this film is gory, violent and jump-out-of-your-seat scary.<br /><br />Earth is running out of resources and decided to send a massive space ship to an earth-like planet called Tanis.<br /><br />After taking off, the crew members receive word that earth was destroyed; we're not told how.<br /><br />Corporal Bower (Foster) awakens from deep hibernation, finds himself in a small room with no exit, then wakes his commanding officer, Payton (Quaid). Together they decide to find answers.<br /><br />They can't remember much of their past, except what their tasks are on-board the ship.<br /><br />Bower crawls through some air vents to get further into the ship, Payton directs him from a command chair.<br /><br />This movie works on one level: you don't know more than the characters. As they learn things, about the ship and their pasts, you learn as well. It keeps you guessing until the end.<br /><br />As Bower makes his way through the innards of the ship, he comes across other people who have been awake longer but are quite \\"wild\\". They are being hunted by these demon-looking creatures that carry sticks with glowing blue lights. (So you know when they're coming) And their screaming is ear-piercing. These blue-light bad guys like to eat you.<br /><br />Where did they come from and how will Bower, Payton and the other humans escape?<br /><br />The scares are intense but the editing is horrific. To make it \\"scarier\\" they blast you with loud high pitched noises with quick cut shots of the creatures running and screaming.<br /><br />And the gory scenes are really over the top.
B00428CPUY|4.0|The Crossroads CD is very good with interesting interviews and behind the scenes insight.  Due to the extensive cast of characters, nobody gets to develop a sustainable groove, thus leaving the listener wanting more.  I guess that's what all-star concerts are all about.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this book after my husband purchased it for himself. He explained the very first chapter to me and I had to read it for myself. I could not put it down once I started and finished all 3 of the books before he even had a chance to read the first.I loved it and I highly recommend this book! ...I just wish there was more than 3 books...
1400052173|5.0|I do not normally read non-fiction books.  That said, boy, am I glad that I read this book.  The writing is exceptional, and the story is absolutely fascinating.   This is a book that is difficult to put down once you get into it.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|Take a cartoon from the 60s, add The Wachowski brothers and you get Speed Racer.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I think this movie got the reception it did because some people saw the Wachowski name and assumed they were getting an adult version of the classic cartoon.<br /><br />It's rated PG for some language. Very mild stuff.<br /><br />I also think this film didn't do so well because the bluescreen effects have been done too often (think 300 and Sky Captain) that it's lost the cool factor - if it ever had the cool factor.<br /><br />The Racer family loves their Mach 5 car and the thrill of the race. Older brother Rex died in a horrible accident which left Speed to become great in his own way.<br /><br />Once Speed wins a big race, the money-hungry Corporations come calling for him to join their team. Speed declines and it becomes a race for Speed and Racer X to overcome and defeat the evil CEOs.<br /><br />Based on a Japanese cartoon, Speed Racer is a fun movie. Remember when you used to see movies because they were fun and you didn't have to worry about something looking realistic or how unbelievable?<br /><br />Speed Racer stars Emile Hirsch as Speed, Susan Sarandon as his mom, Scott Porter as Rex, John Goodman has Pops, Christina Ricci as Trixi, and Matthew Fox as Racer X.
B000UO338W|5.0|I don't write a lot of music reviews on here, but I was just listening to this album and was struck by how good it is.  Ministry is the only band I know of that really channeled the frustration of the Bush years into great music.  Most \\"activist\\" musicians wrote a song or two and made a pouty face.  Ministry made THREE ALBUM and recorded the best song of all of them -- The Dick Song.  Aside from being a really solid Ministry song, it has the awesome lyrics \\"Dick Cheney, son of Satan!  He is the chosen one!\\"  And then some awesome recordings of the guy lying and saying ridiculous, dastardly things.    I know this review is three years too late, but if you never got this album and you're wondering if it's worth the purchase, DO IT!  Look at the damn album cover.  You cannot rob yourself of this genius work.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this CD, I got it for Xmas and have listened to it none stop.  I had just seen Wicked on Broadway the weekend before Xmas. Listening to the CD, I can see the performances in my head.  It is not the same cast that I saw, but it is still an awesome CD.  I love it and would recommended it to anyone.

B000AAF1U4|3.0|I had been told over and over again that this was a great movie. And after playing Disney-Pixar Scene It, I decided it was time for my eyes to feast upon this supposedly epic movie.    Starring David Spade as the Emperor, John Goodman as the commoner who ends up helping him, and Patrick Warburton as the evil henchman, this movie does deal out some well deserved laughs.    I think the loudest I laughed was from a scene I saw while playing the Scene It game; when the emperor (as a llama) is in the middle of sleeping pumas and a squirrel pops a balloon. For some reason little animated squirrels are always cute and funny.    The film is about an egotistical emperor who wants to destroy a village to build his summer home and his evil sorceress who wants his throne. She turns him into a llama and her henchman chucks him into a wagon heading out into the forest.    The emperor and a commoner team-up in order to return him to the palace and be restored.    Not the greatest Disney movie, but worth the time it took to watch. Maybe I was just in a toon kinda mood for these films.
0451228731|5.0|I'm just a little more than half-way through the book but have enjoyed it. I'm an IT professional with some experience in networking and plenty in hardware and Web. I also tinker with home automation. So far, this book has terrified me because I have yet to come across anything that seems truly far-fetched or impossible with today's technology.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Dan Brown novel and it was a thrilling, mentally captivativing book that I consumed in one day. Then I proceeded to purchase his 'Deception Point  and Da Vinci Code'  You will ignore the fire alarms blaring as you read this from cover to cover. Well developed characters and an amazing plot. Kudos Dan! Gwen S. San Marcos CA.

B001H5X7I4|2.0|Too much bad language. Too much.    I don't understand why Ben Stiller thought this would be funny. There was some promise to this film. It could have been really funny. With a cast like Tropic Thunder had, you would think this film would be unstoppable.    You have Ben Stiller as the action hero Tugg Speedman, Jack Black as the drug addict Jeff Portnoy, and Robert Downey Jr as Australian actor Kirk Lazarus who changed the color of his skin for the role.    These guys are trying to make a big budget war movie. But things aren't going so well. They're behind scheduled and tempers are flaring. So the director and author of the book, decide to fly the actors into the middle of the jungle and have them think they are making the movie. (Think The Three Amigos)    There are some drug cartels in the forest who think the actors are DEA agents and we let the games begin. Stiller's character gets abducted by a child-led drug group and forced to replay a mentally retarded character. This is where the film goes from lame to just stupid.    Supporting cast includes Tom Cruise as a foul-mouthed studio exec. and Matthew McConaughy as Stiller's agent.    The constant crude language and horrible story kept me from enjoying what should/could have been a great comedy. They don't all have to be rated R you know.
B000W3Q1HG|5.0|After reading this book I believe that we should look at our Earth as a sparkling jewel of blue and white, a sphere that emits a majestic radiance contained in an aura of deep mystery. The book has taught me that  like the umbilical cord between mother and child, light is the messenger of life, because it is alive and contains all information and sustains life. And that light is the connective tissue that creates the unity of the universe. We then have to re-dream the dream of Spaceship Earth so that little re-dreams can add up to bigger re-dreams, and the re-dreams of the family, re-dreams of the cities, re-dreams of the countries and re-dreams of the entire humanity can bring harmony and peaceful coexistence.
B002ZG997C|2.0|I'm a fan of both Sci-Fi and the post-apocalypse sub-genre. I tend to cut both a lot of slack because projects in these genres are considerably more ambitious than those in others. I liked the actors in \\"The Book of Eli\\", and I liked the visually-interesting scenery.     However, I did not care for the somewhat murky, predictable, and largely mis-conceived story.     The notion that the Bible can offer a very small-time thug the means to subjugate an illiterate population in a post-apocalytic world where fewer than 1 in 10,000 have survived is Marxist Hollywood crap.     The notion that God would annoint someone to save a Bible with a message framed in late-middle English instead of bringing forth the next Krishna, Buddha, or Christ to reassert the Truth for a post-apocalyptic time and place is equally improbable.     Finally, the idea that the lead character is both blind and able to hit multiple moving targets at great distance (for a hand gun) while on the run (and otherwise behave like a sighted person in every scene) is far less likely than the alternative: Eli either knew or found a way to learn braille in order to read the book he was given by God, and called to read. Yes, it could be a Christian miracle in which Eli was without sight but given an even more powerful sense by God.     If pressed, I'm willing to buy both this interpretation and its effectiveness in making it clear that Eli was chosen by God, annointed, etc. But if so, why not jam or mis-fire the round that finally brings Eli to his knees? To show that \\"God works (or chooses not to work) in mysterious ways?\\" To make the point that God is capricious, unpredictable, or unreliable? Either way, this is murky story-telling that only reinforces the audience's murky understanding of the murky Judeo-Christian concept of God... murky indeed.    I really like the notion of depicting a spiritually-uplifted, empowered individual in a post-apocalyptic world. However, in my opinion, this film did not deliverthat to anyone who knows and routinely experience the Indwelling Spirit of God. However, it may deliver a vague sense of what Christian religionists and non-religious individuals raised in a post-Christian era might imagine spirituality to be... sad really.    After 24 hours' reflection and a long walk, I add this: Buried deep in this film is an useful truth, the telling of which redeems much: \\"We live in a time of such abundance and yet we remain impoverished in knowing the difference between what is precious and what is not.\\" Contemplating this truth, we become wiser.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|At first I was unsure How I would like the New Dr. but Matt Smith grew on me with in 3 episodes. And I love Amy Pond!!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|J.J. Abrams has directed a beautiful motion picture called Star Trek. He and his writers decided to re-boot the story and take us back to Kirk and Spock; before the original series.    When a Romulan miner goes through a wormhole, he goes back through time to destroy a planet (I won't spoil too much). Because of this change in history, Jim Kirk's father is killed before he's supposed to and we're given an alternate history.    Many Star Trek fans are not happy with this new spin, but the film's creators wanted their own take on the franchise and this was how they could do it.    Chris Pine plays James T. Kirk. Having never heard of this guy before, I was a little worried. But fear not. Pine does a fantastic job at the brashness of Kirk. He will make a fine starship captain. Except, it seemed as if he was getting beat up all through film.    Zachary Quinto plays Spock. We get to see what it was like for him to grow up on Vulcan and being teased for being half-human. He is the one who designed a training exercise that Kirk cheats at to win. They aren't the best of friends we've known them to be at the beginning of this film. Once again, Quinto does a nice job at Spock and making it some of his own.    Eric Bana is the villain, Nero. We don't get much of his story or see much of him. But we was terrific as the bad guy.    Karl Urban plays Dr. McCoy (Bones) and you believe him as soon as you meet him. The voice and his paranoia is perfect. Great job by Urban.    Finally, Simon Pegg plays Scotty. He's a funny guy and I was surprised at how his character joined the Enterprise family. I didn't really care for his small assistant as if Pegg needs someone to help him with comedy.    Star Trek is a great summer ride. It's fun and funny. Lots of action and crisp looking shots. If you aren't a Trek fan, you should still give this re-boot a try. You'll probably end up enjoying it.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Glad to see a lot more reviews here, and to start seeing Ms. Monae in mainstream-type magazines (I always do a double take).  I thought I was taking a chance by picking up this album a few months back, even though I didn't have much of an idea about the artist or the album.  Soooo glad I did.    When I first fired it up, some classical-type started coming through.  I thought I had bought the wrong thing.  Stuck with it, and the album took off.  It's amazingly produced, but no amount of production can cover up bad vocals or lack or \\"it\\".  Ms. Monae has an impeccable voice, and she never uses gimmicks to \\"enhance\\" her sound.  You know the bad vocal crap I'm talking about.  Think Christina Aguilera.  She simply allows her beautiful timbre to shine through, and then pushes it to the limit to get some great screams and effects.  Amazing.    Go ahead and get this album.  It's not pop.  It's not dance.  It's not electronica (is it still called electronica?).  It's not hip-hop.  It's a lovely digestion of lots of sounds and feels, put together by people who obviously love all sorts of good music.  As for the reviewer who thought it was confusing...poor fellow.    I can't even guess how many times I've listened to \\"Cold War.\\"  In the morning, after work when I'm disgruntled, or when hanging out with friends, this album kills every time.    Beats out anything I've heard this year.
B00001NTXN|5.0|Easy to learn (only 2 rules!), easy to teach, this is an excellent game for ages 5+. Despite the easy rules, there are so many different strategies you can try that it's never the same game twice.  Quoridor is a favorite of both my son who loves games and my teenage daughter who is reluctant to play anything.  Because the game itself is beautifully made and because it takes only a few minutes to play a round, we've taken to leaving it out on the coffee table, ready for a spontaneous game at any time.
006145205X|3.0|Mr. Ridley's book reads like a 360 page newspaper op. ed. piece.  The central thesis is twofold: that comparative advantage and trade have enabled humans to make great leaps forward over time, and that the sharing and cross-breeding of ideas have further catalyzed the process with the cumulative product  ultimately leading to better and more innovative ideas, products, and solutions.  Mr. Ridley also challenges modern pessimists - primarily those to the left  - on topics ranging from global warming to run-away population growth and Malthusian predictions for food shortages, and he even, in entertaining fashion, challenges the error of making pessimistic predictions in the first place (although many more have more credibly pointed out the foolishness in making ANY long-range predictions and forecasts at all!).  Mr. Ridley succeeds in providing interesting and well-supported counter points to arguments in favor of popular issues like the superiority of organic farming to chemical-based crop raising, green energy, the desire for top-down population control, taking action against climate change, and even providing certain types of aid to Africa (see the November 27, 2010 debate in the Wall Street Journal between Mr. Ridley and Bill Gates for a great clash of ideas between the two on this topic). If you fervently believe in any of these causes, you will find well-argued counter points in The Rational Optimist.  I will not spoil the book by giving away the evidence.    However, Mr. Ridley lost me early in Chapter 1. when he made arguments for improving human health based on data about declining death rates from stroke and for improving environmental habitat in the U.S. and Europe based on less toxic pollution.  He lost me because his arguments were too obviously one-sided, and thus more along the lines of well-elaborated opinions rather than balanced arguments.  While death from stroke may be getting better, what about the ballooning obesity and diabetes epidemics?  I also wondered why the scientific consensus that we're in a human-caused mass extinction of the world's species was not given more weight throughout the book's environmental arguments, primarily for the sake of balance.  It became clearer and clearer to me that Mr. Ridley sees the world much more from the lends of an economist than from someone well-versed in both economics and science, as I had hoped (but which I don't completely understand given Mr. Ridley's scientific eduction; perhaps the world he lived in as a journalist compelled this more one-sided view).  I had been hoping for compelling and balanced arguments from Mr. Ridley, but left the book feeling uninspired and skeptical given his propensity to provide only data in support of his views.    While The Rational Optimist argues that things are great today because of how amazing humans are, and that things are only going to get better over time, I found the conclusions unconvincing because they were argued only from one side. Mr. Ridley hasn't persuaded me that Emerson's observation from Self-Reliance isn't true in that, \\"Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other.\\"  Emerson realized issues on both sides.  Mr. Ridley seems only to see from one.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I really enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy. Because I just now saw it, I can't really compare it to the first film, The Bourne Identity. This sequel was a fine-tuned machine.    Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne. He's the guy who was trained to be an assassin and then lost his memory. That was the first film.    Supremacy picks up with Bourne and his girlfriend living in India trying to keep a low profile. Unfortunately, another hitman, played by Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings) finds them and kills the girl.    This causes Bourne to do what any distraught hitman would do; seek revenge and answers from those who did it.    Enter the Federal Agent who knows nothing about the first movie, Joan Allen. Who assisted by Julia Stiles and Brian Cox engaged with Bourne in a case of mistaken identity and assumptions made wrong. (seemed to be the weekend for those kind of films**see Bend it Like Beckham review**)    The fighting scenes are great. The car crashes that were used in the first film are used again. So basically it's a similar film, but you continue to learn a bit about Bourne. Can't wait to see the next one.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|It has been a long time coming, but the Daria fans finally got their wish: Daria's been released.  All five seasons, plus the 2 movies in one set.  As an avid fan, I was massively excited when I got the email from MTV saying they were releasing the show.  I got it as a Christmas present, and I watched all five seasons in 2 days.  It was great, being taken back to my high school years, filled with apathy and questioning things adults were saying.<br /><br />The downside of course, is that the music from the episodes had been changed because they couldn't get all the copyrights.  And it's a glaring issue in some of the episodes (especially 'Pierce Me', when Daria has her daydream about Trent in the phone cord), but it didn't ruin the integrity of the DVD to me.  I am just massively happy to have the series that my friends and I loved when we were teenagers.  And I realize it might sound odd that a 27-year old has a DVD from when she was in high school that's animated, but the show makes just as much sense as it did when I was younger.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This series, originally on HBO is a keeper. It is much like \\"Band of Brothers\\" as to quality of content but obviously about the Pacific. If you didn't see it on HBO I definatley reco. getting the dvd set, it will hold your attention. Well done!!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Shame on the publisher for being so mercenary that they are charging MORE for a digital copy than for a print edition of this book!<br />I enjoy reading Ken Follett, but I will never pay more for a digital copy.  I would rather get this book from the library than pay $19.99 to read it on my kindle.  Shame on whoever made the decision to go for greed rather than satisfy your digital market!  You just lost another fan.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I got Terminator Salvation for Christmas because I have the first 3 and need to keep the series going. (Doesn't everyone do that?)    It picks up long after the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines where we see John Connor (Christian Bale) as a soldier in the human resistance against the Skynet.    Before the first battle scene, we're privy to Sam Worthington's character, Marcus - in prison, offer his body for a \\"good cause\\".    Marcus wakes up amid the battles and finds a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). Together, they make their way towards Skynet and bump into Connor. Reese is captured by the terminators. Marcus infiltrates the machine compound and Connor invades to destroy them once and for all.    Terminator Salvation is a nice addition to the franchise. It gives you a look at some of the things hinted at in the earlier films. It also touts some of the fiercest explosions I have seen in movies.    However it lacks humanity. Which is pretty much the basis of the film. You don't connect with any of the characters and you really don't care who lives and who dies. Obviously you know Connor and Reese will survive this first film (of which the director would like to make 3). But you don't mind watching the other survivors bite it because you really don't care about them.    The movie is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I had heard of this show when it was on the air, but being 11/12 when it was on, it wasn't of much interest to me.  After becoming an adult, and with all the Jared Leto promotion, I figured why not check out a few clips on YouTube?  And I was amazed.  Not with Jared Leto, but with the show as a whole.  So, I rented it, fully aware that I was going back to the 1990s fashions I have been trying to forget these past 16 years.<br /><br />I was taken back to high school, which for me began three years after the show ended.  And despite the fashion differences, I found myself remembering that some things in the show happened to me.  I had a guy friend who was hiding his sexual identity (but unlike Rickie, he wasn't showing same-sex orientation), the unattainable crush, and the friend your parents aren't sure they want you to be around.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to people who want to re-experience high school.  Not just the bad stuff, but the fun memories.  There were several instances when I texted my best friend, just because the show made me miss her.  Besides, it's a fun way to cringe at the 90s fashions that are coming back or all ready in style.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I will not write a 3 page essay on this movie but I will say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.     The storyline and complexity of this film are incerdible and each actor fits their role perfectly. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll at the end.     My advice to anyone who doesn't quite understand it after you watch it: watch it again... anybody I have talked to that didn't understand or was confused by the movie said it all made sense after the second time watching... Enjoy
0937381888|5.0|The title should read 'Everything You Need To Know To Brew Beer Right EVERY Time.'     I'm a 'noob' to brewing and find this book to be a great reference. I brew with two friends who are both seasoned brewers and between us we have all of the major books. All agree that this is one of the best.    We find it comprehensive but not overwhelming, and all steps are well explained through photos, illustrations, tables and appendices.  The very first chapter is called 'A Crash Course in Brewing' and  is exactly that. It walks the reader through the entire process from preparation to bottling. You can brew a batch of beer by only reading this chapter. From that point the book covers (or seems to cover) EVERYTHING- except kegging your beer. I can overlook that since this really is about brewing. It would be nice to have a few pages on it though, as I know many people who have added kegs to their toolbelt.    In my opinion, if you are buying a first book on brewing or just want another very worthy reference, this is the one.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|If you liked the movies I, Robot and Minority Report, you will feel right at home with Surrogates.    As he did in I, Robot, James Cromwell has created a fleet of robots to replace humanity's role on the planet. He has created surrogates - robots that we can plug into - who are perfect and practically indestructable. People just recline in their comfy chairs while putting high-tech tanning glasses on and let their brainwaves do the work.    Bruce Willis is FBI agent Tom Greer who is brought on a case dealing with the death of Cromwell's son. Rosamund Pike plays Greer's wife, Maggie who loves being in the surrogate to the detriment of her own body.    Ving Rhames stars as The Prophet, the leader of humans who don't believe in conducting business as surrogates.    Following the death of the son, we're led down a twist-turning path. How can you know who to trust when you aren't even sure who you're looking at is really them? Did that sentence seem confusing? So can this movie with the number of plot holes.    It does get a good rating from me for it's lack of questionable material. Yet it does include a number of swear words.    The action and chase sequences are above par, but you can tell when the special effects are in place and that sort of takes you out of the movie.    With the end of this movie comes a nice 20-30 minutes when you can discuss how you would like to live in a surrogate.
B004D7GU3M|2.0|I agree with the reviewer above. Wonderful album, but why is the artwork included INSIDE the record sleeve censored. It was not advertised this way and I am greatly disappointed. What point is it to have \\"frameable artwork\\" that is just a censored blur?
B003NFM3JK|5.0|The movie was very life-like and made the same way as Polar Express, a wonderful and moving movie [coming from a totally male reviewer].    Disney decided to keep several Christmas religious songs and music, a wise choice.    The ending, while true to the book's ending, is not like some previous movies which went beyond the book and thus were more satisfying.        Overall, though, the quality of the DVD is great; the movie is great.     It is worth watching, but TOO SCARY for small children.    NOTE: this is a re-written review.  I was too negative in the original.  Sorry.

B000VWYJ86|4.0|In The Bourne Ultimatum, Jason Bourne is one movie closer to discovering/remembering who he was before becoming a lethal killing machine.    Back for more is:    Matt Damon, Julia Stiles and Joan Allen. Adding to this movie's cast is all-time-greats David Strathairn and Scott Glenn.    Similar to the first 2 films, the government agencies are trying to hunt down and eliminate Bourne's threat.    Bringing back the vicious hand-to-hand combat scenes along with dizzying chase sequences, The Bourne Ultimatum is a perfect culmination for this trilogy.    But then I heard there are rumors of a 4th movie possibly being ready for 2010 (but we'll have to wait and see)    Just one bit of trivia about this movie: Matt Damon never smiles in this film. Ever. The only smile we see is during a flash-back. Guess if you've been hunted for a while, you'd be somber too.

0062502182|1.0|We had to read this book for an English class, and at first I thought it might not be that bad: I've always enjoyed fantasy fables. But I would absolutely not recommend this book.     The plot is overly simple, basically the main character goes from A and does some stuff, then goes to B, and does more stuff, then to C, and more stuff, then back to A. The plot is moved along with the very difficult-to-swallow plot device of a series of omens that literally tell the boy where to go or what to do next. There are literally NO CHALLENGES or obstacles or problems to be resolved. All the 'obstacles' the boy faces are solved very simplistically. The boy gives the attackers some gold and they leave. Or the boy's companion makes the \\"right\\" joke and the enemies leave them alone. Or the boy beseeches the sun and wind to help him and after some talking they agree to help him. The characters are shallow and by the end of the book you have little idea of their personalities. You feel absolutely no emotional connection to the boy (aside from the \\"that sort of sounds like something I might have experienced\\" connection)    Furthermore, the book is laden with overly simplistic spiritual messages, such as how there is a universal language we all recognize, how our hearts tap into the \\"Soul of the World,\\" how the universe conspires to help you so long as you desire to achieve something. The problem is, the author tells you these messages through the direct dialogue of the characters. Literally, the boy's companion tells the boy how the universe conspires to help people who seek to achieve their \\"Personal Legends.\\" You get the feeling the characters are talking directly to you. Moreover, none of these superficial philosophical points are backed up by any sort of reasoning or examples. There is absolutely no discussion as to why this is the case, or as to possible counter-examples. That is, the characters rattle off the axioms they wish for you to believe in, and then back it up by saying it is \\"God's will,\\" or part of \\"Tradition,\\" which is an incredibly shaky and questionable way to make philosophical points.    The only conceivable reader who might enjoy this book is a young child, who might benefit from the simplistic plot and simple philosophical messages. The book almost seems like a slightly grown-up nursery tale.  Someone else who might possible enjoy the book is someone already deeply spiritual to the point that the constant deluge of spirituality is actually palpable. But in this case the book is unoriginal to the point that many of the ideas presented within will be already familiar to you.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|I went to see G.I. Joe yesterday. I wasn't expecting much from this film and, because of that, I was able to enjoy a \\"fun\\" summer movie.    The term \\"summer movie\\" never means Oscar winner but that's okay because I've come to despise the Oscars.    G.I. Joe sports an impressive cast (of cameo stars) including:    Jonathan Pryce as the President of The United States  Brendan Fraser as a G.I. Joe instructor  Arnold Vosloo as Zartan  and Kevin O'Connor as a scientist    3 of those 4 were in the first two Mummy movies directed by G.I. Joe's Stephen Sommers.    The movie itself was full of special effects. They used flashbacks as a way to tell the character stories but other than that, this was one action scene after another.    Which is perfectly fine for a summer movie.    The fighting between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow are nice to watch and the Accelerator Suit chase sequence is nice eye candy as well.    Snake Eyes doesn't talk but he is played by Ray Park (Darth Maul)    Copying the remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still, G.I. Joe's villain decides to use nanonites to eat away cities in order to rule the world.    It's up to Dennis Quaid's team of Joes to stop them.    The ending has some nice twists to it and sets up the rest of the series - you know the sequel is already being written.

Didn't like having to fast forward through each episodes credits....but it was worth it for the attention to the book.  I always liked to movie version, but this has become my new favorite.  Colin Firth played an amazing Mr. Darcy.  While reading the book I imagined the Bennett girls to be prettier, but I thought Lizzie was spot on.  Well worth it to see...just have the remote ready to fast forward through the credits.
B0042816YK|2.0|How could you go wrong with Julia Roberts? Doesn't she always make movies golden?    With Eat Pray Love, Roberts encapsulates the adult version of Bella, of Twilight. Starring as Liz Gilbert, Julia Roberts spends most of her screen time crying over the fact that she has lost herself and doesn't have a boyfriend.    Billy Crudup is Liz's husband who can't seem to settle down on any one job or idea. He is always trying new things and this unnerves Liz. So she asks for a divorce.    Soon after she leaves her husband, Liz hooks up with a young actor played by James Franco. See what happens? You sleep with Julia Roberts and, before you know it, you're nominated for an Oscar.    Liz then takes a year to find herself in Italy, India and Bali.    She eats incredibly good looking food in Europe, gets eaten by mosquitoes in India and finally ends up getting run off the road by a Gerard Butler look-a-like. Does anyone not think these two will end up together?    There are some moments that are quality movie-making, this is Julia Roberts we're talking about. But Eat Pray Love is too depressing and not romantic enough to salvage a purchase. RedBox it if you have to.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is easily not only one of the best books I've read this year, but one of the best books I've read period. I won't go as far as to say it's the best book I've ever read - largely because I'm not terribly prone to superlatives - but suffice to say, it's the kind of book we invented the written word to preserve, giving the author ample time to mull over plot intricacies and characters and turns of phrase, to write them and rewrite them until they hoist the narrative up into vivacious three-dimensional movement like a puppet from its strings.<br /><br />On the morning Daniel wakes to find he can no longer remember his deceased mother's face, his father takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. There, Daniel encounters a novel called The Shadow of the Wind by the unknown author Julian Carax. Unbeknownst to ten-year-old Daniel as he closes the covers on the story after that first voracious reading, Julian Carax's final novel becomes the catalyst that sets the rest of his life in motion.<br /><br />This is a story about ghosts - Julian Carax and the people, alive and dead, who bear his secrets. It's a story about coincidences, or fate, and the blurry line between them only clear in retrospection. It's a story about the uncanny intricacies of human connection, how the past is intrinsically interwoven with the present so that forgotten friends can become new enemies. First and foremost, it's a story about love. Love for a novel that, upon discovering that someone has been seeking out and destroying every copy of Carax's works since his inexplicable death, sends Daniel on a relentless, lifelong quest to unmask the mysterious author. Love in every conceivable form - true love, false love masquerading as true, tragic love, familial love, and love that drives a person to extremities, filling them up until it's all they have left and condemning them when it eventually runs out. It's a story about the disillusionment of realizing that, powerful as it is, love is an inept defense against many of life's darkest shadows, and that there is too often as much bad in good things as there is good. And yet it is not a bleak or hopeless tale, illustrating as it does the redemptive power of love to hold us together afterward.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is a perfect example of a whole becoming more than the some of its (impressive) parts. It's part mystery, part historical fiction, part portrait of a city (Barcelona emerging from the wreckage of the World Wars hot on the heels of the Spanish Civil War), and part love story. Zaf&oacute;n's writing is poetic without being longwinded, powerful without being overbearing. His characterization leaves little room for categorization - in the course of the novel, you find yourself pitying and empathizing with villains, questioning and reproaching protagonists. He imparts wisdom - disguised as fathers, sons, and old friends, the institutionalized and the demoralized - without being heavy-handed, and executes breathtaking (literally - I gasped audibly several times while reading) action scenes and plot twists without a shred of melodrama. Daniel's investigation intertwines the lives and fates of himself and Carax to the point where it becomes hard to discern deft parallelism from outright confluence of identity. Dissected, The Shadow of the Wind is all these things. Savored and digested, it is more.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is a novel so multi-faceted that in the course of reading it I experienced three sentiments somewhat rare to me: Before I had even finished it the first time through, I wanted to start rereading it so as to fully absorb and appreciate its every nuance; somewhere around the halfway point it had already made in onto my shortlist of awe-inducing books; and, like Daniel for Julian Carax, I was bent on tracking down more of Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's work. All three were dangerous conclusions to make before the denouement - which so often disappoints, evenin the best of books - but I needn't have wasted a moment's worry. Closing The Shadow of the Wind and setting it down in my lap, I actually had to inhale deeply to catch my breath.sted a moment's worry.

0312600844|5.0|Pat's psychological trauma and obessesion from her unadorned childhood have driven awary her loving husband and beloved son, both of whom have issues of their own.

0440244870|2.0|Ok, I have to start out by saying this is not my normal type of literature.  For one its about shopping and unless its fabric or crafty type stuff, I'm not a good shopper.  But I decided to ignore this fact and instead focused on all the recommendations and good reviews this book had gotten.  What on earth were those people thinking?<br /><br />Rebecca Bloomwood is a young shopping loving person that lives in London in one of its most popular neighborhoods.  She lives for for shopping and frequently comes home with her special finds that she really can't afford.  That's ok though, she's going to win the lottery, or marry rich, or some other scheme that appears throughout the book will give her loads of cash.  Problem is reality means that she is still a journalist for a financial magazine (not a good fit at all) and isn't very good at much else.  But when she starts being chased by Visa and the bank she has to find a way to get herself out of debt and maybe find love in the process, or a good pair of shoes, it doesn't really matter to her.<br /><br />I have to say that there really aren't any good characters in this book.  They are all shallow and conceited and Rebecca herself is the cream of the crop.  While I'm sure the author tried to instill something in her worthwhile, I'm of the opinion that she failed.  Not only is Rebecca a compulsive liar, she also takes advantage of those who care about her and only want the best.  She can't even tell them the truth.  To top it off when she does finally do something nice, it is still more for her than to help anybody else.  To see her rewarded for these heinous behaviours was almost more than I could bear.<br /><br />The writing itself is ok.  Kinsella chose to use letters (from debt collections) interspersed with the novel and also included lists of costs obtained by Rebecca as well to illustrate her debt and spending habits.  She puts a good deal of detail in and that is commendable.  In fact, the only reason I'm giving the book two stars is because I actually learned a little bit about designer clothes from the book. It also is a pretty good description for people affected by compulsive behaviors like shopping.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be taking a look at the rest of the series.  I'm not sure my blood pressure could handle seeing Rebecca up to her exploits and behaviors in more books.  I suppose this is good fluff reading for some, but I'll take a pass.<br /><br />Confessions of a Shopaholic<br />Copyright 2001<br />350 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B001OQCV6A|3.0|The latest version of Sherlock Holmes has the typical British fast-speak with American action.    Robert Downey Jr stars and the logical, quick-tongued Holmes and Jude Law co-stars as the gambling-addict Dr Watson.    Downey and Law have some good chemistry with each other which is a lot better than the relationship between Holmes and Rachel McAdams as the pick-pocket Irene Adler. Didn't director Guy Ritchey remember her from Red Eye?    If you are a Sherlock Holmes purist, you will probably not enjoy this action-adventure version and should stick with the BBC productions.    This is not an origin story. The story picks up as if you should already know everything about the characters. If that's a good thing or a bad thing is up to you. Don't expect every character trait to be explained or every relationship's past to be explored.    Outside of how great an actor Downey is, I loved the foreshadowing to the sequel involving the greatest arch-nemesis. (If there will be a sequel)    Bottom line: a reboot/introduction of Holmes to a new era but not for those who read the books every year.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|Rejoice all you blu-ray owners, the Alien blu-ray Anthology is here and lives up to it's name. For any of you who have not seen these films (which are excellent, by the way) you can fear not, as I'm reviewing the product, not the films themselves. In short: No Spoilers in this review!<br /><br />The packaging is outstanding and was defect free when received. The outer cover picturing the Xenomorph (the alien) is gorgeous. Inside the films are enclosed in a book-like holder that is lithographed with photos from the films and the teaser information from the original movie cover-backs. All in all it's exceptionally well done and a definite upgrade from the DVD Alien Quadrilogy release a few years ago. While aesthetically it looks the same, feels the same, and has all the features of the Alien Quadrilogy release the blu-ray upgrade is noticeably better in both picture and sound on my HDTV and 5.1 surround system.<br /><br />My only gripes with the Alien Anthology release are the way the discs are placed inside the holder they could scratch over time with repeated use. I'm assured that blu-ray discs are exceptionally scratch resistant but in my opinion this could be done better as a preventative measure. The only other thing is the upgraded codecs for the films will not work unless your blu-ray has had a software upgrade. As such some first generation blu-ray's I've heard of having a big problem with that. My Samsung HB-500 is internet connected and the upgrade took less than a minute. For me it isn't a problem but for some folks who may live out of reach of a high-speed internet connection (there are still internet dark-zones out there, don't let anyone fool you) will not be able to play the collection on their systems. I don't quite understand the need to have devices that require an upgrade of this kind with new releases. DVD never had this problem and I feel it's a gross oversight with companies scrabbling over giving the newest features to users.<br /><br />Don't let my review fool you. It's a great product and for the significantly reduced prices that Amazon offers it's a little easier to justify than $140 at Best Buy.It's a great product and for the significantly reduced prices that Amazon offers it's a little easier to justify than $140 at Best Buy.

B002XMGGK6|1.0|The lines of what makes a good guy and a bad guy are blurred in this ultra-violent/too-much-swearing film, Law Abiding Citizen.    Gerard Butler stars as Clyde Shelton who is forced to watch his wife and daughter get murdered in the first 3 minutes of the film. (Forgive me but I thought Butler looked like the brother of Tom Green)    Jamie Foxx plays as Nick Rice, the DA who prides himself in his high conviction rate.    The murderers were apprehended but the one who did the actual killing makes a deal with Rice to witness against the other guy in order to get a lesser punishment (3 years in jail).    Shelton is outraged and plans his revenge.    10 years pass, the murderer is out of jail - still as nasty as ever - when he gets a phone call. Turns out to be Shelton who kidnaps him and dismembers him in front of a camera.    The police come, arrest Shelton, lock him in jail and thus begins the cat and mouse game.    Somehow people involved in the Shelton murder case are getting killed. All evidence points to Clyde...but he's behind bars. Who's his accomplice and how many have to die before Nick is targeted?    I found this movie to be overly graphic. I didn't need to see Butler repeatedly jab a steak bone in the neck of a guy. Nor did I need to see what a body looks like without arms, legs or a head.    I also hated the language in this film. I felt like I was watching Get Short or some similar film with the number of F words being thrown around like popcorn.    Law Abiding Citizen tries to tell a morality tale about the flaws of the justice system of The United States, but the moral is lost when the story is too lame.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|i have been reading other reviews, some stuff i agree to others no. i thought that like the other books it was interesting and enjoyable at the begginning. after that the author just pushes the book along to event to event leaving no time to think. but even that wasnt the worst. THE WORST PART OF THIS BOOK WAS THE ENDING! the whole last part of the book was like the author had a deadline and tried to rush the book to end. she completely ruined it. she took all of the evnts and tryed to cram them all together in one chapter. and then in the very last chapter she ends it saying that everything in the world is horrible and that theres no hope. i mean really...
B0025KW29U|3.0|If only this thing had been an extra 15-20 minutes longer, with an ending that compared to the rest of the content, I would have given it 5 stars. I really did enjoy everything until the last 5 minutes. I know that may seem a bit drastic to deduct 2 stars from my rating over 5 minutes, but endings are very important to me. That's the last thing you see before the show/movie/whatever is over. If I am left with a crappy ending then I don't get the consolation of more content. Instead I have to sit there brooding over the lack of effort put into that ending.    I was also confused by what the Blu-Ray box said on the back. It showed 92 minutes of content, which I take to mean the show itself is 92 minutes long and the 90+ minutes of bonus material is separate. Perhaps I misread it, but if it does say 92 minutes then why the hell is it only 40 something?     Like I said before, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the show. Everyone has a fairly decent voice, especially NPH. I suppose it's no surprise he has a nice voice considering his time on Broadway. I loved the way Horrible interacted with Hammer, and Hammer's over-the-top macho attitude towards women had me going a bit as well. The music for each piece was great, and I even listened to the lyrics, which normally I don't bother with in any song. This aside, I don't regret giving this show 3 stars. I really expected more from Joss Whedon with all the other works he's done. My girlfriend and I were actually sitting there for a while watching the credits, hoping that it was a fake ending because I honestly felt as though zero effort was put into that ending.

B0021L8V1G|4.0|With this review of Iron Man 2, I have seen the film twice in theaters.    The sequel is following in the steps of recent blockbuster sequels in that it has so many storylines to follow. (even though the director mentioned they wanted to keep things simple)    While not as complex as Batman Begins, Iron Man 2 is full of new characters and actions scenes. The additional action scenes are a warm welcome to the lack from the first film while some of the new characters were a painful need.    Robert Downey Jr returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man. With fame all around, Stark must deal with his mortality as the power source in his chest is slowly poisoning him to death.    Don Cheadle fills in as Col. Rhodes. I like this actor switch. Cheadle brings a weight that \\"that other guy\\" missed. In this film, we get to see War Machine in his full glory: guns blazing and heavy duty explosions.    Scarlett Johansson star as Black Widow even though they never use this name in the film. She is part of SHIELD and is tasked with keeping an eye on Stark. She has a dizzying fight scene near the end of the film.    In fact, if the entire movie had the thrill of the last few minutes, this movie would be truly epic.    Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts and is given the job as Stark Industry CEO. The quick banter between Potts and Stark returns but their chemistry is on the short side (once again victim of too many new characters)    Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's main business rival. I suppose you could call him a villain but he just wanted to be the country's main source of weapons. I think there was too much Rockwell in this movie...too much not-funny Rockwell.    Mickey Rourke is the main villain in Iron Man 2. He's on a vengeance kick against Stark because of some bad family blood with their respected fathers. I still don't get why this guy is seen as such a good actor.    Samuel L Jackson returns as Nick Fury. At this point every character is Jackson regardless of the character's name. Supposedly Jackson got the studio to contract him into 9 films in order to be in this film. Ego much?    Iron Man 2 doesn't quick live up to the hype but it was some big hype. The final battle scenes make the entire movie. It seems as if Jon Favreau took the criticism from the first movie (poor final battle) and upped the octane.
B0044KU7KU|1.0|Talk about a band with an identity crisis, what the hell happened here, this was a band on the verge of greatness that kept evolving from album to album, The Black Parade was a masterpiece that showed the evolution of the band from a fairly straightforward punk/emo/ metal sound to an anthemic,rock/punk band with more mature lyrics and compostions yet still \\"true\\", there are two things that describe all their previous releases, they were 1)unique 2)cohesive, this album is neither, it's a hodgepodge that's all over the map, simplistic punk songs,crappy ballads, even crappier 80s sounding pop songs, stupid narrations, stupid album title. I didn't think they would top The Black Parade, yet I also didn't think they would \\"de-volve\\" this badly, especially given the long 4 year wait. If this album could be summed up in one word it would be \\"schizophrenic\\". What a disappointment from a band I had high hopes for, these guys need to seriously get back to the drawing board and decide who they want to be.  Sure , there are a few good songs on here, but even the best ones don't compare to what they have done in the past,....overall, this ones a STINKER.

B00428CCPW|5.0|I bought this item for my father as a Christmas gift. For one, the artwork is spectacular that Taylor designed herself, and the sound is incredible. Taylor Swift made a big deal about having this album on Vinyl, I understand why. Great music, I'm impressed.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I have been a priest fan since the 70's and was very disappointed with the late 80's early 90's pop metal. This is bloody brilliant very complex, thoughtful, and Rob Halford has not sounded this good in years (I recommend his Christmas album from last year by the way).   I am not sure if they were trying to mimic my favorite current metal artist Avantasia or not? If they were then they really one upped Tobias with their version of a metal opera. This double set will definitely be staying in heavy rotation for awhile. Highly recommend to anyone who loved the first 5 or 6 priest albums and Rob Halford.

0201633612|5.0|It is difficult to add to the praises for \\"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\\" and its authors.  For me professionally, this book revealed a new point of view, and transformed my thinking.  Where I had relied on experience and similarity to design IT solutions, it revealed the elementary patterns behind the problems and their solutions.  This allowed me to design solutions to business and technical problems where my experience was light or the similarity was partial.<br />In this book, the authors laid a foundation for large-scale assembly-based IT approaches.  I successfully used their guidance to assemble new IT solutions, beginning with components and services.  In recent years, I focused on applying the assembly-based approach to IT capabilities and business capabilities to achieve greater IT flexibility and business agility.<br />This book remains as applicable today as when it was first published.  If you are responsible for architecting, designing, constructing, testing, or managing new IT solutions, you must have this valuable reference book.  I've recommended this book to many colleagues.  I am very please to recommend it now.<br />__Joseph Starwood
0553381407|5.0|In a way, this book changed my whole life.  After reading this book 20 years ago, I finally got the courage to get help after years spent suffering but too afraid to do something to change my life.  The author describes exactly what goes on in dysfunctional homes and the consequences in a way that to me was like someone had experienced it right along side me and understood how I felt. I was impressed that the author does not come across as judgmental or stereotyping like so many therapists and doctors, but understanding and aware of the differences in people and how they react to being raised in a toxic family. I have come such a long way since I read this book. In looking now to buy this book for someone else, I want to share how much it helped me.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who has suffered abuse as a child and adult.  I only wish I had read this book when I was much younger.

1608191664|5.0|The 2008 'Great Recession' demands re-examination of prevailing economic thought - the dominant paradigm (post 1970's conservative free-market capitalism) not only failed to predict the crisis, but also said it couldn't occur in today's free markets, thanks to Adam Smith's 'invisible hand.'  Ha-Joon Chang provides that re-examination in his \\"23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism.\\" Turns out that the reason Adam Smith's hand was not visible is that it wasn't there. Chang, economics professor at the University of Cambridge, is no enemy of capitalism, though he contends its current conservative version should be made better. Conventional wisdom tells us that left alone, markets produce the most efficient and just outcomes - 'efficient' because businesses and individuals know best how to utilize their resources, and 'just' because they are rewarded according to their productivity. Following this advice, countries have deregulated businesses, reduced taxes and welfare, and adopted free trade. The results, per Chang, has been the opposite of what was promised - slower growth and rising inequality, often masked by rising credit expansion and increased working hours. Alternatively, developing Asian countries that grew fast did so following a different version of capitalism, though to be fair China's version to-date has also produced much greater inequality.  The following summarizes some of Chang's points:<br /><br />1)\\"There is no such thing as a free market\\" - we already have hygiene standards in restaurants, ban child labor, pollution, narcotics, bribery, and dangerous workplaces, require licenses for professions such as doctors, lawyers, and brokers, and limit immigration. In 2008, the U.S. used at least $700 billion of taxpayers' money to buy up toxic assets, justified by President Bush on the grounds that it was a necessary state intervention consistent with free-market capitalism. Chang's conclusion - free-marketers contending that a certain regulation should not be introduced because it would restrict market freedom are simply expressing political opinions, not economic facts or laws.<br /><br />2)\\"Companies should not be run in the interest of their owners.\\" Shareholders are the most mobile of corporate stakeholders, often holding ownership for but a fraction of a second (high-frequency trading represents 70% of today's trading). Shareholders prefer corporate strategies that maximize short-term profits and dividends, usually at the cost of long-term investments. (This often also includes added leverage and risk, and reliance on socializing risk via 'too big to fail' status, and relying on 'the Greenspan put.') Chang adds that corporate limited liability, while a boon to capital accumulation and technological progress, when combined with professional managers instead of entrepreneurs owning a large chunk (eg. Ford, Edison, Carnegie) and public shares with smaller voting rights (typically limited to 10%), allows professional managers to maximize their own prestige via sales growth and prestige projects instead of maximizing profits. Another negative long-term outcome driven by shareholders is increased share buybacks (less than 5% of profits until the early 1980s, 90% in 2007, and 280% in 2008) - one economist estimates that had GM not spent $20.4 billion on buybacks between 1986 and 2002 it could have prevented its 2009 bankruptcy. Short-term stockholder perspectives have also brought large-scale layoffs from off-shoring. Governments of other countries encourage longer-term thinking by holding large shares in key enterprises (China Mobile, Renault, Volkswagen), providing greater worker representation (Germany's supervisory boards), and cross-shareholding among friendly companies (Japan's Toyota and its suppliers).<br /><br />7)\\"Free-market policies rarely make poor countries rich.\\" With a few exceptions, all of today's rich countries, including Britain and the U.S., reached that status through protectionism, subsidies, and other policies that they and their IMF, WTO, and World Bank now advise developing nations not to adopt. Free-market economists usually respond that the U.S. succeeded despite, not because of, protectionism. The problem with that explanation is the number of other nations paralleling the early growth strategy of the U.S. and Britain (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan), and the fact that apparent exceptions (Hong Kong, Switzerland, The Netherlands) did so by ignoring foreign patents (a free-market 'no-no'). Chang believes the 'official historians' of capitalism have been very successful re-writing its history, akin to someone trying to 'kick away the ladder' with which they had climbed to the top. He also points out that developing nations that stick to their Ricardian 'comparative advantage,' per the conservatives prescription, condemn themselves to their economic status quo.<br /><br />9)\\"We do not live in a post-industrial age.\\" Most of the fall in manufacturing's share of total output is not due to a fall in the quantity of manufactured goods, but due to the fall in their prices relative to those for services, caused by their faster productivity growth. A small part of deindustrialization is due to outsourcing of some 'manufacturing' activities that used to be provided in-house - eg. catering and cleaning. Those advising the newly developing nations to skip manufacturing and go directly to providing services forget that many services mainly serve manufacturing firms (finance, R&D, design), and that since services are harder to export, such an approach will create balance-of-payment problems. (Chang's preceding points directly contradict David Ricardo's law of comparative advantage - a fundamental free market precept. Chang's example of how Korea built Pohang Steel into a strong economic producer, despite lacking experienced managers and natural resources, is another.)<br /><br />10)\\"The U.S. does not have the highest living standard in the world.\\" True, the average U.S. citizen has greater command over goods and services than his counterpart in almost any other country, but this is due to higher immigration, poorer employment conditions, and working longer hours for many vs. their foreign counterparts. The U.S. also has poorer health indicators and worse crime statistics. We do have the world's second highest income per capita - Luxemburg's higher, but measured in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) the U.S. ranks eighth. (The U.S. doesn't have the fastest growing economy either - China is predicted to pass the U.S. in PPP this coming decade.) Chang's point here is that we should stop assuming the U.S. provides the best economic model. (This is already occurring - the World Bank's chief economist, Justin Lin, comes from China.)<br /><br />12)\\"Governments can pick winners.\\" Chang cites examples of how the Korean government built world-class producers of steel (POSCO), shipbuilding (Hyundai), and electronics (LG), despite lacking raw materials or experience for those sectors. True, major government failures have occurred - Europe's Concorde, Indonesia's aircraft industry, Korea's promotion of aluminum smelting, and Japan's effort to have Nissan take over Honda; industry, however, has also failed - eg. the AOL-Time Warner merger, and the Daimler-Chrysler merger. Austria, China, Finland, France, Japan, Norway, Singapore (in numerous other areas), and Taiwan have also done quite well with government-picked winners. Another problem is that business and national interests sometimes clash - eg. American firms' massive outsourcing has undermined the national interest of maintaining full employment. (However, greater unbiased U.S. government involvement would be difficult due to the 10,000+ corporate lobbyists and billions in corporate campaign donations - $500 million alone from big oil in 2009-10.) Also interesting to Chang is how conservative free marketing bankers in the U.S. linedup for mammoth low-cost loans from the Federal Reserve at the beginning of the Great Recession. Government planning allows minimizing excess capacity, maximizing learning-curve economies and economies of scale and scope; operational performance is enhanced by also forcing government-owned or supported firms into international competition. Government intervention (loans, tariffs, subsidies, prohibiting exports of needed raw materials, building infrastructure) are necessary for emerging economies to move into more sophisticated sectors.<br /><br />13)\\"Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer.\\" 'Trickle-down' economics is based on the belief that the poor maximize current consumption, while the rich, left to themselves, mostly invest.  However, the years 1950-1973 saw the highest-ever growth rates in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, despite increased taxation of the rich. Before the 'Golden Age,' per capita income grew at 1-1.5%/year; during the Golden Age it grew at 2-3% in the U.S. Since then, tax cuts for the rich and financial deregulation have allowed greater paychecks for top managers and financiers, and between 1979 and 2006 the top 0.1% increased their share of national income from 3.5% to 11.6%. The result - investment as a ratio of national output has fallen in all rich economies and the pace at which the total economic pie grew decreased.<br /><br />14)\\"U.S. managers are over-priced.\\" First, relative to their predecessors (about 10X those in the 1960s; now 300-400X the average worker), despite the latter having run companies more successfully, in relative terms. Second, compared to counterparts in other rich countries - up to 20X. (Third, compared to counterparts in developing nations - eg. JPMorgan Chase, world's 4th largest bank, paid its CEO $19.6 million in 2008, vs. the CEO of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's largest, being paid $234,700.) American CEOs do not get punished for bad management either - instead receiving raises and restated stock options, or at least loan forgiveness and golden parachutes. (Collusion among CEO members of interlocking 'rubber-stamp' boards fed limited information is one reason for excessive U.S. CEO pay; lack of stockholder interest, thanks to being paid high and rising dividends, a short-term strategy, is another.) Chang asks, rhetorically, \\"If American CEOs are worth so much, how come their companies have been losing out to foreign competitors?\\" (And why aren't they investing like their foreign counterparts, instead of sitting on some $2 trillion in current assets?)<br /><br />17)\\"More education in itself is not going to make a country richer.\\" Increasing deindustrialization and automation have lowered knowledge requirements for most jobs in rich countries. The East Asian miracle economies turned in their impressive early gains despite literacy rates of about 50%, and Korean public schools had class sizes of 90; conversely, countries like the Philippines and Argentina did poorly despite having significantly better-educated populations, while Sub-Saharan Africa per capita income fell 0.3%/year from 1980-2004 despite literacy rates rising from 40% to 61%. Harvard economist Lant Pritchett analyzed data from 1960-87 and found very little evidence supporting the view that increased education leads to higher economic growth. Most education isn't even meant to raise productivity, and math/science courses are not relevant for most. Switzerland is one of the richest and most industrialized countries, but also has the lowest university enrollment in the rich world. (College education in the U.S. has already become a bubble - about half our graduates take jobs not requiring such education.)<br /><br />Chang's recommendations include ending our \\"love affair with unrestrained, free-market capitalism and installing a better-regulated variety,\\" having government become more active in economic affairs, and making financial markets less attractive. (U.S. financial assets/GDP exceeded 900% by the early 2000s, averaged 4-12% return since deregulation - higher than most non-financial firms at between 2-5%, and divert attention from manufacturing and its potentially much larger employment. Methods of doing so include taxing market transactions, banning short-selling and derivatives, and limiting bank leverage.)<br /><br />Bottom-Line: Chang's one shortcoming is ignoring/understating the large negative impact of large trade deficits on the U.S. - this sometimes skews his assessment of the impact of other factors. Overall, however, \\"23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism\\" provides a sorely needed approach to economic decision-making - using data rather than ideology.  Readers will be left wondering why Chang or other Asians don't win the Nobel prize in economics - it's their economies that have been transforming the world for last 50 years, not the free-market conservative capitalist economies of the U.S. or Europe.deral Reserve at the beginning of the Great Recession.

1600242405|5.0|A long family drive from St Louis to San Antonio, and back, was made enjoyable listening to this book.  Teenagers and adults laughed aloud, chuckled, turned off the CD player to fill in history for the kids, shared current goings with parents, and grew closer to each other while listening to Keith's long (22 plus hours!) audio book.  Yet, I almost didn't give my husband the book  before the trip, knowing that if I did, I would be listening to it for an entire day of my life.  I'm not a Rolling Stones fan.  I'm a 53 year old, mostly conservative Christian who grew up listening to the Carpenters! Also, we had a 14 year-old and a 19 year-old in the car with us, and I knew that Keith Richard's life had parts with which I was not going to be pleased.  However, I had no idea how good an honest portrayal of his crazy and interesting life could be.  I think I enjoyed this audiobook even more than my husband.  The key--Mr. Richards' sense of humor about himself and his life made a strong impression.  Although you cannot call Mr. Richards humble, his ability to laugh at himself and his circumstances not only makes this book enjoyable, it also makes Keith tolerable, and I think it is the secret to his amazingly long life (considering the circumstances).    CAVEAT EMPTOR:  Much of the language is foul, repeatedly.  Many of the situations are foul, too.  This book is not for younger than teen children, nor is it OK for all teens. [Our two teen passengers have a nurse and a doctor for parents, and are the youngest of five kids, and have literally grown up hearing gross and upsetting stories about surgeries, patients and life.]  It isn't for all adults either.  If you cannot put aside your prejudices about others' behavior to listen--really listen--to his story, this story is not for you.    But if you love a good tale about LIFE--the juicy and slimy parts as well as the sweet parts, and the horrifying parts with the touching ones--this audiobook just might be the right thing foryour next long journey.    Another odd thing, though:  Johnny Depp narrates part of the CDs, but suddenly it sounds as if Keith Richards is reading his own tale, then back to Johnny...some voices and characters switch in ways that aren't always immediately clear.  Then at the end, in comes Keith again, but you realize it isn't the \\"Keith\\" that you heard earlier...so which one is the real one??  It seems to be Johnny Depp at the end again.  That is confusing. [Not sure if that is the part that Amazon.com is checking into right now...it was weird.]    However, any story about a 66 year old who should have died a bunch of times over...and yet LIVES...really LIVES...and loves, warts and all...and ends with some tips on how to cook your bangers and mash...well, that is a REAL story--worth your time.
0307454541|3.0|I have been wanting to read this book for awhile now, everyone keeps talking about this series and how great it is and I wanted to see for myself if it was as really good as they claimed it was.  I am not a big fan of the thriller genera.  In my opinion it is hard to create something in this category that is different, new and exciting.  My expectations for this book were not very high.  To my disbelief I found myself liking the story line.  The decades old disappearance of successful businessman Henrik Vanger's niece Harriet has haunted him and become his obsession.  When he enlists the help of Mikael Blomkvist, a struggling journalist who has recently gotten himself in a bit of a bind, Blomkvist finds himself looking at the mystery with a fresh perspective and starts to find new information in the case.  He finds himself needing the unique talents of Lisbeth Salander, a tattoo multipierced young woman who has major social and authority issues.  The pair begin to discover that this disappearance is more detailed and bizarre than they could have ever imagined.<br /><br />I don't think it is the best book I have ever read but I did enjoy parts of it.  I was impressed with the translation, I found for the most part that the language flowed well and it did not seem choppy as with other translated books I have read.  I also enjoyed the setting of the novel, I found the information about Sweden to be interesting and original. Sweden is not the most popular place to set a novel in so that made the book different. I really thought that the character of Lisbeth Salander was unique, I have never quite read a character like her, the way her mind works is fascinating and her thought process is intense.  Her ability to disconnect herself from harsh situations and people makes her a new and exciting heroine.  I would read the other books in this series just to learn more about her, and see how she is developed in other books.<br /><br />On the other hand, some of the things that I did not like about this novel were I found the beginning to be a bit distracting. I know it is necessary for the author to create the storyline and introduce the cast of characters but the first 50 pages or so are very hard to get into and there are a series of different plot lines going that are hard to connect for the reader.  The character of Mikael Blomkvist also got on my nerves at times.  I found myself sympathizing with him for the situation he finds himself in at the beginning of the novel and I think he has a good deal of integrity, but I do not think it is necessary for him to sleep with every woman that comes into this life.  I found this to be distracting and unrealistic from the rest of the story.<br /><br />The mystery itself is decent. I enjoyed the Vanger families dirty laundry and there were some good plot twists in the book.  I know that some people found it to be overly grotesque and disturbing but I thought it could probably be worse.  Overall, if you are a big fan of thrillers I think that you would enjoy this book and the rest of the series.  I will probably be reading the next two books to find out more about Lisbeth Salander a truly unique and exciting character.e about this novel were I found the beginning to be a bit distracting.

Hardly a reference manual (I mean that in a good way) and not a silly little pocket guide.     I highly recommend it to beginning web dudes and experts alike.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The most important thing to say when concerning Pride and Prejudice is that there are many versions of the story, some are better than others.  Of course everyone, especially the devout Jane Austen fans will say that they best version of the story is the 1995 version with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle.  I have to agree with them, it is the gold standard when it comes to Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />I was convinced that I was going to hate this version.  At first I could not see Matthew Macfayden as Mr. Darcy, it just did not seem right to me.  Not to mention the fact that it would be a shorter movie so I felt that it probably would not do the book justice.  After the first time I watched it, I thought it was okay.  I found the dialogue fast-paced, and I thought they left some major scenes out. I also thought that people who were not familiar with the story might get confused as somethings were not explained very well or misleading.<br /><br />The second time I watched it, I don't know what happened but it all fell together better and it was like magic.  I fell in love with Matthew Macfayden as Mr. Darcy (he almost peaks Colin Firth in my opinion) and the chemistry he has with Keira Knightley is just electric.  From their first meeting, the atmosphere is so charged with it the audience can feel it. If you step away from the plot, and look at the movie by itself it just shines, even though they stray from the book how they present the story is just lovely, and maybe more relatible to us today.  My heart still flutters at the end of the movie in the early morning when Mr. Darcy comes to speak with Elizabeth again.  I find myself sobbing, even though I have watched it countless times.<br /><br />Even though, the 1995 version is the best made from the screenplay by Andrew Davies to the acting and costume this version starring Matthew Macfayden and Keira Knightley offers a different perspective to the story that is fresh and exciting and is well worth watching.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|If you have not seen a good, wholesome, family movie in a while-get this one and watch it! It will remind you of what life is all about. Loyalty, love, truth, honesty, faith, family, friends, holding fast to what is right and true. You don't have to watch it at Christmas to get the point of this movie.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Great movie! I saw it in theaters before purchasing the video. It arrived, as all movies should, wrapped and unopened. The quality of the DVD is fine.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|i gotta admit i liked this korean film about a man who has been  held captive for 15 years.Once out he seeks out to destroy his captors.A friendly waitress helps him through his journey of mayhem.The scene where he eats a live octopus is revolting and there are scenes that are ultraviolent.The dialoque is funny and at times i had a hard time keeping a straight face.Its in an enjoyable way...The sex scene between the two is unintentually funny.It runs 2 hours but its a movie that will stay with you long after the credits role....enjoy and i hope others find this film funny in parts as i did.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|what a dissappointment. i domt know how people thought that was a good ending. i wont spoil it for others so all i will say is there was almost no point to this last book. the ending ruined the series for me. i loved the first two and expected her to finally take control of her life in the third. its like the author just got bored
B002ZG981E|5.0|There has been movies that deal with layers of reality before and even dreams-within-dreams. Remember the endings of Men in Black i & 2? Or even Tron and Tron Legacy? And then there was The 13th Floor, where the reality had a boundary, and the characters could see it.     Inception brought the concept to another level and made each reality affect the other like a domino. If you believe in karma, then you can see the direct results of cause and effect, layer upon layer. The director makes you think, makes you pay attention and dares you to blink - because, if you do, you probably will lose it all and get totally confused. De Caprio, as usual, does a good job out of fleshing out his character, but what the heck I'm a de Caprio fan anyway. But I suspect, when he was peddling his skills about subconscious extraction, he was trying very hard to keep a straight face...    The great intercuts and fast editing keep the audience on its toes; the glass-shattering soundtrack (listen to those giant French horns!) is only matched by that in Tron Legacy, but where storyline goes, Inception comes up tops. You need a really solid sound system with great bass to really enjoy this!    One beef: I got the BD, DVD, Digital Copy combo, and I suspect the engineers deliberately produced a DVD of lesser quality just to show off the quality of the Blue Ray. When playing the DVD, the banding on my tv was totally unacceptable. Technology has produced audio and video to the limits of human sight and hearing, and I'm afraid those clever people producing tvs, players and recorders are going to produce more and more sub-standard DVDs just to make us switch to the pricier medium. I hope there are people out there who keep an eye on such things...    That said, I am watching Inception over and over again, like Mal trying to return to her dream. Maybe my reality is elsewhere too?    This is the first time that I am giving 5 stars to any movie; it's going to be a long time before I will rate a movielike that again.    Go watch it.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This movie is confusing the first time. After watching it twice? I can grasp it enough to understand all through the film. If I watched it more. I would most likely get even more out of it. I only rented it for 48hrs. Will I buy it? No. It is cool conceptually, though. It seems to miss the mark a bit w/me by being too heavy on the loud action scenes, & a little light on substance.     SPOILER_SPOILER_SPOILER:      An enjoyable movie. Except for the \\"Let's screw w/everyone\\" ending.
B0045HCJ6M|2.0|Camelot is a magical tale, wrapped in mists and wonder... but what happens when they do a transfer for DVD to be played on today's hi-res tvs? They remove the mist where possible, increase the contrast and black content and totally remove the magic from the movie. As a result, Vanessa Redgraves' glowing complexion becomes muddy and solid, Richard Harries' blue eyeshadow looks like two black eyes and the things that look best are the wonderful details of the costumes. This should really be a brochure for the costume design.    Add to that, a tinny 5.1 soundtrack that lacks kick and muster, and you have a dead movie - one that caters to the people who just want to know how sharp their tvs are, not for those who enjoy a good movie. (Surprisingly enough, the isolated music soundtrack was rich and full, but can someone tell me how to turn on both at once?)    I am usually very kind in my movie reviews, but this is really too much.    Stick to the laserdisc if you want to enjoy Camelot.    PS. Watch out for Amadeus - they killed it for digital tv too!

B001DMJ9R4|4.0|I purchased this cd/dvd as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend's son because it was on his Christmas list.  I don't listen to this music as a rule.  From what I understand, he LOVED it...and so did my boyfriend.
B0040JHXT8|2.0|Any release of previously unreleased tracks by any artist is a crap shoot. In this case, the dice roll has come \\"snake eyes - you lose!\\" I can see the reason why the tracks that were released were and why these weren't. Jon Landau had an astute ear for knowing which songs were ready to see the light of day and which ones weren't.    While die-hard Sprinsteen fans will ultimately enjoy hearing new-old music from the boss, someone like myself with a more balanced approach finds a lot of these tracks lackluster.    And maybe the bigger disappointment is the compressed muddy sound. Unlike other artists whose releases from the vaults often sparkle with a refreshing lack of over-production (most notable The Beatles Anthology), these tracks sound like they're floating in mud. And since thsse tracks were recorded professionally there's no excuse for that. The released tracks are clearly sonically superior to this dreck. \\"Caveat emptor.\\" And if you don't know that means, look it up on yahoo or google.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|They are what u expect out of 3 films...one being very popular and the last 2 being mediocre...sound I'd awesome on all 3 but picture quality is only improved on the first while the other 2 are slightly...if your a big fan, go ahead and get them for the low price...if you'd being introduced to the series, then find the MGM trilogy on DVD that was released 5or6 years ago...price is probably lower and quality is pretty close to these.

B0044IJ1S6|5.0|Depeche Mode did make one more fantastic performance. They maintained the formation without a women backing vocal as performed in the Touring the Angel. Martin Gore and Peter Gardeno(keyboards) given a perfect support for that to Dave Gahan. The audience could participate in the performance of the best hits like a 'Policy of Truth', 'Enjoy the Silence', 'Never Let Me Down Again', 'Precious' and the new songs. So, the Depeche Mode can prove that the time of presentation on the road improve this magnificent band.

0596009208|3.0|I'm a programming/Java beginner, using Head First Java to start out my newly selected career in programming. I've taken some basic programming classes in high school and college, but still a relative newbie.<br /><br />There are TONS of great reviews for Head First Java. And with good reason. It's easy to digest, sometimes overly so, beating simple concepts into readers' heads over and over again. Instead of reading something that looks like this:<br /><br />fasle;jfe jefrjf wejeiofja esfoewfje efjiofef eif efjaweoa asefjeo awejfe ej<br /><br />for pages and pages and pages on end, the book utilizes pictures, arrows, sidebar comments, subheadings, the whole shabang, resulting in a much easier read than:<br /><br />fasle;jfe jefrjf wejeiofja esfoewfje efjiofef eif.<br /><br />What I don't understand is that anyone who is trying to wrap ther brains around new concepts, especially in programming, knows that learning requires EXERCISE. The only remotely close thing to actual programming practices are fill-in-the-blanks, match code to output, pool puzzles, etc. While this may be nice mental exercise, it IS NOT real programming, and the concepts it introduces chapter-by-chapter are far too easily forgotten by the next one.<br /><br />I've done it myself. It's a nice read, but if you're serious about learning Java from the beginning of your programming career, GET A BOOK THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES YOU TO PROGRAM.
0811876373|1.0|I've visited Bakerella's site a few times and have seen her work in the occasional magazine so I decided to purchase her book this past weekend in support of a fellow home-grown foodie.  Unfortunately, I found two main problems with this book.      First, the samples and projects she provides are very basic and, to be honest, kind of boring.  You can find them on a website for free.  I fully expected to see directions for more complicated and challenging work but this book seemed to republish things that have already been readily available.  I wanted college and this was kindergarten...again.    Second, and most importantly, the writing in this book was awful.  The majority of every \\"recipe\\" was the same and it was only the last 1 or 2 lines that would really be unique to that project.  How many times do you need to write a whole paragraph about how to insert a stick into a cake ball?  Ugh.  Perhaps they needed to make this book length?  Perhaps they needed to justify the price?  Perhaps they rushed in the creation of this book in order to ride the cake pop wave before it ends?  I love Cake Pops but after reading the first 4 or 5 projects I was beyond irritated with the unnecessarily, overcomplicated way in which this book was written.      Bakerella is a very gifted food artist.  She really undersold her talent and her fans with this book.  Visit her website and support her through that venue.
B003YLM78K|5.0|This beautiful movie, full of the best actors and with a compelling soundtrack, is for EVERYONE.  It is a movie to watch over and over.
B002ONC9NC|3.0|The film, \\"An Education,\\" written by Hornsby, and at first glance,highly entertaining, is a propoganda vehicle for inciting, promoting, reinforcing anti-Jewish feeling among the audience. Its male lead is a sociopath with a personality disorder who steals, lies, preys sexually on an inexperienced 16 year old, cheats on his wife, disregards his son, and more.  He is repeatedly identified as a Jew.  In one scene, a headmistress acted by Emma Thompson, unaware that her student's love interest is as perverted as he is, questions why a student of hers would date a Jew.  The identity of this sociopathic sexual predator could have been any ethnicity, any religion, yet Hornsby, the producers, the actors, chose to portray the evil represented by this character as Jewish.

0452289963|2.0|I happen to think that Eckhart Tolle's ideas, though seemingly intelligent and evolved, are simply impractical. This book contains many pearls of wisdom, however. The opening chapter, which decries the certitude and divisive nature of religion, can offer much wisdom to the world and create peace. The \\"I'm right, you're wrong\\" nature of religion is belligerent on a grand scale, and Tolle seems to do a good job of calling out the closed-minded fundamentalists, and presents the teachings of many great religious figures to back his arguments.    However, it seems extremely egotistical to say that if one does not understand or LIKE the material they find in  this book, they simply \\"are not ready\\" for awakening. This may be just as bad as saying that a person who does not follow a certain religion is wrong. Though this book may contain concepts that are a little on the esoteric side, this does not make it acceptable to say that a person is not at an adequate level of thinking to receive awakening.    Also, many of Tolle's concepts of dealing with other people may sound reasonable, but are nearly impossible to put into practice. For example, the simple acceptance of a person's actions without retaliation would serve mostly as a vehicle to make people more submissive and devalue self-worth. Showing a person that their actions do not hurt you is almost a way of showing you that the person can perform these actions over and over again. Also, not expecting, wanting, or asking for any form of apology is a form of submission. The human psyche is not equipped to forgive quite that easily.    In dealing with one's inner thoughts, Tolle makes points that are rather spotty across the board. For example, simply becoming aware of the snowballing nature of painful thoughts does not necessarily prompt a person to rid himself of these thoughts. In some cases, it adds to the snowballing. The \\"pain-body\\", which Tolle explains to death, is a manifestation of all pain inside a person, past and present, and that any time a person attempts to pick a fight or air a grievance, it is simply their pain-body trying to feed and become stronger. This is the philosophical equivalent to a man blaming a woman's menstrual cycle for any instant in which she is upset, or saying \\"You're only mad at me because you hate your father.\\" Tolle neglects to realize that we are not perfect, and that human beings often have legitimate concerns and conflicts with one another. Simply suppressing the pain-body, which is Tolle's solution to pretty much everything, is also not the answer. One can only reminisce about the \\"Serenity now!\\" episode of the hit series Seinfeld. The better solution is to confront the pain inside you. This is the only way to put the pain out of one's mind.    If you take these concepts away, there is one concept Tolle conveys that does remain valid: the notion of accepting one's situation as it is. He suggests that there are right reasons and wrong reasons for being unhappy. For instance, if someone loots your bank account and steals your money, the right reason to be unhappy would be because of the action performed and of the consequences. The wrong reason to be unhappy is BECAUSE of your unhappiness arising from the situation. This allows us to look at our situations with more logic and objectivity.    I would suggest, if you intend to recommend this book to a friend, that you read the book thoroughly, take what you read at face value, and give yourself enough time to put Tolle's ideologies into practice. Many of it may not work as well or as easily as it would seem on paper. It has been a year since I have read this book, and it changed my life at first, but then I realized that many of the concepts were completely useless and impractical.

Ms. Donoghue opens a world that I never wanted to imagine, but once I started to think about it I was overwhelmed and wanted to read more.  The story is dark and haunting and heart breaking, but the Ma character is so amazing and strong and real. My heart still breaks for Jack and his Ma and their journey.  I don't think I will be able to forget this story any time soon.

B0047O2HJC|4.0|Call me nuts but I prefer the stereo versions. Seems I can hear the guitar better. The mono recordings seem to subdue the guitar. For me the stereo versions pop better; the strumming style of Bob is so lively and fun. Remember that any live performance will give you something different in each ear, making mono less capable of re-producing what we would have heard standing in front of Bob at the studio. Is there room for re-mastered mono versions? Maybe with some enhancement in the mid-highs? So I can hear the guitar better AND listen in mono? Kudos to all Bob fans, but also to the producers of the stereo versions--you did fine!

Also explains why things are done a certain way as opposed to just saying 'this is how you need to do it'.  4 stars because some of the anti-patterns are really just commonsense, but the discussions on the pros/cons are worth reading anyway.  A good follow up book after this one would be Joe Celko's smarties books as the discussions are more in-depth.

B004CRR9G0|3.0|As a major fan of Nausicaa, this blu-ray release was at the top of my most-wanted list for BR releases of 2010. As soon as the Japanese release date neared this past summer, I could hardly wait. Until I began to read interviews with Studio Ghibli that said (paraphrasing here) that it wouldn't look as crisp as people expect because Ghibli wanted to retain the look of the film when it was first released in theaters. Now, that would be nice, except that 1) few people will have remembered the theatrical release, either because they weren't in Japan, or because they're too young to have seen in back in the mid-80s. 2) Even if you did see it in theaters then, how are you expected to remember it now, anyway, almost 20 years later?<br /><br />The reviews on the Japanese version of Amazon have been brutal, too, lashing out at the studio for producing a blu-ray transfer that does little to show off the abilities of the medium and media. After I received my own retail copy, I discovered that while the movie is certainly sharper in some areas, there is little to distinguish this version from the previously-released DVD versions. It's not an upgrade worth re-buying if you already own either the Japanese or U.S. Nausicaa DVD. Fortunately it looks like the North American version will ship in a less disastrous blu-ray case than the Japanese version. The JP version featured some beautiful, minimal art showcasing the distinctive silhouette of Nausicaa on her Maeve, but the cardboard housing was useless at keeping the disc in place. The North American version eschews that cover image for more conventional Miyazaki artwork (for better or worse), but presumably ships it in a standard BR box, which is definitely preferable. IMO, the best combination would have been the new school Japanese BR cover art combined with a standard BR case. Maybe the European version will offer that.<br /><br />If you don't already own Nausicaa on any format, you might as well get the BR. But for anyone looking for a crystal clear, upgraded visual image, you will walk away severely disappointed. I can only hope Porco Rosso and Laputa receive better treatment than this.clear, upgraded visual image, you will walk away severely disappointed.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Based on other reviews, I bought this for my son's 12th birthday.  While he sometimes protests that he is beyond Toy Story and other animated movies of its kind, I know that's a cover.  HE LOVES THIS GAME and has found it very interesting and challenging.  What's remarkable is that his 13 1/2 year old brother(who definitely is way too cool for it) loves it too and is playing it non-stop.  They haven't beaten the game after logging many many hours which speaks to its calibre as well.  All in all a good buy.
0439023491|3.0|This sequel to The Hunger Games falls does not work as a stand-alone novel. It picks up at the end of the Hunger Games, and ultimately takes us to a second Hunger Games situation. Rather than say more, I instead will recommend you read the Hunger Games first. If you love that book (which does stand alone as a novel), then you will care about the characters and world enough to enjoy this slightly repetitive young-adult fantasy/thriller. My three star rating assumes that you have read the original novel of the trilogy, as I had. Finally, don't start this book unless you intend to read Mockingjay, the final novel of the trilogy, because Catching Fire leaves you totally hanging at the end.
1400079276|3.0|I liked this book. It was my first by Mr. Murakami, and it was a pretty easy read. The story wasn't anything mind-blowing, but it did keep my interest throughout. I liked the author's simple style and most of the characters were well drawn. My biggest problem is the ending. Nothing is really explained in the end. There's all these interesting threads running through the story, but many questions are left unanswered (who killed Kafka's father? Was Sakura his sister? Was Miss Saeki his mother? What happened to Nakata as a child?). Sometimes I don't mind that in a novel, especially if it was entertaining enough to keep me up at night, but Kafka on the Shore, while interesting, didn't really blow me away (the incest theme and the cat killing scene certainly didn't help in that regard), so I definitely needed a satisfying conclusion to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />Overall, it was an interesting novel that would have been a lot better had the ending answered some of the fundamental questions asked throughout the novel. I might give the author another try in the future (perhaps trying one of his better-reviewed novels like Wind-Up or Hard-Boiled) but I'm not in any hurry. I borrowed Kafka on the Shore from the library, and I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. I suggest that interested readers do the same.<br /><br />3 and a 1/2 stars.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I own this on Blue ray and it is not only an awesome move but the picture is excellent.  I rate this right up there with Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.
0545265355|4.0|This book series was excellent. I'm a big fan of extremely dark fiction, and this filled the void. It was filled with action, adventure and suspense. There's some romance going on in the books to satisfy people who like love stories, but overall it's a wonderfully dark science fiction trilogy.<br /><br />When I first saw The Hunger Games in the YA section of Borders, I was leery of it because of the fact that I've seen and bought some books I didn't like in that section of the store. I'm a sucker for a pretty and interesting book cover, so I picked it up. I was not expecting a book that characters go around trying to kill each other, but I had a very fun satisfying read. I enjoyed that book so much that I went to get both Catching Fire and Mockingjay the night before Christmas Eve.<br /><br />Katniss is one of the first main characters that I liked in a long time. I like the fact that she's a hunter and can use the bow quite well. In my opinion, she is a really humanlike and complex character. For the longest time, I thought she was just a cold blooded killer until she started softning up to Peeta, Rue and her little sister. She felt sorrow for her fallen friend and tried to save her friends.<br /><br />Other than Katniss, I really liked most of the major characters. I can't decide which one I like more between Prim, Haymitch, Finnick and Peeta. All of the characters had very interesting and sad pasts, but in my opinion it made them very relatable.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Collin's writing style, but her story telling ability was very good. I really liked her word choices for how the Capitol people made their food look so good. I also liked how she made some really creepy creatures for the story because that had to be my favorite parts of the series.

B001FB4W16|5.0|Since I read all of the books before getting into the show, I was expecting not to like the HBO series. I never like screen adaptations as much as the original. That being said, I was caught off guard when I actually really like the first few episodes. I have only watched the first four, but I am hooked. I hear that the show strays a lot from the books later on, but for some reason it doesn't bother me (yet). The acting is great.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|If like David Gilmour and Floyd.  You will love this.  The documentary and show are both amazing.  Quality and setlist A+.  A must have for anyone who admires live music and great musicians.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is one of the most exciting books in the series so far. There are so many twists and turns ( literally!). I just read the first book in the middle of summer and I LOVED IT! I got so anxious in the weeks leading up to school because I knew that the first thing I would do is go to the library and check out the next 3 books. In September during our schools book fair I bought the 2nd and 3rd books for myself. My sister had the first one from her birthday. On my Christmas wishlist I asked for the final 2. Instead I got my Kindle with the 2 books alrwady on it. It was the best present I got.         Okay now for the book. In english class we just finished learning about book plots and I say this is one perfectly completed plot. It had the setting,charecters,rising actions,climax,falling actions and resolution beautifully laid out. The charecters are realistic, as if they could leap off the page and blend into your life.I also love the way Riordan took morden people and places and greek mythology and blended them into a page turning series. The way it is written Ithink of as a book that could actually be happening. I dream of being a demigod ( preferably of Athena) , swords, satyrs, nature spirits, gods, monsters, EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  In fact if I could be any charecter in any book or movie of my choice I would pick Annabeth Chase.  So Rick Riordan, I say keep up the good work. Please add more books onto the Percy Jackson series. I want to know what happens with all the new cabins, campers and of course the new great prophecy. I want to know more about what will happen with Percy and Annabeth and Grover. Do the gods keep their promise to Percy? How does Annabeth design the new Olympus? And what about Grovers position in the Council of Cloven Elders? How does that go?       I also love the movie even though it went pretty of course with the plot. I cannot wait for the rest.  Thank you for the great books.                             Abby C.   Nebraska , USA
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Face it, fellow dads, we don't really have any movie to watch on Father's Day. There are tons for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day and even Guy Fawkes Day got V For Vendetta. Who would've guessed that Liam Neeson of all people, would bring us seemingly the only Father's Day movie, and make it a great one as well? Ok fine, the movie doesn't quite have anything to do with the holiday, but this is such a movie for dads that it might as well be, and will definitely be one I start watching yearly every June. I'd also like to state that this totally clears Liam's name from The Phantom Menace as well.    Bryan Mills is a former Special-Ops agent, who describes his former title as a 'preventer' when he was overseas. He now lives in Los Angeles to try and reconnect with his daughter Kim, who lives with her mom and her new husband who's pretty much rolling in money. Bryan is very protective of Kim, and wants what's best for her, and even tries to get a pop singer he bodyguards one night to help Kim out since she wants to be a famous singer. But one day, against her dad's wishes, Kim takes a trip to Europe with her not-so-smart friend Amanda, and things go wrong almost immediately. When they make it to their hotel, their room is broken into by strange men who take Amanda, while Kim sees the whole thing from her window in another room, while at the same time talking to Bryan on her phone. Terrified, she tells him what's going on, and he tells her that she's going to be taken, and to list as much info about the captors as she can before they nab her. One of the men picks up the phone while Bryan's listening, and Bryan gives them a bone-chilling warning that he's coming for them, and that he -will- kill them if they don't let her go immediately. The man simply answers with 'good luck' and hangs up. With his connections from his old job, Bryan takes after them right away, and won't stop at anything or anyone that gets in his way, regardless if they've helped him in the past.    Normally, I get bored with the 'one man army' kind of action movie, but not here. Taken is so well done that the movie never drags on, and even when it seems like it's going to get to a boring moment, something new happens, and we're at a new scene. The pacing is so perfect, and the first time I watched it, I couldn't believe the movie was over because it went by so fast and smoothly. Liam does a fantastic job as Bryan, an effective force of a man who realistically and brutally dispatches of his enemies. A lot of the moves Liam does in the movie are very practical moves from martial arts like Wing Chun, and nothing ever gets fancy. When a move works and takes out the opponent, it's over for them, and he doesn't keep going to the point of overkill. It was nice. I was emotionally attached to his character, and wanted him to bust the bad guys in the worst way possible for taking Kim, and even more after seeing what was being planned for her. What makes the movie work is that Bryan isn't a monster who can't be stopped. Sure, he plows through enemies, but he's not brainless- he is very much human, and the audience can relate to him, and might even let his actions slide because of the circumstances. Compare Liam, who's nearly 60, to a slightly older actor like Sylvester Stallone and usually plays the same character in his action movies, and you'll see a clear difference between the two, and how it's easier to like one more than the other, and how Taken isn't exactly like the other shoot/beat 'em ups out there.    Unfortunately, the blu-ray doesn't look that great, and that's a big surprise considering how much of a surprise hit the movie was. Some colors are too faded while others are over saturated, some deep black look a bit green, and there's even some grain in a couple of scenes. It's a shame because this movie could've looked great on the right set up. The audio's much better at least, a Dolby 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, and Spanish and French tracks in Dolby Digital 5.1. Everything sounds strong and nearly perfect here. I actually re-watched a few chapters when I first got the blu-ray, before letting the movie finish, because they sounded so good.    The special features are robust, but a mixed bag, starting with the international edition cut of the movie, which has a bit more violence than the regular version. You'll probably just end up watching this one and ignore the regular cut. There's a commentary track in French with the director and cinematographers that only the biggest fans of the movie should check out since reading a commentary track is never that fun. It's definitely informative, but there's another commentary track with co-writer Robert Mark Kamen that's just as good. Le Making Of is your typical set of interviews with the cast/crew, going on about how great it is to be working on the movie. There's also a little bit of footage from the premier of Taken, though it's more on the promotional side. Black Ops Field Manual is a useless extra that shows where the characters are as the movie progresses, and finally are trailers and a story board comparison. Basically, nothing too exciting for casual fans of the movie, and the only thing worth checking out if you have time is the commentary with Robert.    What more is there to say? Dads need this movie, and will feel awesome watching it.
0312600844|4.0|Poignant and brutally analytical portrait of the vapid characteristics of modern individuals, written in very readable, slightly resembling Philip Roth style (however with less severity).  The irony of the superfluous and instantly accesible choices in modern life--texting, emailing, facebooking, poking, for example--and the individuals that really lack originality or substance of their own, overwhelmed by the pressure of self actualization.  The messy outcome is pointless, competitiveness, exploits, entitlement,disappointment among family and friends that give them the appearance of identity and purposefulness. Some reviewers thought that the characters are not believable, but except for Joey's business success, personally I have met many of these characters in different degrees of shallowness, and some portrayals are so accurate that the truth really hurts, ouch!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I got this complete collection for Christmas and I was very eager to open and dig into it.  I waited for the complete collection because I knew it would end up being cheaper than buying each season and let me tell you, I'm so glad I waited!  There are so many incredible things just waiting for user exploration in this box.  I've become a huge lost fan over the years and this is a perfect item to add to my collection.  I'm so appreciative of all the time and effort that went into this collection.

1597801585|4.0|Having just finished Paolo Bacigalupi's Hugo and Nebula award-winning novel, I'm left rather bereft at how to describe, let alone review, \\"The Windup Girl.\\" I am not a big reader of science-fiction or dystopian thrillers which means that no obvious comparisons come to mind, and the setting and tone of the novel are so unique (to me at least) that they almost defy description.<br /><br />Set in a future Thailand where genetically engineered \\"megodonts\\" (elephants) provide manual labor and \\"cheshires\\" (cats) prowl the streets, the world's population struggles against a bevy of diseases brought on by all the genetic tampering that's been doing on. Oil has long since run out, Chinese refugees flood the cities, the seas are rising, and power now lies in the hands of \\"calorie companies\\". These corrupt organizations can manufacture crops, though the \\"generippers\\" have designed the seeds to be infertile, thereby forcing the purchase of their products indefinitely. Corruption, blackmail and backstabbing are commonplace, and struggle for survival is very much a reality for all walks of life.<br /><br />The titular character is a Windup Girl named Emiko, designed to be the perfect servant, trained never to disobey an order, and easily identified by her \\"stop-stutter\\" motion. Having been abandoned by her original owner and now peddled as a novelty sex-toy, Emiko is treated as a subhuman, railing against her engineering whilst dreaming of freeing herself from her life's constraints. Yet despite being the book's namesake, the novel contains an ensemble cast that is roughly centered on the doings of Anderson Lake, a company man who works undercover as a factory man whilst he combs Thailand markets for food that is thought to be extinct.<br /><br />There's also his secretary, formerly a wealthy Chinese businessman who has escaped massacres in his own country and is now an amoral survivalist, set on ripping off his boss, and Captain Jaidee, known as \\"the Tiger of Bangkok\\" who is incorruptible in his defense of his country, but who resorts to violent means to get what he wants. Lastly, there is Jaidee's second-in-command, the stoic Kanya, who has a dark secret in her past that is completely at odds with her loyalty and respect for Jaidee.<br /><br />No character is entirely sympathetic or completely vilified. Instead, everything is painted in a distinct shade of grey, from the calorie men who are out to make a profit by whatever means necessary (but who also strive to combat the threat of plagues that threaten mankind) to the environmental ministry who use violent measures against their own people to defend their country and its seed-farms. There is no main character, and so it is really the city of Bangkok that becomes the most important element in the novel. Bacigalupi writes in prose that manages to be both sparse and descriptive, and brings his world to vivid life in all its heat, danger, cruelty, beauty and genetically modified wildlife.<br /><br />For those interested in Bacigalupi's version of Bangkok, he has already explored this dystopian world in his short-stories, notably \\"The Calorie Man\\" and \\"Yellow Card Man,\\" though familiarity with those works aren't necessary to follow the story here. Rather, one of the most exciting things about the reading experience is the way in which you are thrown head-first into an unfamiliar world and left to sink or swim in it - much like the characters that populate it, you have to find a way of negotiating the chaos or you won't last long.<br /><br />I feel as though this review may not be adequate, simply because I don't have enough experience in this particular genre to make an educated critique of the book. Maybe that's a good thing though, as from a layman's point of view, I can say that I was intrigued by \\"The Windup Girl\\", was never bored, and didn't stop reading until I reached the end.

B001GJOL22|5.0|I saw Rush on this tour at Hershey Park stadium and it was amazing!! The set list was incredible and the show was down right entertaining. The visuals were hilarious. Alex is just not right in the head!<br /><br />This blu-ray has captured it all in incredible sound and picture. The video is so sharp, I cut myself on it....twice! The color and clarity are unbelievable. And the videography is right on. The sound is great too. All the highs, mids, and lows are there. You can hear every note Geddy rips on the bass! You can also enjoy all the background movies that were part of the show as well. From Bob & Doug to South Park's Lil' Rush to Alex being a complete loon! It's all here. They even included in the bonus material the video segment that they used on the second leg of the tour to open the second set of the show. It was different during the first leg, which I didn't see.<br /><br />This is Rush at it's best and a must-have for any Rush fan!
B001TH8UUA|3.0|The connection is VERY fickle. Sometimes, it'll randomly go out and I'll have to jiggle the cord. This doesn't happen with any other brands of my HDMI cords in the same connections. The picture and audio quality is great to my amateur ears and eyes...so take what you want from that.
1595141715|3.0|I really wanted to love this story, but I ended up simply appreciating it a great deal.  I really loved the originality of the premise of this book.  A voice from beyond the grave pulling people's strings is a great way to structure a plot, and making that voice belong to a teenage girl who recently committed suicide made it poignant and heartbreaking.    It also made me REALLY freaking angry.  For a few different reasons.    First of all, people failed Hannah, no doubt about it.  She deserved better, much better.  I certainly can see how some of the people on her list ought to shoulder some of the guilt for her plight at school.  Hannah was ignored and used by mean girls, made a public object of sexual harassment (that boiled my blood), and apparently, was the victim of false rumors that are incredibly damaging to an adolescent girl.  Hell, in one case especially, the kid was the lowest of the low, and he ought to have been properly and publicly beaten for the heinous and illegal things he did.  I can see why Hannah was so angry about why few really reached out to her.  That last one. . .  man, I couldn't believe it!  Why, why, why did he not go straight to the principal or her parents?     However, I have to be honest -  I found the fact that Hannah, through all her pain and desperation to end it all, found the time to plan and execute a macabre tour of the way people let her down and hurt her to be really, really sickening.  I had a lot of anger towards Hannah right from the start: the teasing comments to the tapes' recipients, the carefully planned map, the orderly and methodical way of going through her list of people and telling their parts in her story?  Such things take time and planning.  To me, it made Hannah's death feel more like revenge rather than a heartbreaking out from her pain.  In the beginning, she initially seemd to take pleasure in the shock and horror she knew she was giving the tapes' recipients.  This set the tone before I heard the 'whys',and for me, overshadowed the actual pain people put her through and made her death feel like a well-constructed component in a plan to have the last, sick laugh.  It made me so angry!    I am not trying to make light of the way Hannah was used and treated by others.  It's heartbreaking for anyone to feel like they are on the outside, but it's especially hard to go through that in high school.  I honestly did feel for Hannah, and I actually cried while reading the book (and even while writing this review).  I understand how the little things really can add up to the snowball effect.  I usually have a great amount of heartfelt emotion for people who go through depression (see my review on Revolution), but I found it hard to do with Hannah since she seemed hell bent on making people feel guilty for her choice to end her life.  Did everyone on that tape deserve blame for what she did?  Nope, not all of them, and you'll never convince me otherwise.  Most of them should have to answer to someone for the things they did, and sometimes, that 'someone' definitely was Hannah.  But in some of the cases, that person was not Hannah.  However, because she decided to point the finger. . .  some of them now have a ghost unfairly following them for the rest of their lives.     In terms of the writing, it's a well-written book by a first-time novelist.  I had a few instances of questioning the characters' decisions and how the plot played out.  However, each voice is strong and distinct.  I really love that we heard personally from Hannah. In all fairness, she really called out people on some things she had a perfect right to be upset about (I just wish she had been that articulate with them while she was still living).  There were a few times I wished she could have gone on uninterrupted by Clay's thoughts and reactions, but generally, his reactions gave a very real feeling of how the living deal with suicide, and the Hannah/Clay interaction provided genuine emotion, a solid substitution for dialogue and good pacing.  Clay's quick turnaround surprised me at the end, but I loved his character  My sole complaint with Clay is that it felt like he got an `easy out' with Hannah's tapes.  I think he could have been put to better use to get the point across if he had failed Hannah in some way, some actual way, rather than being the right guy who came along too late.  That part still makes me so angry - there was proof right in front of her that she had possibilities in her life, and the realization of it was so powerful that it made her cry.  Yet, she still decided to end it.     Maybe that's the true point of this book.  I've seen so many reviews praising it for its portrayal of suicidal teens and how we have to reach out to them, how it's a cautionary tale that what we do has a very real affect on others.  That's a point that no one can argue with.  Everyone belongs to a community, and in communities, we are responsible for the well-being of others, and people do deserve to be treated with kindness.  However, in the end, even Hannah knew that there could be second chances, and she decided not to take them.  Her death didn't make sense.  It didn't serve any purpose, it did no good, and from the sound of the tapes, she didn't go looking for peace; she went angry and wanted others to know about it.  So, I think the other message here is when things like this happen, you have to take what lessons you can from them and resolve to not let another person go down that lonely path to nowhere, if you can.     In the end, I recommend this book.  It's on an important subject, it's well-written and really makes you think about how your little actions that you think are insignificant or a good laugh can really affect and hurt others.  Maybe my reaction is simply too personal.  I just have a lot of anger towards Hannah after reading this (and other characters, as well).  Maybe I'm supposed to.  I don't mean to for my review to seem like I blame her for wanting away out of her pain - I don't.  I have a great amount of compassion for her, and my heart aches for that girl inside who just wanted not to be judged, to receive kindness, and to have a good friend or two.  It's the way she treated her own death like it was the last laugh on others that had me so angry.  I feel so badly for people contemplating suicide, but please, believe me - you are loved, you are wanted here on this earth, and your death would bring far more pain than peace.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|Kanye has provided us with another classic. You don't have to like the man but you have to love the musician!
B001EN1R2M|3.0|I first heard of Motley Crue in the early 80's through a magazine article with a picture of the band that is seen in the inside of this LP. Very macabre looking band with skulls and a big pentagram above them. That alone made me go out and buy this disc. My first impression went from great to awful. Starting off with the classic \\"Live Wire\\". Killer riff and pounding drums. Excellent song that goes into one of the worst songs I have ever heard at that point \\"Come on and dance\\". Abysmal. \\"Public Enemy #1\\" is better, but then again... any song would be better. \\"Merry go round\\" could have been much better if it wasn't so damn repetitious. Then it goes back to a decent song \\"take me to the top\\".     Side two is just as bad. Stating off with a good track \\"Piece of your action\\" to a couple of not so good songs(\\"Starry Eyes\\" & Too Fast For Love\\"). The album ends on a high note with a great ballad with dark lyrics \\"On with the show\\". A song I think Nikki Sixx wrote about himself, being that the main character is called \\"Frankie\\". That was his birth name before he became Nikki Sixx.    A far cry from a band that just a year or so later released a great album \\"Shout at the devil\\".    I know I'm in the minority when it comes to \\"Too fast for love\\". I really tried to like it. But I still feel like the disappointed kid that played it back in the early 80's.     For me the only great albums Motley has done are \\"Shout At The Devil\\" and the '94 album they did with John Corabi on vocals. All the others are chock full of fillers...including \\"Too Fast For Love\\"
B003P2WO5E|5.0|After reading this novel, I have now become a die-hard Brandon Sanderson fan.    The book is epic - both in scale as well as in quality. The plot is great, the characters are well-developed, and the storyline/the elements of the book (the \\"magic\\", etc.) are completely unique. I literally couldn't put the book down after I started reading it.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie!  I really was expecting a dud.  It's probably not something you'd drag your girlfriend or kids to see; however, if you like good martial arts movies, are a history buff, or just like good story telling...then check it out.  It's definately worth the $ to see it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Let's try to keep this simple:    - Original concept  - Great cast  - Killer soundtrack  - Stunning visuals  - Engrossing story    The movie is one of the few blockbusters in the history of blockbusters that carries an engrossing story based on elements (dreams) as widely relevant to this many people and combines so many different themes (the movie could be interpreted as a love story just as much as it could be interpreted as an action flick). Add in slick execution and an ending that will leave you wondering for weeks after and you're left with a movie that isn't just the jack of all trades, but the KING.     If you haven't seen it, you should stop reading these reviews, buy this blu-ray, rent it in the meantime online (even next day delivery is too long) and take a second look at it when it comes in.

B003ELOQCK|4.0|Bought this at a great price on Amazon. 1/2 the price than at HMV.   Great concert DVD for any one who has been to a 360 concert.   When you watch it, lots of memories of the concert will come back and I found myself smiling many times while playing the DVD.   I will buy it again if I lost it.     I am a big fan of U2.     Plus points:  - Nice camera work. I found that it captured most of the atmosphere of the concert.   - Nice mini booklet with tour photos.   - Comes with a 2nd DVD with some behind the scenes stuff but I don't think I'll ever bother watching it.   - U2 turns on a good show as usual. Performance-wise almost flawless. Fanboys will love this one.   - With a good pair of headphones, the sound is superb.     Minus points:  - I watch this on my 3 year old 15\\" Macbook Pro and am disappointed with the picture quality. Looks like a 1.5hour movie that it only 700mb in size you know what i mean?
B003ZK58WM|5.0|If you enjoy epic tales that transport you into history and do a reasonable job of showing multiple views of historic events this is a great book. The characters are believable and the settings are vivid while still being easy to read. The war sections are somewhat tedious...however, WWI was for many months a great stalemate. While I did not particularly enjoy the slow moving political portions they did seem to be reasonable descriptions of the workings of government and revolution and manage to weave the lives of the characters into the events in a believable manner. I wish the next two scheduled for this trilogy were already available. I will definately plan to read them. I do feel this was very overpriced for an online book; however, it is lengthy.
B003EYVY04|1.0|I confess I too was horribly disappointed to learn that the latest installations of the \\"Ultimate Editions\\" of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire would not be released in extended cuts.  I had placed both of these films on my \\"wishlist\\" for Christmas.  I immediately contacted my family members and told them to scratch them off of that list.  I would not have people I care about wasting nearly $80 of their hard earned money on movies that I already own.  It is sad too, those movies had great additional scenes - one of my favorites being Snape busting students at the Yule Ball (in the Goblet of Fire) for snogging outside.  I couldn't wait to see that added back into the movie.<br /><br />I have read the statements where Warner's claimed that the directors from films 3 and 4 declined to add these scenes back in.  Whether this is true or not is irrelevant.  The extended versions of these movies exist on ABC Family, which means that someone somewhere HAS re-edited the films to include these scenes.  Why didn't Warner's use those versions for an extended version disc?  The ABC Fam versions are obviously \\"legal\\" since they show them regularly.<br /><br />Personally, I am no great fan of all the \\"extras\\".  The only thing that tempts me into buying a movie i already own is if the film is going to be extended, and they interview the actors that I like to discuss some aspect of their character.  In the case with these films, neither occurred.  They didn't have extended versions of the movie nor interviews with Alan Rickman (or many of the other older actors).  One thing needs to be noted by the studio here...not all Harry Potter fans are children.  Some of us are adults who enjoy watching the trained thespians in the films that we have enjoyed for decades.  Sometimes I feel like we are slighted when it comes to these boxed sets.  ALL the materials seem to be geared toward children.  I don't mind some interviews with the younger actors, but they need to also accommodate the older viewers.  As with the UK versions of the books, they should have Child and Adult versions of the films.  \\"Adult\\" meaning that the extras would contain information that viewers beyond their teenage years would enjoy.ommodate the older viewers.

B0007PLLQ0|4.0|First off, let me say that I love this movie. The one that was released to theater's in 1987 was great. This is actually the directors cut and there is no other version on the disk. Usually you can choose to use the alternate ending or deleted scenes or what not, but not in this. There is no music in this from the released version and the ending is completely different. I was a little disappointed in the way this version played out, but it is still a great movie.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|This book is really well written and the characters are psychologically complex and interesting. Sort of like \\"The Corrections\\" meets \\"The World According to Garp.\\"    I can't help but add how annoyed I am about the \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" in the title on the screen of my Kindle.
B004E3XD1W|2.0|I, like many other reviewers, read this book because of the outstanding reviews to obtained, though I wish I hadn't. The novel started out good. I liked the idea of Graces, and the main character who wasn't a weak girl who had to have everyone else fight for her. Her love interest was easy to identify, but I continued reading the novel with hope. Though to my despair I was not satisfied. A huge part of the novel is just Katsa and Po traveling. While I enjoyed the author's descriptive skills with the landscape, to much focus was put on the in-between. I was also disappointed that Katsa missed out on all the real action. The author spent so much time pumping up her fighting abilities, but never really gave her a chance to shine. I enjoyed the character of Katsa except for her attitude toward marriage. Never one to be a huge romantic, I identified with her tomboy attitude toward dresses and things of girly nature. Yet, if I really loved someone the way she claimed to love Po marriage shouldn't have been such a strain to her. Especially since he was willing to give her the freedom she desired. Marriage isn't prison, but a partnership. I think the author's warped view of marriage may have contributed to this. I also feel like the character of Bitterblue was only introduced to soften Katsa's view of children and marriage, which I didn't buy.<br /><br />While I appreciated the author trying to create a strong female character who didn't need an ending of marriage and children for it to be happy, I feel like she failed. I don't recommend this book to anyone who wants to be left with a satisfied feeling after reading a 500 page book.
B004B8DH98|1.0|this long boring movie was a a disappointment in many ways.  It was boring and long, had no plot, and ended badly.  What was George Cloony thinking when he made this?  Dont waste even 99 cents on this dud.
B001OD6HN6|4.0|I got this for my wife for Christmas and she seems to really like it. I was also glad to find this edited version so we could play it around our kids.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I thought that this film was well directed and cast.  The story and the special effects keep your interest and is the kind of film that you wont want to pause so you can see what happens at the end.  The only thing that I find fault with is the technology that is supposed to put the individual dreamers into one person's head, but I believe that I have a psychological explanation for that (the whole story isn't quite what you think it is).  Anyway, a very entertaining film that keeps you wondering what will happen next.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|My experience with direct to DVD animations has been mixed. Some seem to be targeted towards a much younger audience. This one was not and I think that's why I enjoyed it a bit more. It's very violent and dark (like Batman should be). The story was interesting and had a few plot twists that slowly unfolded throughout the movie. Fans will not be disappointed.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Good show but lead to believe more star time ie. Bruce Willis and Arnold S.it was fast moving enough. I just think they should not of built it up the way they did. They could have just said there would be cameos not build it up so we could be let down.
B000IDK6XU|5.0|If you want to see another inspiring actor in an off-beat movie. Try J. Depp in \\"Dead man\\"..... From Neil Young playing guitar licks through the whole movie to the cast of characters like Billiebob, Gabriel Byrne, Crispin Glover, Iggy Pop(dressed as a woman), and Robert Michum - this movie moves a little slow for young kids but it's more of an adult movie anyway. So if your old enough to appreciate the trip rather than the destination then check it out. The movie locations, background plot, neil young guitar, and raw western feel make Dead Man a modern western with some adult content. I believe for anyone who can appreciate the \\"art\\" of movies Chaplin and Dead Man are must haves to own. Cheers to all
031603438X|4.0|Everything I learned about the music I love I got from reading the songwriting credits on the first Rolling Stones albums at age 13. McDaniel, Morganfield, who WERE these people? Keith knew. I remember watching Dean Martin on a 60's television show, Hollywood Palace, playing up the freak angle and whining just before a commercial break- \\"Don't leave me alone with these Rolling Stones!\\". Who gave a damn about Dean Martin in the 1960's anyway? Shattered was the anthem of New York in the late 70's when I lived there, \\"rats on the West Side, bedbugs uptown\\", the Rolling Stones owned the place and it suited them. Life as a book has it's faults- it could be about 50 pages of drug use, drug worship, and descriptions of cold turkey vomiting shorter and a few other things like the omission of mentioning Nils Lofgren's song plea \\"Keith Don't Go\\" about the Toronto bust, hardly a mention at all of Bill Wyman that isn't more than a sentence long with not a single thing about the man's 30 years of musicianship, I found missing. The lack of compassion and bitter disdain for Brian Jones was just sad after all these years. The New Yorker called it among other things \\"brand extension\\" and in the 21st Century I guess that's right. One always knew Mick Jagger was a behind the scenes manipulator and society fawn didn't they? There is just so much packed into the book that it's hard to know where to start, but it's well worth the price of admission. I just wish I hadn't seen \\"Shine A Light\\". The decline of an entertainment troupe (the Stones have long ago ceased being a Rock and Roll band) that was around at the beginning of the Kennedy administration doesn't need a movie to peep into that almost 50 years later. Jagger, the imitation of youth, needs to go away, but Keith will always be there. When Katrina left me broke he bought the flamed neck off of my '68 Telecaster and I always wonder if he'll ever use it. He was the real thing then, and he alone now still is. The $7 million advanceMr. Richards got was worth it. May he live long to spend it all.
0767812166|5.0|Coming off the commercial disappointment of \\"[[ASIN:B0002CHK1S The Thing]],\\" director John Carpenter felt he had something to prove to the world. With \\"Starman,\\" the trail-blazing director shows himself to be more than just a one-trick pony as he steers his focus away from the typical horror and action fare he carved his teeth on in favor for a unique romantic sci-fi story. The result is the director's most under-rated work to date and proof that the man can handle more than one genre at a time with the greatest of ease.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges stars as an alien who finds himself side-tracked upon landing in the backyard of a Wisconsin widow, played by Karen Allen. In order to reach his final destination, he takes the form of her deceased love and the two take to the road. Of course, no sci-fi love story would be complete without interference as the two find themselves being pursued by scientists and military personnel alike who -- you guessed it -- don't have the alien's best interest in mind.<br /><br />Although \\"Starman\\" is admittedly predictable from beginning to end, Carpenter keeps it fresh throughout by keeping the pace going and making sure we are engaged in the ride the whole way through. In true Carpenter fashion, the film looks good and boasts a great soundtrack. Of course, it also helps that Bridges and Allen have excellent chemistry and make for two rather charming leads. Bridges stands out in particular for taking a role that could have been paper-thin and turning it into an odd and endearing character that will be remembered long after the end credits have rolled. In less-caring hands, the film could have been a dud, but thanks to all parties involved, it's an entertaining, engaging and tear-jerking roller-coaster ride that rivals not just other films of its ilk but the rest of Carpenter's filmography as well. \\"Starman\\" is truly a must-see gem of the '80s.
B000069AUI|1.0|I bought the CD hoping to rip it at least once. I thought Like New might have a few scratches, but I would rate what they sent as Good. The case was broken. They completely lied about the quality.
B00448SE4S|3.0|I love Edgar Wright - from Spaced to Hot Fuzz and Shawn of the Dead is on my top 10 movies list... but something felt off here.  I am of the early video game generation Atari, Odessey 2, Intelevision and the original NES with Rob.  I still spend many hours a week playing PS3 and Xbox360, I like comic books, I'm a geek/nerd into pop culture - so this movie is aimed at me, but I still felt it was off.  The only thing I can pinpoint is that when the first boyfriend busts onto the screen, it does not compute - and what I mean by that is that the movie takes place much like the world we live in, but all of a sudden normal people are doing video game moves... It took me out of it (though I do like when they become coins when defeated). Maybe if the world was a little less real and more \\"gamey\\" it wouldn't have been as disconcerting.  I did enjoy the movie but it is not going on my shelf with Shaun and Fuzz.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|We have enjoyed Josh Groban ever since hearing him on \\"Ally McBeal\\".  This is the fourth CD we have purchased.  We look forward to more music from this special talent.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for someone. It came within three days and was in perfect condition! I will definitely order from them again!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is not a review of \\"Planet Earth\\" which is amazing, but since Amazon didn't let me rate my transaction with them I will rate it here:  It would be nice if I actually received what I bought.   The product they sell on Amazon is listed as 1080p, but the Blu-ray I received was only 1080i.  Big difference for a videophile.     Because I have not been able to find it anywhere in 1080p I believe this is the only way it is produced, but if so Amazon should have it listed correctly.
0316077054|4.0|The second book is pretty sad but it changes tempo when you get past the first two-thirds-no spoilers here though-read it and enjoy!
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I finally went to a movie worse than Wicker Man - The Black Swan. It's a gay man's bad acid trip. The film employs every groan-inducing cliche about the theatre/ballet ever used. If they missed one, I'm at a loss what it might be. Actually, Mickey Rooney isn't in it, now that I come to think of it. At points it was like Tchaikovsky meets the Three Stooges, especially when the lead male drops Portman on her keester. To give you a sense of how intensely bogus it all is, all the male characters are straight and the hottest chic in the film ( and it's not Natalie Portman who 1. is never the hottest chic in any film, and 2. is more ham fisted than Al Pacino on his worst day) is a lesbian pill popping Angelina type who carries extra underwear in her purse. Of course! Where was she when I was in the ballet? Wait a second...   Never mind. I kept waiting for someone to carry a ladder onto the set, swing around and coldkonk Portman as the director fumed \\"You numbskull! Watch where you're swinging that thing.\\"   This is bad enough to have been directed by Night Shayamalan. \\"I see dead birds.\\" Do you think Alfred Hitchcock knew this was in the pipeline? Woody Allen is rightly criticized for making dull films for people from select zip codes in NY. This one is for their daughters. As for the overly hyped \\"wanking\\" scene, she'll never go blind.   I used to think it was a miracle that Edward Woodward escaped the career torpedo Wicker Man sent his way to become the actor we all discovered in Breaker Morant, among others. What do you do after you've played a boring princess in lame brain space movies and an infantile diva in bird brain ballet films? If I wanted that much drama, I'd go watch Terrel Owens.  I'm heading for the popcorn.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theaters on the day of release. I've been a fan of the movies ever since the first one because I've loved the Resident Evil games I've grown up with, and I love how this is the only movie series based off of a game that's actually good. The fourth part of the series is on par with the third movie which is good. I enjoyed these movies, and they're one of the few movies that I can actually watch a second, and even a third time.
0316098337|2.0|This book is pretty good but its not a 5 star book. When I bought this, amazon reviewers gave it close to a 5 star and I didn't see any negative reviews. I liked this book but it wasn't a great book. I didn't mind the 5 year old's narrative. The 1st half of the book was original and the second part was a waste of my time. There could have been a lot more depth towards the second half. It was like simple characters doing simple things. I would put this book on the back burner. If you have nothing better to read then pick it up.    Do not read anymore if you have not read the book.    I understand its a five year old's persepective but a lot could have been explored with the Grandmother and what happened to the family. I don't have a light on \\"Ma\\" (in the second part of the book). She's almost the same from the 1st part to the ending. Shouldn't we see more of who she was even if it is through the eyes of a 5 year old.
B00009YOQW|4.0|My 19 month old Great Grandson was lavished with fancy gifts at Christmas Time, some played with some not, yet this little drum was truly a hit!  He could distinguish the different tones that were made due to the curved cut on the top. I'm certain that it will last for his own progeny.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Ever since I was a little kid, I watched scary movies. One of my favorites when I was around 13 or 14 was F.W. Murnau's \\"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror,\\" a little silent film that managed to scare the unholy Hell out of me. It was a poorly-scored copy of the movie from one of those 50-pack DVD box-sets of \\"The Greatest Horror Movies Ever Made,\\" and it was my favorite out of all of them. Orlok (Dracula) and Hutter (Harker) were great characters that lit up the silver screen in a way I'd never seen before.<br /><br />What seems like an eternity later, now in my mid-20s, I discovered that Werner Herzog, the man who made the documentary \\"Grizzly Man\\" (Which I was a big fan of!) had previously directed a remake of Murnau's silent classic, with the original character names from Bram Stoker's novel reinstalled to their rightful players. Needless to say, this movie is like \\"The Shining\\" meets \\"Dracula,\\" it's a slow-paced, but visually overwhelming and delightful film full of fun and scares that will entertain horror fans of all ages.<br /><br />But I won't waste time telling you the story, I'll let you buy the DVD and judge for yourself what you think of the film.<br /><br />I will tell you about the DVD itself, instead. This DVD contains two disks, one with the movie \\"Nosferatu: The Vampyre,\\" which is the English version of the film, and the other with \\"Nosferatu: Phantom Der Nacht,\\" the German version of the film. They're basically the same movie, only the scenes with dialogue were filmed twice, once in English and once in German. Which version of the film you like better is up to you, personally, I prefer the English version of the film, because I find the German accents to add a nice touch to the film, plus I can understand it without reading subtitles. There are some great special features on disk two, which I have yet to check out, but all in all, I'd say this movie is worth your money. It's a timeless remake of a timeless classic, and totally unforgettable.<br /><br />Scary, thoughtful and well made-- everything a horror film should be./>Scary, thoughtful and well made-- everything a horror film should be.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I love this movie. This is the continuation to the best story ever told. The extended scenes really added to the movie.
0780626494|5.0|I purchased this for myself as a treat since I love this movie. It came packaged well and plays great. Have watched it twice since receiving it and it works perfectly.
B004B4J7H8|5.0|This work really impressed me, and I will watch for Alexander Desplat's work now in the future.  If you listen carefully, you will notice that each song has some form of shivery background--subtle, not overdone--that captures a sense of chronic fear and exhaustion throughout, making the bolder parts of the music sound all the braver for it.  Also, the progressions that approximate a human sigh, repeated at key emotional points throughout, really tug at the heartstrings!  Some composers best capture the action scenes while others excell at quieter moments, but this one works marvelously with both!
0470913029|4.0|Though I do not eat a strict paleo diet I do not eat starchy carbs.  I have found the recipes in the cookbook delicious and easy to prepare.
0525951652|1.0|I honestly can't see how this book got such good reviews. I barely got half way through this book before I had to put it down. It's absolute drivel. Jeffrey Phillip's review is right on the money. What could have been an interesting story turns out to be a highly predictable (and therefore boring) plot. And the character dialogue... ugh!... like nails running down a chalkboard irritating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a quick and easy read but full of emotions of all types. I could not get enough and could not get to the second and third books fast enough.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|When I changed my cable subscription around, I wound up not having Starz.  Which to me was ok since I watched mostly this show.  Now that the star, Andy Whitfield, is no longer doing it, I dropped the channel.  Then I was going through withdrawl from the show and had to get this DVD set.      Just a wonderful show.  I have seen where some people say this show was macho male oriented, well ok, maybe.  But, mostly naked, well built men in this show works for a women too!!    To this set.  I am very impressed by the presentation of the packaging.  The DVD package is made to be like a hardcover book, with discs in pockets on each page. The weight is nice, the whole thing is very well done.    Highly recommend this set. After watching for a while you realize, it is like a big painting, rich in filming.
0316067938|4.0|My niece gave me the first two books of the series, and I devoured them.  When I came to Amazon to buy the next two, I read the reviews, and became very hesitant to read the next two because of all the negative reviews.    Fortunately, my partner gave them to me for Christmas, because I devoured them as well.  After finishing the entire series, I decided to add my own review in support of the series, flaws and all, but particularly Breaking Dawn.    First, in a series such as this, readers often mentally write their own conclusion.  When the author doesn't write that ending, the reader views it as a betrayal but label it as a failure.    Stephanie Meyer isn't the most skilled writer in the world, but she wrote a series of very compelling novels.  Her ability to draw me into the world she created made me oblivious to any and all technical errors.     This series is directed towards teenagers, and I didn't have the same expectations in many areas as I would for the Next Great American Novel.    This is a story about vampires and werewolves.  You want reality?  Go read a biography.  You want consistency?  Good luck finding that anywhere in \\"real life.\\"    Okay, to address some issues to which others have had very negative reactions:    1.  Bella is self-centered to incredible proportions.  For the first three and part of the fourth book, I have to agree.  I gave my partner chapter and verse on that about two chapters into Breaking Dawn.  However, when I finished Breaking Dawn, it all made sense.    2.  Immediately upon becoming a vampire, Bella has amazing control and seems to negate Stephanie Meyer's mythology of the newborn.  In addition, she has complete control over her supernatural talent very, very quickly.    3.  The two are combined.  Bella's complete selfcenteredness and stubborn refusal to get or do anything other than what she wants shows great strength of mind.  Her determination to become a vampire is, with one moment of consideration for the voluntary option of remaining human for one more year, is absolute.      Even before her transformation into a vampire, no vampire could read her mind.  It makes sense that she was strongly predisposed to anything that required mental strength.  She was well informed and therefore well prepared for what newborns are like.  But becoming a vampire strongly enhances any natural human predisposition to a supernatural power, and if as a human she could resist Edward, Jane, etc., her strength as a vampire would of course be amazing.    I had no trouble with the concept that she could, by her mental strength of will, fight successfully against the usual actions of a newborn.  The same goes for her ability to extend her protection to others.    3.  Sex.  Duh.  Have you never been in a new sexual relationship?  If you have but have not been eager to express yourself sexually very frequently, then I feel sorry for you.  Plus, Ms. Meyer handled it very tastefully, without details, for her teenage audience - and made sure that Bella and Edward were married before they had sex.    4.  Renesmee - okay, I don't care for the name, but it's unique, not weird or awkward or dumb.  Parents often saddle their children with difficult names.  Plus, Bella's right - Nessie is much worse.    5.  Motherhood.  It was a stretch for me, even with my suspension of disbelief.  But it is a fantasy novel, so why not?  As far as the blood - have you seen what movies and games teens watch and play?  A fountain of blood gushing from Bella's mouth is really gross, but a central \\"character\\" of the novel is blood.  But I do have to say that this was really an awkward plot device that I believe was only there as a reason to allow the confrontation with the Volturi.  However, I love the supernatural power Renesmee has and bought in to how she captured everyone's hearts (beating or not).    6.  Pedophilia.  I'm positive that the scene between Quil and Claire is included to show that pedophilia is absolutely not part of the equation with imprinting.  Over and over it is stated that the werewolves who imprint only wish to make the person they imprint upon happy.  They are driven to do so.  It is never so much as breathed that Quil and Jacob see Claire and Renesmee as sexual in any way.    7.  Lack of details about a lot of things readers want to know more about.  Breaking Dawn - over 700 pages.  Just how long do you want these novels to be?  Yes, I too want to know more.  I hope that Ms. Meyer writes backstory novels about all of the Cullens and uses the opportunities to fill in more general information.  But I'm also content to fill in the blanks myself if she chooses not to do so.    8.  Confrontation with the Volturi.  Some who complained about the bloody birth also complained about the lack of violence at the meadow scene.  Hmmm... questions of consistency anyone?  If Ms. Meyer had written in a violent confrontation, who do you think would have won?  The heroic Cullens, of course.  Boring.  It was much more interesting to see the Volturi withdraw - to fight another day.  Breaking Dawn left readers with the knowledge that it wasn't over.  The Volturi would certainly regroup and try once again to destroy the Cullens and the Denali coven (yes, both, in case you didn't catch that in the novel).    9.  Everything wrapped up nice and neat.  Uh, no.  See above.  Big, big threat that was not wrapped up.  Also, there is the potential future confrontation between Jacob and Nahuel over Renesmee.  As far as other story lines go - just see the title of the final chapter - \\"Happily Ever After.\\"  I don't want to overstep my bounds here, but I think that's a pretty good clue that Ms. Meyer has seen the entire series as a fairy tale that would of course be concluded with Bella and Edward supremely happy.    Please excuse the fact that I have switched back and forth between present and past tense.
0316098337|5.0|We read this book for a book club and I have to say that it is one of my favorites. It was so well written that you could not put it down. You just wanted to turn another page to see how it all works out. The subject matter (19 old woman abducted, locked in a small shed and has a child through her abductor), is truly horrifying but it is written so well that the focus is on the child and how amazing the mother was to protect her son and create a 'normal' life. Had I been told it was about an abduction I would not have read it, glad I did as I would really have missed a great book.   Amazing book...don't pass it up.

0240816250|5.0|Many photography books are full of promise, but after a few reads, end up on shelves or on the bookshop seconds pile. This book is not only beautiful and satisfyingly hefty, but it's the kind of book that is actually continually useful. I ordered this when it was announced, and so it was in my hands fairly early on - but even so I've only had it a few short months, and already I have found it a really useful tool. It consolidates knowledge I already sort of knew, whilst clearly outlining things I only vaguely understood, and was keen to know more about. There is so much information in this book, and it really is refreshing to see an up-to-date reference for an activity that has, let's face it, become rather niche!   I am very pleased I purchased the book and can see myself referring to it for years to come. Clearly written by folks who care about analogue photography.
1934356476|5.0|The technical writing is incredibly good. It's organized, and to the point. I would first learn ruby from another book, spend a few months writing ruby code, and then get this book. I think the topic is pretty narrow, but even if you don't use the techniques very often, it will take your ruby programming to the next level.
B003TXSF5C|4.0|Note: I am reviewing the Kindle edition.<br /><br />I found this book to be a satisfying read, and more importantly, an accessible tome, as compared to a \\"Brief History of Time\\". I'm no physicist, but I found some concepts as illustrated in the book to be fascinating.<br /><br />As for the ending, I'm somewhat a little bit disappointed; I was hoping for clarity, instead of a crafting a lame-ass excuse 'searching for the ultimate theory to solve all answers to the universe - M-Theory.\\" I suspect, gravity alone, is not the engine that sparked the Big Bang and helped spur the early creation of our universe.<br /><br />Also, I liked one chapter in particular; the \\"Miracle\\" of our green little planet we call Earth. A wide array of factors, all aligned just perfectly suited for life, helped formed our terra firma, and our existence as a whole. A whole lot of coincidences, all implausible in known science, helped create our solar system and our Earth, teeming with life. If it doesn't smack of 'intelligent design', I don't know what else can apply to this miracle.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book over Hawking's earlier work, \\"A Brief History of Time\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book im half way through but ive only been readimg for a day and its just one of those books that should be a movie
0061906220|3.0|The message of this book is great and the concept of the cat and his sneakers is fun, too.  I like how it encourages you to integrate rhythm into the reading.  But all in all, I found that it was much too simplistic and it's the kind of book that for my 2.5 year old, a few readings have worn it thin already.  It's not creative enough, in my opinion, to warrant it being a standby over time.
B0015DWLD0|4.0|The kind of impact the book leaves on the reader could be unique. You are not going to get motivated to fight the inequalities in the country. This could rather make you more selfish,more courageous and more fit to survive the buggered system. Enjoyed reading this book.
B000YDCFRE|5.0|I would like to thank everyone who wrote a review of these shoes suggesting to buy a size smaller than what you normally wear. I wear a 10 1/2 in Nike's, but ordered a 9 1/2 in these as reccommended and they fit perfect! These are a great pair of boots. Very comfortable right out of the box and look great. I haven't had any issues with these shoes and would definitely recommend them.
B0017KIBAI|1.0|BUYER BEWARE!  Apparently the Sellers linking to this product page are selling the american version controllers.  Maybe this link was for the Japanese version (w/longer cord) at first, but it is no longer.  I thought I was buying the Japanese version of the gamecube controller in part from the reviews here and especially because of the images of the Japanese Gamecube controller uploaded by Nathan S. on this products official Amazon page here.  I made my purchase based on this and I ended up getting a silver American version GC controller. There are many other reports/reviews of this from the individual Sellers linked to this Amazon product page as well.
B000002U82|5.0|Wow! All I can say is it's really hard to compare this to other albums. Pink Floyd's DSOTM is unlike anything I've ever heard before. I really wouldn't say there is a chance of this exceeding any of the best beatles albums, I really don't think anything can really touch their greatness. But with that said, this is a really good album all in all! Something about the flow of the songs altogether is.... briliant!     Ok, ok enough of that. It's time for a song by song review:    Speak to me/Breathe: The Album begins with haunting sound-effects such as laughing and screaming. After the screaming it goes into the song Breathe. Amazing song! Very different sound but... a good different! Very soft and calming. a great way to begin an album.    On the run: Very, Very different! I didn't expect something like this when I first heard the album. I think most would find this a little boring but it's something I've never heard been done before, so I do like it. And it does add to the magic of the album!    Time: The intro here is a little too long, but once the the song starts it's great! Powerful vocals, killer guitar and a short 'Breathe' reprise! This is a track that you'll find yourself wanting to hear this over and over again!    The Great Gig in the sky: Wow! Another thing I've never heard done before! Amazing! This one starts off with some interesting spoken lines which inform the listener what the song is about since the song itself doesn't have any lyrics.    Money: Ok, I think everyone already knows that this is a classic rock classic! Stunning!     Us and Them: Possibly the best song on the album, unlike anything ever done before. This song I can't explain, you just have to hear it to believe it! Incredible.    Any color you like: Intersting... It's almost like you can see the colors before your eyes as you listen to the strange sound effects through this song.     Brain Damage: Great song. Great lyrics. Nuff said.    Eclipse: One of the best tracks on the album. So simple but so briliant. perfect way to end the album.    Great album. A classic. Second biggest album of all time. Dig it!

Once you are no longer chasing your tail, you can devote your mental energies to better things in life and Buddha also shows you how to do that perfectly. You will also take better care of your physical health. Overall, a must read for mental and physical well-being. I loved Bhikkhu Bodhi neat introductions in the beginning of the chapters that excellently summarized meanings of the suttas.

B002QH2NUA|5.0|Simply awesome! Not only Beatles or McCartney fans, but anyone who enjoys good music should have a piece of that.  Playlist is very similar to the the tour Paul did late 2010 in LatAm.  And Something performance is unforgetable...  Just buy it!

0385340990|3.0|This book is a charming throwback to an earlier, gentler era -- on the surface -- but then offers a dose of reality that lands like a kick in the teeth. It presents as a series of letters to and from a 30-something Englishwoman circa 1946 who is searching for a new book project and winds up on the island of Guernsey, an English island off the coast of France that was occupied by the Nazis. The literary society was created to allow people to gather without arousing Nazi ire, and its surviving members share with writer Juliet Ashton the story of their lives under occupation. The pivotal story is that of Elizabeth McKenna, an Englishwoman who falls in love with a German officer, bears his child and winds up imprisoned in the German concentration camp from which she has still not returned. In some way, all of the characters in this book are trying to heal themselves and heal their world after surviving a terrible war. In order to do that, they must discover what happened to Elizabeth and how her story ends. Some may find the epistolary approach off-putting, but it worked for me.
0143145088|1.0|A friend of mine who I respect whole-heartedly recommended that I take a look at this book. He only said that it was interesting and thought I'd enjoy the topic discussion considering I work in a related career field. As one of the reviewers noted - none of the information is new. It is possible that the information is new and inventive to some; and they may also be the ones who rely on a media mogul who is starting her own network for \\"news.\\" My experience reading this book was like being stuck behind a Sunday driver and there's nothing you can do other than throw up your hands and scream \\"Come on already!\\" Yes - save your time (and your money) and watch a TED clip or pick up the book in the store and read pages 145-146 - \\"The central idea of this book...\\" Five short paragraphs and you're all set.
0307463745|5.0|A very quick read with some very good thoughts. Really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to my family and friends!

1439107955|5.0|Everyone should read this exhausting book.      It's 571 pages, it's arduous, the story is full of big disappointments and a few measured successes, but it brings clarity to maybe the worst and most secretive scourge of mankind.  You could hardly ask for a better history of cancer, first recorded in 2500 B.C. (with the chilling note: \\"Treatment: There is none\\").  In the following millennium, centuries, and decades that prescription would change - from carving, drainage, frogs' blood, holy water, `remote sympathy,' radical surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and, finally, targeted genetic interventions.  More often than not, combinations of these are used.  Writing in a style comparable to Bill Bryson's (scientific, historical, generously enriched by key personalities and anecdotes), he carries the reader through failure after failure and incremental advance until we not only understand the struggle, we feel the weight of it.    This disease, it turns out, occurs when a combinations of genetic mutations happen to co-opt a healthy cell for \\"its own purpose.\\"  Because it happens at the genetic level, it only has to happen once.  It hijacks just the right combination of normal functons.  The cell duplicates furiously (like young cells), stimulates local blood supply (as during injury), resists expulsion (like any real body part), never dies (like stem cells), and travels through the body (like antibodies).  It just takes one such freak to go and ruin everything.      Mukherjee's technical explanations are enriched by well chosen analogies and colorful key characters who have contributed one way or another: philosophers, doctors, researchers, patients, philanthropists, pharmaceutical companies, politicians.  He deserves a place in it himself -- honestly, the book is that good.    A word of warning: it's not for the impatient.  If you want a clinical update on advanced in the cancer war, or even just a concise read, you'll be frustrated with all the anecdotes as well as allthe false starts that have taken place, the shattered hopes, the failed experiments, and setbacks.  It's exhausting, but I say it's worth every effort.  One can't help but be impressed with, and thankful for, the unrelenting effort of physicians, researchers, politicians, and charismatic supporters.  This is science at its very best.      There are endnotes, a glossary, an index, a companion web site, and now my copy has a thousand marks and underlines. I suspect - I'm afraid -- this book will be coming off my top shelf as a reference book regularly.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I got this on Blu-Ray and it looks amazing! Its a teriffic mini-series. Great acting, so much attention to detail on many levels. A very well done piece of work! Love it!
B003CFBQBW|5.0|it came on time and was in great order thanks soooo much it was a gift to a friend who is a huge twilight fan she loved it i hope to do more buying from you soon!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|While other companies try to market all their special features added on to make a standardized product work better, Amazon just does it right, as it should. I also love the frustration free packaging - especially if you need to return something. I've bought cables from Monster and others and if there's an Amazon option, I'll always pick that first.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Love it, was hoping it had some bonus features but it doesn't, which doesn't matter, as long as Edward and Jacob are there!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I haven't had the chance to read this book but I know I'll love it. Rick did such a great job on the other six books that there's no way this book will amount to anything less.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I absolutely love this product.  I had a different brand that was horrible. It was real staticky and forced me to change between 2 stations during my 15min drive to work.  Also, it would not read wma's like it was supposed to do along with working with mp3 players. Luckily my husband accidentally broke it and I was able to get something else.  The sound quality is great, the screen is easy to see.  I love that it shows all the information about the song.  The sound quality is strong, it reads everything that it is supposed to and it works great on the same station no matter where I go.  The only minor complaint is that it does not work with all radio stations, however it gets in radio stations that weren't even a possibility with my old one.  To me, that is a plus, not a minus.  I highly recommend this product.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|A strange, sad and great film. Natalie Portman stars as Nina, a ballerina fighting for the top part in a production of Tchaikovsky's &#34;Swan Lake.&#34; She replaces an older ballerina (Winona Ryder), but not without competition from a younger doppelg&auml;nger (Mila Kunis). It’s similar to director Darren Aronofsky's previous film &#34;The Wrestler,&#34; in that it’s about someone who earns a living with through intense physical discipline (most of Nina's dancing was done by Portman herself, and it’s amazing), the stress aging has on their careers, and the fear of becoming irrelevant and obsolete. In many respects, though, this film is closest in tone to Aronofsky's second (and best) film &#34;Requiem for a Dream&#34;: it’s not terribly re-watchable, but it’s a thoroughly engrossing and heartbreaking portrayal of someone on a downward spiral. Hypnotic and brilliant.
0385738757|3.0|When I finished The Scorch Trials I didn't immediately get to writing a review because I couldn't really organize my thoughts on this book. I'm not even all that certain on the rating I gave it because I have so many conflicting thoughts. First of all, I did generally like the book. Some of the issues I had with the first book were toned down a bit so that I felt a little relieved while reading this one. Thomas, for example, is much less irritating to deal with. His narration is still a bit strange, I can't always comprehend his train of thought so that some of this ideas come off as a bit weird to me. It's not simply that I disagree with his thoughts and the actions that come about because of them, but I just don't understand his reasoning. For example: sometimes it feels like the author will make Thomas angry at someone for the sake of the plot rather than because it comes naturally. His anger will then lead to something particular happening in the story but I end up feeling annoyed because that anger seemed so contrived in the first place. This then makes Thomas's character a bit uneven and unlikable (on top of all the other issues I mentioned in my review of the first book). All in all though, he was easier to deal with. His moods didn't flip nearly as much, and he made wiser decisions when it came to dealing with dangerous circumstances.<br />Minor characters are still very fun, and I'm still rooting more for them than I am for characters like Thomas or Teresa. We meet a few new characters in this book, although I'm not sure what to think of some of them. There are a few I want to see more of and there are others I'm sure I'll see more of but don't really want to. Brenda, for example, was just strange from beginning to end. I'm not really sure I see the point in having her around, but I guess I will in the next book.<br />The story, at the very least, doesn't take a hundred pages to get going, because the action starts nearly at the first page. The Maze Runner took too long to really get going in my opinion, so I'm glad this wasn't the case with The Scorch Trials. There were points throughout where I felt like the author could've cut out scenes to help things run along more smoothly but nothing was ever too horrible. Thankfully there's a whole lot of action, maybe even too much action, so you never get bored waiting around for something to happen.<br />My real complaint, and possibly the reason that my rating for this one isn't higher, is the ending of the book. I had all kinds of problems with several details in the end (and I mean the very end, like the last five pages) but I won't go into that because I'm avoiding spoilers. It's not even that I'm demanding more answers, although that would be nice, it's simply that yet again I'm not understanding the behavior of characters and I think certain details were a bit silly to have. I could've removed a sentence or two and felt less annoyed. I know that sounds nitpicky, but I think you'd have to read it to see what I mean.<br />I'm hoping The Death Cure will be a satisfying ending to this trilogy. It doesn't have to have all the answers, I just don't want it to be like watching the last season of Lost all over again (especially since I heard the author is a big fan). I'd rather not be left with a ton of questions and no real resolution, because that would just make me regret wasting time on the whole trilogy. At this point, this whole thing could either turn out to be awesome or really, really pointless.  I'm really hoping it goes for the former.oo long to really get going in my opinion, so I'm glad this wasn't the case with The Scorch Trials.

B003Q6D1YW|3.0|This documentary is about an amateur photographer Nev Schulman. One of Nev's pictures catches the attention of a child artist named Abby Pierce. She friends him on Facebook, and Nev quickly becomes &#34;friends&#34; with many members of Abby's family, including her older half-sister, a songwriter named Megan. Nev pursues a romantic relationship with her, and she sends him MP3s of her songs, but Nev discovers they are simply copies of songs that can be found on YouTube. Nev eventually goes to meet her in person in Michigan, and I cannot say anything more without giving vital points of the film, suffice it to say that what happens from there on is completely and utterly fascinating. Audience reactions will be mixed (I see this as being fairly polarizing), but you owe it to yourself to take a look.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first with buying this product because I did not know if it was going to make it in time for Christmas. But the timing of arrival was earlier than was initially expected, it was well packaged (plastic bubble-wrapped which kept it from moving around), and was in great condition when it arrived (wrapping was in tact, not ripped or torn anywhere, and box was a nice presentation of the dvds and wasnt dented or fractured in any way). I was very pleased with the handling of its delivery and the price was more than fair and the best Ive seen for this product.
0439023521|5.0|I could not put this book down!  I did not expect to like it as much as I did upon starting; however, as I read further, I found myself fully engaged with the characters, the mentality of the society they lived in, and the environment they were facing.  I devoured this book in 24 hours, reading it every chance I could.  The next two books in the series are just as riveting!
B000002WPI|5.0|This was the GREATEST HIP-HOP/RAP GROUP OF ALL TIME!! You can appreciate the RZA'S production skills on this album and anything other WU-TANG album. You don't get raw, uncut, true lyricism like this anymore. This group is timeless and they're albums will forever be just as timeless as them. Thank you, RZA, METHOD MAN, GHOSTFACE, RAEKWON THE CHEF, OL'DIRTY BASTARD, U-GOD, GZA, CAPPADONNA AND ALL THE REST OF THE WU!
1416550534|3.0|I don't want to spoil this book for all the people that have loved it or will yet love it, but I'm sure I won't with my little review. If you're new to reading period pieces, not a literature major or haven't read/or have read but didn't enjoy Jane Austen, the Brontes, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edith Wharton, Henry James, etc. and want a clean (no sex or vulgarity), fast-paced novel about a another time with a little twist at the end, this book may be for you.    It was not for me. I found it flat, derivative, sterotypical, with no character development.     I would have kept my two cents to myself except that I wanted to express two things. One, that in writing you should stick to what you know and Ms. Morton admits in her Author's Note that she knew nothing about this time period and had to do research. Not surprisingly, her present-day main character, Grace, is the best developed character. When we go back in time we encounter one-dimensional sterotypes and recycled everything. But then, this book is wildly popular so if Ms. Morton were to stick to the time period she knows her fans would probably be dissapointed.     Two, I didn't appreciate the 'borrowing' of characters and other aspects of well-known books and tv shows. Maybe Ms. Morton intended it as a tribute but reading the dialogue of the cook, Mrs. Townsend and the butler, Mr. Hamilton, for example, and finding that they spoke word-for-word what Mrs. Bridges and Hudson from Upstairs Downstairs would have said, just seemed like 'taking'. And it just made for flat, near-caricatures.     I wonder if Ms. Morton may later regret not sticking to what she knows and writing with more depth and originality, rather than having huge book sales. She's not a bad writer but I felt she sold herself short a little and could have worked a little harder. Maybe it's all about the market and how to get published these days...
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is my first Brooks novel. It won't be my last. The author is short on formality, long on details, and just right with the format of the book. Brooks allows us to experience the fear, the suffering, and the hope of the entire human race through the firsthand accounts of his characters. What emerges on the other end of his dark tunnel may be a bit preachy for some, but overall Brooks's work is interesting and timely, and it's certain to provoke more than a few conversations with zombie enthusiasts and politicos alike.
B0021L9ME6|5.0|I recently watched this movie for the 1st time the other day. I was very impressed. I didn't find it cheesy or stupid. I give it 5 stars. It's nice to see some female superheroes out there. I love the action in this film & She looks amazing! MEOW!!
0307577589|5.0|I'd say this is the best book since J.K Rowling's Potter series. I found the movie a little less appealing though, especially due to subtitles, but the book is a must read! Once you get past the first chapter, you're bound to finish it that same night!

0060797509|5.0|I bought this book for my 9 year old step sister. It was the first of my favorite book series when I was her age, and I hope she enjoys it as much as I did. :)<br />The book was in perfect condition, shrink wrapped, and I like that it came with the little fiddle charm necklace.
B00006FDCD|4.0|This is one of the hardest movies to find, either on DVD or VHS.  It's not played on TV as often as every other Stephen King mini series.  Bought it for my son as a stocking stuffer.  Yeah, I know what your thinking.  He read the book first and I was happy to watch it with him.  The seller was honest regarding the condition of the product, it was good and the DVD was not damaged in any way.  Thanks
0451219597|5.0|I loved this book. This book was based on actual events.  I can't begin to guess the female spy that the character \\"Flick\\" represented.  There were numerous times during WW II, that extraordinary events occurred involving female spies in France.  A sudden opportunity would arise to gather information or to remove someone from the Gestopo.  There were several daring female agents that served during this time.  Many of the records for the SOE were sealed for many years, and others were actually destroyed at the end of the war.  This book was exciting action at its best.  One of the most interesting thing was how women went outside of the home and placed themselves in danger.  This was during a time period when women did not work outside the home.  However, England was literally imploding, because the men were fighting outside the country and women had to pick up the slack in factories, military, working the farms, and of course as spies.  I could not put this book down.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Run, don't walk, to see this movie. Make sure you take your insulin (and every little girl you can round up) with you.  I know I'm giving away a lot of the plot, but this is one of the s w e e t e s t movies I've seen in a long time.  One teeny spoiler:  You'll love the Minions lining up for good-night kisses...
B002ZG981E|4.0|This is one film that you cannot miss a minute of - can be confusing at times, unless you are paying close attention.  (At least this was true for me, maybe not for someone else).  I found the concept both fascinating and interesting, and in some instances, almost frightening.  Definitely worth seeing.  At last, something new brought to film, instead of reworking the   same old plots over and over.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|I really enjoy the 6th season of Medium.  I saw many of the episodes when they aired on Lifetime channel.  Now I am catching up on the rest of them. There is a show here for everyone.  There are episodes for the horror fans.  There are episodes for those who love romance.  There is also plenty for mystery fans!  One of the reasons I love this show is that it doesn't limit itself to one genre. Definitely a keeper!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|These films look and sound great, no question about that.  However, in playing them on my high-end Pioneer Blu-Ray player, one thing keeps happening that is quite annoying.  Namely, every once in a while a chapter title and timeline pops up, then disappears after a few seconds.  If this happened only once or twice it would be bearable, but after a while it starts happening with every chapter change.  This same problem has occurred on LG and Toshiba players.    Another oddity is that in order to get the sound to play, I have to load and boot up Alien, stop and eject it, then load and start it again.    Minor problems perhaps, but this is the first time I have had any trouble playing Blu-Ray disks on my player, and that includes some just-released items.  This is the only reason I would not give this collection five stars.    --Nightflyer
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I recently purchased this package because it contained the princesses Ariel and Tiana which all of the other sets I could find do NOT. My daughter's new bedding has Tiana/Aurora/Cinderella on it and she loves the Little Mermaid- so I was willing to pay a little extra to have ALL of these characters.  I'm so glad I did! The princesses are very good sized (about 12 inches each) and come with alot of little accent decals such as the 3 fairy godmothers of Sleeping Beauty, Snow White's blue birds, etc.    Also, the \\"jewels\\" that come with it are pretty and are larger than I expected. Overall these wall stickers are of good quality and well worth money! Oh, and if you have extra wall space look at the Disney castle mini-mural... it is a BEAUTIFUL combination!
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I have been a fan of Linkin Park for years now, and with each CD I have been even more impressed. This CD is no exception! Their music is at the same time beautiful, haunting, raw and powerful. I would highly recommend this album to anyone.

B0041CGP02|5.0|Not only do you get the greatest hits, but 4 new songs from what is one of the best of rock bands ever! Bon Jovi at their best is still better than nearly every other band on the scene today, with a career spanning more than 2 decades - a remarkable achievement with the quickly fading careers of most rock bands! This is a great album.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I am 7 months along and have been doing this video for about 3 months. At first it was a bit of a challenge, especially the squats! But the more I did it, the easier it got and the better I felt. I try to do this video at least 2 times a week alternating with elliptical workout on the alternating days. It makes me feel great and I feel like I am doing something worthwhile for my body. This is my 3rd baby and I have tried a lot of other pregnancy workouts; none have been as good as this one. I would definitely recommend this one!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|The DVD/Blue Ray is great but I forgot that my father's DVD player is not Blue Ray.  Do you have David Foster and friends in DVD form and not Blue Ray?  Please reply.   Thank You!  lindalawing@bellsouth.net.

030746363X|2.0|In one of the intro chapters to the book Tim goes over a 2.5% rule that basically states: \\"2.5% of the total subject matter provides 95% of the desired results.\\"    Incidentally this rule applies perfectly to the book--of the near 600 pages maybe about 2.5% is practical, useful, and worth reading; you just have to figure out yourself which one applies to you.    The problem with the book is that it immediately sets itself up for failure. The intro talks about how science is completely behind the times and that the \\"common knowledge\\" we have today started off as hearsay decades ago, and that it'll take many decades to make what is rejected today (and shown in this book) to become common sense in the future; but as the other reviewers have stated most people who have a decent amount of knowledge in fitness already grasp these principles.    He claims this is a research/science based book but most instances and examples he provides are purely anecdotal. A woman who wasn't losing much weight following his diet plan? All she had to do was cut back on her workouts and magically the results appeared. Interesting? Maybe. Applicable for the average person? Not quite.    The book also states the all changes are \\"small and/or simple\\"--yet they are often anything but. Eating at a restaurant then immediately going to a bathroom and doing squat exercises? Taking ice baths? No.    For each new strategy he discusses, whether it be a new diet or exercise plan is a tip sheet at the end with articles or links to other books to get \\"more info\\".     And even while preaching about the simplified diet, there are literally dozens of recommended supplements he mentions that the reader take for fat loss alone, and tons more for weight gain purposes.     For instance his muscle gain chapter lists literally a dozen supplements he took DAILY, with zero explanation on what any of them do, and even those who are familiar with supplements have never heard of before. Micellean? Policosanol? Slo-Niacin? Put all this in my body?    Simple?    Contradictories are everywhere as well; he says that the frequency of eating meals don't matter when it comes to fat loss, but in another chapter he says that less meals can lead to fat gain.     The other reviews on the book point these out as well.    So I do have to wonder how the hundreds of 5 star reviews were posted so quickly after the book launched--and why all the \\"most helpful\\" reviews are all critical of the book.    Also the first chapter I went to? 15 minute female orgasm--highly misleading.     And speaking of misleading, you, the reader, will NOT \\"gain 34 pounds (of muscle) in 28 days\\" as one of his chapter suggests.

1419553429|4.0|I liked the questions in this book. They were better than OG Verbal or OG Math guides. However, this is more or less a collection of advanced questions. Sometimes the explanations are not quite convincing, but they are much better than some other books.    For more comprehensive prep and guidance I recommend Veritas Prep guides.

0316067938|1.0|Let me preface my review by stating quality and quantity are not the same thing. Lots of Harlequin romances have been on the NYT bestseller list, as well as books like \\"...for dummies, the Secret,\\" and others have sold millions of books. Selling millions of books and having a lucrative franchise; does not equate to quality. There was not much quality in Mrs. Meyers work to began with and her \\"last\\" installment in this franchise fares much worse. I found that Mrs. Meyers writing style has continued to deteriorate as the books went on; this deterioration has also resulted in character annihilation. BD has 3 books in one: the first is Bella, the second is from Jacob's POV, and the last is Bella's again.<br /><br />The first book is about Bella's wedding and honeymoon. Although Bella is marrying Edward, somehow she still seems to believe that Jacob belongs in her life/their family. Edward being the epitome of a dream, is willing to allow her this concession. All Bella seems to care about is the sex she and Edward will share. Once again, I am subjected to Mrs. Meyers constant portrayal that Bella is unattractive; not worthy of this dreamboat, model vampire affection. The honeymoon goes as planned with a bump that takes too many passages to resolve. Bella ends up pregnant***. They cannot seem to know why and they rush home; Edward believes that he can get Carlisle to \\"dispose\\" of the child and save Bella, Bella want to have the child and enlist her \\"enemy\\" Rosalie to help.<br /><br />The second book deals with Jacob and his undying affection or \\"love\\" for Bella. He wants to see her and his pack is still constantly being subjected to his thoughts of her. He desperately wants to imprint after finding out she is sick and bruised with child. He wants to kill Edward and Bella if she is changed but as soon as he learns of her pregnancy, he cannot bring himself to do it. As some point he actually grows fond of Edward because he can see they want the same thing. He is willing to share Bella with an enemy; why does everyone in Mrs. Meyers works have low self-esteem? He breaks his pack, becomes an alpha and the Clearwaters join him. His novel ends with Bella giving birth and dying.<br /><br />Bella gives birth and dies; she is awakened as the most awesome vampire ever. She is graceful, skilled, more beautiful and calm them any vampire the Cullen's have ever seen. She makes Jasper question his very core, Jacob still sees Bella; it is sickening and inconsistent. Yes, Bella was dull and emotionless in her life, so this is magnified but she was clumsy; how can she jump and fly better than vampires who have been doing it for centuries? Problem: her awesome half breed dhamphir is confused as a baby turned vampire, here come the Volturi. No fight actually happens because Bella is so awesome, that she scares the royal group of vampires to concede. Jacob imprints on her, horribly name, daughter Renesmee and all is well. The End.<br /><br />Problems<br />*** First, being the horrible writer that she is, Mrs. Meyers never really thinks about how producing a dhamphir works. Vampires are rooted in magic: the same way the spawn of the devil is made with blood, is the same way lore explains how half breeds are produced; sex is not required. Being that Edward is dead, and if you mix in True Bloods lore that vampires bleed tears, that would mean that Edward impregnated Bella this way. But since the vampires in Twilight do not cry, how can he reproduce? Yes, she has a cop out that very few human/vampire relationships ever get to the intimate stage but it does not make sense. Seems Mrs. Meyers was just bent on giving the cliche happy ending.<br /><br />Second, lots of readers have inferred that whole reason Jacob loved Bella was because of Nessie. This makes no sense: yes, when Jacob came upon the baby because he wanted to see Bella, he could have imprinted then. But his whole relationship could not follow that logic. Alice's superpowers are rooted in the factthat any change of decision could result in a change of future. Bella's ridiculous seduction of Edward could not have worked; would Nessie be here then? Jacob would still be pining over Bella, they would have been in each other lives when Jacob saw fit; Bella never turn Jacob away. It is possible that the only reason he did not run, was because of them imprinting but this seems wrong.<br /><br />Imprinting is based on the premise in Mrs. Meyers work, that they will produce the best werewolf; how is this possible with a dhamphir? How is this suppose to be a happy ending? Knowing your technically 7 year old daughter will be an adult and in love with a 16 year old werewolf, who looks 25? I was able to overlook the frightening parallels in the subsequent novels but not in this one; it is too much.n a change of future.

B000063UR1|5.0|Good quality movie when played on HD tv.  Enjoyed the extras on how the movie was done on the aircraft carier Valley Forge.  Well worth the price for a used DVD!
B0000033J9|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie.  One of the true classics.  The soundtrack covers the entire movie.  Each track is very authentic.  I did not care for the additional tracks that modify the main theme, eg:  jazz, rock, etc.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who truly enjoyed the movie.
1434102815|4.0|The books came quickly and in good shape. I had seen a different version in the store so when I didn't get that exact version since I didn't see it on Amazon- I was disappointed, I guess going forward maybe distinguishing better between the different versions of the book may be helpful! Thanks!
B001DJLD1M|5.0|This movie is actually no harder to watch (for your head) than Star Wars but is a lot more satisfying.  The concept is as revolutionary as Star Wars or Star Trek and the action never fails to satisfy.  The love story doesn't leave you hanging either.  Good guys win and good guys lose.  And thank goodness evil is not the most powerful force on earth !!  The 4th disc is a cartoon story and fills in the few story gaps not shown in the real world acting portion.  Worth seeing after you finish the trilogy.

068987474X|4.0|Some of the suggestions are light-hearted and fun.  Don't take this book too seriously.  Some guys just need time to get to know you so don't dump them too soon.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|My story first goes back to 2001 where I first heard 'To Where You  Are' on the radio. Needless to say, I wasn't a fan straight away, but when 'You Are Loved' came out, I became a diehard  fan, even calling myself a Grobanite.  If  your going to buy a Josh Groban album, I suggest you get 'Closer' it is one of my favorites.  This album however is not. From the subpar performances that Josh has done, to the lackluster album, where notes are forced, and painfull to listen to,  this album lacks in so many ways it isn't even funny. Even his 'Awake' was much better then this.  The album lacks in songwriting, for me, if I don't relate to the lyrics of a song, it doesn't click for me and I don't like it.  None of the lyrics make sence on this album. With 'February Song' that was a hit. None of this songs are hit miterial.  Second of all things cannot be done in just one take. It might sound impressive to most, but not here. There is no emotion, no passion nor feeling when he is  singing at all.  A word of advice Josh, go back to your classical rutes, no more experimenting, it's over. Go back to making music with David Foster, and leave the songwriting up to the experts.  I unfortunately will not be seeing Josh on tour with this album like I have done in the past. I'm hoping that  this is not the future  of many Josh albums to come, because  if it is, I will be getting off the  Josh Groban train.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I grew up with the characters of Toy Story; the first film being released when I was 3, the second when I was 7, and the third months after I turned 18. With that in mind, it's worth noting that there's an added pathos to the proceedings in that regard. Toy Story 3 is Pixar's conclusion to their Toy Story films and while many studios could have just made a cash-grab based on an established name, Pixar has produced one of the best \\"threequels\\" you could hope to find. The film is the highest grossing movie of 2010 and it's been established by audiences and critics that saying a negative word about it is hearsay; but, luckily, that's not necessary here.    Andy is now all grown up and off to college, while his favorite toys have been cast off into the toybox hoping for the off-chance that Andy will play with them again. Planning to take his favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) to college with him and putting the rest of the gang in the attic, a mistake leads all the toys to end up at Sunnyside Daycare. A new villain emerges as the soft-spoken, purple teddy bear Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty) along with his henchmen Big Baby and Ken (Michael Keaton).     All of the main characters and voice cast from the previous two films return (with the exception of the late Jim Varney) and none of the charm of the original films has been lost. The toys really take center stage in this film, with very little human involvement this time around. In terms of storytelling quality and execution, Toy Story 3 is exactly what you'd come to expect from Pixar studios. Endlessly creative in their endeavors, I found the new toy additions brilliantly used (my favorites being Chuckles the Clown and the \\"eye in the sky\\" Monkey).     It's a wonderfully creative film that I enjoyed even more the second time around. It's got a witty, poignant script by Oscar-winning screenwriter Michael Arndt ('Little Miss Sunshine'), sight gags that are as amusing as ever, and voice work by actors who haved stayed with thesecharacters for over 15 years yet never lose their energy and flair. The latest voice actors to join are particularly good, notably Ned Beatty, alternating between comforting and sinister and Michael Keaton, a total scene-stealer.    As I mentioned earlier, growing up with these films in the way I have has added a significant amount of pathos. This is not more apparent than it is at the film's conclusion. The conclusion of Toy Story 3 is one of the most heartwrenching scenes I've ever encountered in an animated film. It may be because it seems symbolic of my own childhood ending or that it's just a really well-executed conclusion, but whatever the case...I can't help but be impressed by an animated film that nearly moves me to tears.    Toy Story 3 is not my favorite film of 2010 or even my favorite animated film of 2010, but I have to agree with the general consensus that it's one of the best films of 2010. An entertaining, amusing, exciting, crowd-pleasing close to an iconic trilogy of films that will appeal to both adults and children alike. There really isn't a negative thing to say about it.    GRADE: A-
B0017SWPXY|4.0|It was a good book. It got a little slow in the middle but picked back up nicely.<br /><br />If you have and like your dog it is required reading.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Kubrick vs. King? Both King's novel and Kubrick's film are creative powerhouses. Those wanting drama in the way of Jack Torrance's alcoholism won't find as much of it here as in the novel. The cases made in the editorial and customer reviews about Jack being a loon from the start are a little overstated. In the film, it's clear Jack's problems originated from his drinking and that they spiral downward into attempted murder due to the darker side of his nature as egged on by the memory-specters within the Overlook. While creatively altered, enough of the spirit of the story has been maintained. Films aren't novels and there have been far less faithful cinematic adaptations of source material before and since this one was made.<br /><br />And while this film did omit some great aspects of the novel (e.g. the dogman), it has several goodies of its own. The best little nugget here? Phillip Stone as Delbert Grady.  A minor flaw within King's work is this character, and Kubrick corrected it.  King greatly emphasized the foreshadowing of this character, only to present a nonchalant, rather underwhelming tone for Grady's great dialogue. In Kubrick's film this star part is treated more appropriately, and results in one of the best stare down scenes on film, beautifully shot and expertly acted. Even avid detractors of this film shouldn't fail to acknowledge the merits of this scene.<br /><br />Regardless of some content discarded from King's work, Kubrick certainly caught King's vibe. The scene in the novel with Danny playing in the snow and sensing the ghost of the little boy isn't in this film, but it assuredly found its way into Kubrick's inspiration. That he expounded on this and transmuted the story into a creative vehicle of his own should not be regarded as a slight to Stephen King or his novel. Rather, it should be seen as an example of how a great story can be capable of inspiring a great variation.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I was looking around for a great price on a doctor who DVD, and this is by far the best for brand new!  Season 5 is still just as great as the others and you would be a fool to stop watching after season 4!
044656740X|4.0|If you've just decided you want to become an investor, or you've been an investor but it's not working out, READ THIS BOOK! It explains what rich people do that you can learn. How to think Rich. But I have one suggestion to make, after you buy this book don't stop! Buy more books on the subject you want to go into, because Robert Kiyosaki does not explain in this book HOW to actually invest, he just gives you what you need to begin - the right mindset. So go ahead, buy this book, but do yourself a favor and buy more books as well.
B001AQO400|5.0|For insightful analysis of the essential qualities that make Lost in Translation a masterpiece, I suggest that Amazon customers read the Editorial Review by Doug Thomas and the featured customer reviews by Matthew Gladney and M.Burns.   But I will add that I saw this film when it first reached the theaters because The Virgin Suicides had convinced me of Sofia Coppola's brilliance as a director and because I was anxious to see a Bill Murray performance which had received such extraordinary critical acclaim.  I did not anticipate that when I left the theater that day, my heart would be aching from the whispered but almost unbearable tenderness of that \\"grace note\\" near the end to which Doug Thomas refers.  I went back five or six times before the film left town, and I bought the DVD the day it was released.  I am not condemning the views of those who do not respond to this film.  We respond according to the various ways in which our hearts are configured.  I know brilliant, sensitive music critics, for example, who simply cannot stand Mozart but love Wagner.  But if you are the kind of person who is fond of well-made, subtle, bittersweet love stories which move at a slow pace but build up astonishing power along the way, then you should at least consider watching Lost in Translation.  If I were a billionaire, and I knew that Sofia Coppola could make another film like this, but only if I footed the entire cost, with no promise of making a penny, I would write a hundred million dollar check in a heartbeat.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|One of his best works! My favorite is hell of a life. Just the beats alone are sick. Then I appreciate the other artist he collaborated with and what they had to bring to the table. ;)) Buy it!!!
0307454541|1.0|I found this story to be offensive and weak. This is not about making a stand against violence against women. This is about entertaining the public with lurid details of such violence, particularly with respect to Jewish women. In the end, it's all excused away by the hero. I think the book is gross and so are the vast numbers who enjoyed reading it.

1594744475|5.0|This book is SO GREAT. It has simple recipes and absolutely the cutest layouts for a bento box or even just gladware or tupperware! Some of the recipes look funny, but when you make them, are just so delicious! I recommend buying this book for sure, especially if you have school age children. Also, buy a little smiley face paper punch when you buy this, too, as punching out the silly little faces for the \\"pigs\\" and \\"chickens\\" make the meals that much greater! And faster! Bentos = cute ways to use new dishes AND leftovers!

B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I love that Disney is bundling their Blu-Rays with the Digital Copy and DVD. We have only one blu-ray player, so we can only watch blu-ray in one room. It's also great if we want to take the movie over to my siblings houses for their kids to watch, since they do not own a blu-ray player. The movie is of course adorable; it's a perfect addition to the Disney Princess movies.

B002ZG99QS|5.0|First of all, TRON legacy totally lives up to expectations and the hype. I enjoyed the movie every moment of it - the CGI as well as the plot on the whole. Ocscar winner Jeff Bridges has again delivered a great performance, but what is surprising is co-star Garret Hedlund does a very good job throughout the movie as Kevin Flynn's son who is eager to bring this dad home from the Grid. Hedlund is enthusiastic and charismatic, while Olivia Wilde is impressive in her role as Quorra.     The CGI is a great improvement upon that from the 1982 original and it is what audiences would expect from the highly anticipated sequel. However, I don't really think 3D does anything to improve the entertainment level of the movie (afterall, the 3D effect disappears after about two minutes, much like in Avatar). Some critics say the plot peaks too early when Sam Flynn meets his father in the electronic world now known as cyberspace (the term was never mentioned in the movie). But to me, the peak occurs towards the end of the movie, so it is well-timed in my opinion for the film.    The father-son relationship is very moving and the story hinges on it (job well-done for both Bridges and Hedlund). As a modern sci-fi movie, TRON legacy is an all-round success and would render a highly satisfactory viewing experience for many.

B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth has been one of my favorite films from childhood through adulthood. This movie combines an excellent and exciting plot that has fairy tale appeal, complex characters, and major theatrical moral dilemmas. Sarah is a girl fated to learn the lessons of life while attempting to conquer the many obstacles of the goblin city to rescue Toby, her little brother. Labyrinth will inspire and renew your interest in the world of fairy tales with the assistance of Jim Henson's lovable muffets, George Lucas productions, and David Bowie's vocal assistance. Take the chance to dive head first into Labyrinth.

B0001907DA|5.0|I watched the entire DVD collection and it was more than great. It's one of those movies that I would watch over and over again. I still like to think about the most random things that happened and they do always make me laugh. I told my younger brother who wants to be a cop \\"if this was real police work, I'll be already in\\" I wish they made more. Todays movies are somewhat funny. I use to be a scary movie fan but most of those movies have the same theme. I now switched to comedy.
0786838655|5.0|I absolutely loved this action-packed fantasy! It is an educational, fun journey for those of us who are not so savvy about Greek mythology.

044654759X|5.0|I knew nothing about this story when I received it as a gift and admittedly, I judged it by its cover.  I thought it was going to be a fluffy romance, without much intrigue.  I was wrong.  N. Sparks is a master at gradually turning up the tension and pulling the reader along.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a quick read, but didn't lack in character depth or a twist I didn't see coming.

0765328321|4.0|I confess that I'm not into games at all. Nevertheless, I very much enjoyed the \\"world\\" developed in the book. The novel tells the story of the \\"Master Chief\\" a.k.a. John-117 or Spartan-117 who, after being abducted by ruthless scientist Dr Halsey, is trained and genetically manipulated to become some kind of super warrior.  There are some shortcomings, however. For example: The weaponry depicted in the novel. (OK, I know that the novelization has to stick with what the game provides.) Laser guns, plasma guns, MACs and so on - all these are extremely close-range weapons and as such simply useless in most space combat situations. With those weapons, you wouldn't be able to fight a war in deep space where you'd have to take into account the vast distances involved. Laser (and plasma, for that matter) travels with the speed of light; MAC slugs, as stated in the novel, with 0.1c. Therefore it might take a laser beam several seconds to reach its mark, an MAC slug even longer. It would be like fighting a modern guided missile destroyer with the weaponry of a WWII destroyer. And, no, you can't \\"see\\" a laser beam, even in space unless you look right into the muzzle of the weapon firing it just in the moment of firing. But if you could see the laser beam - well, then you'd be dead, obviously. No, you can't dodge a laser or plasma beam fired, no matter how enhanced your reflexes and perception are. It simply happens too fast, especially in close quarters combat. So, to cut a long dissertation short: If you were close enough to effectively fight an enemy in a space battle with laser, plasma, or MAC weaponry (or 50 mm autocannons, as described in some scenes), you'd be definitely much too close.  But since the novel, as mentioned above, has to stick with the framework given by the game, this can't be chalked up to the novel. And in the game there has to be much WOOSH and SIZZLE and BOOM to keep the players happy.  What the novel could have done better, though, are some inaccuracies in the military aspects of the setting. Example: There is no navy I know of, and I can't imagine that there will ever be one, in which lieutenants junior grade, i.e. officers, will salute a master chief, i.e. an enlisted man, address him with \\"sir\\" and obey orders given by him. (I think this has been mentioned by other reviewers before.)  Besides that, the novel is a nice, entertaining read. You don't need to play the game in order to understand and enjoy it.

THEY DON'T LIKE IT, TELL THEM TO EITHER BECOME LEGAL, OR GO BACK TO MEXICO WERE THEY BELONG.IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED I'M OPPOSED TO IMMIGRATION, BUT LETS GET BACK TO THE FILM AND AVOID POLITICAL PROPAGANDA.        THE FILMS CAST CAN BE CONSIDERED OFF KILTER. FIRST OF ALL ROBERT DENIRO PLAYING A RACIST POLITICIAN IN A MOVIE HE SHOULD HAVE SKIPPED. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTORS OF ALL TIME. WHY WOULD HE GET INVOLVED WITH THIS? ALSO TO NOTE DENIRO IS COMPLETLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE CHARACTER HE PORTRAYS IN REAL LIFE. HE'S ACTUALLY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. NEXT DANNY TREJO AS THE LEAD STAR OF THE FILM. DANNY TREJO IS GOOD AS A SUPPORTING STAR PORTRAYING A VILLAIN. HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A HERO. HE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A ROCK QUARRY THAT'S BEEN DYNAMITED. ITS A JOKE ON THE AUDIENCE TO SEE HIM AS A GOOD GUY.HE WAS GREAT IN MOVIES LIKE DESPERADO, HEAT, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, ETC. HE'S PRIMARILIY CAST AS A VICIOUS VILLAIN, NOT A HERO.FINALLY LINDSAY LOHAN IN A FILM. WHY DO THEY KEEP GIVING THIS DRUG ADDICTED PIECE OF GARBAGE MOVIE PARTS? LEAVE HER IN JAIL WHERE SHE BELONGS. FINALLY JESSICA ALBA AS A FBI AGENT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? SHE PROBABLY COULDN'T FIRE A DAISY BB GUN. SEEING HER IN THIS PART WAS JUST AS FUNNY AS SEEING JESSICA BIEL AS A SOLDIER IN HOME OF THE BRAVE.UNFORTUNATELY THESE 2 YOUNG WOMEN LACK THE KIND OF TOUGHNESS THAT MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ HAS.         NOW THE POSITIVES ABOUT THE FILMS CAST:         IT WAS GREAT TO SEE STEVEN SEAGAL AS A VILLAIN AND HE WASN'T SO HARD TO KILL INTHIS FILM. (PARDEN THE PUN). HE ACTUALLY STOLE THE SHOW. THANKS STEVE! THE FINAL BATTLE WITH HIM AND TREJO WAS FUN TO WATCH.BRINGING JEFF FAHEY AND DON JOHNSON IN THE FILM AS SUPPORTERS WAS NICE. FAHEY IS A FINE ACTOR THAT'S RECENTLY BE SEEN ON THE SHOW LOST. WE ALL KNOW DON JOHNSON FROM THE MIAMI VICE DAYS. FAHEY PLAYS A CORRUPT POLITICAL AID TO DENIRO AND THE FATHER OF THE LOHAN CHARACTER. DON JOHNSON IS THE BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO WOULD RATHER SHOOT ANY ILLEGALS INSTEAD OF ARRESTING THEM AS THEY CROSS THE BORDER. ALSO MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ AS A FOOD STAND WORKER WHO ENDS UP JOINING A IMMIGRATION RESISTANCE UP AGAINST DENIRO. SHE WAS PERFECTLY CAST FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART. THIS ACTRESS IS SEEN IN THE SHOW LOST, RESIDENT EVIL, AND SWAT. SHE ALWAYS PLAYS A HARD CORE TOUGH GIRL AND THE SAME KIND OF CHARACTERIZATION IS PORTRAYED HERE. SHE WASTES QUITE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE FILM. IN FACT SHE'S RIGHT UPTHERE WITH TREJOS CHARACTER WITH THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE SHE KILLS. IT'S NICE TO SEE CHEECH MARTIN AS A DRUNKEN PREACHER TO LEND SOME COMEDY TO FILM. UNFORTUNATELY HIS PART IS WAY TO SHORT.           ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, THE FILMS DIRECTOR, IS VERY ADEPT IN FILMING ACTION SCENES. SOME OF THE SLOW MOTION STUFF IN PARTICULAR. THE WAY HE DIRECTS TREJOS CHARACTER ALL THROUGHOUT THE FILM WAS UNIQUE. YOU WOULD THINK TREJO COULD BE A FUTURE ACTION FILM STAR TOUGH GUY LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD.EVEN AT HIS PRESENT AGE DANNY TREJO ( A FORMER BOXER BY THE WAY) HAS THE PHYSICAL CHARECTERISTICS TO PULL IT OFF.           SO A SHORT SUMMARY. ILLEGAL ALIENS TRY TO GET INTO COUNTRY ARE KILLED,AND A COP,TREJO COMES TO THE RESCUE OF HIS COMPADRES, ALONG WITH RODRIQUEZ TO OVERTHROW SEAGAL'S CHARACTER TORREZ A DRUG SMUGGLER AND DENIRO'S CHARACTER, A CORRUPT RACIST POLITICIAN WHO ALSO KILLS ILLEGALS HIMSELF. NUFF SAID...
B003UYUQZW|2.0|After reading the glowing reviews listed here, I was anxious to see this exciting movie.....and boy was I glad I borrowed it instead of buying it!  Acting was barely adequate (sorry Jake), story line was predictable as H-ll, attempted \\"tongue and cheek\\" humor was lame, and the action was choppy and hardly \\"edge of your seat\\".  Rent it, or borrow a copy, or wait for it to come on Cable.  You really won't want to watch it more than once.  In fact you might not even want to bother watching all of it.  Ending was totally predictable.  And ostrich races??  Disney are you trying to cash in on the success of Swiss Family Robinson??  Well, it didn't work.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Bought this for a family member for Christmas who is a huge Beatles fan, made her cry! It is an amazing set and...just wow.
B004F9OV5C|4.0|Very readable, even if it is a pot-boiler. One should point out the moral downfall of hero, Adam. At first he is simply a victim. Soon he is stealing a white stick so as to impersonate a blind man to increase begging returns. By the end he murders another down-and-out without a moments thought.    Among the Boyd inventions is the fine paranoid religion of 'Christ St John' based on the idea that John impersonated Christ in order to get the 'wrong' man crucified so as to allow Jesus to escape and write Revelations...The religion is soon corrupted by money...
B002ZG99A4|1.0|This is by far the worst mainstream movie of 2010... I could not even sit through all of it..... The acting is painful at best.... and the story got stuck in the 1980's somewhere.... maybe that is what they were going for but I have to ask myself WHY? There will always be a few that rave about movies like this but not me....
1400031001|2.0|Boyd is always readable though here it takes some effort. Minor characters ,real and imagined, from a wide variety of odd episodes in the 20th century  drift into the story and then, more often than not, drift off again immediately after a drink and, as we Brits call it, a fag. Why so many? Especially in the world of 'modern' art? Is there going to be a test for readers at the end?    The main thing is to try to read Boyd's intentions. We are essentially following the lives of 3 boys from a minor public (private in the US) school throughout their lives from the 20s to the 90s. None, including the 'hero', are made very attractive let alone pleasant or even genuinely interested in other people let alone women.They all live in a world or writers and art dealers which never once becomes interesting.Is that the whole point? If so then it succeeds in making it hard work in following a main character we do not really care for or about.    Then the choice of episodes is very bizarre. Oxbridge, the General Strike and Edward VIII are pretty much main stream for 20th century novels and these sections may just be rather dull satire. Then we get into a parachute mission into....wartime Switzerland (really!) ,followed by a dreadfully dull two years in prison written in what seems to be real time, followed by German militant politics, the Biafra war in Nigeria and a return to France to open the question of loyalty under the Vichy government. None of these three episodes is remotely convincing; the German episode being far less frightening than the reality and the Nigerian period almost an afterthought as if left over from notes for Boyd's other works.By then the reader has long since ceased to care. But was that the whole intention?
1595825045|5.0|This book is not only beautiful to look at but gives you a wonderful in depth look to the shows creation. It's like stepping in the world of Avatar all over again. It's a large format book in size but is spilling with information. It doesn't have too much copy that makes it long to read but includes many steps of the development for the series. You see sketches, animation scenes, background paintings, original architectural sketches and so much more. For any Avatar fan it's a must have especially if you are a person who enjoys the creative side of life.
B003ELOQD4|4.0|This is sure a lot of value for a U2 fan; the video and audio are exceptional and empower an impressive show. The song selection is amazing, and the 360 stage is really worth seeing/hearing (it's not just about the visuals; the 360 provides a never before audio experience that the Blu Ray captures). The performance is flawless, with some interesting extras (I`d say they should include more 'behind-the-scenes'material, but other than that some really cool stuff, especially the making of the stage).  Really worth the dollar!
B002L5GQGY|1.0|I've tried to like his music so many times but in the end, I just don't see what the big deal is about this guy. He's is obviously an excellent guitar player but his tone is generic and his original songs are instantly forgettable. He's is not in the same league as Hendrix, Clapton, Rory Gallagher, SRV, Warren Haynes, Duane Allman, etc.
0143118420|5.0|A few days ago, a friend posted on Facebook that she had watched \\"Eat Pray Love\\" and had found it beautiful. ... ... ... In reading that short statement, I knew immediately she couldn't have read the book.  I commented on her status, saying, \\"The movie is pretty but the book is profound.\\"  That friend is soon going to be reading the book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0143118420 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]] sat on a shelf in my home for over a year before I was [apparently] ready to read it.  When I finally sat down with it one day this past summer, I was gifted with realizations, \\"aha moments\\" and recognitions time and time again.  I reread passages, posted quotes on my Facebook profile, laughed, cried, gasped, ate, prayed, loved.<br /><br />This book is one of my few keepers; for me, it is akin to a reference book.  I gifted my Mom with it at Christmas and look forward to discussing it with her.  Oh!  And my word is \\"awakening.\\"
0439023513|4.0|From the start you know this book will not have any Hunger Games because of what transpired in the last one.  So it's all new ground for the writer and Katniss to tread.  However, it takes a while for the book to get as interesting as expected, which didn't happen for me until half the chapters were gone.  That's when things start getting darker, grittier and supporting cast starts biting the dust, and they do so quickly.  I did not like that a couple of characters I favored were given such a quick demise, but that is what the writer went for, making sure to depict the battle against the Capitol as violent, chaotic and bloody.      It isn't a bad conclusion to the trilogy but it's certainly not a happy ending, everything-is-fine-now kind of deal.  It is an ending that further scars the main characters forever, physically and mentally, pushing them over whatever limits they thought they had.  In that sense, I like the writer's boldness, doing whatever she wants with the direction of the story and the fate of the characters rather than delivering feel-good cliched ends.      Now that there will be movies about this, I feel that they will fail from the get-go if they are not rated R or a hard PG-13, because there is no way to drive the drama and poignancy of these books into the audience collective psyche without subjecting them to the blood splatters and body mutilations of the many horrific ways people die throughout the story.    One thing that bothers me a bit is that I never viewed this world as the future of our current world, because many things feel limited, like each sector produces one main type of product (sounds inefficient and unrealistic).  What goes on in the lands that are not sectors?  Wild people? Other civilizations?  The writer never dabbles on it and frankly does not care in providing the view of the world as Tolkien and R. R. Martin and other detail-happy fantasy/sci-fi writers do.  I suppose you just assume they are nuclear wastelands and carry on with the story.  Maybe the Capitol in its absolute control hasn't told the people what else is out there. Who knows?  There might be more ground for Ms. Collins to cover if so, but it would have to be new characters to do so.     Overall, this a worthy trilogy to read and I will keep it in my collection.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|This is a \\"B\\" movie. I don't think it's particularly great itself, though it is interesting. But I give this 5 stars on the strength of Kurt Russell's performance. I have never been able to count the number of words he says throughout the movie, but I suspect it may be under 100. Yet his performance should have received at least an Academy Award® nomination. It is a remarkable performance through expressions, composure, and delivering each word exactly as a professional should. I like Kurt Russell. One of my favorite movies is Overboard, which is night and day from this film. And he got a lot of notice in Miracle. But his performance in Soldier is the best I have seen. I have little doubt that he was overlooked for a nomination because of the nature of the rest of the movie. It is dark. And there are significant moments of violence which some groups prefer not to watch. But I recommend it just to watch him handle this part. Maybe someone else here already has. If not, try counting the number of words he say. I know it's likely around somewhere. As others have said, this movie grew on me.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|My son received the Beatles Blue CD last Christmas. He wanted this to complete the collection. The set does not arrive in a jewel case but that is OK. It is quickly transfered to his MP3 or our computer. The remastered sound quality is very good. A nice collection of early Beatles work.
1438509480|5.0|Helpful introduction to set the genre and context help make this a pleasure to read.  You may use it as a daily devotional.  Or you may want to read it over a weekend.  It truly is one of the great works in history.
B002VKB0M4|5.0|I do believe that it takes a bit of patience on the part of an American viewer to comprehend the deeper areas explored in French film. Often I see that we rarely can look past our ignorance and cheeky criticism of \\"French anything\\", and it is a shame because their film is so much more powerful and thought felt than any American or British product. They may not be up to par on our cliche action flicks or our type of film but they instead offer a great, refreshing look at film that boasts strong emotions. That after all is what French life is about. They live life not as we do, they respect it's greatness and they live for the day. After spending some time myself in Paris I can tell you that unlike American film which rarely correctly reflects upon our culture, this movie does. If your looking for a bit of Paris for yourself and a real feeling that can little be achieved elsewhere, find it in this film. I loved it, and you will too if you are looking to learn something. It also couldn't hurt to love the langauge, but honestly subtitles are hardly something to hold against any film.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  I knew I would because I like the first two.  The acting was superb as usual.  Can't wait will the Breaking Dawn comes out.
B003MX5P20|5.0|Enrique's style remains as fresh & original as ever, an entertainer for the ages! He provides the kind of sound that never grows old.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I'm not rating the movie. If you don't already know how awesome it is, there is no help for you. If you do love this movie, splurge for the Blu-Ray version. The colors are spectacular: vivid, rich and deep. The picture is not faded like the VHS or DVD versions. But I feel I should warn you, if you are already tempted to watch it frequently, Blu-Ray will make you want to watch it every day. In fact, I think I'll go turn it on right now.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is great music that you can play while doing other things, or just listen to.  I'm glad Susan Boyle was introduced to the world so she could give us her beautiful music to listen to.
B004BEMC6G|2.0|Well I start saying, I am a big fan of Angeline Jolie. I always like her strong face features, even when she was slim I can still believe her role, example Lara Croft not really great movie, but love her acting. Here ahh.. I think Angie needs to start eating. Is my same comment for Maggie Q, and I totally dislike her. But you can't do a role of violence when your body does not look the part no way, it looks silly. Male actors tend to work there body really for that type of role, females should do the same. I want a woman looking like Michelle Rodriguez body at least... but I guess she is to latina for the role, but she does look the part, or Angie please start to eat. It was passable but it also have to many unbelievable moments, to many of them, there is no way she can jump so many cars without breaking any bones, no way. Or jump down the elevator like that, or even fall from the Helicopter without actually aiming to fall in a correct way and survive after that fall, specially in the Potomac in plain winter.   I do like her fight scenes, they were better when she didn't have to do anything out of the ordinary.   Chiwetel Ejiofor oh man... he is bad.. really bad actor, I just couldn't care less about him.

1932907009|2.0|With all this hype, you'd think Blake Snyder would be a screen writing God.  However, he only wrote 2 major motion pictures: \\"Blank Check\\" and \\"Stop! Or my Mom Will Shoot.\\"  Both are lame kids movies from the 90's.  It seems Blake Snyder made a fortune selling scripts that were never made into films.  Snyder tells you how to make a script that SELLS - which is very different from writing one with a good story.  Snyder picks on \\"Memento\\" and M. Night Shyamalan's \\"Signs\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\" because they don't follow the PREDICTABLE AND CLICHE Blake Snyder formula and literally challenges you to e-mail him to debate the value of these films (he gives you his e-mail address for this purpose - too bad he's dead, cause I'd love to contact him).  Snyder openly admits to being arrogant and bullheaded - which would be fine if he'd written some great films - but the guy is really a nobody.      Sure, there were some interesting points, but most of this book is common sense and you'll find the same info in other books.      Don't \\"Save the Cat\\" - Save Your Money instead!
B001AQT0RC|2.0|Before I review this film, I am going to say this. If you haven't seen this film - don't. Track down Disney's 80s made-for-cable \\"Flight of the Navigator\\" and be happy with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday night. But if you must...    Contact is a difficult film to review. Based on Carl Sagan's serenade novel to the stars, the ambitious, and occasionally moving, story of Ellie Arroway taps into the romance of stargazing but fails to explore the larger implications of the Pandoras Box it opens. Like a black sheep family member, I really can't hate this film, but it is also so difficult to love it.    In many ways Contact is a concept film - a \\"what if\\" statement on a slice of Kubrick's 2001: A Spacey Odyssey. \\"What if\\" somebody made an entire film on somebody discovering the monolith from 2001? \\"What if\\" the monolith and signal is a radio transmission telling us how to construct an advanced piece of technology? \\"What if\\" we ditch the stark soundtrack of deep breathing sounds and add pulsing radio transmissions, romance and a sad story of a little girl losing her dad? This is the movie Contact is. On paper, it all sounds so interesting, but somehow it all goes very wrong.    Jodie Foster invests heavily in Ellie and so does the audience. She is stubborn, driven and also charismatic. What I am not persuaded by is the script's tacky father-daughter story laced so sloppily into the plot. What I feel, is there is a greater story to be mined here, but the father-daughter angle rings hollow. John Hurt is wasted as a Yoda inspired bald genius and every other character in the film seems recycled from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest institution staff. There are too many villains and the only supporting character with more than one dimension is Matthew McConaughey.  This is one of those movies where everybody is crazy and evil but Ellie.  Everybody knows better than Ellie - they know so much better, they do everything she says and in the end, still make her think she is crazy. Ellie discovers the sound, Ellie discovers the bomber, Ellie...well you get the idea.  All the males are paper cut out bastards and little old Ellie is the perpetual victim.  It is one of those movies where you are continually frustrated by the contrived characterizations and idiocy of the characters and writing rather than engaging into the story.  Yes it is one of those movies.       The film is based largely on the idea and euphoria of discovery, but the film offers so little of it. Director Robert Zemeckis tries desperately to resolve questions about aliens and religion within the social conscious, but instead we are given long lectures, congressional testimonials and emotional schlock more fitting to the Young and the Restless. Like a bad episode to the TV series LOST, there are many exciting ideas in Contact but they end up flushed by filmmakers and writers who are afraid to take on these ideas, or even any of Carl Sagan's ingenuity or conjectures from the novel, with any seriousness or dedication. The filmmakers take the easy way out and play out melodrama instead of insight.  The novel's intricate plot is ditched for a \\"are you kidding me?\\" laugh-out-loud \\"alien\\" beach rendezvous and intelligent writing is ditched in favor of teary-eyed soliloquy to tug at your heart strings. The search for intelligent life in movies continues.    The finality doesn't do justice to Ellie Arroway any of the deep ideas proposed by the plot or ultimately to the intelligence of the audience. There is, however, one brief redemption. There is a moment in the film where Ellie is lying in the Plains of San Augustin under the VLA telescope listening to static. This is when the first pulse of the alien signal hits. Ellie's eyes grow large and so do ours. It is an incredible epoch. It is the only moment in the two and a half hour film where Contact actually makes some.
B00021HBGS|5.0|I bought these for my daughter when she was 18 months and they've kept her interest now for many months!  The quality is superb; even when she's tried chewing them they've held up well.  She quickly learned the names of the various vehicles, and it was a fun way to introduce her to the kind of themes that are typically for boys...it's nice that the ambulance is in a group of several other kinds of vehicles such as \\"produce\\" truck and \\"ice-cream\\" truck...this set does not make me think of of emergency type vehicles or situations that are so common in toys that are designed for boys.  My daughter loves her baths and looks forward to playing with this set.
0061684384|5.0|High Voltage Tattoo by Kat Von D is a visually stunning book that is designed like a scrapbook to show off the life and art of Kat Von D. This is a great book if you are a fan of L.A. Ink, tattoos, or just Kat herself.<br /><br />L.A. Ink is a great show on TLC that I've watched many episodes of. Reality shows that show off artwork with tattoos is fun to watch. I may not personally have a tattoo, or plan to get one in the near future, but if I ever did, it would have to be from someone as talented as those on that show. They make the standards high!<br /><br />High Voltage Tattoo by Kat Von D is all about who she is as an artist, and as a person, giving you a glimpse into the highly interesting life that she lives. You get to see pictures of the first tattoos she ever gave, and even her artwork as a child.<br /><br />Ever wonder what Kat Von D's tattoos mean, or just want a closer look at them? Well, inside High Voltage Tattoo, you get to see Kat's tattoos up close and personal, and she explains what they mean to her. Very cool part of the book.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the book. It still doesn't make me want a tattoo (unless it is temporary) but I still enjoyed looking through it. If you like Kat, enjoy tattoos, or perhaps just like L.A. Ink, you will enjoy this book too. I also think that this book would make a perfect gift for someone you know that also loves tattoos. They may have never heard of this book, and it would be a very fun surprise gift!<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of High Voltage Tattoo, Collins Design, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I'm telling you, SALT is awesome. I don't care what action movie you have seen already . No movie even comes close to SALT in this action/thriller. Sit down in front of your big-screen TV and hold on to your seat. You will yell, screan and holler...You think the Jason Borne movies are good? You think Daniel Craig as the latest James Bond is good? Do you think the Expendables with Stalone & Company was good? You thought the Transporter movies were good, huh? Well they were. But you haven't seen any thing like this movie. Right now SALT is the \\"Thrller of Mania\\" of action/thriller movies, bar none.  Angela Jolie was absolutely superb.
B0041T52S6|5.0|It may or not be exaggeration to state that this is the film for my generation. The story isn't ground-breaking but the presentation is something truly unique (util it is mercilessly copied).    The DVD is nice, I enjoyed the extras (multiple commentary tracks, bloopers, deleted scenes, etc.). I only wish I had gotten the BR/DVD combo pack instead.

B002ZG98UA|3.0|Resident Evil: Afterlife is arguably the weakest in the series. Yes, it has action. And yes, it has zombies. But it has hardly any actual zombie action. Most of the action in this one is between humans. Bad guys vs. good guys. There's only about five minutes of zombie action in the whole movie, and it's awesome while it lasts. Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long. It's as if Paul W.S. Anderson didn't want to make a horror movie this time around, but a shallow action movie that rips off The Matrix series. There's also a lot of boring dialogue. Let's hope that if there's another Resident Evil film, that it has a lot of zombie mayhem.
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|This is a tremendous and beautiful movie.  Since I'm not a Chaplin scholar, I won't describe or analyze it in full here, but suffice it to say this is an excellent movie and worth a look for anyone with an interest in economics, sociology, film, history, film history, Charlie Chaplin, etc.    As for the edition itself, it's great, as Criterion Collection usually is.

B004B63M1S|5.0|Machete is not meant to be taken seriously but there are actually more political messages in it than one might expect from a film of this nature .<br />I thought it was Grade A entertainment from Frame one.If you're a gore hound or an action freak it will satisfy you more than a snickers would a fat kid at fat camp.<br />All the performances were what they were supposed to be,even the over acting \\"even for this\\" Stephen Seagal didn't come across as out of place.I have nothing but praise for Machete and am thrilled that Veteran Character actor Danny Trejo' has a role as leading man instead of the usual ex con supporting roles he is given.I mean don't stop with the supporting roles a man still has to eat but you catch me.Michelle Rodriguez is also excellent as SHE...

B000EU1PKA|2.0|i dont like this album. i see a lot of reviews on here saying how 'imaginative' and 'different' this album is, but, that does not a good album make.  everything about this album is BAD. from the ludicrous album title to the incredibly stupid artwork, and the bad songs. this IS NOT  a helloween album. I DONT KNOW WHAT BAND THIS IS, BUT IT'S NOT HELLOWEEN. after albums like WALLS OF JERICHO and KEEPERS 1&2, this is a terrible folow up. and they did even worse when they followed THIS tragedy up with their next album, CHAMELEON. neither album has that helloween sound that their fans truly love. it really seems as if another band wrote both of these albums and slapped the 'helloween' name on them. this is helloweens 'RISK' or 'ST ANGER'.  now there are a couple tracks that are noteworthy on this album. the tracks 'kids of the century' and 'the chance' are good songs, but those two songs alone are not enough to save this album.  helloween is my favorite band, and i love almost all of their albums, but i just cant give this album any type of positive review. there just isn't anything redeemable here. if you're looking for a good helloween album, try 'time of the oath' 'better than raw' 'gambling with the devil' or their new album '7 sinners'. ANY other helloween album is better than this one.  don't waste your time or money on this. you'll listen to it once or twice and then it will end up gathering dust on a shelf.

1608870081|5.0|If you are a real Harry Potter fan you will love this book. I have been collecting Harry Potter pop-up books since the first one came out titled, \\"Hogwarts\\". Since then I have collected a couple more (as these are either hard to find or not made). I was very happy to see another pop-up connected with this series. As a collector of Harry Potter memorabilia I am really happy with this book!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I had to read this for Book Club. I had to make myself finish it.  I couldn't manage to care about any of the characters or their situation.  Too surreal. This probably won't happen in my lifetime. Not a fun book to read.
0061537934|3.0|This book is about a race car driver going through some of life's downs as seen through the eyes of his dog. It's a novel idea to give a somewhat generic story a different point of view, but besides that novelty there really is not much else going for this book. There is a lot written about the technicalities of racing, which is meant to be metaphorically interwoven with the plot line - I found that it did not really add much to the book and I even started skipping those parts that I knew were going to be solely \\"racing\\" based. The writing is simple and at some points funny...I just wish it head more depth to it. Typically such gloomy plots get me teary eyed but this one did none of that; it was a sad story but the characters did not get me so emotionally involved that I actually FELT sad. I would only recommend this if you're trying to kill time and have no access to other books; the book is not a complete waste but it's also just not that great.
B0009NCQJ6|1.0|I bought this for my daughter but it won't work in her Mac laptop.  It works in my PC, but it write-protected so I can't burn a CD for her.  I am extremely disappointed that this is not labeled more clearly on Amazon!
B000UX6THK|5.0|Read the multitude of other reviews for synopsis and detail about the story, setting, and characters.<br /><br />As someone who knew nothing about Twin Peaks, here are my reasons for recommending this series.<br /><br />One, the story line is fun, exciting, and keeps your attention.  It is not a sitcom.  Two, this is a continuing story.  You will probably not be able to watch it on TV.  Even if you do, if you miss an episode, the story line is broken, so don't try it.  Three, this program is one of a kind.  There is nothing like it.  No one has copied it. The plot is so unique that you will not be watching some writers' rehashed dialogs and plots.  The price is great, and you will have hours of enjoyable entertainment.  Enjoy.
B002ZG981E|5.0|What can you say, a great movie with a great cast.  Not your typical over the top CG effects type movie, but one with cool effects and deep thought provoking dreams!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This was one of my favorite books when I was little. I read it multiple times, and even held my own version of their Pilgrim's Progress roleplay. I hadn't read it for years, but when I got my Kindle for Christmas and saw this free version, I had to download it. The book is still as wonderful as I remembered (and some part of me still pulls for Jo and Laurie to get together, though I love Professor Bhaer, too). It's a gentle, quiet book filled with profound wisdom and loving relationships between family members. The path of growing up is never easy, but this book shows how for many, faith and family can be the underpinnings for a bright future.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This was nicely packaged and easy to assemble. The instructions are pictures and arrows, which were sufficient. I had three of them assembled and mounted in a matter of minutes. The parts seem strong and durable.<br />  It is difficult to get the monitor adjusted exactly where you want it. They have allen screws. Knobs to adjust the tension would have been preferable. A single monitor is not difficult, but getting two or three to sit at the same height is NOT easy! Once they are there, they are beautiful though!
B004BEMC6G|4.0|Good, fast paced action.  It will keep your interest if you like these action-spy movies.  Would have loved to see more character development and more of the back story but I still really enjoyed the movie.  I am a big fan of Angelina in these types of roles though anyway.  I think a sequel could be really well done and even better so we'll see....
B003AOAXGE|1.0|Considering this is a Russian tale, the artist took too much artistic license for the setting and characters for my liking.  I had to use many other materials to introduce \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" before I ever got to showing this video.
0553583182|1.0|This is my first harsh review.  I can't believe these many glaring reviews on this pure garbage. The author mentions that he'll show \\"scientific\\" way of praying or something like that and talks about nothing more than self hypnotism. This is a book of anti-reason, self-deception. We call this kind of approach as \\"pseudoscience\\", which means, 'NOT SCIENCE'. OR, we can call this book \\"religious\\", which is again \\"NOT SCIENTIFIC\\".  I bought this book because I thought I would acquire understanding of my subconsciousness. But when I began to read, I couldn't believe my eyes because the plot of the text is a 'textbook' pseudoscience. It looked like 'subconscious mind' is 'mindless stupid GOD'. I'm very confused. How can this kind of book get such good reviews? If this book can get 4.5 avg stars, Stephen Covey's 7 habits book must get 1000 stars.  Some people might say that this is not a scientific book from the start and I made mistake to buy this. I'm very sorry to say this but this is a very bad and harmful book even for people that didn't expect a scientific book. It only teaches you to deceive yourself. Its teaching is not even close to a simple basic serious meditation book. If you think that this book is good, you're deluded. This book is full of stories without any evidence or things that may happen by chance.
1440503257|4.0|I got this as a gift for a Potter fan of mine who loves to bake. It is so creative and particular about it's recipes and even the pages have it's own Potter-esqe flair to it.  The only thing I wish it had was it's own 'unofficial' version of Butterbeer!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I'm not sure why a lot of people are pissy about season 6.  It may just be the best season of them all, and was a great way to wrap up both the three-act arc started in Season 4, but the series as a whole.  The End resolves most of the characters in a very satisfying way and The New Man in Charge ties up all the loose ends anybody could really care about.  Standout main characters this season were Locke/Smoke Monster, Desmond, Ben, Richard and Jack (not necessarily in that order.)  There were great guest performances by Charlie, Eloise, Faraday, Keamy, Dogen and a bunch of others.  The only thing I kinda wish they would have dug a little deeper with was the history of Frank Lapidus and why the Island seemed to care about him so much, but whatever, y'know.  That, and I kinda wish we could have seen the other side of the outrigger chase from Season 5, but you gotta choose your battles.  Season 6 was great despite not seeing those two things, which as far as I can tell I am the only person who cares about either of them.  If you're on the fence about this season because you have been hearing people bellyache about the finale, I say don't listen to them. They suck. This was an awesome season of television.
030745455X|1.0|So the first book took awhile to get into.. but was great when I finally got there. I couldn't put that book down.<br /><br />I felt like this book was a bunch of fluff.  Things only started to get resolved in the last 20-100 pages of the book. This book could have totally been cut into half. It kind of put me off from reading the last book. But I was talking to someone who was saying that he agreed with me about this 2nd book and the 3rd one gets a lot better. I may get to reading the 3rd... hopefully its not like the 2nd.
0316067598|5.0|This is 1 book that any reader would have a hard time laying down once they got started reading it.It gives you a much different outlook as to what the people serving our country in the Armed Forces do to keep our way of life in the United States of America safe. Marcus Luttrell is truly an AMERICAN HERO and also the 3 other Navy Seals who were with him in Afghanistan but did not survive. Thank you MARCUS LUTTRELL and all the men & women who are fighting to keep our Country free.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I started listening to the Black Keys over a year ago when I first heard their music playing in a pizza place.  I saw them in concert in December and they were amazing.    So what makes them amazing?    THEY HAVE SO MUCH SOUL.     You can hear it in Dan Auerbach's voice and the way they play their instruments. And it was thrilling to see 2 people have so much stage prescense during the concert. Patrick Carney was amazing on the drums.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Every year I have one movie that just surprises me - a movie that blows away all my expectations.  2009 it was The Hurt Locker.  For 2010 that movie that defied all my pre-conceived notions was director Darren Aronofsky's glimpse into insanity known simply as Black Swan.<br /><br />If you hadn't already learned, 2010's highly acclaimed drama Black Swan is about ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman).  After four years in a prestigious New York City ballet studio (I don't remember the title of the company ever being given within the film) Nina tries desperately for the part of the Swan Queen in the year's production of Swan Lake.  The company leader, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), is a strong willed man who lets no boundaries come between him and his vision, willing to make aggressive, sexual advances solely to make a point on how he wants a performance to be done.  When Nina auditions she perfects the routine for the White Swan, but is told by Leroy that she simply is too uptight and controlled to play the White Swan's evil doppelganger, the Black Swan.  After biting the Leroy's lip when he attempts to sexually assault her Nina is given the role of the Swan Queen with Leroy claiming that the biting incident was the spark he needed to show she was capable of the role.<br /><br />Nina is a goody-two-shoes having the color pink enshrouding her entire room and living under the care of her overbearing mother (note that Nina is clearly out of her teens) who wishes for the best but also causes Nina to be incapable of truly living outside of the ballet.  Her mother wishes the best for her daughter, but it is clear she's been too controlling of her daughter's life, which in part is the cause of the Nina's tragic downward spiral.  At first glance she is a caring mother, but as the plot progresses it is clear her control reaches far too deep into Nina's life<br /><br />Nina at the same time meets with a new dancer, Lilly (Mila Kunis), who unlike Nina isn't a perfectionist, but comes across as very natural.  Lilly is also an outgoing girl, smoking in the studio, taking drugs, and filling her evenings with wild sexual exploits.  Eventually, Nina is brought in by Lilly's advances and begins a descent into darkness.  But as the plot progresses further towards its destructive climax Nina begins to believe that Lilly is not out to befriend her, but instead attempting to steal from her the role of Swan Queen which she had worked so very hard to achieve.  The film ends with the opening night of Swan Lake where everything ties together in a special effects fueled finale.<br /><br />The trailers in no way prepared me for the nightmare that is Black Swan.  Black Swan is perhaps the best psychological horror film of the last five years, if not the decade!  I knew nothing about ballet (except a few holiday visits to the Nutcracker), but this movie made sure it was all easy to follow for those uninitiated in the art.  Easily understood is the common notion of an individual seeking perfection, and that is Nina's flaw.  Perfection is what she seeks and with her good nature taking the role of the Black Swan begins to drive her mad and Natalie Portman plays the part pitch-perfect!<br /><br />I knew the buzz, knew that Aronofsky is one of the great directors currently working, yet up until I arrived at the theater I doubted that a movie centered on ballet would entertain me as a male member of the audience.  By the end of the movie I realize this could have been about anything, but the ballet allows for majestic, dark imagery mixed with classical music (alongside another great score from Clint Mansell who also did the infamous score for Requiem for a Dream with Aronofsky).  This is the first movie in years, and I do mean years, that has made me cringe in my seat.  The violence is minimum, but what it has I found far more frightening than any today's \\"torture porn\\" films (see: Saw franchise).  Aronofsky knows how to make the most out of the violence inhis film and each time it left an impact on me as a viewer.<br /><br />There will always be that stuck-up portion of the population (particularly guys) who will avoid this movie being \\"Yo, this ballet stuff is so gay!\\" and trust me, I going into the theater alone, as a young man to see a movie about a ballet dancer, I was rather uncomfortable...But once the movie started all those thoughts were left behind!  I couldn't believe it!  Aronofsky made a great movie mixing ballet with psychological horror!  There is nothing stupid or girly about this movie.  In fact, this is far more disturbing material than three fourths of the films released in the few years.<br /><br />You'll have to be into movies that tell movies through surreal imagery to really enjoy Black Swan, because the one flaw is that some of the events make no sense if you try to put it under the scrutiny of logic.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great movie, but one thing in its climax takes a great deal of suspension of disbelief (if you're like me you were too blown away by how awesome the climax is to notice this leap of logic until after you've left the theater).<br /><br />If you're into surreal movies, or psychological horror films dealing with an individuals descent into insanity than I couldn't recommend this movie enough.  If you're some \\"macho, macho man\\" or think all films have to make perfect sense than you might want to skip it.<br /><br />I personally say Black Swan easily in the top five films of 2010!t an impact on me as a viewer.

B00138J7ZC|5.0|Man, where to begin!  I've had this album for years and I think its one of the most enjoyable and creative albums that have come along in years.  I wish I could say I like all of BRMC's stuff, but this album is the only only I really LOVE.  If you like their normal harder rock stuff, this isn't for you.  This album is what I consider a back porch, down south, acoustical masterpiece!  All of these songs are worth a spin.  Its acoustic southern rock, gospel, rock, and folk all blended together.      I saw them open for the Rolling Stones years ago and really enjoyed their song \\"Mercy\\" that they played.  I didn't know the name of the song at the time but did some research and found that it was probably on the Howl album.  Sadly, it isn't (it's on the highly coveted Howl Sessions EP).  But the good news is I got to discover some great new music and hopefully you will too!  Get the Howl Sessions EP if you can find it, \\"Mercy\\" is the greatest!!!!!
0393078299|5.0|Here is a brilliant portrayal of what may be the most dramatic debate of the 20th century, with repercussions that continue today. With the creation of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, two of the best physicists of the day, Einstein and Bohr, began a lifelong debate about the nature of reality as suggested by the new physics. Kumar captures this conflict in all its human drama with all its sidemen. Although occasionally too technical for most readers, the emphasis here is more on the human conflict than the details of physics, which makes for a captivating, compelling story. I know of no book that covers this ground better. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

B002KSPKRS|2.0|So much promise, so little delivery.    While the headset is wireless,  the base station with which it communicates (i.e., the box you see the headset resting on in the product picture) needs to be connected by wires to both the Xbox and the TV.  Problem is with the connection options: they are so limited!  This is mostly Microsoft's fault.      For a digital headset, you effectively can NOT use the X41 with an HDMI connection!!!  That's right - you can NOT.  How can that be?  Let me explain.    If you use the basic Microsoft Xbox wired headset, it is typically connected to the Xbox controller, not even to the Xbox itself.  That is easy enough.    But to use the X41 headset, you must first connect the Turtle Beach base station to the Xbox. THAT is only possible via Xbox's proprietary \\"AV\\" input port.  Problem is, once you use the Xbox AV port, you can no longer use a standard HDMI cable to connect the Xbox to your HDTV.  (Even if you wanted to try it, you couldn't, because once you plug an acceptable Microsoft AV cable into the Xbox AV port, the HDMI port is physically blocked(!!) by the AV cable.)    Instead, the Microsoft Xbox AV cable you must use will send out 2 sets of wires from the Xbox AV port: one to the TV you are using (mostly for the video) and one to the Turtle Beach base station (mostly for the audio).  That means you are limited by whatever AV cable combinations Microsoft deigns to make available for you.      But does Microsoft sell an \\"AV\\" cable that allows you to link to your TV via an HDMI wire? Of course not!! The closest you come to hi-def audio and video via the Xbox AV port is a Microsoft Xbox AV cable combination (costing an extra $40, of course) that links the Xbox (1) to the Turtle Beach base station by way of a digital audio cable (also called a TOSLINK or an \\"optical audio\\" cable, for some bizarrely counterintuitive reason) and (2) to the TV by way of the clumsy, 5-wire component cables.     For some unknown reason, Microsoft refuses to make an AV cable that simply uses HDMI(!!!).    After that, none of the cable combinations offered by Microsoft for the Xbox are even close to hi-def, rendering the X41 essentially useless overkill.  (Like the proverbial lipstick on a pig.)    My son's TV does not handle component cable signals well, so this purchase was a waste for us.    To sum up: the X41 headset is only plausible if you can (and want to) link the Xbox to your HDTV via component cables.  HDMI connections are not available (yet?).
B002JL5NGE|5.0|This show is addictive! Starts off a little slow, but I ended up finishing the entire first season in 3 nights. $28 makes for much more entertainment at home than going out and spending three times as much!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This purchase was a gift that was requested by the recipient. The price for the two-disc DVD from Amazon was close to the price I would have paid for the single-disc version locally so this purchase was a no-brainer. I received the order very quickly.
0765350386|4.0|The first of the Mistborn books manages to reinvent classic fantasy with some new twists and concepts.  The \\"magic\\" system is novel and interesting, and the world-building is thoughtful and thorough.  The book (and those following) flirt with some of the stereotypes of the genre, but never quite become trite, showing, at times, a playful awareness of what the reader anticipates in epic fantasy.  I appreciate particularly the authors ability to tie together loose ends and provide excellent twists and turns in the plot.  On the downside, at times I skimmed extraneous and preachy sections in which the characters spell out their emotional development.  Of the three books, I liked the first best, and the second least.  The third also gets particularly preachy.
0440244870|5.0|I really liked this book.  Sophie is madcap and a lot of fun; she made me laugh all though the book.  And I truly appreciated that because I was reading this at a time when I definitely needed a little levity!!

B0015DROBO|3.0|Ok, I don't know if most of the people who have rated this book have actually read GOOD books or what!  This book is OK, but nothing more, nothing less.  For one it's NOT a page turner.  I wasn't on edge of my seat either.  I will admit that the mystery portion is good and that held my attention, but for the most part, this book is a 3 out of 5 at best!  Secondly, why were there 600 pages????  WHYYYY?????  This should have been a 300 page novel at max!  There was so much useless information that I think Larsson was just writing to take up room!  There are A LOT more books out there that are better then this.  I don't see the hype.  Not a bad read, but do NOT purchase!  RENT from library!  I reluctantly move on to part two so that I can at least finish the series.

0525951652|5.0|I read this book and as I read especially the parts of the book that related to Wales was a cameo of my own upbringing. The demise of a feudal society, the politics, the effects of war - my own Grandfather fought at the Somme as a machine gunner ( aged 16).     The politics of the time was the highlight. Its historical fact showed considerable research and an understanding of the society of the times -its context is deserving of a history class as well as a piece of literary fiction.     For those who complained about the price - it was in my opinion a bargain.

1439153663|5.0|I scour these reviews looking for reviewers to mention a book \\"that they just can't put down.\\"  I found this to be an engrossing read and I read it in two days. However, I can't for the life of me figure out why the author had to put such a devastating event in the end. I will not mention what happened but suffice it to say, it added absolutely nothing to the value of the story but to leave the reader crushed to the bone. It chronicles the strength of the human spirit under the most dire circumstances, but, after crying through all the trials,  isn't the reader due just a bit of real happiness at the end?

It was astute of EMI to lure old hands who already own multiple versions of the nine symphonies with the fine but lesser known cycle under Vernon Handley. The alternative was the much reissued one under sir Adrian Boult, the composer's friend, sometime dedicatee, and quintessential interpreter.  As authoritative as Boult is, Handley runs close behind.  Even better would have been for EMI to pick and choose among their stable of RVW conductors, including Barbirolli and Haitink, to select the best version of each work.<br /><br />The singers chosen for the song cycles and choral songs are close to ideal, and for me it's gratifying that older tenors (Tear, Rolfe Johnson, Partridge) were chosen over Ian Bostridge, despite his fame and enthusiastic fan base. It was a serious misstep, however, to skip over the version of Dona Nobis Pacem, perhaps the most profound of RVW's choral works, sung by Bryn Terfel and Yvonne Kinney under Hickox. Sancta Civitas from the same forces would also have been preferable.<br /><br />I am not a fan of RVW's operas, and neither are record companies, so these performances are the cream of the crop, on the whole.  Riders to the Sea is almost a literal transcription of Synge's play and holds my interest.

It was astute of EMI to lure old hands who already own multiple versions of the nine symphonies with the fine but lesser known cycle under Vernon Handley. The alternative was the much reissued one under sir Adrian Boult, the composer's friend, sometime dedicatee, and quintessential interpreter.  As authoritative as Boult is, Handley runs close behind.  Even better would have been for EMI to pick and choose among their stable of RVW conductors, including Barbirolli and Haitink, to select the best version of each work.<br /><br />The singers chosen for the song cycles and choral songs are close to ideal, and for me it's gratifying that older tenors (Tear, Rolfe Johnson, Partridge) were chosen over Ian Bostridge, despite his fame and enthusiastic fan base. It was a serious misstep, however, to skip over the version of Dona Nobis Pacem, perhaps the most profound of RVW's choral works, sung by Bryn Terfel and Yvonne Kinney under Hickox. Sancta Civitas from the same forces would also have been preferable.<br /><br />I am not a fan of RVW's operas, and neither are record companies, so these performances are the cream of the crop, on the whole.  Riders to the Sea is almost a literal transcription of Synge's play and holds my interest. So does Pilgrim's Progress, but less so in the complete opera format; there's a radio broadcast featuring the best music and a gripping narration of Bunyan's text that works better -- seek out either the BBC wartime broadcast or a reproduction in modern sound narrated by John Gielgud.<br /><br />Least known among the major orchestral works is probably the various concertos for oboe, tuba, piano, and piano duet.

B003D0ZNXS|3.0|EMI's \\"Icon\\" series sometimes unearths some fairly rare or out-of-print recordings, while most of the time it is an exercise in repackaging, admittedly at a very good price.  Unless you are a Gilels completist, however, I'd steer clear of this 9-CD box set. A good deal of room is taken by two complete Beethoven concerto cycles, the first in mixed mono and stereo with Andre Vandernoot and Leopold Ludwig (both routine), the second in stereo with Szell and the Clevelanders. both are unimaginative accounts, despite the pianist's undoubted power and authority, and the later cycle is particularly unfortunate in that Szell was in physical decline. I detected almost no change in Gilels' interpretations in the span between 1954 and 1970. Gilels also recorded the sets of solo Beethoven theme and variations in 1970, and these two are authoritative but heavy-handed. He overwhelms the Saint-Saens Cto. #2 in an impressive way but has not much to say in the Rachmaninov third.<br /><br />And so it goes. I once thought that this pianist was fiery and interesting in his younger years but grew dull and conventional in maturity, and in general I still hold to that. by the time he died in 1985, a few days before turning 69, he was a revered artist, so my lack of enthusiasm is a minority report.  Even so, I think DG got the best of late Gilels, not EMI. The best of all comes from reprint labels that issue his Russian recordings and live concerts, where he was at is best. In this box set I enjoyed some items: a sober but absorbing Mozart Sonata in B-flat K. 570, and a resounding Tchaikovsky Piano Cto. #2 in its old abridged form (which some may still prefer in this long-winded work). It and the infinitely more popular Tchaikovsky first are vigorously conducted by Lorin Maazel with the New Philharmonia Orch., but EMI has done nothing to improve their coarse recorded sound. the same goes for the unfinished and negligible Cto. #3.<br /><br />the best that could have been gleaned from the vaults would have filled only four or five CDs, but they would have served Gilels the artist better than this motley overstuffed collection.

B000AMJC2K|2.0|If you need to put your monitor in one position and leave it there then this works great.  If you only need push it back and pull it forward, then it will probably work ok.  If you need to frequently raise, lower, tilt, or rotate your monitor, then look elsewhere.  Raising and lowering is awkward, but workable.  Tilting and rotating requires you to get out the allen wrench and loosen/tighten the joints every time.  This is difficult to do by yourself and works a lot better if someone else can hold the monitor while you loosen/tighten the joints.

0887307280|3.0|the core principals of this book are solid -- that we americans need to again find our entrepreneur spirit, not in just working for ourselves, but in carving out a piece of the world that is ideological, logical and yet humane. the key is not making your business just your new day job that youre tethered to perhaps even more than your last day job, but one which is well-defined and organized such that you can insert other workers into the workhorse roles that you will naturally try to fill by yourself.    great ideas. and his suggestions for mapping this out are good ones.    but there are weak parts -- his writing style, some mumbo-jumbo, and \\"get rich quick\\" scam factor.    1) writing style -- this book deserves a major re-edit. it makes use of a dated, corny, phony dialogue between the author and a client. \\"Oh, dear Sarah, dear, dear, fair Sarah...Do you see it? Do you see your happy spirit horse? I see it, Sarah, and you can, too.\\" BARF! seriously. what is this junk? was she his lover or just a bad idea from his editor? just stick to the business ideas.    2) mumbo jumbo -- he writes quite a bit about a \\"game\\" management must create for its workers, but i really have no idea what hes talking about. either explain it or scrap it. he also refers to sales scripts and other concepts as if they are patented E-Myth inventions w/ fancy names...mumbo jumbo.    3) get rich scam -- the author borders on snake-oil salesman. much as he advises in the book, this book itself is an emotional \\"hook\\" that is designed to get you to contact E-Myth Enterprises and schedule some financial/business planning training sessions. book is littered with ads to visit his website. same schtick that the \\"4 Hour Work Week\\" guy does, not surprisingly since that book is a new version of this content inspired by emyth.    ...so, if you can ignore the advertising ploys and the sappy, terrible writing style, and stick to the biz concepts, its good.

B003HARV4S|4.0|I got this movie on sale, for only $7.99 shipped with prime. It arrived to an APO address overseas in a most incredible amount of time. Everything must have just worked. When I first found out the dvd was for sale I confused this movie with The Prestige. After watching it, I enjoyed it quite a bit, and even if my wife and I never watch it again, it was worth the price. The addition of the dvd along with the bluray was something I did not know when originally purchasing this item.<br /><br />There is only one small detail I wish would be changed, and that would be adding special features to the bluray itself. As it is, there is just the feature presentation on the bluray, and the standard def version and extras on the dvd. With the amount of storage space and compression algorithms available in blurays, simply adding a few features wouldn't kill it, and would make this a 5 star.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend at any price below $12 or so.
1400063515|3.0|This book is a thinking piece, and as a result tends to wander about, but the  thesis is pretty powerful.  It's the notion that most things in the world and in world history are a result of Black Swans, which is a cute term for unforeseeable outcomes with unpredictable and seemingly unbound impacts.  In the military, these were called unknown unknowns, which are generally impossible to prepare for or understand the outcome of.  Taleb has gained some fame in that he's seemingly foreseen some of the major Black Swans that have affected our modern world.  Namely, his previous book, Fooled by Randomness predicted that a plane hitting his office building would be a random event that he could not prepare for and which would create outsized impacts.  That was just before 9/11.  This book was published shortly before the worldwide financial/banking collapse and in it he notes in a footnote that there are significant interrelationships in the banking world where the failure of one or two players could create a massive economic impact.  And so it was.  That said, Taleb, to his credit, admits that both of those scenarios were not Black Swans since he was able to reasonably foresee them as possibilities.   The author is a man of science who cites many interesting scientific studies, which if read with an open mind, will change how you view yourself and the world.  It's like the case studies in the tipping point or in Freakonomics, but not as dumbed down.    The book doesn't get a higher rating because it has too many notes.  100 pages probably could have covered it.  And, the author has a little too much of himself in the book.  And he's not a very likable guy.  So he goes off on seemingly irrelevant tangents in an attempt to prove how smart is and how dumb his enemies are.  Those sections, interspersed throughout, are unnecessary and distracting.

0756655730|5.0|I initially purchased this book for a friend, but was so floored by the book's beauty and information content that I just had to purchase a copy for myself.  For me, the value of this book is substantially in its visuals, which are in many cases truly stunning (in this regard, the book puts typical historical geology texts to shame).  I really appreciate the chronological coverage of organisms, and feel that the relatively broad coverage of fossil types (including invertebrates, plants, and microfossils) really helps to convey the richness of the fossil record and of past Earth ecosystems.  The book has all sorts of nice touches, such as the provision of visual scale information (i.e., the profiles of individual organisms are sized relative to the outlines of familiar objects such as a standing human or a human hand).  I have absolutely no reservations in recommending this book to anyone interested in the history of life on this planet, and am not at all surprised at the high ratings that other readers have given this book.

0142410373|4.0|Roald Dahl is somewhat of a literary evil mastermind. He has the uncanny ability to create the most twisted, repulsive adults every imagined in the world of children's stories. Matilda is the story of a young genius born to a family of ignorant twits. She goes to a school with the horribly cruel headmaster, Miss Trunchbull, who locks children in a closet of nails if they misbehave. The only kind adult in Matilda's life is her teacher, Miss Jenny Honey, who turns out to be Miss Trunchbull's niece. This friendship leads to numerous adventures as Matilda discovers certain special abilities she has, beyond her highly-developed brain. Miss Trunchbull is one of my favorite characters of all time. She's a vicious body-builder whose greatest pleasure in life is torturing children. This book is funny but dark, and like all of Dahl's tales, it is incredibly entertaining. For Roald Dahl lovers, I can also recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox and George's Marvelous Medicine for some more delightful reading.

0312600844|5.0|I may have written a review when I first read \\"Freedom\\" (pretty soon after it came out), and I'm not sure if I gave it 5 stars.  However, if Amazon members can give books like \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" and \\"The Help\\" 5 stars, than this book should merit at least 5 stars.  The average rating for \\"Freedom\\" is now 3 stars.    Yes, the book does have some \\"issues.\\"  The plot gets a little unwieldy and perhaps its themes are overly ambitious.  So it's not a perfect boook.  But it's definitely not the junk that some readers seem to confuse with literature.  \\"Freedom\\" is literature.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|There are so many screen adaptations of Jane Eyre out there, but this is by far the sexiest! Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson have the best chemistry and you really believe the attraction between them. Unlike other versions, you totally understand why Jane falls for Rochester. Stephens is brooding but not standoffish, harsh but passionate, and successfully gives him a deep heart and soul.<br /><br />The movie does not linger too much on Jane's early years but moves straight to the romance and mystery. Like all movies, there are a few changes from the book, one of them being a segment where Rochester tries to seduce Jane into staying after the big reveal, but that is one of the reasons it makes my most sexy title!<br /><br />My favorite version of my favorite book! Masterpiece Theatre has truly made a masterpiece!

You don't have to be a gamer, comic book nerd, hipster, or child of the 1980s to love this film, but if you are any of those things, you'll get a kick out of the loving ribbing Edgar Wright and the cast give them. An absurd concept that, through skillful story telling and fine performances, somehow manages to work, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is at least a must-see, if not a must own. Just... just trust me on this. Buy it. You'll be glad you did.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|\\"Pandorum\\" (2009) is a German/American science fiction horror film directed by Christian Alvart (Curiosity and the Cat, Antibodies). Ben Foster (Corporal Bower), who wakes up from suspended animation finds himself alone and with no memory inside a passenger spaceship called Elysium. He proceeds to wake up Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) who is also suffering from amnesia. The film starts off very slowly, presenting a dark, claustrophobic world, which seems rather predictable at first, but as the film develops it continues to gather momentum. Light gradually enters the film in the way of flashbacks and with a variety of charismatic and likeable characters. Manh (Cung Le) is a Vietnamese warrior like character, and the beautiful Nadia (Antje Traue) is likewise an able survivalist with great athletic abilities. It becomes apparent as the film develops that a fair amount of money and thought was put into the sets and special effects, and that this isn't going to be a dull, ultra low budget film after all.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|People keep comparing Vampire Diaries to twilight but there is no comparison. Vampire diaries was a book series written by L J Smith in 1991 8 years before Stephanie Myer wrote Twilight. I mention these for a few reasons. I loved the first episode so much that i ran next day to get the books. They are wonderfully written the characters so alive. Elana was blond in the book but i think the reason they allowed the brown hair was publicity because it would look like a twilight knockoff, and thus would draw attention for more viewers. Reading the books i was at first disappointed the storyline of the book and the show are almost nothing alike, a few things are but what amazed me after i realized the tv show their actors bring L J Smith's characters to life. Its like the characters were taken out of the book and put into another story, i can't read the books without seeing Paul or Ian's face talking, their actions. The actors in Vampire Diaries, I would have chosen no other, they are amazing at what they've done. To portray themselves so they meld with the story, there's nothing greater an actor can achieve. The storyline that the directors came up with has so many twists and turns you're always begging for more. If you start be prepared for a marathon. The one thing about having the series in your hands is that you don't have to wait a week, and you're not going to want to.

B001FB4W0W|3.0|I was very surprised at this series. People have recommended it to me over and over, even my own sister who has HBO told me i should buy it and watch it. What I wish i had know was the mature content in this series. First episode about 5-10 min was a sex scene and I was like Oo what in the hell did i just get myself into. Overall the acting was good, the storyline was good. Despite unexpected the guys were nice to look at I'll admit xD but i sold the series to Hasting the day after I finished watching the series. I'm glad i got it for only the $12 on black friday i wouldn't have paid the full price and be happy with it, I want to see the second series just to see it, but I don't want to buy it. There are 12 episodes in this first season, be warned about every episode has at least a naked person in it, if not a sex scene. Otherwise if that doesn't bother you, you're left wondering who was doing the murders until those few episodes, it drags in. I watched all the episodes back to back I couldn't stop, but once I finished it left me wondering about the next season, but unlike Vampire Diaries I can wait, I'm not in omg omg i gotta see it phase xD.

B001AQO400|4.0|I had to watch this film a few times to understand it but for most people this is a slow film but for me, its watching one of my favorite actors at his best.  I do mean Bill Murray, who is at a role that was made for him.  I wish he won the oscar that year but he lost to Sean Penn for Mystic River.  Either way this is a film about the understanding of one culture to another.  With shots done well of the Japanese structures and landscapes, it made this film so serene that I felt at peace when I was watching Scarlett Johannson skipping on the stones in a lake.  It was not only that, it is about Bob Harris a man in a midlife crisis who befriends a girl who was just as lost as he is in a country unknown to them.     Just so you would know there were other actors who won so many awards for a single role like Bill Murray that the only thing they did not win is the Oscar.  There were actors that were viewed to come so close to winning an Oscar it surprised the critics who thought they would win.      I am not sure how far it goes this is the earliest I can think of:    Bob Hoskins for Best Actor in Mona Lisa (1986)losing to Paul Newman of The Color of Money (1986)    Clive Owen for Best Supporting Actor in Closer (2004) losing to Morgan Freeman of Million Dollar Baby (2004)    Eddie Murphy for Best Supporting Actor in Dreamgirls (2006) losing to Alan Arkin of Little Miss Sunshine (2006)     Mickey Rourke for Best Actor in The Wrestler (2008) losing to Sean Penn of Milk (2008)
B000ICM0YY|5.0|Having sat on stage at the end of the keyboard in downtown Chicago's Orchestra hall for Maestro Gilel's performance of Liszt's b minor and also having performed 8 of the Beethoven piano sonatas myself I can only say one thing about his recordings of the near complete Beethoven cycle. Simply splendid musicality coupled with supreme technical control. Along with his colleague and rival Sviatoslav Richter this musical masterpiece rates right along side of Richter's readings. This is a must have. One can listen to Gilels for 1 hr. after another and never cease to awe at his interpretations of Beethoven's sonatas. Every time one listens he or she becomes that much more well educated in listening to what I personally would define as one thing: BEETHOVEN'S VOICE! And yes my friends that is excitement at its GREATEST! The 'Appassionata\\" and \\"Hammerklavier\\" are beyond human perfection!

B003E6K1VK|5.0|Fiio's E7 is a portable amp/digital-analog converter (DAC). What that means is that the E7 can be used as both as a portable headphone amplifier, and to replace your computer's sound card when connected via the USB cable for better audio quality. The E7 offers solid construction and great value at its price point, which makes it a must-buy over comparable products at this price range.      The E7 comes in a very compact box, when opened, the box includes the E7 itself (looking akin to a tiny solid block) and a bunch of accessories. Note that when first opened, the E7 did not come charged; it must be recharged using the provided USB cable for a couple minutes. Once the wait is over though, the little portable DAC/amp does wonders.     Using the provided USB cable with the E7 allows it to be used as a DAC/amp in lieu of your computer's sound card. Previously, I was using the stock sound card in my MacBook Pro as the DAC, and the E7 completely elevated the sound quality to another level. Immediately, I could hear details across the board with my Sennheiser HD 555. I heard entire instrument lines that I've never heard before. The E7 even comes with a built in headphone splitter, which is great to use to share my music with others. The construction is solid, although prone to scratching. I've dropped my E7 carelessly many times, yet it remains functioning perfectly except that the surface is laden with many scratches. For easy to drive headphones like the Sennheiser HD 555, the built in amplifier is plenty and will power the headphones to perfect listening levels at 10/60.     When using the E7 as a portable amp, use the provided line in-out cable in order to connect your MP3 player/DAP with the device. The sound quality leap was not as pronounced as I was just using the amp portion of the DAC/Amp; and that's probably the only criticism of the E7 for me. Still though, a marginal change in audio quality can be observed with my Portapros; manifesting in the form of greaterwarmth and slightly better bass/highs clarity. The bass boost came in handy outside, where I was a far more casual than analytical listener.     To conclude, the E7 is a great DAC; it is built with solid material and has future upgrading potential with the E9. However, the E7 is by no means perfect. Just buying the E7 to use as an amp is perhaps not a great idea, as I later found out when trying to drive Sennheiser HD 600s with the E7. Still, the E7's advantage lies with its price point and versatility, and I would definitely buy the product again given a chance. Users with a great DAC and/or sound card would obviously want to reconsider though; and those with higher end audiophile headphones (like the HD600/DT880/etc.) can buy the E7 if ampless but note that the E7 alone, without the E9, cannot drive those phones to their full potential.
B0025KVLTM|2.0|So I bought the mono box set and heard this album for the first time in its entirety.  I was prepared to be disappointed and was still disappointed.  With this box set I've gained a new respect for the early albums while later work is hit or miss and this album misses for the most part.  Little help from my friends is a good song that Joe Cocker made fairly great.  LSD is a great song don't get me wrong but the only other one I like is a Day in the Life so I can't give this more than 2 stars despite all the hoopla.  I've listened to Rubber Soul for the first time also and it is really a great album though I still think Revolver is better, Revolver being a stunning work in my opinion.  Magical Mystery Tour is actually (much) better than Sgt Peppers but it came out after so doesn't get groundbreaking credit... or something.  I just find the Sgt Pepper songs lacking, self-indulgent with little redeeming value.
B003L77TZI|3.0|The CD is OK. There are a few good songs, but some of them I did not like and thought were a bit annoying. The hits songs that are released as singles are great, but the others are just OK.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas.  She was super excited to get it!  However, it just will not walk! We have slick hardwood floors and this thing just sits and grinds, moving its legs but refuses to walk.  It is even worse on carpetting.    The toy looks awesome. It could have alot of potential to be a big hit if the manufacturer would redesign its little wheels on the bottom of the spider to get better traction.    Its a little loud too.  The griding motor sound ruins any \\"sneak attacks\\" or tricks you want to play on people... but the dog doesnt seem to mind!  It drove our dogs nuts.... they wanted to attack it and DID!
B002ZG981E|4.0|Great deal and couldn't pass up. But any true extras are blu-ray only, and that cool \\"digital-copy\\" is NOT HD either...bummer.
1932100660|5.0|This is a fascinating read with truth jumping off the page as to what needs to change within ourselves to be more healthy and what needs to change in the industry to stop the confusion.      I plan to buy more copies and give to my friends and relatives.
0802473156|5.0|I am enjoying the book and it has helped me understand a few things about my relationship.  Although, there is no alternative to the Bible this infuses some the same principles.
B00335EQ0E|3.0|I was going with a bit of an Alice in Wonderland theme for my wife for Christmas, so of course I had to get this movie.<br /><br />We haven't watched the special features, but my daughter was captivated by the show itself.
B00001W9G0|5.0|A worthwhile movie to own for any of those times when you want to enjoy a movie with a romantic gene from the past. It is enhanced by the chemistry between Barbara Steisand and Robert Redford in a more modern romance story way with her being an independent woman. I think it's a movie women of all ages will enjoy and it should be considered a classic.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|To put it simply, this book is incredible. Easily one of the best I've ever read. I finished it in about two days, it's that absorbing. If you like dark, believable stories with some lovable characters, and some downright hatable ones, then Room is definitely the book for you.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Rarely ever does Christopher Nolan not direct a masterpiece and Inception is no exception. Definitely cannot be disappointed with this movie. Every time you watch it you catch something you didn't catch previously. It's a nice change of pace to have a movie that will actually interact with your thoughts instead of you being a mindless zombie lol. They spared no expense on the animation or scenery either. The actors were a-list and perfect for their persona's. This movie was easily my Top 5. Hope this helps in your decision. If you're more curious about ratings go to [...] or [...] and search Inception to get more reviews.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|What a deal! All the movies on DVD!<br />It's really taking awhile to watch them all but they are great quality! This was a wonderful gift for my boyfriend. I haven't seen them all and now we can watch them all in order!<br />Such a good price too!
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is not just another teen novel. It is definitely not like twilight with unrealistic vampire and werewolf love stories. It has a suspenseful storyline from a post-apocalyptic style United States. I would recommend this novel to anyone, young or old.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I've been looking for a decent pair of headphones for some time now. All I can say is that these were a fantastic acquisition.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sound quality is top notch. I always test headphones out against high fidelity french horn recordings and these did a fantastic job. While it is hard to match a full range speaker, these headphones do a swell job with only the faintest of distortion on the most resonant selections in my library. The highs are crystal clear and the bass are plenty punch and wonderful low level response. I can go from Lady Gaga to Aerosmith to Trace Akins to John Williams without thinking twice. These headphones sound great no matter your taste. The only question is if you like the sound of 1/2 open back headphones as opposed to noise isolation.Personally I like being able to hear things going on around me when I want to without having to have my music almost completely off. That said, these speakers can certainly put out plenty of volume where outside noise is not an issue.<br /><br />-They are incredibly light weight. This seems to a function of them being 1/2 open back. It is also a function of the head pad's design. You really don't feel them on you head at all. They are also self adjusting.<br /><br />-The Removable cable is wonderful feature. The clip design seems more reliable than sure and less likely to break the headphones should something yank it out.Additionally, the cable is a miniXLR to 1/8\\" standard headphone with a screw on adapter to 1/4\\". The screw treads on the cord can get in the way some headphone jacks on some ipod cases. However these headphones are more likely to be paired with a computer or mixing set up so this is generally not a problem. Depending on how you plan on using the headphones you will either love or hate the 10 foot cable. There is an optional curly 16 foot cable that is about 3-4 feet long when not stretched out.<br /><br />Cons: Non of the below are serious concerns just possible items to be aware of for personal preference<br />-Depending on your preference the cord length<br />-Depending on you use the threads for the 1/4\\" adapter<br />-They can get a little warm, but they are completely over the ear headphones so that is kind of expected. However that could just me. Non the less it is not enough to bother me or keep me from listening to them for hours and hours.<br />-No the easiest to transport, but then again if you are looking at them you probably don't plan on doing it that much with them.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />I would have gotten the AKG K272HD but they were not in stock where I got these. If you are stuck between these and any other AKG headphones, these will certainly not disappoint. At their price point, they can't be beat. Bose have nothing on them and Sure was just too in your face sounding. They also have a wonderful warranty.<br /><br />As of this writing, Amazon has them for $100, I paid more at a local audio shop.ing on your preference the cord length  -Depending on you use the threads for the 1/4\\" adapter  -They can get a little warm, but they are completely over the ear headphones so that is kind of expected.

B003ZHR6SY|5.0|Simplemente una Obra Maestra del cine de nuestro tiempo. Es apta para ni&ntilde;os y para adultos. El &uacute;nico inconveniente que le veo a la politica de Disney es que ahora saca al mercado las peliculas en ingl&eacute;s in el audio en Espa&ntilde;ol, como hac&iacute;a antes. Ahora quiere sacar m&aacute;s dinero de los consumidores. Muy triste. Porque los nativos que hablan ingl&eacute;s podr&iacute;an beneficiarse de un \\"track\\" en Espa&ntilde;ol.
B002ZG981E|3.0|Babble - nonsensical dialog - whatever you call it' this movie has more than you'll find elsewhere.  Little makes sense - dream in a dream in a dream? Sounds like an idea derived after a weekend of recreational drug use. \\"Dude - I had a dream I was dreaming!\\" \\"Cool - let's make a movie.\\"<br /><br />Basically this was an excuse to show off special effects. The idea of being trapped in a dream - and not knowing it - is old hat. Nothing to see here. Move along. So what we have is an unoriginal plot (dream in dream) using another idea stolen from the movie \\"Dreamscape\\" (enter a dream to gather information or change the dreamer's real-life actions) with a bunch of B-list actors.<br /><br />Just because the end is intentionally hazy does not make this a \\"great\\" movie or a \\"mind bender\\" - it makes this a poorly executed rip-off from several other movies.
B004FDY4LE|5.0|THIS SHOW IS JUST AWESOME. NOT A ZOMBIE FAN, BUT THIS SHOW IS CHANGING THAT. GREAT ACTING, GREAT STORY LINE!!!!!
0385341008|5.0|What a pleasure this little gem of a book was!  Admitedly, I was taken aback when I realized that this story was written as a series of letters between the characters of the story.  Still, while this format differs from the one used in books I usually read, I decided to give it a go, and am I glad I did.  The authors did a wonderful job pulling it off, and making this story not only interesting, educational, sad, and funny (among many other things), but they made it work, and that's what counts.  I was truly transported back to post-WWII times, and had a good feel for how difficult these times must have been for all under the boot of the Nazi regime.<br />The ratings for this book do not lie, and there is little more to add.  It was a great story, written in a very clever and beautiful way, and I was very pleasantly surprised, as well as thoroughly entertained.  I certainly recommend this book! Enjoy!
0380799006|5.0|LEt me start by saying I am not a \\"textbook\\" parent. A friend recommended this to read and I cannot say enough about it. I read it in a single night. Tons of instantly helpful things you can instantly apply BUT not an overwhelming amount of information. I consider this my parenting \\"bible\\"!
0671027344|5.0|I never review books but I had to review this one. It's simply amazing, worth the buy. So well written and raw, I couldn't put it down and have read it several times since first reading it. I read it has a high school freshman and read it again now, my sophomore year, and will probably take many more stabs at it. Great book, even for adults.
B000P0J0G0|5.0|Okay, picture this.  J and I are on an airplane somewhere above the icy Atlantic heading toward London.  Ear buds in our ears, joined together by a splitter on our DVD player, laughing our heads off.  The people around us, not hearing the reason for our gaiety, must have thought we were lunatics.  We didn't care -- time was flying by and we were having too much fun watching the first two seasons of Fry and Laurie.  We were in London before we knew it.
0312600844|2.0|This book is painful to read. It's so bad that I read only one-third of it since I felt it wasn't worth my time. It's only popular because Oprah recommends it. She tends to pick books with people who have major emotional problems, and this book is no exception.
1439102813|5.0|Dr. Alice Howland, age 50, is psycholinguistics professor at Harvard University. She has a rigorous schedule of courses to teach, graduate and undergraduate students to supervise, conferences to attend, social gatherings with her colleagues, and a daily jog. She notices a decline in her memory and cognitive functioning and ultimately receives a diagnosis of Probable Alzheimer's Disease, confirmed by genetic testing that revealed a PS1 mutation. We, the readers, experience Alice's symptoms as she does, month-by-month. Because we meet Alice in the early stages of AD, she is able to share all of her fond memories and the significance of people and objects in her life. Thus, with all of this knowledge attached to people and things in Alice's life, we also feel a sense of loss as her memories of those people and objects dissipate.<br /><br />I would compare Still Alice with other great works on mental illness, such as Kay Redfield-Jamison's An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness; Sylvia Nasar's A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash, and Mark Hagdon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|For me, this movie lacked. The scenes for me really didn't add up. One minute Bella is mad at Edward for messing with her truck, the next, they're in school going to lunch. For me, a lot of the movie was just like that, skipping from one scene to the next. If I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't have understood the movie as a regular movie goer. There are only a few scenes that stuck with me:<br />1)The marriage proposal<br />2)The training fight scene(which should have been much longer!)<br />3)Charlie and Bella sex-talk<br />4)The ending fight scene<br />5)Certain parts of the tent scene.<br />Certain scenes were ok, like the Quileute background story and Jasper's background story. Rosalie's not so much.<br />Everything else was mediocre. I really would have liked it if they added the part where Edward followed Bella all the way to Angela's house as soon as she crossed the Quileute border. That was one of the scenes I was looking for and it never happened.<br />This movie seemed a little bit sappy with all the kissing. It was even too much for me, and I'm a female.<br /><br />So. Eclipse. Just ok.<br /><br />I'm patiently waiting to see how the hell they're going to make some life of what is Breaking Dawn.
B002ZG9774|5.0|[[ASIN:B002ZG9774 Burlesque [Blu-ray]]]    My daughter talked me into going to see Burlesque. I'm not a Cher fan, but I do enjoy Christina Aguilera's music.

044656740X|3.0|Here is an exact review of what this book is and isnt.    1) If you are plugged into The Matrix as a human battery (8-5 jobs + rat in the maze), this book serve as the red pill that will wake you up.    2) If you are already awake outside of The Matrix like Neo, this book will offer nothing on how to defeat Mr Smith.    So if you are in group 1 still asleep and clueless (most young people / college grads who are just starting out etc..) This is an excellent book that makes you look up and see the forest.    If you are in group 2 already awake, but actively trying to find a way to defeat Mr Smith (or build wealth), this book will offer you nothing, it has no actual step by step nor methods.     So in the end it really depends on where you are in life, it's a book I wish i read while in college but isnt very useful to me now.    PS If you havent seen the Matrix yet, go watch that first! ;)
B002ZG98J6|3.0|I watched this movie last night all the way through even though my wife walked out after the first ten minutes. The sound and picture are very good on Blu-ray but the rest of the movie is not all that captivating for the older audience. I happen to be older but stuck with it to the end; I suppose I was curious how it would play out.<br /><br />The special effects are very well done and visually convincing; the surround sound is also effective and has some powerful moments, especially if the volume is cranked up higher.<br /><br />If you have younger viewers there may be a place for this one in your collection otherwise watch it before you buy it. It's not really bad for its target audience but that is the question; does your collection need something else for that demographic?
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was at first skeptical of the efficacy of this CPU cooler due to it's price and somewhat pedestrian design. Wow, was I proved wrong. This thing cools better than many $60 offerings from other companies, especially when another Blademaster fan is used for push / pull. I have done many a build and this is absolutely one of my go to products, as it's cooling capabilities allow for solid overclocking at cool temps. The only con that comes to mind is the included thermal paste (mehh). This is made up for by the inclusion of a second set of fan brackets, screws, and rubber pads to mount the additional fan, if you so choose. Overall, the performance of this unit is wonderful and every review, both by professionals and consumers, speaks glowingly of the product. I found this to be a solidly designed CPU cooler with fantastic functionality at an equally impressive price. Great Buy!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Sometimes less is more.  I already own, use, and love the larger SB-600, but there are times when a smaller, lower profile flash is just right. The form factor is entirely different than the SB-600 (and the rest of the more powerful Nikon speedlight line) so it slips into my smallest pocket or camera bag.  It's just right for normal sized residential rooms with white ceilings, and you can bounce up very easily by flipping the head.  While it's true that the unit does not allow for easy side bounce, you could accomplish that off-camera with a sync cable if you wish. Actually, the sync cable is a great idea because it allows for more creative options than on-the-camera flash. Bottom line: different tools for different jobs.  I'll still use my SB-600 for larger venues, event photography, and when I want wireless off-camera. Understand the specs of what you are buying, do you homework, and you will not be disappointed.  It bothers me a little when people post negative reviews about specs/limitations that were clearly spelled out before the purchase decision was made.

Not everyone will like that aspect of it, but I really did.  It is a wonderful, well written story.  If you like Nicholas Sparks, you will like this book especially if you are a dog lover.  They are making it into a movie, and I can't wait to see it.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|The watch keeps stopping.  I gave it as present two weeks ago and it has had to be reset numerous times daily.  Why is this happening?  Could it be battery related and if so, why would you not send it out with a brand new battery considering the price and service?  I would appreciate a response to vkonestabo@hotmail.com please.    Thank you in advance for your promptness.
014241543X|4.0|I loved this book!  I found it very beautiful and powerful.  It stuck with me for days after reading it.  I starting to think about a few things after reading it which I love about books.  I think it was written for teens/young adults but I am in my late 20s and I still enjoyed it so don't let anything like that deter you.  It may be about a girl in high school, but an adult can still enjoy it because the situation can happen to anyone.  The sequel to the book comes out in a few months and I can't wait to read it but don't read any synopsis for it because then it will give away the ending of this book.

B0044CBMXE|2.0|Season 6 opener, \\"The Mastodon in the Room,\\" barely references the influence of the group's separation in Season 5.  For instance, Bones left Washington explicitly because of the Gravedigger case, and the fact that investigating murders was weighing heavy on her conscious, and everyone else in the cast followed suit.  Additionally, she was going to make Anthropological History be discovering/proving the missing link in Human Evolution.  What has suddenly changed her mind?  Booth went to war in the Middle East as a \\"trainer\\" specifically so he would not get killed and fail to raise his son Parker, yet in the opener he is clearly leading a very, very dangerous mission - what gives?  Why make him out a liar?  Seriously, when Booth gets back to Washington he tells Parker over breakfast that he would never leave him, but the previous story-line directly contradicts this assertion.  Angela is now pregnant but Hodges is initially in the dark, um, he's supposed to be a brilliant Scientist, yet he conveniently \\"forgets\\" that lack of contraception during sex is bound to lead to a pregnancy?  Dr. Saroyan, constantly acclaimed as a \\"brilliant\\" Forensic Pathologist by Caroline Julian in \\"The Mastodon in the Room,\\" can't even establish the racial identity of the male child cadaver in her care; and, frankly, she comes across as being incompetent both as a Forensic Scientist and as the Chief Administrator of an extremely powerful and Federal Government Bureaucracy.  Daisy in an underwear scene, how can anyone take her character seriously?  Sweets at the piano bar, ditto?  Why not pursue the rationale that ended Season 5 in a more powerful way?  When Bones looks back through the taxi cab window at Booth in that last episode of Season 5, I believed she was fed up with death, and I firmly agreed with her emotional logic.  Was I wrong?
B0037KMHRY|4.0|I was lucky enough to see TRON:LEGACY at the IMAX.  The soundtrack was incredible over all those speakers and I immediately rushed out and bought it.  This soundtrack does not disappoint.  I think I have listened to it 50 times in a week.  I do a lot of computer work and it is perfect background music.  I really look forward to more Daft Punk in the future.
B003OWVHVC|5.0|Most R&B and modern rap performers no longer keep true to the legends like Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, or Aretha Franklin and fill their lyrics with nonsense involving drugs, violence, and sex, as well as try too hard to be cool. They wear so much bling and ride their pants so low that it is almost an insult to music thats origins begin in black gospel communities. Unlike a majority of these modern performers, Aloe is clean-cut and classy, you can tell just by the album cover that he isn't like the others. Aloe modernizes the sound of soul music without cussing or trying to look thug. I Need a Dollar has quickly become a sensation and is such a modern soulful song about a poor man sining about needing a dollar, which fits perfectly in todays economy. Aside from this the other songs are still pretty soulful, but not quite as catchy as I Need a Dollar. If Sam Cooke were alive still, he would be proud of guys like Aloe Black who keep true soul music alive and with this Aloe has a successful future ahead of him in the R&B industry.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I do not buy a lot of movies.  I only purchase ones that I feel I will watch a bunch of times.  I do own Toy Story 1 & 2.  When they announced Toy Story 3, I thought there was no way it could live up to expectations.  Boy was I wrong.  This movie is great and really is a nice end to the Toy Story series.  I saw it in the theatres and bought it as soon as it came out on DVD.  I have enjoyed watching it with friends and family over the holidays and I am sure we will be enjoying it more in the future.  Pixar is awesome.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand is an amazing show and is underrated.  I am very excited for the prequel season \\"Gods of the Arena\\" and season 2.  The special effects are like nothing ever seen on television. I am thankful that Starz has allowed them to do so.  The blood, nudity, and sex does not bother me for 2 reasons. 1, the plot, storyline, characters, and action are so amazing and heart pumping. The story draws you in so much. 2, Rome in the gladiator times was a very messed up and corrupted time so it makes sense that the producers would create an accurate simulation of the events in that time.  300 doesn't even compare. 300 used special effects to make up for its story. Spartacus has heart. I love the show and I hope others discover this amazing show.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I had seen this movie before I purchased it for my collection and I loved it. This movie tells a very moving and emotional story about a World War Two \\"flying fortress\\" and its crew, their battle for survival to make it their 25th and final mission and a promise to be sent home if they make it back from that mission. Outstanding cast and great acting by them. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves history.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan is a truly interesting movie experience. It takes one of the all time great classic ballet tragedies & without distorting the premise of the story it re-invents the storyline entirely in a human domain. No sorcerer here except that sorcerer we all have within us.<br /><br />In the ballet, purity & evil are separate spheres & the battle in this world is won by the dark & deadly. Yet even in the ballet world there exists the sphere beyond flesh where justice mayhap prevails.<br /><br />In the movie, light & dark are contained in a single vessel. The struggle is, if anything, even more intense than the ballet because there is only one fate to be determined & that fate is all but foreordained, yet possibilities exist.<br /><br />The story of Black Swan has enhanced the enjoyment of Swan Lake for my wife & I. Just as the creation & story of Swan Lake makes Black Swan such a wonderful journey. Black Swan is a great movie whether there is a Swan Lake or not. Yet Swan Lake makes the movie a far greater show by its very existence. The ballet is the life blood of both yet the ballet is complimented by the movie in a grand manner.<br /><br />If you get caught on this idea of an older girl with a little girl's mind struggling to make an integrated whole of her childlike purity & her adult desires. Add in the very human influences around her & see the childlike wrath, shown as images in the movie but they are only thoughts in her mind, it is a tremendous depiction of human struggle for a functional identity. What will be the union of these opposing forces?<br /><br />The director has given a story that allows numerous personal choices for the character & the viewer. The viewer's personal leanings for a resolution are left open & then the end........ Did the viewer forget something that is brought out in the end? Yes, the most obvious consideration in any case of identity development. Does dark & evil win in Black Swan? Is there a further consideration? Guess!<br /><br />The Swan Lake story is re-organized into a totally human realm & characters go through some adaptation & yet there are no unrecognizable characters in Black Swan. These are people you knew from the ballet but they are more developed as people & more complex as personae.<br /><br />We did not go back & watch Black Swan today only because we watched Swan Lake instead. The one show lends life & depth to the other. I am a full on certified Black Swan freak. More so than for any movie I can remember in long years.<br /><br />It is a Shakespearean tragedy wrapped in a little girls mind & a grown woman's body. It shows tremendous thought in adapting the storyline, tremendous depth in displaying this dysfunctional mind, tremendous intelligence in how to display the scenes for story development & a whistle in the ear for people that want their cinema straight forward plain jane. Rest assured I'll see it again in the theatre./>The Swan Lake story is re-organized into a totally human realm & characters go through some adaptation & yet there are no unrecognizable characters in Black Swan.

However, there was something missing -- something big and necessary. I could not bring myself to really care and be in any way emotionally invested in any of the characters. There was so much darkness, sadness, tragedy, and just plain ugliness in the novel, with not enough beauty and redemption to make it worth struggling through all the darkness. If you're going to drag me through all this nastiness, loss, and depravity, you've got to give me something more to hold onto than these characters.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have always been a huge Alien fan, but these new blu-ray disc bring the movies to a whole new level. I noticed details that I haven't noticed before and all of the extended scenes make the movies so much more interesting. If you really need to get your Alien fix on I highly recommend this blu-ray set.
0439023521|1.0|Disturbing content?  Ok, well it's violent, but it lacks the credibility to be truly disturbing.  And deeply thematic?  Gimme a break!  \\"Killing is bad.\\"  \\"Freedom is good.\\"  Ta-dah!  Hardly revolutionary or even really interesting.  Read any number of other and better dystopian novels - like Ender's Game, Catch 22, 1984 or Paradise Lost.  They have the thematic nuance, subtly, and multi-layered development both in plot and in character to make them classics.      A little research and some attention to detail rather than the inclusion of prolific violence and an adolescent (thematically speaking) love triangle would have done wonders for this book.  Geez!  Her half-attempt to make a statement about Roman gladiators is truly laughable.  For example, she has little to no concept of the history of the Roman names she's included, and then failed to give interesting names to her main characters!    The Hunger Games is like a violent version of a Nicholas Sparks novel.  This is dystopian allegory for those with little or no academic background.  All in all, completely forgettable.  To be honest, I only finished it because I was required to do so for school.
193413712X|3.0|This book got rave reviews, won the Pulitzer and I was attracted to the description, but I ended up having a love/hate relationship with it.  Occasionally I have a difficult time concentrating and can be easily distracted, so reading some of this was tough for me, especially sections that might include the excruciating detail on the inner workings of a clock.  Although poetic and interesting, also tough to get through some of the author's long sentences.  Otherwise, I really liked this story and came to love the the main characters.  I was pulled in and blown away with the beautiful prose and story line.  It was both sad and sometimes funny, and will probably haunt my thoughts for a long time.
0545265355|5.0|I finished reading each book of the The Hunger Games trilogy set in 2 days, that's how amazing the story is. The story is fresh, original with shocking twists in each book. It's the best sci-fi with survivor plot I have read so far. Each book was really a page turner. My 19 yr old daughter is really hook into it, too. It was my christmas gift to her and she was so happy to own this set. I can't wait to see the movie which will feature the lead characters: Katniss, Gale & Peeta.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|A Classic Film with some really excellent singing and acting performances.  The comedy is also excellent with Steve Martin, John Candy, and others.  Steve Martin is the classic dentist and Bill Murry the best masochist I've seen.  Rick Moranis plays a very memorable lead.  I don't have the DVD Cover in front of me now but the heroine has a really beautiful voice and plays her part masterfully.  I never get enough of this film and will take it off the shelf from time to time to enjoy myself or to entertain guests.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This book is a good read, but I've certainly read more engrossing novels.  Two things that bothered me:  it was never fully explained what makes the main character so irresistible that every female character wants to shed her clothes and be with him (must have been the author living vicariously).  Secondly, if you don't enjoy graphic descriptions of horrible sex crimes, allow me to stop you now.  One Stieg Larsson is enough.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|Much like a David Mamet play or movie (like the Spanish Prisoner), the Mist could not be more overwritten. People do not talk or react like this at all in real life, its just ridiculous and cringe-worthy. That said, like a car wreck, i couldn't take my eyes off it. Its so over the top bad, and you really want to slap Marcia Gay Harden. Fun special F/X, great monsters and best ending ever...
B0042RJWTM|4.0|It was nice to see the original movie..I've seen the Tom Selleck version also & enjoyed both- side more with Selleck's take of the novel.But-the older movie here with Lee Marvin blows the socks off The Coen Brothers take on True Grit- don't waste yor money for the remake of True Grit- buy this DVD and it will a be much better investment of your time & dollars spent...
B002ZG981E|5.0|great movie , saw it first on IMAX, knew I had to buy it on blu-ray. Amazon had a great price.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, even your husbands will love it as i did. Kate Winslet is fantastic in this movie.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Portia is so honest, and descriptive of her life battling an eating disorder.  It amazes me how detailed she allowed herself to be and it was heart wrenching at times to read the descriptions of her calorie counting, comparing herself to others and feeling she was worthless.  Her self-esteem was so low.  I am so happy she is doing well now.
0920668372|5.0|I knew of this story prior to purchasing the book for my son. I love it. It is somewhat sad though. My mother in law read it to my son for a bedtime story and came out crying hahaha. It is a sweet and sad story. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it for your kids. My son loved it when he was a baby. Especially when we would read the song verse.
B002XG1OUE|5.0|Definitely worth additional $$ to get the model in addition to the DVD. Lots of special features included in the DVD too.
B00000JTB2|5.0|Brand new CD - this is a must for anyone who likes great Blues.  You get Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughn collaborating.  Not hard to figure out where SRV got his groove.  Seller was prompt with communications and shipping was almost overnight.  Amazing.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|Real horrible movie... top ten worst of the year. But what else would u expect from this brainless porn actor???
0756405890|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I downloaded it on my Kindle. I can honestly say that I was drawn in immediately and couldn't put it down. The characters are rich and the story world is well thought out. I enjoyed this book and cannot wait for the next one to come out. Well worth every penny!
B002ZG976U|5.0|VERY GOOD MOVIE,  KINDA HAD DOUBTS ABOUT THE FILM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER MUSICAL,  BUT IT WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT, INFACT IT HAD A STORY LINE!!! CHER LOOKED FAB AS ALWAYS & GREAT BREAKOUT FILM FOR CHRISTINA AGUILERA,  EVEN THOUGH ALL THE MUSIC WAS PRERECORDED FOR THE FILM,  I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED,  ITS A MUST SEE FOR ALL X~TINA & CHER FANS ALIKE,  COMING TO DVD THIS SPRING!!!  IF U HAVE'NT GOTTEN THE SOUNDTRACK,  WHAT R U WAITING FOR!!!
0760335540|5.0|This is a wonderful book for DIYers.  The photos that accompany each project are fantastic.  The text is to the point and easy to comprehend.    It is a great overview of how things work on a Boxster with pics showing you just about everything you need to know about.  The book covers basic things like putting the car on jack stands and oil changes to more complicated things like installing a 3rd radiator or installing an IMS upgrade.  Each project is assigned a degree of difficulty for DIY.  This is a must have book to anyone who does DIY.
1400023343|3.0|I found this book helpful in getting my husband and I started on a path to bilingualism. The author discusses different approaches. I bought this book because it had a whole section on OPOL (One Parent One Language), which is what we are trying.   The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because I found myself reading (or as I interpreted) many justifications as to why bilingualism works/ is important. I felt the author was trying to sell me on educating my child to be bilingual...I bought the book for a reason - obviously I believe in bilingualism, don't try to then sell me on it in every chapter.  The book was very informative and the author has done lots of research. The book in itself is very helpful.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|The first time you watch 'Children of Men' you might not get it. Try watching it again and later, again. Eventually, like so many other people, you may come to the realization that 'Children of Men' is about as close to perfection as a movie can get. It is stunning. But one warning. You should watch this film under the right conditions or you may not see the same movie so many others have come to admire. A good deal of the film's punch is packed in its sound design. Pick up a decent set of headphones (which are a lot more inexpensive than a nice sound system), turn out the lights at night and crank up the volume. When seen like this 'Children of Men' can blow you away.
B003EYVXTQ|3.0|One of the most surprising indie films I've seen from 2010 is Winter's Bone (2010). It's a dark, gritty, character-driven drama about a 17-year old girl scrambling to take care of her sick mother and younger siblings in rural Missouri. Her father is missing, probably dead or in trouble, and she is thrown into taking care of her family with no money or resources to do so. The appreciation of this film is in the slow revealing of the suspenseful complex story, and the details of the lives of the characters within it. The film is written and photographed with a realism and texture that takes us right into the cold, barren, winter life of poor southerners trying to survive. I give the film 3.5 stars out of 5.<br /><br />Having watched this film once, and then a second time with the audio commentary on, I'm struck by the incredible attention to detail and care that went into constructing this film. It just goes to show that sometimes less is more when it comes to production budgets for movies. This film was made for approximately $2 million, which amazes me when I see what they got for it. Winter's Bone reminds me a lot of another recent Sundance Film Festival winner with a low production budget: Frozen River (2008). Both films are set during winter, and explore strong female characters at the centers of the \\"tough\\" stories. Both films are excellently written and carefully crafted by their female writers/directors. And both films are wonderfully photographed by their directors of photography. Winter's Bone was shot in digital on the Red Camera, an impressive display of the new technology that is changing the film industry.<br /><br />The incredible cast of Winter's Bone is what really brings this story to life. Every detail in their words, their clothing, their make-up, and in their faces is expressed with passion and commitment. While many of the characters stand out and shine on their own, sometimes in just a few minutes of screen time, what struck me the most was how as an ensemble they all brought the film to the same level of excellence. They all deliver Oscar-worthy performances for acting, but will probably be overshadowed precisely because of the sheer quantity of competition between themselves in this one film. Lead actress Jennifer Lawrence will probably be nominated for Best Actress, but beyond her performance, we will have to see.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and watch Winter's Bone. It's a testament to the great indie films that are still being made in our times of $100 million blockbusters that mostly lack soul, depth, and craft. I realize the material for this film isn't necessarily a \\"fun\\" escape, but cinema isn't only about laughing or crying. Sometimes a great movie just shows you the way something is. Winter's Bone does that very well.hey all brought the film to the same level of excellence.

076781326X|5.0|I got this - a film I saw when it came out - to share with my kids.  This is a real hit or miss proposition, as they are used to computer animations and the rawness that we get in films today.  We put it on for xmas and happily, it was the perfect film for us all.<br /><br />First, the acting is simply first rate, from the unlovable Fagan and the sociopath Bill Sikes to the adorable Oliver and his flawed protector, the unfortunate Nancy.  Indeed, this was the film that made Oliver Reed a major star, and he is the perfect villain.  It engaged us completely, both on the emotional level but as a start of an historical discussion.  We all bonded over the film.  Second, the music is wonderful, even if Mark Lester only lip-synched.  My daughter loves musicals, so we will watch this many times with her.  Third, it is a rip-roaringly good story, however much Dickens relies on deus ex machina interventions to tidy things up at the end (usually in the form of a middle-class savior).  The adventure deeply engaged my son.<br /><br />This is an outstanding classic film.  Warmly recommended.
B002AR9YPI|5.0|Been one of my regulars since buying it.  Very well done.  Beautiful at times, haunting at times, but always interesting and listenable.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Recieved this for christmas & let me tell you its a amazing movie/series. The picture is breathtaking. I also own Band Of Brothers on blu-ray. The only thing is, is that there are 6 disc(over 10 hours total). They could have easily put this series on 1-2 disc. Just as they could have with Band Of Brothers. In all it kept my interest. Would recommend to anyone & ecspecially If you own Band Of Brothers.
0316067938|4.0|WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!    It's funny. I'm not really a fan of the Twilight series, but I liked this book. As stated in other reviews, I don't believe this series gives off the best messages to teens and young adults. Bella and Edward are not good role models in my eyes and that was still a problem with this book. I don't support women risking their lives for a pregnancy, but that's my own personal opinion. I can fully understand how someone else could disagree and I respect their decision. I do wish at least one woman in the book would have talked about how they disagreed with Bella's choice to risk her life for the baby. Instead, Rosalie, Leah, and Bella all said they'd risk their lives for an unborn child and while Esme and Alice never said they agreed, they didn't say they disagreed either.     However, I did enjoy reading about Bella's experiences as a new born vampire. It's fun to imagine what it would be like to be suddenly so beautiful, so strong, so fast. Not to mention the perfect memory. I'd take that trick, thank you very much. Renesmee was an interesting character too. She's a bit too perfect for my taste, but whatever. I really wasn't bothered that Jacob imprinted on her, but I know that freaked some people out. He doesn't turn into a pedophile! Don't panic.    I was disappointed in how Charlie reacted to finding his daughter so changed and a new, impossible baby with her. I know he was in shock, but having him just sit in silence for hours and watch t.v.? Really?  No more talking to the daughter he's been worried sick over, no getting to know the new baby? Just sitting and watching football for hours while they sit silently near by? Then when it's time for him to leave, he's so desperate for more time with them. It just doesn't make sense to me.     I was also disappointed that after all the preparation, there was no battle, but I'm glad Bella finally found some strength and power. About time, sister! Everythingturned out a bit too perfect and happily ever after in my view, but apparently that's what Meyers wanted. Meh. Each to her own.     I know a lot of Twilight fans were disappointed in this book. I'm sorry they felt let down. It sucks when you love a series but hate the ending. I guess the wrap up is a bit more palatable if you weren't a big fan to begin with. Go figure, hu?
0312600844|2.0|...for me to finish this book.  I read about 1/3 of it before I ended up skipping through the remaining 2/3.  When I was reading it, all I could think about were all the other books I had gotten from the library that I wanted to read and thinking to myself that my time would be better spent on them instead of this bore of a book.  I have \\"the Corrections\\" in my home library and may end up donating that to the library, as I see that book received worse reviews than this one.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Amazing documentary. Scenes are spectacular. Be sure to watch the epidodes in Blu-Ray on a large screen. It is as good as going to an iMax theatre.
0316010669|2.0|I had the original paperback version of this book, and gave it away to a friend.<br />When I ordered another from Amazon, they sent me a 25% smaller version of my book.<br />It didn't say anything about shrinking the book before they sent it to me.<br />I'm a big man.<br />I like big books.<br /><br />All the words were there .... I just wish they would have been their original size.
0395389496|5.0|I love this book. it came in great condition and i look forward to reading it to my son as he grows. Definity a Christmas Classic!
B004APVI1G|5.0|This is my very first 3D movies on my LG 47\\" 3D TV. There are a lot of ghosting. Could it be the technology is too new??  After doing more research. It turns out to be my TV.. I'm giving 5* for this movie. :)
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I saw this movie in the box office 16 times and I can hardly wait to see it as many times as I want while at home.  I looked at all the othe promotion for the different sets and picked Amazon because it was the cheapest and it had all the stuff I wanted in it.
0060931671|1.0|I got half way in, expecting something to happen, but nothing ever did.  I learned nothing about the characters, the story did not move forward, and massive amounts of irrelevant trivia were thrown in - to make the writer seem clever?  In this book, the joke's on the reader.  Stay away unless you also really dig monotonal music too.
1439181780|5.0|There are so many books with ideas, theories and the like. I'm not one to be into the hype but this book is very different. The information is sound and provides insights into what can make a persons life change for the better in so many ways. All I can say is Read the Book, it will change your life. While the other book written buy this author had more of a materialistic feel, this one is more of a personal improvement style, well done and worth taking the time. I'm pretty sure you will be impressed enough to purchase additional copies to pass around.
B00493AD74|2.0|I watch a lot of movies and I like Julia Roberts.  But this movie was way too long and just too slow.  They could have cut it a lot to make the story move along better.  It almost felt painful to finish, but I had to get to the end.  Not the worst movie I've seen, but very far from good.  Would not recommend.
9889979942|5.0|This is a really great book!    I'm a photographer and I have spent a lot of time doing travel photography [...] so I am generally really picky and very critical of other photographers but this is really great work.  Tom captures the uniqueness of individuals and the diversity of the cultures across china.  He shows us everything from the grittiness of poverty to the beauty and grandeur of the landscape.  It is a truly remarkable book and one I am glad to have in my collection.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Well worth the price!  And, don't bother trying to find a less expensive, new, complete set-this was the cheapest I could find in December.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I was mildly excited about this album as I have heard Nicki Minaj's work on some other Young Money albums and found her style of machine gunning witty lyrics refreshing, however.  Popping this album into my car I was immediately disappointed; first and foremost the lyrics are just brainless, she uses idiotic metaphors to discuss superficial topics which seem to blend well with the modern hip hop zeitgeist.  I can almost forgive this transgression, however, aside from the idiocy of her topic's, her vocals are way off you can tell a ton of auto tune was used and she modulates and shifts her voice from annoying to more annoying, I understand from some of Nicki's good verses (on other peoples albums) that she does change cadence and intonation and it happens to be something I am a fan of, when it sounds good, this doesn't.  She sounds more drunk karaoke singer than an actual musician in these instances.  The final problem with this album is the production, many of the beats seem phoned in using a variety of synths and technology instead of real musicians, furthermore these beats are simply cheap imitations of the same things we have heard before.   Avoid this clearly Nicki is happy attempting to be modern hip hop's Lady GaGa and attempting to convince fans that superfluous topics are profound.
1439153663|5.0|Let me start by saying I listened to this book on my IPOD because Bahni Turpin (narrator from \\"THE HELP\\") was reading-and she is my favorite Narrator.  From beginning to end, this was a compelling tale of love, family, happiness and sadness, sacrifice and riches. A tale that follows the arrival of the little Irish girl in America to a plantation in VA, through her childhood and her arrival into womanhood, and all those around her who became her family and loved ones. The Author provides an explanation at the end of the book as to how she came to write this story, and this will make you shiver. Excellent story, flows well, involves the reader, the characters come alive. Makes you smile at times, and cry at others. The Narrators, Orlagh Cassidy, and Bahni Turpin do an absoultely superb job of bringing the characters to life. As a result, this is certainly one book that I recommend listenng to v.s. reading.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|this was so good. i really wasnt sure how much i would have liked it but i really did. i would recomend this book to a lot of people and thepeople that i already recomened it to are also reading it.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I loved Mr. Ferriss' first book \\"The 4-Hour Work Week\\" so being a fitness nut, I was curious to see if this book was as great as his first release. I was very surprised by the broad category that he covered in this book, relating to everything from a better mind, a stronger and leaner body, to better sex.    Although most of this information is common knowledge among body builders and health experts (which he points out) it was nice to see a manual with various quick methods to rapidly reduce weight loss, build libido, and pack on the muscular pounds. Although some of the methods may seem a little scary, Tim offers science for us nerds backed by many doctors. Plus, if you follow his routine, you can shove Thirty donuts into your mouth and still lose weight.    It is well worth the read but note that it is very deep in terminology and every chapter may not relate to your needs. But he does suggest a proper route of which chapters you should read depending on your needs, which I though was a nice bonus.    The only thing I wish he would have added in the book is a re-cap chapter that lays out his diet, grocery list, and the exercise plans. However, he does offer links to his site that provides this information and more. I just prefer to have it in the back of the book so I can jump to that point on my Kindle.    All in all, if you want to lose weight, pack on some muscle, or want to throw away that Viagra, give \\"4-Hour Body\\" a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed;)
0393316041|5.0|No doubt, Dr. Feynman is one of the most extraordinary American scientists of all time.  Not only is he a brilliant Physicist, he is a remarkable thinker and highly relatable. His anecdotes, adventures and more in-depth stories provide an inside look to the very odd but brilliant Dr. Feynman.  While readers from a wide range of backgrounds would enjoy this work, science enthusiasts (and those familiar with his work) will be particularly pleased with this one.  An outstanding read! A+
B000IOM0WE|3.0|Decent movie...some interesting special effects but lacking in true story development.  Enjoyed watching but if you are not versed in the SciFi world or are unwilling to suspend your disbelief you might find this film seriously lacking.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book series.  It was not what I expected from the title and a little hard to get into at first but then I loved it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was in my stocking this year! Not sure if I have ever sweated as much in my life...these workouts really kick your butt and great if you are limited on time. Like other reviewers said I too wish there were more DVD's in this series. Strongly recommend this to anyone trying to lose that last bit of baby weight.
B000RJO578|5.0|Buying this for my son gave him 3 copies of this movie.  It's a great one to re-gift....  :)
B00008IHN1|4.0|My husband saw \\"Drumline\\" a few weeks ago and liked it so much, he wanted his own copy and has watched it over and over ever since. For us, it brings back memories of playing in a marching band even though neither of us played percussion. The only reason I didn't give the movie 5 stars is due to the skimpy costumes and sensuous dance movements of the young, beautiful women. Back in my days, we were more covered up and less provacative. Other than this, it is a thumbs up.

B002VPE1Z2|3.0|If you're looking for a camera case that just gets the job done, this is the one for you. It's priced very decently, has enough room for my new fujifilm camera, and has a decently sized zipper pocket for batteries. There isn't enough comfortable room to put the USB cable in, but that is ok.<br /><br />As for construction, it isn't anything flashy or special. It won't be as protective as something with a hard shell case or more padding, but it's something to hold and carry your camera. I don't know why cuteness is a factor in rating this item, so I have it a 1 since it isn't cute.<br /><br />I also received the camera case as quickly as the camera, so I'm very pleased with the buyer! All in all, I'd say it's a 3 out of 5. It does the job for my husband's new camera for a nice price, but isn't as good as anything more than $10.
0810993139|5.0|Hey do you want to learn about the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book? Manny and Roderick are Greg's brothers. Greg has a lot of friends. Their names are Fregly and Rowley. The problem is that Greg doesn't like middle school because everyone gets bullied.     My favorite part is when Greg fights Fregly and Fregly wins. I like this part because it was funny. It made that part funny because Greg said he wood beat up Fregly. I would not like to be a wrestler like Greg and Fregly.   Something I don't like about this book is that I wish that the book and the movie had the same ending.   I would give the book five stars.

B002VECM6S|5.0|I saw \\"Blindside\\" on a plane and loved it so much I wanted my husband to watch it. Sandra Bullock deserves her award winning performance but everyone in the cast was great. Everytime I see \\"Blindside\\" I still get tears in my eyes becuase it is very inspiring and also heartwarming. The line I like best is when Sandra Bullock tells her friends that she has learned more from Michael and Michael has changed her life more than the other way around. \\"Blindside\\" is perfect for the whole family to watch and what I would call a \\"keeper\\".
B00006LLLN|5.0|This is one of her very best CDs.  Most stores don't even carry this artist and when they do the CDs are very expensive.  Amazon had the best price.

1400049628|2.0|This was an interesting read. I guess in a tongue in cheek kind of way. Yes I am into the zombie genre of fiction. Yes I have read World War Z. So why no 5 star rating like most of the others? Well the author doesn't know much about firearms for one thing. He doesn't know much about combat for another. And lastly he knows very little about survival. So in a tongue in cheek sort of way it is entertaining. If you are looking for a survival book check into SAS survival handbook or something of that nature. If you want an entertaining read. This can kind of give you that. But it is a very short book, the information contained is inaccurate and it comes off as a little silly. I couldn't give it 1 star because it does actually have some entertainment value. Beyond that it really is just a misinformed author giving advise on topics he has no idea about.
B000LT2IHI|1.0|This is a boring waste of space. My son got it as a Holiday present and he never plays with it. It seems like it should have come with 4 balls since there is 4 shoots but it only comes with 3. There is very little you can do with this toy and it takes up a fair amount of space.

0061989142|4.0|One of the things I love about Lauren Conrad is her classic, elegant, yet chic style. Watching \\"Laguna Beach\\" and \\"The Hills\\" as a teenager, I grew up liking L.C and her fashion sense. I was so excited about this book, and Amazon has an amazing (and cheaper) price than most retail/bookstores. The book did not disappoint- if I could buy enough books for all my girlfriends I totally would. This book is a great gift, treat, and personal staple for anyone even remotely interested in the fashion industry, or just the ladies who want in on L.C style tips. I love that this book has two angles, Lauren's personal lifestyle & tips, while at the same time, it includes a lot of classic/helpful information from other sources (such as her styling crew, and other tips she's learned from designers/makeup artists). A lot of the content in this book is also similar to plenty of classic and timeless tips you would get from Teen Vogue, Lucky Mag, and People's Style Watch (which is great, you get a big magazine with helpful tips in one book). The book is overall great- it involves many categories, such as: 1. Shopping tips 2. Closet organizing 3. Makeup 4. Hair 5. Basics every girl/woman should own 6. How to shop/dress for your body shape. 7. Accessories and more!
B00338QENI|5.0|I purchased this book at an airport because our flight was delayed, and I am so glad that I did. I was so intrigued by the story that I nearly finished the book during my flight. This book caused me to realize the number of untold stories that still must be out there waiting to be told! I encourage any person going into the medical field to read this book! Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job putting all the pieces together as she ventures out on her quest to find out who is Henrietta Lacks and how her cells contribute to the changes, discoveries, and even ethics of modern day medicine. It is very easy to read especially for those who may not be familiar with the medical industry.
9889979942|5.0|Comprehensive, moving, and off the beaten path, just the way I like it.  Not sure how this guy got these candid shots out in the sticks of China.  The book itself could be larger but the content is well worth it.
0307346617|2.0|This is not the worst Z book out there. But it honestly isn't the masterpiece it is touted as either. By telling the stories through survivor's accounts the author skirts by without looking like such a misinformed buffoon as he does in his other books. It is of coarse the most popular zombie book out there. It is actually one of the least interesting z books out there as well. It is generally everyone's first read in the z genre. That is fine, it needs to be that way. It is a good primer to break a new reader in to the genre. It is not scary, riveting or even interesting for that matter. The good thing about the book is most of the accounts are short. So although bored, one can power through to the next one or just set it down and do something more interesting. If you have already read some of the better authors in this genre I wouldn't recommend regressing. If you want to start out with this one. Maybe look into Joe McKinney or J W Brown afterward. My advise would be to wait for the WWZ movie. Surely it will be better than the book.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|I filled the backpack with a camera body, 4 lenses, and a flash.  There was still room for a small lens.      Pros:  Comfortable, good layout, a lot of versatility.    Cons:  On the first day of carrying it the seam started to pull out at the top of the straps then later at the top of the second pocket.  This was on the first day of a 10 day vacation so I had to be extra careful the rest of the trip to make sure it would not come completely undone.
0486476421|5.0|I have been reading Metaphysical authors since the mid-nineties and Haanel takes the 'ethereal' cake. This book takes some time to read. I am only about two weeks into the book (the process takes twenty four weeks). Initially, I was taken aback because the process was so long but, understood the reason for the method. It takes many years to get to the place where we're at when we first pick up the book. It takes a minmum of 40 days to shift one's consciousness and 120 days to cement the new vibration in the human experience so, 24 weeks should do it.<br />I would wholeheartedly reccomend this book to anyone looking to \\"cement\\" a permanent change into their life. I like to call the Master Key - the original self help book. The only reason that the Secret (by Rhonda Byrne) was so popular is because The Master Key was published in 1917-falling out of wide circulation.<br />The Master Key is rumored to be behind the success of folks like Bill Gates and others.<br />I would reccommend reading Wallace Wattles \\" The Science of Getting Rich\\" as well as it reflects some of principles of the Master Key System. The primary difference between the two writings is that you'll spend far more time -solidifying the principles in the latter. Please buy this book! You will not be disappointed.
B00000JTB2|5.0|After seeing the studio session on a local PBS station, I had to have the CD. As a Blues lover, I was surprised that I did not even know that this recording existed. I have seen both of these masters perform and am glad to have the recording in my collection.
030746363X|5.0|I've been studying fitness and nutrition for several years as a hobby.  I haven't had the time to try most of his more advanced \\"hacks\\" as of yet, but the fundamentals are accurate and clearly presented.  The more advanced techniques are supported by Tim's personal experience, vouched for by credible experts, and explained by science (for the most part & where applicable).  Importantly, Tim does a great job of debunking a lot of bad myths that persist among \\"average\\" people about excercise and nutrition.  For the beginner, this is an extremely valuable take-away.    In short, this book can be a useful tool to a novice or an expert.  It provides tips for motivation (hint: learn what/how to measure, & track), and if you're looking to get in shape this is the biggest and most important step.  It will also provide clear instructions to accomplish your goals-no matter how ambitious.
B00338QENI|1.0|I just HAD to read this book after it landed itself in the top spot on the book list for 2010. I was interested to find out more about the Hela cells, as I had never heard the story before. This whole book revolves around the strange and ridiculous family of this poor woman. They are uneducated and very money hungry. They seem to only care about what type of compensation they can receive from the Hela cells. This is a story of a family that is neither inspiring or noteworthy. They are a waste of 300 pages. RIP Henrietta Lacks...so sorry you family ruined your story!
B00417HV14|5.0|I discovered Joe on Palladia. This exact show. He is amazing! He is rather iconic the way he shreds with emotion. He looks cool doin' it too. The sound is fantastic and would give it five stars just for the mix. The guitars bite, the bass thuds and the duel drummers pound. A purchase well worth it!
0380730405|5.0|\\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again\\" begins \\"Rebecca\\", Daphne Du Maurier's superb 1938 novel of suspense.  \\"Rebecca\\" is a subtle  psychological thriller, with a slow rolling start and a gripping, page-turning finish, set in Cornwall in 1920's Britain.<br /><br />As the story opens, a young woman suffers through her work as the paid companion of a wealthy but hopelessly gauche older woman.  In Monte Carlo, they meet an Englishman, a \\"landed gentleman\\" in his forties named Maxim de Winter, who is recovering from a personal tragedy. The older man and the younger woman strike up an awkward friendship.  The young woman is happily surprised when Maxim suddenly and casually proposes marriage.<br /><br />After their honeymoon, Mr. and Mrs. de Winter return to his estate of Manderly.  The young Mrs. de Winter finds herself out of her depth in a household dominated by the forbidding housekeeper Mrs. Danvers and haunted by reminders of the first Mrs. de Winter, the beautiful Rebecca, drowned in a boating accident.  As she struggles to find her footing, the earlier tragedy refuses to stay buried.  Mrs. de Winter will find that very little around her, including her husband, can be taken at face value.  The dead hand of the past will reach out to threaten everything she values in the present.<br /><br />\\"Rebecca\\" is a superbly crafted thriller, told entirely through the eyes of the young Mrs. de Winter, against a lushly described setting of time and place.  It is very highly recommended to fans of Daphne Du Maurier and to those looking for an exciting period piece mystery novel.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|Machete is so off the wall violent that it makes the Expendables look like Mary Poppins. But unlike the Expendables, the movie doesn't take itself too serious. Machete is a retarded and cheesy flick that's trying to be a retarded and cheesy flick.<br />Lindsay Lohan even has fun poking fun at herself as a rich sleazy girl that constantly needs her father to bail her out of bad situations. Except, maybe she's so high these days that she doesn't realize she's poking fun at herself.<br />While you have Don Johnson (Miami Vice) as a boarder controller. Robert De Niro as an evil Senator that wants illegal aliens out of the U.S and Steven Seagal as the bad guy that just wants....Machete DEAD!!!!! There's just too much fun casting to mention. I can't wait for Robert Rodriguez to cast Paulie Shore as a bad guy in Machete 2 lol. Well I'm hoping he will anyway.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Nine years after Michael Jacksons \\"Invincible\\" that hurts soo deep down in hearth and soul by listening to it Kanye West delivers the only fitting response! Try it for yourself, play \\"Invincible\\", the over-produced record trying to mask the dead hope for love and longing by Michalel Jacksons - still kind and still fighting against all odds - softly spoken voice. MJ never came out of his closets. But you can hear the fight with himself, still believing in humanity. The beauty of hope as last man standing. Listen to it resonates with my own struggle with human being and still brings me to my tears. Up today in the post-2000-years no other record was released that shows us what music at its best is about as Mozart told us in his Da Ponte Operas or Wagner in his Tristan. In rare cases find music and words and instruments together and speak everlasting truthness. And now listen to Kanye West. He did everything right - It starts with the title of the record \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\". Five words - no other words could have tell more about this masterwork. Why answer to \\"Invincible\\"? Because Kanye West turns his inside out. Michael Jackson could never do that but it was exactly this behaviour that let us also forget all the devils in our very own souls to believe in the possibility of the beauty in good. West sings in Devil In A New Dress \\"I know I'm preaching to the congregation. We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan\\". A beauty Jackson never knew? Kanye West does. And was brave enough to add this dangerous distortion of sound into his songs. \\"I Think I fell in love with a porn star\\" How many men long for such a line. What beauty. Great music always starts with God and ends with Love! Buy it. And if it does not catch you instantely give it another listening. It will catch. It will. Best record of the last nine years!
0439023513|3.0|One of the things I liked best about Katniss from the first book was her relatable complexity as a character. She is unwilling to kill, but bravely does so when she must. She puts up emotional walls to protect herself, but they crumble at revealing times to show her true nature. While she may not want to lead others, she has a strong sense of duty. All of these things made her very compelling.<br /><br />Many of these traits were lost in this book. You can argue about the trauma of war and its effects on a person, but I agree with the other reviewers: this was Katniss's time to take up her bow and fight. This was her moment to shine. And if the book hadn't been told in first person, she would have been lost. She shrank away to almost nothing, and really her whole role in the war was not that significant. There is a lot of buildup, and then we're left unfulfilled at the end.<br /><br />Think of all the trilogies out there. Think of Star Wars--first, the unwilling, slightly naive main character struggling to survive by the seat of their pants; second, the character realizes what must be done and starts to learn the skills they need; and third, the character faces the fact that they can't hide from their destiny and brings everything full circle. That was the progression I was hoping for.<br /><br />This book didn't grip me like the other two did. It's not that it was badly written, it's just that it didn't take me where I wanted to go, and large chunks of the story felt very flat. I loved the first two, but I probably will not read this one again.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I don't usually write spoilers but I have to get a few things out there that drove me nuts. 1) At the end of the book, Katniss's mother pretty much drops her. We don't see her after Katniss is burned and she doesn't return home with her. I know her mother was very passive throughout the books, but there should have been some sort of coming-together between these two to share their grief. 2) Katniss has two kids because Peeta wanted them so much. Where is our strong Katniss? It was like she didn't really care for these kids at all. 3) Killing off Prim, really? Plus it was like boom, she's dead, and the follow-up was hardly satisfactory, especially since Katniss had been so protective.
0817439390|5.0|Years ago I came accros the 2nd edition and wished I had it decades ago as it would have saved me major headaches.  Now that I teach Digital Photography this is the book I use a long with the workshop.<br /><br />For a beginner, amateur, hobbyist this book is a must have.  More experienced Photographers might find the material redundant (to a point) and if you have the 2nd Edition the new material might be too minimal to justify the purchase.  After all, if you read and did the exercises on the 2nd edition you should have 'mastered' the same principles covered in this book.
0525423273|5.0|I am an avid reader and usually go through about 3 books a week so I am constantly looking for more material to read.  At first when I found this book I though it would be a predictable, one note teen story but boy was I wrong!!  I can not say enough good things about this book and author. It is so funny and well written I just could not put it down. I enjoyed it so much and am looking forward to reading more of Stephanie's books.  Her style is so witty and fresh and this story is wonder.  In some places I laughed so hard I was crying and then in others I felt the love, anger, frustration and happiness right along with the characters.  I definitely am going to recommend this book to everyone.
B0001VV1GK|1.0|My friend has a much older model of this garage, and it is great.  The elevator moves up and down via a single wooden dowel with a spiral groove, and it is indestructable.  The elevator on the version I got is operated by a string and pulley system that quickly broke.  In fact, the entire top of the garage comes off.  I screwed it back on and used some wood glue, but it is still shoddy.  Looks like they have a new design already, but I wouldn't trust it.  I bought the orange Plan crane, and it was a piece of junk too.  Disappointing.
B003L20IFQ|3.0|Wow, who knew that they made a box big enough to fit Ryan Reynolds AND a whole boatload of liberal talking points?  Oh yeah they are all there: the Iraq war and the military is the pretty obvious one, but go ahead and heap on evil insurance companies, add a dash of health care and even class warfare while you're at it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, but the political crap that they heaped on was really pushing it.  And for one character to say, \\"they are just like you\\", was really detestable.  I'm sorry, but terrorists who would bury someone alive for ransom are not like any Americans I know.  That mentality is disgusting to me.<br /><br />But, as a suspense thriller, this one really does a great job keeping things fresh and interesting, and Ryan Reynolds can do no wrong.  Pretty much right up till the very end, I felt like the fish on the hook.  They pulled the line and I followed right along the whole way.  I'm always one for a unique movie experience, and this was a good one, I just could have done without a lot of the blatant political statements.
037582913X|5.0|Most people have that one book or so that they LOVED being read when a small child. This book was mine!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Old habits die hard. Jack Bauer is out of C.T.U. and is in New York convalescing from his exposure to a bioweapon from last season. All Jack wants to do now is fly out to Los Angeles, to spend time with his daughter and grand-daughter. But one bleeding informant shatters Jack's serenity, this stool pigeon apprising him of a plan to assassinate the charismatic President of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan (Anil Kapoor, terrific), who is in New York to establish peace relations with the United States. And there goes the reluctant Jack Bauer, handling field ops again, risking his life again, having another crapawful day. But Jack can still adapt to any tricky situation, is as implacable as ever (and he still yells orders a lot). Old habits die hard. The opening episode revs it up, treating us to a whiff of 16 BLOCKS.<br /><br />24 - Season 8 - or as I like to call it, Betrayathon! - superbly closes out one of television's most innovative and controversial series and, the way it ends, I wouldn't be surprised at all if a 24 movie were in the offing. As usual, Jack has to pierce layer after layer of conspiracy. The twists and turns may give you whiplash. Neat \\"What the--?!\\" moments include an unexpected promotion for Chloe and the return of a familiar snake in the grass. And it wouldn't be 24 unless key characters are navigating thru many moral and political pitfalls, being forced into grey area compromises, except that the grey area always seems to get darker, yeah? Here's a game: Drink a shot every time a character validates their actions by saying it's \\"for the greater good.\\"<br /><br />It would've been a hell of a tweak if 24 this time took place in, say, Duluth, Minnesota or Ogden, Utah. But no, the writers don't go out on that limb. New York is the new C.T.U. setting, and the only familiar presence there is social sandpaper Chloe O'Brian. Intriguing new faces at C.T.U. consist of Mykelti Williamson as the sorta slimy new C.T.U. Director, Katee Sackhoff as a secretive (and hot!) systems analyst, and Freddie Prinze, Jr. as square-jawed C.T.U. agent Cole Ortiz. Cherry Jones (\\"President Allison Taylor\\") and Annie Wersching (\\"Renee Walker\\") return to meaty roles, with Wersching's scarred Agent Walker in some instances out-Bauering Jack Bauer. It's a sight to behold when even Jack thinks Renee had gone too far.<br /><br />But if you thought that Jack was extreme before, he really goes off the reservation in this one. Kiefer is so intense and still so underrated as an actor. We follow multiple story arcs going on simultaneously, and I'll admit to initially scoffing at Katee Sackhoff's narrative. For the first half of the season, I was dismissing her arc as contrived and unnecessary. But then something happens...<br /><br />I've become converted to waiting to watch my television shows until the complete season DVDs come out. 24, with its complex multi-layered plotting, is best taken in when you could it tune in back to back to back. Season 8 is thrilling and action-packed and cautionary. It provokes thought and debate, from Presidents Taylor and Hassan's character arcs to Jack Bauer's controversial stand. 24 doesn't rest on its laurels. It's addictive to the end.<br /><br />24 episodes on six discs with the following bonus material: \\"The Ultimate C.T.U.\\" - a featurette going into the show's relocation to New York and the impressive set designs for the New York-based C.T.U. (00:12:51 minutes); 7 Extended Episodes; Deleted Scenes, including one in which Renee tells Chloe why she never called Jack back when he was recuperating; \\"Scenemakers\\" - a series of 2 minutes-plus technical footage giving behind-the-scene looks at key stunts/special effects sequences in 21 episodes (the rocket launcher scene, the motorcade save, etc.); and \\"Virtually New York\\" - this segment explores the tech involved (mostly digital compositing) in delivering a consistent and convincing looking New York City (00:09:09). It blows that there aren't episode commentaries.ies.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|Although I am a big fan of the books and movies, in my opinion this is not the best soundtrack of the series, probably like about 6 of the songs.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|This is a pretty good gaming controller, especially for WoW players on the Mac platform.  It is built solidly and of decent materials.  The software works fine on Mac OS Snow Leopard, but it needs work.    Pros:   -Lends itself to comfortable short- to mid-length gaming sessions  -Doesn't move around the desk even in the most energetic gaming sessions  -Highly customizable, especially with recognized games (I've only used it with WoW/Cataclysm)    Cons:  -Not all keys on the pad respond the same.  Some of the larger keys are sticky or don't depress consistently  -I don't care for the placement of the typical movement key detents (AWSD equivalent)  -Some of the software is buggy, but this is mitigated by turning it off (The RSS reader for the screen is junk)  -Unlike other types of controllers, it is completely dependent on the software at all times, rather than just for configuration    Overall, I'm glad I got it.  After the initial breaking in, I definitely prefer it to the Apple keyboard for extended gaming and accessibility.  I wish the software were better, though.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I bought this for my wife as a Christmas Gift and who's a fan of both James Taylor & Carole King. She started listening to it on Christmas Day and it's still in her car's CD player. I say based on that, it's a great buy.
B004FP1WX0|1.0|Anyone who is even marginally tech savvy knows where this movie is going inside of 30 minutes. I failed to see what was riveting, horrific, or job dropping as the description implies. At most, the lead male character is easy on the eyes (ok, he's hot!)and the lead female character a pathetic creature who clearly needs a support network and some therapy. While I am certainly by no means diminishing the life in which she lives, recall that her husband says she chooses it. That's her lot. As for the purchase of this video, shame on the writer whose teaser line convinced me to rent this sham. Save your money, this movie sucked. It deserves a negative star.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|enjoyed the sample as well as expected.  with health issues wanted to continue my love of reading and got the kindle for holidays.  ken follett had to be first. love the book and the kindle. no more need to be said.
0441013597|1.0|I finished this book but chose not to continue with the series. While I don't need a Disney finish to books I'm sensitive to the overall mood of a story. For me this book, all through it, had a depressing heavy feeling to it like all hope or hapiness was sucked right out of me. There has to be some sad or not so good parts in a book scattered throughout, but what I found in this book is that there is a depressing feeling that permeates from start to finish. I was disapointed because I know from the reviews and people I know who have read it that this is a great SF series...but like all styles it is not for everyone.
1439163146|3.0|James Franco is by no means a bad writer. His stories inspired a lot of thought, actually. I wouldn't call them great though. Some are certainly good while others are \\"okay.\\" This is the kind of book that makes me want to have a conversation with the author. I'm curious as to why he made some decisions.    I think the stories could benefit from a rewrite--what stories can't? But I think a lot of them could bridge the gap between \\"good\\" and \\"great\\" or even \\"okay\\" and \\"good\\" if some things were tuned up. He slips into wordiness in some moments and does the whole \\"telling\\" not \\"showing\\" deal. It annoyed me when reading it at times because I know that if he just deleted three or four paragraphs at moments, the stories could have excelled because of subtlety.     I'm interested to read more from him. He's definitely talented.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|Absolutely fantastic novel. You didn't want to put it down, and when you did you thought about nothing but the story.
0553582461|2.0|The Farseer trilogy and The Tawny Man trilogy are well worth reading. Regardless, I was disappointed with Fool's Fate.      The Good:   The relationship between Fitz and Fool is genius.    The possibility of a romance between Kettricken and Fitz was gripping.    Hobb's invention of Thick is quite creative, and the use of Nettle creates an interesting addition to plot.       The Bad:  In Fool's Fate, Fitz is the eternal Charlie Brown who never gets to kick the football. Is there anything wrong with allowing Fitz some positive experiences and public acolades??? Please, Fitz, stop accepting everything as your fault. UGH!!! Tell them all to go to hell. You had every right to keep Nettle away from the Farseers. The Farseers manipulate and abuse bastards. Please, Ms. Hobbs, must Fitz always be so good, so noble, and so impotent -- always enduring an ignominious victory? It is redundant, irritating, and one dimensional.     Fool's Fate, encompasses a ridiculous unbelievable plot! Who would allow the prince and his most important advisors to place themselves in such a precarious lose/lose position??? Once realizing the country did not want the dragon beheaded, they should have returned home. In addition to this, the prince was too young and inexperienced to even consider a marriage. I do not believe Kettricken would ever commit her young son to a marriage, later yes, but not at that age.      Hobbs has a poor habit of burdening her readers with PAGES of trivial matters: eternal seasickness; eternal snow treks. How many pages must the reader endure Thick being sea sick? Stop wasting our time. Edit! Edit! Edit! Instead, let us read of an affair between Kettricken and Fitz.       The Ugly:     Fool's Fate has a nauseating ending -- Molly who??? Give us a break! Fitz should have had an affair with Kettricken or a \\"female\\" Fool.     I loved Fool. However, once dead --- he should have stayed dead. His revival was a gimmick that should not have been repeated. When the Fool died, Ihardly cared as I knew Hobbs lacked the guts to leave him that way. I knew he would be revived. Hobbs loves emotional roller coasters, yet she lacks the grit needed to live with the results of her tragedies. One tires of this dishonesty and stops trusting the author's integrity. While reading one quickly realizes, \\"Yes, the Fool is dead. So what? It is obvious this will not be eternal.\\"     The final insult is Hobbs' inability to explain her deception involving the Fool's manhood. Instead, she simply ignored all references to the possibility that he might actually be a woman. It would have been more honest and interesting if the Fool had either been a woman or better yet, a hermaphrodite. Be consistent, Hobbs, stop manipulating the reader -- it is a cheap, sophomoric tool.          One Final Questions:  1.  Did anyone resent the use of the soldier, Riddle? Initially, he appeared he might actually be the Fool in \\"soldier disguise.\\" Not cool...I was relieved to finally confirm he was NOT the fool. Had he actually been the Fool in disguise, I'm not sure I could have continued reading. Yes, Hobbs is an amazing writer. However this is a prime example of the weakness in Hobbs' writing style: obvious gimmick after obvious gimmick after obvious gimmick.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I love this movie beyond reason. As a lucid dreamer, I find the subject matter fascinating; as a sci-fi and action aficionado, I was constantly engaged in the movement of the plot and the effects; and as a girl, I was utterly thrilled with all the amazing three-piece suits. Every actor in this film went all out in terms of performance; the subtlety of facial expression, particularly on background characters in a scene, is so fun to look for during repeat viewings. I've seen this movie several times now, and feel that nothing is diminished, no matter how many times you watch it. It's just that richly woven and complex.    The extras are nifty, the quality is great, and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time. If you are a fan of any of the actors in this film, the genre, or are just looking for something intriguing where lots of stuff blows up, you will love this film!
B002PMV9K6|1.0|The sad fact is this dvd arrived broken.  The packaging seemed adaquit and the return policy of no returns of opened items is understandable...but...in this case it was unfortunate for me.

Great stuff Tim... you are a serious legend and more obsessed than I am (that is saying something!).    Congrats on your #1 in Amazon. Your promotional strategy was the best I have ever seen.

B001VNB54A|2.0|This movie focused way too much on the battle fatigue (currently called post traumatic stress syndrome).  You never connect with any of the characters except the Medal of Honor winner.  And that was just depressing.  This movie is biased by hollywood-speak and political correctness.  Both thumbs down.
1440503257|5.0|My 12 year old nephew is a HUGE Harry Potter fan and loves to cook, so this was the perfect Christmas gift for him.  The book is well thought out, right down to the \\"ragged\\" edges of the pages to make it look more \\"Harry Potter\\".  Each recipe has a reference to the book, chapter and sometimes the page that the dish is mentioned.  Even though it is \\"unofficial\\" it was very well written and keeps with the true nature of Harry Potter.
0896898288|5.0|I love the book and cannot wait to get started on my class to make the quilt.  I find myself drawn to the book and the lives of the 1920's farmers wife.     I am disappointed that the entries from 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners of the original contest were not included in the book.     The included CD contains all of the templates (111).  Be very careful when you print them to make sure you have to correct size.  I printed all of the templates and when I measured template 94, I realized that all of the templates I printed were too small.  Once I found the correct printer settings, template 94 measures exactly 6 1/2 inches (finished size is 6\\").     Enjoy, I know I will!
0765326353|4.0|My favorite thing about this book is the world Sanderson created.  The natural history and the way magic works are unique to this book. One does get pulled along by the story.  The only thing that could make this better would be if the language used was richer.  The descriptions could be more vivid and the dialogue could be more interesting.  I'm not sure if it's reasonable to expect that someone who quickly writes 1000-page books labor over every phrase.  Not everyone can be Harper Lee.  Anyway, that's why I gave it four stars.  You might give it five stars if you don't care about such things.
1416955070|4.0|This is the first book in the Mortal Instruments trilogy. Cassandra Clare does a great job creating a whole new world parallel to that of the \\"mundanes\\" (humans) who have no idea that the other world exists. In it dwell Shadowhunters, whose main purpose is to fight and vanquish demons. Also present are vampires, werewolves, warlocks and other \\"Downworlders\\" (all part-demon) who live in an uneasy truce with the Shadowhunters. The story centers on Clary, a 15-year-old girl who catches a glimpse of the Shadowhunters' world when she encounters three of them pursuing a demon and realizes that no one else can see them. Shortly thereafter, Clary's mother disappears and Clary is plunged into the world of the Shadowhunters and realizes that what she knows of her past may not, in fact, be true. Her quest to find and rescue her mother becomes a quest to learn about her past and herself. The story is engrossing and fast-moving and the characters are interesting and likeable. Fans of the fantasy genre will love this book.

B0040IAZVM|5.0|These comments are less a proper review than a listing in full of this wonderful set's contents (the audition samples list only the pieces performed, not the names of collaborating conductors and orchestras; perhaps someone else will be kind enough to transcribe the recording dates). Not every performance is great, of course, but many are darn close to it, and none is poor. The level of Haskil's playing is high throughout.<br /><br />Among my especial favorites are the Mozart D minor concerto with Fricsay, the Kinderszenen, the second Waldszenen (CD 10; actually, all the solo Schumann is splendid, though to my taste she just misses communicating the profound weirdness of Vogel als Prophet), and all of CD 5. This last has a sparkling but tender performance of the seldom-recorded K. 415, a K. 466 that is a bit slower than the Fricsay-led performance but is none the worse for that, and a Nights in the Gardens of Spain in whose first movement Haskil and Markevitch find a vein of mystery that eludes even its otherwise greatest interpreter, de Larrocha, and her collaborators.<br /><br />Both performances of the Beethoven C minor are taut and exciting, but the one conducted by Markevitch has an extra degree of insight (he and Haskil were obviously in artistic sympathy). Both pairs of opus 31 sonatas also have terrific esprit (one thinks of Schnabel, especially in the brio of the finale of no. 3). I can't choose between them, though the brightness of the later recordings is hard to resist (indeed, it grabs you by the throat). The highly regarded performances of the Beethoven violin sonatas with Grumiaux have never sounded so good. I may be kidding myself, but I hear an improvement in the balance between the instruments. All earlier releases, going back to the imported Philips stereo LPs, made the piano sound as if it were in the next room. Perhaps it was.<br /><br />The Scarlatti sonatas are edgy and brilliant; Ralph Kirkpatrick played them similarly. Her way with the Ravelsonatine is reminiscent of Gieseking's in that she too, understanding that the surface glitter is a trap for the unwary, mines the music's true gold--its tenderness.<br /><br />Enough said, though I have only scratched the surface. If you admire this pianist and have the cash, this edition is a not-to-be-missed event.<br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The first comprehensive edition containing all of Clara Haskil's recordings for the Decca, Philips, Deutsche Grammophon, and Westminster labels, this 17-CD set was released to mark the 50th anniversary (December 6, 1960) of the death of the Romanian-born pianist.

141694737X|5.0|A great book for Baby.    Simple and cute pictures and catchy phrasing.  Not busy, to the point, yet intelligent.  Nice thick durable pages.  Interactive and fun for baby to lift the flaps while still remaining a real book.  Enough repetition to make it somewhat predictable yet the book still creates an air of suspense.  Gives a feeling of satisfaction at the culmination.      Excellent.      I wish more of Campbell's books were easily gotten in the US.  This was actually a gift from Baby's aunt in from the UK.
B002N9MK8G|4.0|Great remastered music from the old days at the Sands. Some dialogue between Frank and the audience, maybe a little boring.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|alright move for some of us that seem errol flynn years ago i think that that was a better movie,for what of robin hood that they should it was good
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is the best family movie I've seen since Toy Story. This movie trumps all other films in its genre. Its enjoyable for all audiences; entertaining from start to finish for all ages. The humor touches everyone's and sequences through out the film pay homage to classics like Star Wars and Apollo 13. The visual presentation is stunning and the audio is fantastic. The extras are worth while too, unlike most other film extras which aren't entertaining. This package is well worth the price as its packed with great content.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|One of the best albums of 2002 and of the first decade of the millennium. It is definitely deserving of the eight Grammys it won that night. From her the title track to \\"Don't Know Why\\" to the sensual \\"Turn me on\\", Norah Jones knows how to draw in the listener for the entire album. Sure, the music is simple, but it's soothing and it's something you will want to listen to over and over again. I highly recommend purchasing this album.
B003YUC9JI|2.0|We were supposed to get a Blu Ray + DVD with this order, but all we got was the Blu Ray. The movie arrived on time, but just disappointing that we did not get what we ordered.

B0049D1TCM|5.0|This was one of the main Christmas gifts that my daughter asked for and she loves it.  Thanks for making it easy to purchase.
0307474712|3.0|Structurally, this novel is a cross between When Harry Met Sally (and even self-references), Groundhog Day, and the Molly part of Ulysses by James Joyce. It falls back on tried and true literary devices of other greats. It was well executed (not easy to do) but not very original. Oh yea, I cried a lot in some parts. So a fair warning to women on PMS. Not a good book to read when on PMS.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|We watched this during broadcast on HBO, but our son didn't have HBO, and he is a huge fan of WWII productions.  He loves this set!  He keeps it right next to his DVD set of \\"Band Of Brothers\\".

0062064304|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo294YS8BLHEIOZ]]Weta Workshop is a brand that's synonymous with quality creative work. The Art of District 9 is another testament to the amazing work they do, on top of what they have already done - Avatar, Lord of the Rings, King Kong and Narnia.    The Art of District 9 is a 160-page hardcover. This book actually cost a few dollars less than typical art books of this size. This is a fantastic bargain.    The book is filled with concept art. Most of the things you see are in their various stages of development, from the idea to the final designs. There are lots of iterations for character designs, the aliens, props, weapons, the mothership and many other stuff. All the visuals in the book are in high resolution with great detail.    What you see in the film is actually a small part of what's presented in the book. You can see a discarded concepts like crazy Organ Retriever which can harvest organs at the press of a button (I suppose), and then there's the variation of the exo suit which was designed to the stage where a life-size model was created and then dropped - I can't even begin to imagine how it feels like to have work at that stage of completion thrown out. And there are a few impressive mothership designs which weren't used as well.    Other than the illustrated art, there are also lots of pictures on the sculpts created. What impresses me are the weapon designs. They look really good, and they are printed really big, and there are lots of them.    Lead conceptual designer Greg Broadmore, creature designer David Meng, Neill Blomkamp and other artists provide good insight into the conceptualization process with their commentary.    This is one of the better art books for 2010.    Highly recommended.    (There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B00006JDVV|4.0|A classic sci-fi/fantasy film. Dragons are a time honored tool of the fantasy world and though the concept may be a little unbelievable the movie is enjoyable, at points amusing, and has all the core sci-fi pillars needed for a good film.
141041678X|4.0|I've been reading through the Percy Jackson series with my kids as their bedtime reading for the last year+. There have been times where I've wanted to skip ahead but I've forced myself to let myself be surprised/anxious/excited right along with them. As we read the Last Olympian, it became even harder for me to not read ahead.     Speaking of personal difficulties, I had a hard time deciding how to review this book...I debated whether to stay \\"high level\\" and talk in generalities or to dig deep and reveal potential spoilers. I finally decided to stay kind of high level since I think it's more fun to stumble on the revelations through reading rather than through a review. Don't let the high level review make you think this book was missing the detail and depth of the previous novels. In some ways the plot was a little less complex than previous books...but in other ways it was a little more engaging.    The Percy Jackson series spanned 5 books. In each of the previous books we were given a single stand-alone adventure that Percy and his friends had to take on. In the background of each book, there were always a couple of parallel storylines going on which were intriguing and fun to follow. Behind all of the books, there was the story of a \\"Great Prophecy\\" that basically suggested that Percy, on his 16th birthday, would be part of a decision that would make or break the existence of Olympus and the Gods. In the Last Olympian, we're thrown neck deep into the war that's at the crux of the Great Prophecy.    Right from the onset of the book, we are thrown into some serious action and tension alongside Percy. The immediate danger, disaster and intrigue sets adrenaline and emotion at high levels early on. And for most of the book, the story doesn't let down on that intensity. There are moments of \\"downtime\\" where the characters are talking about the situation, investigating leads, or planning for future battles, but the large majority of this final book is action, Action,ACTION.    In addition to the main battle and the unraveling of the Great Prophecy a number of other loose threads and subplots are resolved over the course of this book. Some interesting new revelations are given that shed light on previous 'back burner' topics. There's also an interesting resolution to the potential \\"love triangle\\" that's been created through the last couple of books in the series.    I really enjoyed the fast paced almost non-stop-action ride in this conclusion to the series. As in many conclusions, the final wrap up to me felt a little anti-climactic and even a little forced in some points. But generally I was very pleased with the way this series wrapped itself up and I really enjoyed the overall story and the tension of the conclusion.    If you're just starting into the world of Percy Jackson and you're enjoying it at all, I definitely recommend you push through and read the entire series. The reading level and general content stays at the same level throughout the series which is a good advantage in a kid's series since you don't have to wait for the kids to mature before going on to future books. The final book does take on Percy's adolescence a little bit with peripheral references to romance but nothing over-the-top or off-putting to young readers.    Overall, I really enjoyed the series. It's not without its flaws, but it's definitely a lot of fun. We've already jumped headlong into the next Riordan book in the Olympian world....The Lost Hero....and I'm looking forward to seeing how Percy and friends have evolved.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|\\"Theory\\" is currently the reigning champ of comedy. \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" meets \\"Two and a Half Men\\", this series is just fun to watch.<br /><br />My overall satisfaction with this purchase was only slightly tarnished by the fact that my copy arrived without the DVD insert/booklet. Although this item was listed as \\"brand new\\" I seriously question this since all brand new copies of \\"Big Bang\\" DVD sets include this insert. However, considering I only paid $12 for this set, I accepted the missing insert as the price I paid for, well... the price I paid.<br /><br />Mail order customers would be wise to keep this story in mind the next time you find a deal on Amazon that seems too good to be true. I know I will.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I started watching on TV for violence and sex, then I got hooked.  All the episodes are never boring and tells a darn good tale with really good characterization.  acting is also top notch.  Andy Whitfield is especially great as Spartacus.  This is a must-see series.
B003Y8YXFS|5.0|Imagine is one of my favorite albums not only by John Lennon but by any artist. In my opinion, Imagine is John Lennon's best album and extremely progressive. Whether you are a fan of the Beatles or just love music, Imagine will be a wonderful addition to everyones collection of mucic albums.Recently, the world mourned the 30th anniversary of the passingor assasination of this great artist. Everyone will enjoy the sound of this great collection of songs
0385508417|4.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this quick read \\"holiday\\" story.  We laughed on each page, and plan to read it each Christmas.  We all need an escape during the hustle bustle that time of year brings. The price we paid was UNBELIEVABLY inexpensive as well.  Thumbs up definitely.
1416585710|4.0|I have been a Constant Reader of Kings work since I was in middle school. I liked Lisey's Story and the strong female lead character.  I just want to caution a would-be new reader to Kings work by not letting Lisey's Story to be your entrance. The Stand, It, and Dolores Claiborne would be great suggestions for the first time read.  Lisey's Story takes persistance to read and to sometimes understand.  I enjoyed it because it challenged me to think outside the norm, even for a SK book. I believe if a person who was interested in Kings work were to read Lisey's Story as their first SK read, they would be confused and hard-pressed to understand the beauty of this story, thus perhaps turning themselves off to future King novels.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I could barely put my kindle down while reading this book. It was very engrossing. While any book about zombies is going to be hard to connect to the real world there were many parts of this book where I was like damn that could really happen that way. Very well thought out. Anyone who likes zombies or fantasy apocolypse will really enjoy this book. No only is it a great read it really gets your imagination going.
B0042MEQVG|1.0|The first DVD stopped playing at about 30 minutes into the movie. Was told to send it back at Amazons expense. The replacement DVD, which arrived quickly also stopped too early. Again, I was told to return the second DVD, then purchase one elsewhere. I did. It works perfectly.   A little put off about being told to buy one elsewhere as I live in a rural area and this was inconvenient.  The movie itself was very enjoyable.
B003O2RQKS|3.0|Video quality is of course fine, but for my taste too many cuts. Another director that got his training at MTV. Each take on average 3 seconds, with shorter takes in the beginning and longer takes towards the end. He learnt a bit or got tired himself. Overhead shots were not good enough but needed to spin, too. Your taste may differ.  I listened to the surround track of the concert (5.1 DTS-HD) and it is not that great, either. Little use of the side channels and the piano sounds not as full as it does on other recordings I have.  Normally, I don't watch the bonus program (here excerpts of the same pieces played in the Berghain club, but recorded in 3-D for a future release, sound is 5.0 DTS-HD), but someone had  mentioned the different acoustics, so I checked it out. Low and behold, that sound is much better.   I don't think it's the acoustic of the room, but the microphones and the placement. In the concert, there are 4 microphones, 2 at the narrow end of the piano (which I believe don't do much for the sound) and 2 in front, very close to the piano, about piano high. In the club, there are 3 different microphones in front of the piano, about 3 feet apart from each other and about 15 feet away from the piano. Different audio technicians/directors too.  So this disc turns out to be an example of how different the sound can be based on who does it and how it is done (good or not so good). The Berghain guys did a better job and the bonus material sounds better than the concert.   \\"Jundi Li in Baden-Baden\\" sounds in concert just as good as Lang Lang in the club, DTS 5.1  The Verbier Festival Piano Extravaganza is much better recorded as far as surround sound is concerned.  So Lang Lang 5 stars, audio 3 stars
0446604844|5.0|It has been a long time since I read a book that I didn't want to put down.  This was one of the few.  It starts off with a bang when a commercial jetliner is sabotaged and crashes.  The twists and turns of the story can be a little difficult - make sure you keep track of the characters and who they are.  The plot became more outlandish the longer the story continued, but it still made for an excellent read.  I'll definitely read more of Baldacci's books.
B0044KU7KU|4.0|Unlike The Black Parade, MCR's previous release, this is not a concept album. But Danger Days has a theme and a thread of continuity through each of the songs. Although I love The Black Parade I believe this is possibly a better compilation of songs. There really isn't a single throw away track. There are at least two and possibly four or five tracks that could be commercial hits, though I doubt the band was focused on making hit songs. I have played this album straight through several times. I think that is the best and perhaps only way to fully appreciate it as the work of art it truly is. As MCR keeps making and better albums, I guess I'll keep buying and listening. This is a definite buy. Even if you aren't  an avid MCR fan you'll enjoy this one.
0060936223|5.0|,...do not walk, to buy this memoir.  I'm a little young to have known about the entire emergence of punk scene in New York, but have been a longtime fan of Patti Smith (and many of those featured in the book - Robert, Sam Shepard, Blue Oyster Cult, John Cale, Lou Reed, etc.).     I was absolutely blown away by the honesty, the love, the romance, the poetry, the clean, crisp truth of Patti's story with Robert. Both celebratory and heartbreakingly sad, it's a winner.  I felt like I was in the room with her and Robert. The writing is lyrical, magical and yet, gentle and clean.  I laughed, I cried, I marveled at her command of the English language and the breadth of her cultural touchstones and knowledge.  This was, by far, my favorite book of the year (read it last few days of December) and it's SO deserving of all of the accolades.  I devoured it like a starving person.  Brava, Ms. Smith!  What a gorgeous tribute to Robert - and to you.  And to New York.
B002ZG980U|5.0|As a long-time film fan who has been critically watching films for some 60 years I would include this one in any list of the top 100 films ever made.  After watching and thoroughly enjoying it I came to this conclusion: The film mounts so many serious and deep challenges to one's mental capabilities to constantly follow and understand what is happening that it is really like a visual IQ test.  Those who do not like it and do not \\"get\\" it simply do not have the intelligence and quickness of mind to appreciate the film's complexity, creativity and convoluted story.  If you give it five stars then you have a high IQ; be proud.  Those giving it three or less stars simply do not have the brain power to love it.  I can't wait to see it again and again.

1579125549|4.0|I bought this book thinking I could take it with me to campus and solve some problems while waiting between classes. Its not clear from the picture, however, that the book is rather large, perhaps the size of a dictionary. So while it contains a lot of problems, which I've found to be good so far, its a book that you keep on a nightstand as opposed as to taking it with you.<br /><br />EDIT: Yes I know that this is mentioned in the product description. I'm just emphasizing it, that's all.

1400052173|5.0|The best feature of this book: people like Henrietta Lacks and her family do not often get their stories told, nor told so well. Rebecca Skloot allows them a space to tell their stories, and she gets out of their way when necessary.  The writing itself is succinct and informative, the story is presented in an intelligent fashion, and there is nothing to fault in the persistence and patience of the writer in her research. Skloot comes across as warm, personable, and a very capable writer. The story itself, of Henrietta Lacks's life, the travails of her family, and Skloot's research, is fascinating. The praise for this book is deserved; please read it if you have the time.
1442337966|5.0|I purchased The Power CD set recently.  My husband & I have listened to it more than once and feel it is absolutely outstanding!  The message and delivery by Rhonda, is very inspiring.  You can't help but get your spirits lifted when listening to this -- and that feeling lasts; which allows you to carry out your day on a positive note!  Rhonda gives excellent advice that you don't hear very often --this makes this CD set that much more powerful.  We like listening to it in the car to make the best use of our travel time.  Thank you Rhonda, once again, for producing such an inspiring and effect product that changes people's lives for the better!
031603438X|5.0|This has been a very pleasant surprise. I am a Stones fan (particularly `68 -`74 - The Mick Taylor Years) but I never would have bought this for myself. Who wants to slog through 500 pages of semi-literate, semi-lucid ramblings. A friend gave the book to me for my birthday and I was starting a period of heavy travel so I dove right in.<br /><br />Keith (and his ghost writer - thank god) do a great job discussing his childhood and upbringing, which unlike a lot of autobiographies really reveals what shaped him and where he came from. There's a terrific long description of Keith, Brian and Mick living in a squalid flat and using food money to pay for heat and obscure blues records. All of their time was spent going over and over and over the recordings and figuring out how to play them.<br /><br />Nice description of Ian Stewart bringing the band together and the early Stones years. At this point, I noticed by the page count that I was a third of the way through the book and we had only reached 1965. Now, Keith claims to remember everything. I suspect that a more accurate take is that - Keef very much remembers - everything that Keef very much remembers.<br /><br />Good, in-depth discussions on how their music evolved in the seventies - their peak years. Keith even reveals how his unique guitar sound came into being (sorry pickers - you'll have to read the book). Of course, there are tales of many misadventures as well as the day to day tedium of drug addiction.<br /><br />The book ramps down in the eighties and beyond - much like their music, eventually leading to the Glimmer Twin Wars. I was falling down laughing at the thought of the band referring to Mick Jagger as \\"Brenda\\" right in front of him without him being any the wiser. This apparently went on for MONTHS. \\"That Brenda is SUCH a B!#@?!\\" Ha ha ha.
B0016PM722|5.0|Bought this for my son for Christmas this year, he loves it.I originally bought the non-detachable blade, which was nice but this one with the detachable blade is more versatile.When I first ordered the lightsaber I thought they were all detachable, when we found out it wasn't I immediately went on Amazon and found out the one with a detachable blade was cheaper.Returning the original wasn't a problem although I haven't been reimbursed yet,but it's only been a week.We're going to Comic Con this year so if he wants to dress up like Luke Skywalker, he's all set.Great product thinking of buying Dart Vader's now.Only problem with this product is that it didn't exist 32 years ago when I was 11, I would have been the coolest kid on the block!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout, you can TOTALLY miss a gym day and put in FULL EFFORT and feel amazing results.  I am only on level 1 and definately will continue this DVD until I have reached/topped all the levels.  I use this every other day when I am not in spinning class and is a very intense cardio/muscle/ab workout in a condensed timeframe.  Is very doable for working moms who have timestraints.  If you are not sweating and feeling the workout, either you are not trying, or you need to seriously increase your handweights.  I use 4# & 6# and they are MORE than adequate!
B00000IUT7|5.0|My kids love this train.  It has lights and sounds, both in forward and reverse.  It definitely adds to the fun, instead of only pulling the train along the track yourself.  Couldn't find it in ANY stores . . . ended up getting on Amazon.  It was to replace the exact same one we had bought at Zany Brainy many years ago.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|** spoiler alert **<br />****SPOILERS******<br />****SPOILERS******<br />****SPOILERS******<br />****SPOILERS******<br />****SPOILERS******<br /><br />I have read Jodi Picoult books before. But this one had me reading it at every chance I could get. I was emotionally attached to these characters and their lives.<br /><br />This book is centered around 2 teens, Chris and Emily, who have a suicide pact. But as the book begins, we find Chris alive and Emily is dead. Throuhout the book we keep learning little things until we get the truth of what had happened to Emily.<br /><br />No one wants to believe that Emily would kill herself, so Chris is charged with first degree murder. He spends nearly a year in jail waiting for his trial, and greiving his girlfriend. What would make her so sad that she would want to kill herself? Then we find out that Emily was 11 weeks pregnant with Chris's baby. His emotions were very real, his sadness and then his anger. Emily could not see herself living up to the standards that were set by Chris and her parents. I was so sad that she could not see a way out, that she couldn't tell Chris about the baby.<br /><br />I felt that the emotions that the parents had were very real also. The parents of Chris and Emily went from being best friends to enemies overnight. I was sad that the mothers could not be friends again.<br /><br />In the end, Chris confesses that he shot Emily and killed her. He said that is what she wanted. Chris knew that Emily wanted to kill herself, and yet he promised her that he would not tell anyone. I was very upset by this. He could have saved her. Instead he loaded the gun and pulled the triger.<br /><br />I was also upset that Chris was found NOT guilty! He confessed in a courtroom of people that he shot Emily! I don't think he should have gotten away with it.<br /><br />But I guess that is what makes a good story. This book grabbed my emotions and was a real page turner. It was a good read, but I won't ever read it again.
0385523912|5.0|I bought this book for myself and enjoyed it so much I ordered a copy for my mom.  It gives a good prospective into a country that so often we know little about.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in North Korea or the struggles people go through in other countries and how they survive.

044654146X|3.0|I found this book interesting and filled with interesting data about countries in general.  Its quite amazing what the state of Israel has achieved in its short life, barely half a century old and its today, one of the most innovative countries in the world.  Its also quite remarkable how many of the Israeli companies have taken advantage of the expertise that Israeli citizens acquired in during their military training   However I expected a slightly more balanced book, for one thing, the authors seem a little too much of a fan of the State of Israel.  The reason is that even do the book does present accurate and truthful accounts of events, I believe it fails to put them adequately into context, since some of the events  portrayed as examples of Israeli achievement, could have taken place in many countries in the world.  For example the author tells about a factory that meet its delivery deadlines in spite that the area close to the plant was being bombed during the Gulf War, well those things are not unheard of in other states that have been at war and keep production going.  Chapter 11 tells about how the \\"Betrayal\\" from France forced them to be innovative,   that has been also true of other relatively isolated countries, after all there's the old saying necessity is the mother of invention.    And lastly the book seems to underestimate the enormous impact that U.S financial, technological & military assistance has contributed to Israel's success.    This is not to take away, the due credit that the State of Israel and its people have earned thru their achievements & hard work, since its quite impressive, but I found the lack on context unfortunate & potentially misleading.  But still, I guess its a good start for someone interested in the subject.
B002ZG98CS|1.0|I read the good review and watched it.  I didn't bother watching the whole movie.  The action scenes were subpar..done like a cheap scifi movie.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I LOVE THIS BAG! I have been using it for about a month now and have found nothing to note as a fault. It has oodles of room, plenty of great compartments for storing anything you can think of, is well padded and made very well. The straps are padded nicely and sit well on the shoulders. I have my camera, 4 lenses and flash in the main compartment at the back and there is still extra room. The only thing I could think of is if you wanted to fit a note book in this bag that there is no dedicated spot, but you might just get a small on in there.  No complaints at all from me, this is a great value bag for the low price.
B000FC1BZG|4.0|The story is wonderful. A could not put it down.<br /><br />The only negative is the occasional typos (used \\"-----shire\\" a lot) and used only one letter initial for names in some areas.  Annoying but it was free.
0812974611|3.0|There's a lot of potential in this story but it falls flat.  I'm a big time enthusiast of Ancient Rome but after some 80 pages or so I found myself being challenged to continue.  The main problem seems to be that the suspense level isn't cracked up enough and most of the characters aren't compelling enough.  Pliny was the most compelling character.  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PACING: C; HISTORICAL CONTENT: B ; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN READ: December to January 2011.
B000007NYS|5.0|I can't possibly improve upon the many previous reviews here, which articulate this album's - and this artist's - attributes quite thoroughly. I'll just say this: BUY IT. I'd say this if it was only for \\"The Night's Too Long\\", but the whole Goddamn beautiful shebang rewards repeated listening. For whatever this is worth, I love disco, punk, and soul music, yet this woman is one of my favorite artists EVER.
1416972242|4.0|This one was so much better than the 1st book. It takes you deeper into this colorful frightning world. Ms. Clare certainly did not disappoint with keeping the flow and keeping u intrigued by this world. She causes u to grow even more invested in these teens, causing u to care more deeply for not only them, but their plight.<br /><br />She did kinda weird me out with whole Jace and Clary thing but at the same time I found myself completely undertsanding and feeling heartbroken for them. It's weird, uncomfortable, and you can't not want to know what will happen with these two. Their father, the inquisitor, and even Maryse got on my ever loving nerves! But they kept it interesting and on the edge of my seat so I forgive them. LOL I just starting the 3rd book now. These books will definitely draw you in there is no doubt about that. This 2nd book was a great follow up to the 1st, and from the way the 3rd has started out, I only hope that it will be even better. I highly recommend this series
B0015DROBO|4.0|I felt that the book was excellent.  The only problem that I had was that I saw it after the movie so the book was not as exciting as I would have expected.
B0017VG69U|5.0|My family was very happy to add Season Two to their collection this Christmas.  The episodes look wonderful digitally remastered.
B0042816YK|5.0|I am sad to see such negative \\"catty\\" reviews posted. It seems that most reviewers just don't \\"get it\\" and thus were not truly open to the message of the film. Yes, Liz is successful, beautiful, seems to have everything, made her choices...as we all have and do. I do not know what to say to convey the frustration I feel with a society who largely fails to see humanity and truth over the superficial and greed. This film is a HUGE message to all of us who are crabby (and as a result claim to call a judgement, \\"review\\"), unsatisfied, confused, lost, frustrated, who continue to do the same things and expect different results...etc, etc, etc. Liz Gilbert's experience is a shared and universal one regardless of one's background or current worldly status. The film if you pay attention to the woman instead of the things around her, is inspirational in many ways. I am not rich in material goods, I've never had the privilege of owning a home in this country, and currently I do not have my health, but I know what it's like to work like crazy for empty and meaningless dreams to discover something more...search for growth. I applaud Liz's courage, abandonment of all she knew...step by step...to travel another road less traveled only to discover she was the love she was looking for all along. If only we all had such courage and optimism and fortitude, we'd be a much more kinder and compassionate society and world.

For an affordable price i have a new audio system in my car that plays new formats music and looks very good. Thank you SATECHI
0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski is a story within a story within a story, but far more complex than that. It may give you nightmares, make you cry, totally un-impress you, or scare the you know what out of you. It will change your life.    A quick summary of the novel: The Navidson family moves into a house. The father, a photojournalist, takes video of their move into a new location. The video quickly turns into a documentary about the house's supernatural qualities. Zampano, the blind recluse, finds the documentary and starts to write a book about it. Truant, the junkie, finds Zampano's book and makes his own notes.     So, there you have the story within a story within a story. Along the way, you'll find that the word \\"House\\" is always written in blue text (if you get the color version of the book), which is the least of the creativity involving typeset. Some pages are written upside down and backwards, while others may contain a single word, or perhaps no words at all. I can guarantee you've never read a novel quite like this one.    I recommend this novel to everyone. Not everyone will like it. In fact, most people won't get through it. Some will think it's brilliant; some will think it's a waste of paper. Regardless of which, it will change their lives and their way of thinking, at least for a little while.    The thing about House of Leaves is that it's not an extraordinary novel at first glance. It appears to be an attempt at avant-garde style. It's a story inside of a story inside of a story that often doesn't make sense. It's filled with unreliable narrators (the drug addict, the blind recluse, and the madly obsessive photo-journalist), endless footnotes, lengthy descriptions and visual tricks. It appears to be an author trying way too hard to do something new.    But it gets under your skin. It scares you when you least expect it. It takes your world and tilts it just a few degrees off-center, just enough to give you an odd disoriented view of the world around you.    After finishing the novel, I wanted to run and hide. Seriously, though, I was relieved when it was done. This was not an easy read. It took me several months, and I had to take breaks from it.    House of Leaves left me feeling disoriented and disconnected. I'm writing this book review one year after starting the novel. Two weeks ago, I had another nightmare about the House. This is probably the most difficult book review I've ever had to write, but I need to write it. This book changed my life, and though I want to share it with others, my review comes with a warning. Odds are, it will change your life, too, and you might not like it.    People equate this novel with the film, The Blair Witch Project, and I've found that the reactions to the novel are similar to those of the film. Either you think it is totally new and it gives you the creeps, or you think it's the dumbest thing you've experienced in your life. For me, House of Leaves is one of the scariest books I've ever read. I've had two nightmares in the year since I started reading it, and I expect to have more.    I found this novel through a message thread on a forum. The title was \\"Books that changed your life.\\" I added it to my ever-growing list of books to read someday, and quickly forgot about it. Then a local bookstore was going out of business, and this happened to be sitting on the shelf of discounted novels. It felt like the book found me when I was least expecting it. And that's really, really scary.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I absolutely love WWII shows.  This did not let me down, other than the fact I found Band of Brothers to be better.  But don't let that take anything away from this miniseries, it was very good.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan not only directs but writes this dramatic thriller.  I know that's obvious but sometimes it's hard for my brain to grasp that.  The same person who wrote the incredibly original script is the same one who directed and created the incredibly unprecedented images.  The whole movie is full proof.  Every detail accounted for and no loose gaps.  It's beautifully written and directed and believe it or not Nolan found a way to top himself!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|For all the people out there who don't know every Beatles song there is and don't want to, this is a really great CD. It has a great selection of songs that are some of their most famous and well liked songs. It's got a little bit of everything from their long list of songs and has plenty of the songs that people give you funny looks for not knowing. I highly recommend it.
B00386OWUC|5.0|I saw this movie after several notable critics gave it very favorable reviews. On first approach, I can't imagine a film sounding less appealing: a German film, bearing no English audio track, presented in black and white (the film was filmed in color and then had its palette desaturated), concerning the events in a rustic village circa 1914---not exactly Michael Bay material.<br /><br />The film is so anti-establishment, in fact, that some people may recoil from its possible pretentiousness; I include myself in this latter group, having been burned a time or two too often by films buried under their own aspirations of signfiicance.<br /><br />Happily, \\"The White Ribbon\\" bears no such affliction: this is a great, deeply thoughtful movie. There are many adequate discussions here about the film's plot, which I will not belabor, other then to say Michael Haneke's decision to couch his ideas in the framework of a mystery, tinged throughout by a looming sense of dread, was very wise indeed---the viewer is inevitably drawn to the film's narrator/protaganoist as he seeks to uncover the identity of those responsible for the seemingly random acts of violence that have occurred in his village.<br /><br />The less said the better. There are very profound questions being considered here: e.g. how should we balance our personal freeedoms against the communal need for well-being and security---but Haneke is too smart a film maker to offer up an easy fable; there are no simple answers. People are quick to judge the motives of the murderer; the dark nature of a people swept astray by fascism; Haneke suggests the seeds of our worst evils may be sown even in the richest of soils.
1416955070|5.0|City of Bones is set in New York City, but not as we see it--the main character Clary and her friends (who are demon hunters)can see the supernatural world of vampires, werewolves, faeries, demons, warlocks, and other creatures that normal people (mundanes) are blind to.    PLOT  The plot is fast paced for the most part with a love triangle that keeps things interesting. Near the end the reader is suddenly taken on a jerking roller coaster ride of twists. I read a lot and can usually predict twists before they arise, but not the case here. I appreciate when an author can pull off a genuine twist, and Cassandra Clare does it several times.   ***HUGE SPOILER****  One of the huge twists revealed toward the end is that Clary and Jace are siblings, and the villain Valentine is their father. Before knowing this they had been falling for each other. Sound familiar? Think Luke & Leia in Star Wars. Some readers may be annoyed by this twist, and others disappointed like I was. I really liked the romance developing between Jace & Clary and then that twist completely ruined it. I wish they had been love interests instead of siblings.   ****END SPOILER*****      CHARACTERS  I loved the characters. They felt real to me, and it's been a while since I've read a book where I can get attached to them. I even liked the minor characters like Simon, Luke, Isabelle, and Alec. The characters are real, they make mistakes, they argue, they make up, they hate, they love, they cry. Clary was a good heroine--strong but still with weaknesses and flaws. Jace was sexy, sarcastic, tortured, and badass, and will have girls swooning. He could be almost cruel at times but I suppose that's a part of his character. The villain, Valentine, was well-done. It was unnerving to read his scenes, because I couldn't tell whether or not he was lying. I hope to see more character development in the following books.       DIALOGUE  The dialogue was good and enjoyable, with lots of sarcastic, witty, humorous banter between characters. But there was one thing that bothered me--throughout the book the characters used huge words in their sarcastic banter that not even I know the meaning of and I'm a college student. And the characters are what, 15? 16? For example, Clary says, \\"When the self-congratulatory part of the evening is over, maybe we could get back to saving my best friend from being exsanguinated to death?\\" In some instances it was okay, but in this example a simpler word would have done better. It just made it feel unrealistic at times, because teenagers don't talk like that. (Not to say teenagers can't use big words, but some of the words used were a bit of a stretch)       WRITING  City of Bones is very well-written. However, a few times the descriptions didn't make sense or the prose made me wince. For example, at one point Clary is eating an apple and it's described as tasting, \\"green and cool.\\" This actually made me cringe. How can you taste a color? This could easily have been remedied with some sharper editing.      Despite the few nitpicks I have with it, I highly recommend City of Bones. It's an entertaining read and you won't want to put it down! If you're not certain check out the first from the library, and I guraentee more than likely you'll be buying the second before you've even finished the first, just like I did.
B000EULJZG|5.0|The CD's were in very good condition, and were shipped promptly. I received them before Christmas and was able to enjoy them during the Holidays. I had been wanting to see the Pilot of Medium for about a year but wasn't able to find  it anywhere. I finally found it in Amazon at a reduced price! That was my X-mas present to myself!
0061714372|3.0|I see the glowing reviews and wonder why many are giving this 5 stars. First, Dave does not go into detail about anything, including his martial arts training or the meaning of the songs. Also, are we supposed to feel sorry that he chose drugs when he had so much going for him? Oh, he found God....yay!    Decent but not great. Get the Ozzy bio.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I'm glad I fell upon this series. I've come to enjoy zombie lore, etc...but it's more about the end of man & life as we know it; the everyday stresses, impatience, etc...Now it's about survival and the unknown because we're not focusing on the brand names of things or paying bills. We're now concerned with our next meal and a safe place to lay our weary head. Will you survive or not? Can you trust the people around you, including your own loved ones? This series is based of a comic which I've not read. However, I think the characters of the show are extremely well developed, the special effects, acting, etc...are well done, and I'm often eagerly waiting to see what will happen next. I'm hoping next season will be longer, as it's often the case the first ones are short. I want to see what will happen to Rick Grimes (protagonist), his family and friends. At every turn there is possible danger, a macho rivalry for control, the need for weapons, losing loved ones, suffering, love, etc...<br /><br />Possible spoiler alert - I'm betting now the cdc doctor (at the end) whispers to him that his wife is pregnant & Rick does the dirty math.<br /><br />IF you are a fan of zombie apocalypses or post-apocalypse anything THIS is a series to watch.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|This was definitely not the highlight of the SATC story. However, it was nice to continue to keep the characters and story line going. I'm hoping for a better number 3, but who knows!
0439023513|4.0|The first book in the series was the best.  This was good, though a little wordy in parts.  You should read \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" first.  I enjoyed this book.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I'll admit it now, I am a sucker for Disney animated classics, and this is coming from a 26 year old male who refues to watch live musicals. Take it from me, Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best movies. The story is fantastic and well told, with the plot moving along at a good pace. It is also an emotional tale of love and redemption, and it is a moving story. The songs (except for one, which I will get to in a moment) are fun and catchy, and you will find yourself humming at least one of them long after the movie is over. The only downside is the added musical number, as it is not of typical Disney quality and really does nothing for the story. You will most likely notice it immediatly. Other than that, there are no complaints with the movie.    Technically, the Blu-Ray restoration is amazing. The sound is wonderful, and, as with previous Disney Blu-Ray releases, the visial transfer is stunning. It feels very much like watching for the first time.    All in all, if you enjoy Disney movies, musicals, or animation in general, you will love this movie. If those things aren't your cup of tea, the movie is still well worth the price of admission.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Alright, after reading a handful of one-star reviews, I get it...I really do.    In fact, even though I should've known better, initially even *I* had a negative reaction the first two episodes. The acting/dialog was suspect; the actors were utterly generic/unknown; the \\"battle\\" scenes were completely unrealistic, over-the-top cgi-fests; and I didn't really care about any of the characters. Especially \\"Spartacus\\"!    Like I said. I get it.    Having said that, I stuck with it because I realized two VERY important factors where hampering my ability to enjoy the series:    First and most importantly, was the fact that I allowed my expectations to be set by the initial main-stream reviews. I am greatly into \\"period\\" pieces; the less civilized the period, the better I like it, because, and I make no apologies, in addition to loving the stilted language and protocol of classed societies, I am a blood and guts kinda guy. So when the reviewers went on about the blood and violence, quite naturally, I expected realistic depictions of brutality and violence, ala \\"Gladiator\\". I also expected expensive sets and costumes, and great acting by all involved. In other words, I was expecting a 150+ million dollar, big screen production instead of an original CABLE series...And not even an HBO series at that.    So, after adjusting my expectations, and judging the series on the basis of its own merits, I realized that A. The acting improved, and characters become MUCH more interesting. B. The cgi-ifying of the violence, and it's stylized outlandishness was intentional, making it almost \\"operatic\\", and easier to stomach. The bloodletting, was literally a work of art in motion, like ballet. Yes, it borrowed from the movie 300, but I believe it took it to the next level. The sets remained low budget, but to ME, this series wasn't about the sets, or really, with the exception of maybe three or four battle scenes, not even the arena. Which brings me to the second realization.    Like a number of series deemed as low-budget and/or cheesy by those, not in the know, the beauty and magnificence of this series lies in the characters and storyline. A perfect comparison for me personally, would be the \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", and \\"Angel\\" series. My first take on both of those series (especially Buffy) was cheesy, and b-level at best. In fact, you can even add \\"Firefly\\" to the list. But today, ALL three of them rate as some of my ALL TIME favorite series, which I have re-watched in their entirety, multiple times since they went off the air. The same is true for \\"Spartacus\\". And no, these aren't cases of getting beat over the head with something you hate, until you love it. It was about giving the series enough time to understand the over-arching storyline, and to decide whether or not the characters were worth spending time with every week.    In the case of Spartacus, the characters are so vivid, that there was not a single main character that I felt apathetic towards. I had strong feelings one way or another for each of them. So much so, that I am not ashamed to admit that I actually cried when one died. After several viewings, tears STILL run down my cheeks when the character meets their end. In fact, I tear up, just thinking about it, as I write this review. And trust me, I'm a 47-year old tough guy...Well, at least I USED to be. lol.    And isn't THAT what great media, be it a painting, book, movie, or television is supposed to do?    Move us?    Come for the action, blood, and/or hot women/beefcake, but you'll stay for the characters, relationships, and the storyline.
