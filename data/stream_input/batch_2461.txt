B000OVLINI|5.0|oh wow I love a twist in the plot or a change. but the character development in this story and the twist kept me wanting to know more!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Fabulous movie; well acted, scripted and photographed with a great soundtrack. One of the best movies I've ever seen in any language. Item arrived on time & well packaged.
B000001GOZ|5.0|I have listened to about 20 versions of this piece.  Boulez' version has the best sound quality by far and I can listen to it over and over again without being bored.  The sound quality is the difference here.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a really fun game buy it now<br />But if you are still reading this than you haven't bought the awesome game yet buy it
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book offers fresh perspectives I had not stumbled upon prior to reading &#34;Lean In&#34;.  After reading it over a weekend, I went back to work the next Monday with a completely different (and more attuned) view on gender roles in the workplace.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|This was one of the first near death experience books that I read. I still go back and read it and even though I own it in hardcopy, I had to have it for my Kindle as well. Recommended for the person who is just getting into reading about near death experiences and for those who have read many. Still one of my very favorite.
B003162R7E|4.0|Who knows how the final mix would have sounded and what songs would have made the cut if Hendrix had been alive to see these songs through to their release? But what's here is enjoyable and consistent with the sound of previously released versions of many of the songs--although it's a pleasure to hear everything cleaned up and brought to life through the use of the latest digital technology. Besides the vastly improved sound, fans who were raised on the extended jams found on the live albums that flooded the market in the decade after his death will be struck by the length of the songs; only one of the songs is longer than five minutes. Despite this brevity, none of the songs feel incomplete; and, in fact, their tight structure make each individual song all the more memorable. Listeners will find melodies and hooks running around each other long after the disc is back in its sleeve. Highlights include wonderful mixes of old war horses \\"Dolly Dagger\\" and \\"Room Full of Mirrors\\" that provide clarity and reveal layers previously hidden in these multilayered gems. The only track that really sounds dated is \\"Izabella,\\" an r&b workout that doesn't quite find the funky groove that Hendrix innately finds in \\"Freedom,\\" the song that precedes it. It is nonetheless enjoyable and worthy of inclusion on the album. While the album isn't the second coming of \\"Are You Experienced?\\" it's worthy of inclusion in the Hendrix canon and will be enjoyable to young fans and oldtimers alike.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this near death experience tremendously. The descriptions were very good and I was able to imagine myself in the place this man found himself. The most interesting fact about the book: The man was a neurologist and pretty much thought death was the end. He had no deep beliefs but does now. To the author: Sincerely, thanks for sharing.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|This is a great movie, Peter Jackson is awesome. Not sure how one book becomes a trilogy but can't wait for the rest
0553386794|5.0|Actually, I haven't read it because I bought it as a gift for my son. My step-son recommended it because he loves George R.R. Martin.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My son would go nuts but I am having fun with it. He would enjoy the simplicity of it and how easy it would be to blow the mind of a six year old child who loves iron man and all marvel heroes.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I wanted to write a long, elaborate review of this album, but the five-star status speaks for itself. Twenty years later, this euphoric soundtrack fills me with the same amounts of joy, awe, and gratitude as the first day I listened to it. People have come and gone from my life, but this album - more importantly, this band - have always been a strong force. The lyrics are applied to different situations now, but the songs hold dear to my heart. In a day and age where autotune dominates the airwaves, I'm so thankful we have a precious gem like this to fall back on.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I liked this book - I feel that it is very well written.  However, I think that it is too long.  I did skip over one whole chapter when he was in prison since I had trouble continuing to read all the horrible things that happened to him there.  I also got kind of bored later with a lot of the Mafia stuff.  I had trouble keeping track of the names of some of these people.  I still have about a quarter of the book to go.  I think this book is wonderfully written and probably more suited to men.  (My husband thought it was one of the best books he's ever read - and he reads a lot).<br />How do others feel about it ??

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't usually read this type of book so I wasn't too sure if I was going to like it. I was pleasantly surprised when I couldn't put it down. I didn't want it to end, but when it did it left me wanting more. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.
B000002LRX|3.0|This is an old cd that I have been unable to find in any local cd stores. It seems most people are turning to mp3s but I still prefer to have the CD.  The music itself is great but the case was cracked and CD scratched. It's always tricky buying used CDs online.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|enjoyed the book made me proud to be an American.  It also told it like it is muslims are evil people who have no moral base, if you are not  a muslim you are infidel and should die.  He made sure a lot of them are hanging with the virgins!

B0050PYNN0|5.0|this movie is a nice movie night addition , watch it and you'll agree!! maybe not suitable for kids tho!!!!
B00005RHGK|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was sort of wondering at first what was going to happen, seemed to start off pretty slow and not that exciting.  But the suspense builds and it gets going and scares ya!  This was a great original idea that I hadn't seen done in horror films before, and I watch a LOT of horror movies.  I liked it so much decided I had to buy it!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This app works as advertized. Easy to use and easy to get music into it. A good addition to my audio.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Bloody hell. I don't think I'm ever going to forget this story and I'm immensely angry with you Jojo.<br /><br />It's all about starting the month with a good book.<br /><br />There comes a time in your life when you read something and it renders you speechless. There is no time to prepare for it, to protect your heart, to stop yourself from the wreck. There is a slight part of me that wishes that I hadn't read this, because things won't be the same after. My mind will not, of that I'm surely, forget this book. I can imagine mentioning to someone with a somber glaze in my eyes, imploding them to read it, and backing out at the last moment. Because, what I just went through I wouldn't want it on someone. And perhaps I'm being melodramatic, but I can't stop this feeling in my chest that something was taken, for this book is not at all what you expect. This isn't some Hollywood product, this is painfully realistic and if you put time into it, you get emotionally invested.<br /><br />It seems a given that there must be some kind of con in a book. The part that we all hate as reader, that being the MC that is too whiny, or the jerk of the guy that won't get it together, or the annoying family members with their callous comments. But not with this book. I found it beautifully flawless. From Lu to the different points of view. I think that by giving an insight to Katrina, Steven, Will's Mom, it all tied in fantastically. Flawless in the way that it was full of so many flaws that it made it flawless. That it portrayed real life in its epitome.<br /><br />Overall, because if you do want to embark on this journey then I can't spoil anything, then know this is a story of more than just romance. That blurb in the cover is misleading. Moreover, this story is about family, responsibility and looking for a better future, looking for a better you. And the person who brings out the best in you. The pace is both fast and steady, all warped in one. Fast in that we don't get a day by day, but steady in that things flow naturally and not like love as first sight.<br /><br />By the end of this novel, you'll want to go on a trek, go to paradise, be someone new, be everything you ever wanted to be or dreamed to be.<br /><br />As much pain as brought me in the last 15%, I'm beyond amazed at this novel and for some reason I felt like I needed to read this. This is inspiring and haven't cried that much triggered something in me-that books should make you feel like that. Heartbroken, comical, and inspired. Honestly, I would want to paste a thousand passages and quotes, because Will is the funniest, sarcastic jerk in the world, in a good way kind of way.<br /><br />The characters were all well put together, and some that weren't because, let's be honest, there are some people that are just very two-dimensional. There were times where I wanted her to break up with her dull boyfriend, but then when you have been with someone for a long time, when is it acceptable to walk away? Should you walk away?<br /><br />A beautiful, realistic book with everything that life has to offer.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We loved it in the beginning.  Lately it is one disaster after another.  Now we have 2 babies without one parent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Breathless, countless, doubtless, effortless, fearless, flawless, helpless, selfless.hopeless. I was hopeless in not falling in love with this book. It was useless, and it will be timeless. 649 words found. Six hundred and forty-nine words. All ending with -less. From those I can pick a handfuls of words to describe this book, but this book with its flaws was flawless. I wish I could comment on each word, each dialogue, each sentence, each paragraph, each chapter, but then I would just be writing it. All I can do, that being written or spoken is-to recommend it. I will never not recommend this book, because it was just beautiful.<br /><br />When I rated this book I clicked on 5 stars, which reads, \\"It was amazing.\\" But it wasn't. It was beyond amazing.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />This book entranced me from the first page. It was captivating and strong and I had to keep reading. Forget anything you might think you know about how this book will play out. I wish I could be my prior-spoiler-gal but now with this book. This book you need to feel the happy moments, the heartbreaking moments, the shocking moments, the angry moments, the intense moments, all of the moments. The plot was flawless, it was well thought out, captivating, and intense.<br /><br />The Characters<br /><br />Linden Sky is someone I could connect with. Not on the later parts of her life, because well that didn't happen to me. But on her attitude and her bluntness, and her way of thinking. There were times in which I was angry with her, but then I put myself in her shoes and well, I agree. Most of all, I thought she really matured, she changed and I'm proud of her. She is a beautiful person inside and outside. There are rare times in where I fully and wholly like the MC, but this time I thought she was butterflying badass.<br /><br />Dean Holder is someone I could forever want a forever with. He was a very complex, and entrancing character. He was the whole package. Good and bad boy. Passionate assin, and sweet as candy. And he loved life like no other. Every time he spoke, it was as if the world stopped and just listened to the beautiful words that escape his lips. The way he view life, and the way he thought was amazing. The way he loved and lived is something we all want.<br /><br />\\"I can already tell he isn't the kind of guy a girl gets a simple crush on. He's the kind of guy you fall hard for, and the thought of that terrifies me.\\"<br /><br />Six and Breckin are people who without them in this story it would have been the same. They were awesome. Simple as that.<br /><br />Karen is someone who I could take a walk with. And talk about how wonderful she is. She truly is and I appreciate her.<br /><br />The Romance<br />The romance started out intense, and I kept looking for the downfall. What did happen I didn't expect and all I can say is that it was the perfect romance for this perfect book. Mostly I loved who effortlessly their romance was, and easy-flowing it was.<br /><br />\\"Its real, Six. You cant get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. Its the fake happily ever afters that should piss you off.\\"<br /><br />The Things I Liked<br />The pinky holdings<br />The \\"I live you\\"<br />Six's texts and letters<br />Holder's ego-deflating texts<br />How long it took her to make her last decision<br /><br />The Things I Hated<br />How long it took her to make her last decision<br /><br />Additional Notes<br />I bookmarked so many pages it was almost highlighted everywhere. I want to post so many quotes, but that would be unfair to you, as a reader.<br /><br />Blogger and Reviewers, you all were good! Holding out all of your spoilers, man first time that ever happens. Thank you.<br /><br />I'm so glad this was the first book I read this year.<br /><br />P.S. Beautiful Cover<br /><br />Colleen, you did it again. Third book you made me fall in love.
B00BWHZI0C|5.0|The best rap album that's come out in a while. Don't even stop to consider buying it because it is perfect and you need it now.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|What a book, what a good looking book. What a blurb, what a name, what characters. What a good book...<br /><br />I was planning to write, \\"Why not five stars for this amazing book?\\" Mind you, I was merely half way and already loving the hell of this book, this fresh take on misfits and love in high school. I'd even written a note, \\"Is it cause I'm Chinese Korean?\\" In the voice of Park, but alas, I found my answer at the end... That end. What an end.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park was not something expected, it had such a complexity in this story about love in high school. Love between two misfits kids. See, I had this idea that they were too young to be saying certain things, somethings way mature their young age. When in reality they weren't that young. This book begs to ask, \\"Is there an age to love?\\" Not only that but it delt with far more than love, and it makes you care about the story, the love between this two amazing characters. So, yes, it was about love and it happened over the course of a year. It was split into both Eleanor's and Park's POV and it was formatted in a way that makes the story fresh and worthwile. Had it been spread out and every detail of the day written I think it would have taken from the story. There was so much going on that they way Rainbow wrote it made it unique and fresh.<br /><br />Star-crossed lovers, oh how I loathe thy word. Therefore, I looked up the word: adjective poetic/literary (of a person or a plan) thwarted by bad luck. Again,in my very overreactive imagination I always thought of star-crossed lovers are Will not end up together and if you know me then you know I hate bad ending, sad endings. I need the HEA. I do. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Meaning that I was hesitant in jumping into this story. And quite frankly this is a story of star-crossed lovers. More from Eleanor's side, but I was hoping, pleading that it would have a happy ending, they, if not Eleanor needed a happy ending. She deserved it.<br /><br />You see Eleanor had just moved back to Omaha, where her mother and siblings lived with her stepdad, Richie. She had been gone a year, though it was more like exiled thanks to the jerk of a stepdad. Life at home is the synonym of hell. Eleanor had to wear clothes that came from goodwill (that not bad, I admit), but she had to wear clothes that were in dire need of a garbage disposer/shredder, they were starved, didn't have soap, the essentials. Not to mention she needed to stay clear or Richie. Usually, when something scares us or when you are frighten who do you run to? Your mom, right? Well, Eleanor's mom sided with Richie. Sure, that was her husband. But mother would do anything for their kids..right? I mean, they wouldn't, say, send them to their best friends house for over a year, neglecting them, right? Wrong. It infuriated me to no end how her mother never stood up for Eleanor. I understand, boy do I understand that she was thinking of them all. If she were to leave Richie where would they go? How would they survive? But, that didn't make the situation right. (view spoiler)<br /><br />The characters were kind of an overwhelming relief for me. Kind of been reading about some whiny characters, you see. Well, Eleanor was fresh and everything I like. Funny, clever, witty, and when she does cry it's for more than just her dramatic love quarrels. Though, there was one miny high school fight. That had more to do with her insecurities, but she quickly got over that. She had a way of being that you couldn't help but like her. She wasn't sugary nice, and she didn't intend to change for anyone. Eleanor was the type to see the world for what it was and she knew that though Park loved her that they wouldn't last forever, but she bathed in the sun for a while. As for Park, well, he was funny too, and I loved his honesty. I loved that he never hide his feelings for her and he did have his character growth. Eleanor taught him that, to be himself. To stop caring about what people said orthought. And I found him realistic. He had his moments when he wasn't perfect, God, Thank God, for that.<br /><br />All in all, this was such a sugary sweet novel. I'm sure that when I'm down and I want some song inspiration and some worthy gushing moments, I'll whip this gem out. It was a beauty, it was what I needed.<br /><br />Now to the ending. That's the only part that left me feeling numb, and I rather feel that than sad and weepy. I'll be honest and say I'm not happy. Maybe, perhaps, most likely than not, I'm sad and a bit disappointed. Though it did leave on a hopeful note? At least I'll like to think so. Nothing was resolved though, I need an epilogue. You know I wouldn't even mind if there was a sequel of about 600 pages, because I just need to know more. I need to know about Eleanor & Park, and I hate books that have the characters name on it, but I loved this one so much I wouldn't mind. I need to know about the Douglas family, and life after and if Richie gets what he deserves. I need to know. Or maybe a short story. Okay, I'm grasping at straws here, I know.<br /><br />At one point or two Park says that she is just asking to get bullied (again, he changes), but for the sake of pointing this out for future thoughts on this. Nobody asks to get bullied, no one asks to get anything bad. The way you dress shouldn't be asking to be bullied. If Eleanor had chosen to dress as she was dresses not because she had next to no money, but for the fact she liked the bizarre trend, so be it. No one, I repeat, asks to get bullied.<br /><br />Things I liked Lived For:<br />The bus<br />The comics<br />The tapes<br />The hand holding<br />Doctor Who references<br />The love between the parents<br />DeNice & Beebi<br />'Your Eleanor'<br />`My Eleanor'<br />Park's `I Love You' moments<br />8765309

B000KKPN5C|5.0|Great value for very reasonable price.<br />Very goog results when your subject is fast moving, when you take pictures of kids or pets.<br />It is compact, does not require much of extra space in the standard Nikon bag.  When accompanied with Omni-Bounce Diffuser makes great job in taking quick shots with wide angle of view. Use overexposure setting +1.3 or more when use it with Diffuser.
B007SGM084|5.0|A great easy read. Sex scenes not as horrible as it was made to be...just erotic;-) I would definitely recommend it.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|The Good: Character-oriented packaging featuring Lannisters, Starks and Khaleesi, Blu Ray definition and clarity, fantastic histories and lore special feature, making of the Battle of the Blackwater documentary.<br /><br />The Bad: Lame trading card, pricey for what you get over just buying the episodes.<br /><br />I absolutely love the narrated animation pieces. Hands down best part of the whole product. Each piece is well executed and provides tremendous insight into the universe that extends beyond the series and into the novels. I always like the DVD combo packs, so that's another plus.<br /><br />All that aside, I want more. Nay, I need more. I want more in-depth features than Robb and Cat talking about motivations. At least it is better than the Stark kids performing their rendition of the GOT opening theme acapella. How about a bit more Peter Dinklage?? I need me some more Dinklage!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game. I want more please. It was time consuming which I love. I felt like I was the real dectective. Little pricey but totally worth it.
B000062YAZ|5.0|As a result of the recent sad passing of Jeff Hanneman I revisited Reign in Blood in tribute.<br />As a practising Christian I have always loved Reign in Blood as indeed, the Lord does Reign through the giving of his own precious blood.<br />It was all very much as I dearly remembered it, probably THE METUHL album of the 80s, nothing else came close to its brutal ferocity. I always loved how it had such a focus on the Lord, yes Jesus Saves. The themes of death and SATAN on the album are there to remind us of the redeeming grace of the Lord. I thank Slayer for focussing my faith.<br /><br />Thank you Jeff, may you rest in the bosom of the Lord.<br /><br />So do you BUY? Well yes, I mean NO, get an illegal download and give the money you have saved to the poor.

1451696191|4.0|I recently watched the film version of this book and walked away feeling a little empty. I'd read the book first and had mixed feelings about it. At times it held me with a real sense of urgency and deeply moving emotion, and it was fairly easy to \\"veg out\\" to it (just sort of get lost in it's pages without actually getting lost in the story). The main character and narrator, Charlie, is extremely likable and has a solid voice, but some of the plot points got muddy along the way: the friend who committed suicide before the book begins seemed to play a strong role in Charlie's life, but then seemed like nothing more than a footnote as the story progressed; the subplot involving the aunt didn't seem significantly developed for the ultimate impact it has on Charlie, and then it just seemed like it all got swept away at the very end; and the identity of the \\"Dear Friend\\" that Charlie is writing to is never revealed (this would have been fine if at the beginning of the book Charlie hadn't made such a big deal of \\"covering his tracks\\" to prevent this mystery person from figuring out who's writing the letters to him/her -- it just seemed like the author started with this mysterious hook, and then didn't make that hook pay off in the finale).<br /><br />But still there is much to admire in this book as well (the subplot involving Patrick, Charlie's gay best friend, the relationship with the teacher who gives Charlie great books to read, the story of Charlie's sister and her boyfriend), and it does move along at a steady pace. I liked the book better than the movie, but I feel the movie got it right removing the cigarette smoking (which is the worst crime ever propagated against kids, period) and the overt drug use, which in the book are almost played as therapeutic remedies for what ails Charlie. I'm not being a prude on this. I have no problem with books with teens using drugs, as long as those books accurately depict the effects of drugs and not make it seem like, \\"Hey kids, if you're messed up, just do drugs and life will get better!\\" I like the way the movie portrays Patrick and Sam as slightly more responsible older kids -- they don't get him hooked on cigarettes and they don't get him involved in drugs (and when he gets slipped the hash brownies at a party, Sam helps him come down easy).<br /><br />Though I still have mixed feelings on this book, as well as its movie adaptation, I feel there's enough worth while in each to recommend them both.

B006IYFCIM|4.0|I have always enjoyed Dan Ariely.  This does change your paradigm about &#34;honesty&#34; and makes you take a more appropriate look at your own thoughts and actions.  It reviews many of the studies he has done, coming to similar conclusions about dishonesty and how we can challenge it.  The fact that at times insurance companies, bankers, and the government would just as soon not confront dishonesty is concerning,  but the fact that we as individuals may not tell ourselves the truth is frightening.  It is worth the purchase

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|..I quickly became a fan because the casting as well as the performances by each castmember, from the smallest part to the leading roles, were magnificent!  I seldom partake in series like this because it is sometimes difficult for me to follow them.  But all in my circle were so enraptured, I gave it a try and was immediately hooked!!  I can hardly wait until Season 4!!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Aside from Blue Duck's (Frederic Forest) obvious fake Native American nose I love every single solitary part of this miniseries, just a great epic adventure in the old west. If I were stranded on a desert Island (that was furnished with a TV and Blu Ray player of course) and could only bring one film it would be this one as it has it all, humor, action & adventure, drama even romance. And Robert Duvall as fantastic an actor as there has ever been was born to play one Augustus McCray, a character everyone will fall in love with, a mans man and a lady's man all rolled up into one. Also perhaps the best All Star cast ever put together.

030758836X|1.0|Mind-numbingly bad. The plot is absurd and the characters never feel like anything more than over-simplified cardboard cut-outs designed to move a story forward. I keep hearing this novel described as a page turner, but I struggled to maintain any interest in the characters or their ridiculous struggles. Worse, the book seems rooted in a pervasive misogyny. Women are at the root of all evil here--and \\"strong women,\\" as the book defines them, are worst of all. (Note: Flynn's definition of strong women varies significantly from my own. You'll know the ones Flynn considers to be \\"strong\\" by the cloud of feminine curse words surrounding them as well as their \\"vaguely vaginal smell.\\" Ugh.)
B009NY43NY|3.0|After seeing all of the one-star reviews on this site and Goodreads I expected this to be one of the worst books I've ever read. It's not. It's not the best of the Sookie Stackhouse series but it's not any worse than the others.<br /><br />I would expect that everyone who has read the first twelve books to have already come to terms with the fact this these books are NOT literature. No one is ever going to be assigned a Charlaine Harris book to read in high school, ok? All of the books have serious inconsistencies, plot lines that don't make sense at all or go nowhere, characters that act out of characters, characters that show up for no particular reason and characters that are poorly drawn. Sookie cooks, visits friends, goes to work, runs errands, cleans her house and tans. That's Sookie.<br /><br />Yes, the book starts out slowly, but not any slower than any other book in this series. Yes, the author trots out basically every character in every other book who is still \\"living\\" so to speak. That's not that strange for a final book. Yes, it's cheesy but it's not any cheesier than any of the books in this series. Although Sookie does say \\"dammit\\" one time in this book that doesn't make me feel she's \\"not acting like Sookie\\" as so many other reviewers stated. You get my point by now, I hope. This is a Sookie Stackhouse novel, people; it's not effing Steinbeck. If you're suddenly expecting, after twelve previous books, for this book to be a well-executed work of literature then you're delusional.<br /><br />Here's what I think is going on in the one-star reviews- Sookie does not end up in a romantic relationship with the man that these reviewers want her to be with and that makes them angry. Suddenly they see all the flaws they apparently never noticed in the first twelve books because they didn't get the ending they wanted. From my perspective the ending worked just fine. It was in Sookie's character all along to make this decision and I don't feel cheated or rippedoff in any way. Frankly, I saw it coming a mile away.<br /><br />In conclusion... if you are expecting this to be a great American novel you are way off base. If you are not able to accept Sookie choosing to be with any one of the multitude of men she has dated over this series then you will most likely be disappointed. If, like me, you keep reading these books because they are a ridiculous, lowbrow pleasure then you're probably going to like this final book just fine.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Can criminality be inherited?  This murder story revolves around a couple with one adolescent boy.  The father's family includes a number of violent men, but the father is totally different, a soft-spoken, loving husband and a lawyer. His son, Jacob, is accused of murder, and little by little, as his trial progresses, we learn more about him.  One of the more interesting parts of the book is the father's quest to prove Jacob's innocence.  The couple struggles in their relationship as the details of the case unravel.  No more..you must read the book if you want to know what happens!
B000B8L6LI|4.0|Very nice sharpening system. The base can be a little hard to hold if you are going to be using it for a long time, like when I first got it and went through the house sharpening everything I owned. But for a single blade it is not that bad.
B009XEE0DW|5.0|After having been a bit disenchanted with Ms. Farmer's previous release, I was wondering if there would be any improvement with &#34;Monkey Me&#34;. I liked most of the tracks after a first listen but it has now been on repeat in my car CD player for almost 4 weeks. It now rates as on of my favorite Mylene Farmer albums. &#34;Monkey Me&#34; and &#34;Tu Ne Le Dis Pas&#34; are my favorite tracks but EVERY track is excellent. Mind you, I don't speak a word of French but Mylene remains one of my favorite artists. Buy this CD, you will not be dissapointed!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is for all the nerds and 80's kids out there. Great read and not a very long book either

B003EYVXXW|4.0|This film is both an impressive historical drama and more importantly a powerful critique of religious fanaticism.  Set in Egypt during the late Roman Empire, it chronicles the career and eventual murder of Hypatia (370?-415), a mathematician and philosopher who was one of the greatest minds of her time.  She lived during a period of religious and political turmoil.  Christian mobs destroyed the great library in Alexandria.  Dogmatism replaced reason.  Fundamentalism was replacing philosophy.  Hypatia struggled to maintain her rationality and independence of thought as her country degenerated into theocracy.  She would be brutally killed and mutilated by a mob of fanatics, partly as a result of local political conflicts, but also because the religious views of the day did not tolerate educated women in positions of intellectual leadership.
0062020889|5.0|Another great book from Ken Follett, I have read all his books, don't know how I missed this one.  It is amazing how he ties it altogether with different events from the past acquaintances.<br />  I always recommend his books!
B00009RDG9|4.0|The Hunted is, in a way, the faithful adaption of the novel First Blood. I found the Hunted an entertaining and interesting ride. What really made this film work are the performances by Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones. There is also some entertaining fight scenes as well, particularly in the beginning.<br /><br />As I said previously, this film is, more or less, a faithful adaptation of the First Blood book, rather than the film First Blood. In the First Blood novel, Rambo goes insane from his experience in Vietnam and from losing all of his friends. Rambo goes on a killing spree, killing cops as well as civilians. This film pretty much follows a similar story. A man named Aaron Hallam, played by Benicio Del Toro, was a soldier for the U.S. Military that had returned from war. What he experienced during the war causes him to go crazy and kill innocent civilians. Meanwhile his old mentor L.T. Bonham, played by Tommy Lee Johns, has to track him down.<br /><br />What makes this film is Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones. I'm not to familiar with Benicio Del Toro's other work. The only other film I have seen him in is the Wolf Man. I thought he did a good job here though. Tommy Lee Jones has never given a bad performance in any of his films that I have seen him in. He is one of my favorite actors working today.<br /><br />The film looks good too. There is a great atmosphere and tone set by the film. There is some good action as well. The beginning really had the best action scenes. However, do not go into this film expecting constant action. This movie is more of a drama than an action film. It is very much like the first Rambo film, which was more of a war drama.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of the First Blood novel and want to see how it would be on film, give this film a look. I say this film is worth seeing at least once. It is a good look at how war can affect people. People bashed this film when it came out, and I do not see why. It is not perfect,but it definitely does not deserve the hated it has gotten by both critics and users.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The moment I got out of the movie theatre I got so obssessed with the story and the musical numbers I knew I just had to have it in my collection &#60;3<br /><br />I know it's a heavy musical, but it is totally worth seeing it in the end...I love it so much I'd even be willing to see an extended edition. Amazon delivered it safely and on time. Really good service! ;)

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very entertaining. The characters were all believable. I have read all of Grisham's books and this ranks right up there with the best. If there has not been a Movie I hope there will be in the near future. I'm thinking Denzel Washington for the lead role.

B00CL6GAD2|5.0|Must see not your typical movie you actually want to pay attention when watching. Definitely worth your two hours to watch.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Paul Newman in the type of role that used to be the defining heroic archetype to American males: the self-reliant, hard-headed individualist searching for truth and justice while battling the forces of evil. Themes of Christianity; rejection of bureaucratic soul-stifling rules; striving to do the best you can do; being broken and yet coming back to renew the fight once again... A very powerful movie. For those who still enjoy this type of inspirational story of individualism, check out &#34;Sometimes a Great Notion&#34;. For those of you who idolize gansta drug dealers, misogynistic rap stars, weak-wristed poetic losers, or hopeless romantic werewolves, your choices from the Hollywood studios are multiplying rapidly.<br /><br />Excellent casting and acting (George Kennedy won best supporting actor Oscar for his role). Musical score was outstanding.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have studied scriptural Heaven as I have a son residing there.

B006Z2XTBY|4.0|This book is not the best William Boyd novel I have read, but it is entertaining and readable. The plot is straightforward and moves fast, the book could be easily turned into a movie. Set in present day London, is good at depicting the city underground, with migrants from everywhere, mostly good guys, and a few dangerous ones. Some characters speak a sort of pidgin urban English. There is an odd new Christian religion that helps the hero. I will probably read it again.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This was a very well done movie. It takes a very serious topic, mental illness, and brings it to the forefront with a sense of humor and taste. The topic is truly a family affair showing how everyone gets affected. Ms. Lawrence deserved her 2012 best actress Oscar Award for making her character so believable. They all did excellent roles.

B004CFBMRY|4.0|This book was recommended to me by another athlete who like me had experienced the frustration of ongoing injuries associated with running.

B008OOYALE|4.0|There is no doubt that Dragon Story is a great game. However, i haversack experienced many bugs that should be fixed.<br />1. Dragons can sometimes get stuck while breeding or evolving. Once, I had to wait two days to retrieve my evolving dragon from the temple, because whenever I tried tapping on the temple when it was done evolving, it wouldn't do anything for two days.<br /><br />2. When you hatch the rarest or highest-priced dragon and want to sell it, you only get  100 coins in return. I think this is a complete rip-off and should be fixed immediately. This is how you lose most your players, is by ripping them off terribly.<br /><br />3. Often times when Dragon Story is loading, the screen freezes and the app forces itself to shut down. This is incredibly irritating.<br /><br />4. The prices for certain decors/dragons are just absolutely ridiculous. NO ONE is going to pay fifty dollars for a pixel dragon. And 500 gold for another egg nest? No one buys a second one because its so over priced. Honestly. -_-<br /><br />Other than the cons, Dragon Story is still a fun, addicting game. There are tons of unique dragons to hatch, collect, and breed. I love decorating my island as well! Great graphics, cute decors and dragons. Well developed game besides the cons.

I thought these were so cute that I decided to give them a try...I'm glad that I did cause they feel great even after wearing them all day.  They look good with jeans, shorts and even skirts.  I will definitely buy more of these!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great gripping book! I think the capital  uses the hunger games to destroy innocence, squelch any sense of hope and dreams of a better life. The use of children for their game serves to be a reminder that they have control to take the most precious of life, the district's children...a modern day version of Gladiator s

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Great movie, which I consider to be a physocological thriller, in the sense that the fight between Batman and the Joker is really for the soul of a Gotham. It has a lot of action, and twists and turns, and its great if you a a Batman fan.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|While the movie is watchable, it is no comedy.  It is a 2 hour collection of bickering and whining.  The movie is nothing at all like the characters from Knocked Up.

B0012HRJEA|4.0|The quality was great. The movie was good overall although it wasn't as seamless as it could have been. The idea of transporting romeo and Juliet into modern day times without changing the Shakespearean language was excellent- unfortunately, some of the pathetic quality was lost in the process. I would recommend this movie as a pleasant (and romantic) time killer, but not if you're looking for a sensational eye opener.

B000FA675C|4.0|Good read. Dan Brown creates a sense of mystery and intrigue with this novel. I read it a few years back, when it first came out, and I would probably read it again if I had the time. I like being able to put the pieces of puzzles together and follow the main characters while they do the same.
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|I loved the book -- but the movie is not as good. I cannot force myself to imagine Tom Cruise as a 6'4 giant with huge fists. Though I have to admit, he plays well -- but this is just not his role.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really loved this book. I found it so beautiful. It tells an amazing story through the point of view of a man who has a mental illness. He struggles with his life and family are told in a wonderful way and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|I read the book so I knew the plot. But my favorite actors did great job in this movie, and in addition some new faces appeared. I was very impressed with Frobisher. This book is almost impossible to present in 2 dimensions (not even three seem enough).  To everyone I can recommend to read the book, whether you saw this movie or not. And then see this movie...
B0096HFOZO|5.0|When I was young my grandfather read this book to me - one chapter a night until it was completed. While I understand that the twits are mean, I felt that was the point of the book. The Twits teaches us a lesson about kindness that would not come across the same way if the Twits had been kind. I purchased this item when I was older and plan to read it to my son when he gets a little older.

B000FIMG68|4.0|I love Lost and have watched the entire series, beginning to end. I watched on TV, but own all the seasons on DVD as well. The second season was not as good to me as the first, but I still enjoyed it. I would not recommend watching this season or any season after this if you haven't seen the first season. This show builds on itself, and if you haven't started at the beginning you will be lost and confused.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I almost didn't read  the series because it was for teenagers.I am very glad I did. It is a very good series.
B000P6YNSE|3.0|The first half of season 3 was my least favorite of all. It was so off topic, trying to introduce new characters which made the whole things complicated. I felt that they were stalling until they figured out what to do. The second half was not as bad, but still not my favorite.

B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|This is by far one of the worst books that I ever read in my whole entire life and believe me I've read a lot!<br />Charlaine Harris was never too talented and can't be compared with the great American writers like Hemingway and Faulkner,nor did I expected to read from her something that is on that level.Her last book \\"Dead Ever After\\" however was under every acceptable level.I truly hope that this also means dead ever after for Charlaine Harris too.She was not writing this books because she wanted to be true to herself but for money,and If you don't write for immortality but for good pay check then you must give to the fans what they want and expect.I find it extremely pathetic that she is crying all the time on her Facebook page and call her fans-the people that made her rich true all this years-morons and idiots.I also find it pathetic that pages like \\"The Bill Compton Appreciation Society\\"  are asking their fans to give a five star review to this book.<br /><br />I will never read anything else from this author.

B008XCM18Q|3.0|This is one of those rare cases when the movie is better than the book. The first 1/3 of the movie is riveting, but the rest is like a mediocre spy movie. The characters are very flat and predictable, the plot uses lines you've seen many times before.
B00AKTXL7K|3.0|For those of us who didn't see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL on the big screen but bought into the rave reviews that this is the best of all the MI pictures this 4th installment is a big letdown. Brad Bird as director may be part of the problem: his credits prior to this assignment include Up, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, The Iron Giant, The Simpsons, and such like - films that depend on the animation magic they bring to cute stories but somehow don't transfer well to the use of actors in a `serious' film. Writers Josh Appelbaum and Andr&eacute; Nemec based this script very loosely on Bruce Geller's original television series, but in this film they seem to opt more for inserted comedy lines when there is anything vaguely beyond the minimal conversations that occur. The film is like a ship without a sail and headed in a direction full of sidetracks.<br /><br />Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise Production) and his team Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are racing against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a strike on the United States. An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.<br /><br />It all starts in Budapest with the assassination of Trevor Hanaway (Josh Holloway) by Sabine Moreau (L&eacute;a Seydoux), proceeds to a prison breakout (Ethan Hunt has been imprisoned for killing some Serbian guards), the Russian secrets are discovered, aborted plans lead the team form the Kremlin to Dubai (for Tom Cruise's reportedly self performed scaling of a glass tower) and subsequently to Mumbai and on and on an on for well over two hours. The movie is fast moving and the booms and blowups and car chases and pyrotechnics and absurdly one-sided fights (yes, the girls get to fight and kill each other) manage to keep our attention because of spectacle. There are a couple of moments where we get to learn just a bit about some of the characters an their motivations to be part of this invincible team, but in the end we care very little about any of them as they talk their way through a soupy ending. OK to see on Amazon Instant Video but not a film to own. But that is just one opinion from a viewer who likes story in a movie. Grady Harp, May 13rm the Kremlin to Dubai (for Tom Cruise's reportedly self performed scaling of a glass tower) and subsequently to Mumbai and on and on an on for well over two hours.

There are a couple of moments where we get to learn just a bit about some of the characters an their motivations to be part of this invincible team, but in the end we care very little about any of them as they talk their way through a soupy ending. OK to see on Amazon Instant Video but not a film to own. But that is just one opinion from a viewer who likes story in a movie. Grady Harp, May 13
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Slow download and install on my kindle fire. Great graphics and smooth play. While it is a match three game it has a different twist with the objective of building a village.  Very enjoyable and I did not complete the free play but just went ahead and bought the full version. A definate keeper.

B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is very easy too use and understand how to setup.  it is very simple to use and add new / other locations. thank you
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|It started off well. I was getting all excited by some very good actors, a decent plot and so on. Then it collapsed. Really, a corrupt politician with a pretty wife and a reluctant detective who uncovers a land scandal is nothing original at all.<br /><br />Parts did not make sense. Why get a detective to check on a wife committing infidelity that may have dramatic effect on an election a few days away? If it has not come out it probably would be better to leave it till after the election. A detective that did an amateurish job of trailing someone secretly.  Finally a scandal like this would be hidden, it would take ages for experts to figure out the details of who was involved, people would try and cover their tracks.<br /><br />The acting is okay; I did like Mark Wahlberg performance.<br /><br />The actual filming is good.<br /><br />Note there is a lot of hidden political correctness in this movie, it did not bother me, but it may put you off.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|A lengthy introduction to the Hobbit story.  Great for fans of the novel but perhaps a bit slow-paced for the casual viewer.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Shows the same sort of rats still infest the Capitol. Some how or other we have survived the infestation. Hmmmm!
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This APP was extremely frustrating.  The hints they gave you were minimal.  I think it could have have been better.  It was fun to play at times.
B0024F08RO|5.0|Reiterate what was said, is an excellent TV series, I congratulate those who participated in creating, the actors and the director.
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|Found this movie so boring and pointless. It tries to be profound, but, for me, fails completely. I wish I had known this included beliefs such as \\"all religions are true,\\" etc. so I could have skipped the experience.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie and really enjoyed it so I thought that I would give the book a chance. I have never really been a big reader, but I couldn't put this book down. It is truly an amazing story.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Quite exciting and with good life lessons for anyone, especially for younger people.  Some might object that it is too far-fetched in some ways, but the underlying message is there.
0307950654|2.0|Very disappointed!  I enjoy P.D. James so much that this novel really was a huge disappointment.  I realize what she was trying to do but it left me very bored!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was disappointed at the end of book 4 for not caring much of half of the characters, I understood why on book 5 to my delight. Almost all my preferred characters are here!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game I think its the bomb<br />and I think every one should have the chance to play this game.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is FASCINATING. There are no other words for it.<br /><br />Yes, the book is long, but it's truly interesting. I'm now reading Onward, Starbucks story, and it's not even 25% as good as Steve Jobs' book.<br /><br />Go for it!
B00COHIFQS|5.0|This is one of the scariest movies I have seen in a long time. Great story line. Acting was good...Loved just about everything about this movie. I haven't seen too many newer movies in years that I rave about...This is one of few. If you like scary, creepy movies, this is a must see!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Classic Sookie with what I assumed would always be her ending! Sad to say goodbye, but glad she ends alive!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|The concept of the game is your standard endless running type game and occasionally you get to shoot enemies.  The graphics are better than average.  Here is the worst part of the game: in order to unlock new armors and upgrade existing ones requires experience.  You earn experience by playing the game. It takes FOREVER to earn enough experience to unlock the armor, unless you want to pay real money.  I give this game 2 stars because the concept isn't unique and I'he been playing for a week and still can't unlock the next suit.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Every book in the series wasn't a home run, but I really enjoyed this last book in the series.  It tied up the loose ends neatly and smartly.  There were a few surprises and some of the more despicable characters got what they had coming to them.  I won't spoil the end, but it's very fitting, if a little predictable.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|this is a very exciting puzzle game. the puzzles start out simple and get progressively harder. I would highly recommend it.

B005OK722U|3.0|Almost as depraved as the 1st 2 but not as good. They don't even carry this title at Blockbuster. But I didn't think it was that terrible.

B0002CHIJW|5.0|As usual the original is much better than the new version which wouldn't rate more than 2 stars. I don't understand why this movie got such crappy reviews. I don't care I loved I loved it.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|A male writer, writing from a female perspective. A very good effort, but how convinced am I that he captured the true feminine perspective...say almost.
B0002EXH54|4.0|much better than all of crappy androgonous looking drag queens like poison,motleycrew, cinderella etc. I enjoy all of their releases.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I had a hard time getting into the story line and the characters. I have always enjoyed the Scarpetta novels but this one was hard for me to finish.

B006ID6UAW|4.0|Excellent book with depth and insight. University level read.Good source for teachers of history. Kissinger has been participant and perpetrator.
B00CHILW64|2.0|This is a poignant story, but the film is way too long. The director and editor could have cut it down to 45 minutes and it would have had more emotional impact.
B002JHF5HU|5.0|it was a gift<br />to be given to a friend<br />A gift that was enjoyed<br />and will be for many years to come.
0783231202|5.0|First, the acting is the best. They play their parts so well, you don't look at them as actors, but as the characters they portray.<br />It's a true story that is based on the struggles of the blacks in America and the injustice of slavery.<br />BUY IT. You'll never sell this one at your garage sale.
0786955570|5.0|This is an excellent intro to DnD. My wife and I have been wanting to try DnD for quite a while but didn't quite know what to do with the Red Box. We were a little over whelmed having never played tabletop RPGs before, but this board game help fill in the cracks. Not only is this a great stand alone board game and easy to learn, but it also helped us learn the very basics of DnD and give us confidence to get back into the Red Box and push forward.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game and play it often with friends.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I enjoyed it pretty much.  There were a couple of times it was dragging and I got a litte sleepy.  I never did figure out the REAL relationship between Alfred Hitchcock and his wife.  It was more like a business arrangement.  Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock was pretty good except his voice sounded more like Hannibal Lector from the Silence of the Lambs.  Apparently, Alfred Hitchcock was a very petulant, childish person.<br />Also, the making of Psycho left the viewer with more questions than answers.  I still don't understand what the movie was about.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've read the book, and this is the only film version I've seen. Even though this isn't a verbatim transcription of the book, I think it captures the romantic feeling I got from the book. And Keira Knightley makes one fabulously sassy Elizabeth to boot.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I love history that is written and presented with authenticity.  The acting was convincing yet dramatic.  Here's four more words.

In a TUPE case of 1981, the TUPE legislation was referred to as `a Pandora's box of ambiguities.'<br /><br />The European Commission, however, predictably took the view that `the Directive has proved to be an invaluable instrument for the protection of workers in the event of the reorganization of an undertaking by ensuring peaceful and consensual economic and technological restructuring....'  And so forth.<br /><br />In short, as Wynn-Evans explains, a central objective of TUPE is `as to protect employees from the consequences at common law of a disposal or other transfer by their employer of the business in which they work.'<br /><br />Focusing primarily on the private sector and, in the author's words, `finalized in the shadow of  potential TUPE reform,' the book elaborates on all aspects of TUPE, covering a range of issues, from the legal effects of a transfer to consultation requirements and claims arising from transfer related dismissals.<br /><br />Much to the advantage of the practitioner, as well as the general reader, the text itself as well as the organisation of the book is clear, logical and accessible.  Those doing further research will appreciate the detailed table of contents and the extensive index which certainly aids navigation. Also note the almost fifteen pages containing tables of cases, and legislation as well as a table of abbreviations and terms.<br /><br />Anyone involved in employment law, lawyer or non-lawyer, should acquire this important book.  The law is stated to be as at 21 December 2012.primarily on the private sector and, in the author's words, `finalized in the shadow of  potential TUPE reform,' the book elaborates on all aspects of TUPE, covering a range of issues, from the legal effects of a transfer to consultation requirements and claims arising from transfer related dismissals.<br /><br />Much to the advantage of the practitioner, as well as the general reader, the text itself as well as the organisation of the book is clear, logical and accessible.

It is to be hoped that this sort of thing will never happen again, but we would not like to bet on it!<br /><br />As Louis Blom-Cooper remarks in his Foreword, a judicial review of this particular administrative action against Speyer for the State's flawed, irrational and blatantly prejudicial decision in 1921 to discriminate against him would almost certainly succeed today with a different, fair result for Sir Edgar and his family.<br /><br />Lentin has worked extremely hard to uncover the correspondence and associated papers which are set out clearly in the detailed notes and he includes a section on further reading and a detailed index.  His scholarship throughout is first rate, highly competent and paints an appalling picture of what can happen when the power of the State becomes `irrational'. We do not use such a heavy word as `corrupt' although the inferences from the published papers in this book highlight the sort of flawed decision-making we should not see again in the United Kingdom.<br /><br />If there is anything which we can take comfort from with the Speyer case it is that modern judicial review, however costly, must be retained and improved for the future if there is to be any scrutiny of the bad decision-making highlighted in Speyer. We have all had our days in a court when we know that forces are at work well outside the decision-making process we are asking the court to undertake: alas, we can never prove it!<br /><br />So, there is a lesson to be learnt from Tony Lentin's endeavours: the need for an external review of bad ministerial and administrative decisions which might one day become enshrined in our constitution to prevent another Speyer.  All we can feel is that the same thing did not happen to the Mountbattens and others who were more fortunate, and not Jewish: no more vengeance and a little more humility should be the new order of the day.are at work well outside the decision-making process we are asking the court to undertake: alas, we can never prove it!<br /><br />So, there is a lesson to be learnt from Tony Lentin's endeavours: the need for an external review of bad ministerial and administrative decisions which might one day become enshrined in our constitution to prevent another Speyer.

B00CLL1UY6|5.0|This is a really exceptional account of this kids life that is set just before the start of WWI. I really empathize with him and what he goes through. It's difficult for me to imagine going through life missing a leg but it does keep him from getting caught up the meat grinder of trench warfare that is soon to come. This is one book I would recommend to anyone that likes to read historical fiction. I had previously read, \\"The Luck of the Weissensteiners,\\" and this story is definitely showing the development of his writing skills. He's becoming quite good I feel.<br /><br />I did receive a copy for a review.

Screenplay by Kurt Wimmer, Mark Bomback. Screen Story by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, Jon Povill, Kurt Wimmer.<br /><br /> Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrel) just woke up from a terrible dream. Same dream, same time. In the dream he is a secret agent running with a woman (Jessica Biel). The police robots are after them. Quaid grabs a hold of her to stop her from going over the ledge. He then tells her she has to let go. The robot police capture him with a wrap around and pulls him back. Then he always wakes up.<br />  His wife, Lori (Kate Beckinsale), gets called in to her job after an explosion. Now Quaid has time to relax, watch the news and look out over the balcony of his home in Colony Rejoice. Later, after seeing an advertisement for REKALL, he boards the Fall transit to his factory job where he builds police robots.  Everyone has been told they will have to work a double shift. Quaid has been working so hard on the job. He has a dream of going on a vacation to Mars.<br /> With his wife passed out in bed, Douglas is so bored with life, he goes back out into the seedy part of the colony. He visits REKALL. The owner, McClane (John Cho), talks him into taking a mind trip as a secret agent. They put the necessary chemicals into his body when suddenly something goes wrong. McClane shouts \\"He's a spy!\\". The officers bust through the door and shoot everyone except for Quaid, who after shooting the officers is able to escape.<br /> He has no memory of being a spy, but this will be one night he will never forget.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Will Yun Lee, Bill Nye, Bryan Cranston. Ethan Hawke is in the Extended Director's Version.<br /><br /> I found this remake to be very entertaining. I like to see the Extended Director's version.

They have seen this movie many times on TV and tell me there are some scenes or parts of scenes that are missing on this DVD.  Ex. at the end of the movie one of the characters yells \\"We love you.  I love you\\" as Clint Eastwood rides away. It isn't on this DVD.  Other parts are missing, too, say my parents.<br /><br />Don't know if they are showing a director's cut version on TV, but I'm disappointed that my parents own an inferior DVD.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Dark Shadows is not Tim Burton's best work, but it's great fun in a camp, over-the-top kind of way. I've never seen the original series and had nothing to compare it with, but I enjoyed the gothic elements combined with humour that didn't turn the film into a complete parody. The only thing I didn't like was the unevenness of the story line because it opens with Victoria, who it seems is going to be an important character, but she's not in the movie much after that till the end. This is probably because the series was compressed into movie length and its very hard to get everything right, but still it was a good movie that didn't disappoint.
B002OB9KPE|3.0|The musicianship is just too good to give this CD less than three stars -- though I was sorely tempted to. Yet this rehashed CD is basically an insult to the fans and their wallets. Virtually every melody and hook can be found in Spock's Beard's V or the first two TA CD's. I strongly believe that warmed-over material from strictly the V CD has indeed provided the groundwork for the majority of TA compositions. There are parts of these songs that indeed \\"soar,\\" but they are not tied in to a cohesive whole. Of course, this is an issue with a lot of prog music. Artists seem to think they have to write these epic songs in order to produce genuine prog. Morse-era Spock's Beard and The Flower Kings, for example, have amply demonstrated their fondness for largely unfocused \\"epic\\" material. Not that these bands aren't first-rate -- they are -- but I wouldn't put them at the elite prog level because of the oftentimes sloppy song structure. Fans of neo/symphonic prog who demand virtuositic playing, soaring passages, and beautiful melodies -- yet prefer tighter song structures and better flowing CD's -- would probably be better-served by the Pendragon and IQ catalogs. Comedy of Errors recent CD blew me away as well.

B00A81MV3U|3.0|Stop right here, if you are concerned about spoilers!<br /><br />One of the best things to be said about this film is that it left me eager to pick up the novel by Matthew Quick!  It's a well acted piece, which definitely leads you to empathize with its characters.  Yet, I share the concern of a National Catholic Register review, which concludes that the film ultimately leaves you rooting against marital reconciliation (www(dot)youtube.com/watch?v=aTi9JDmQP4M).  Couldn't the story line have had you rooting for two characters finding each other, without it being necessary to leave a marriage behind?<br /><br />Oddly, John McCarthy's review on a Catholic News Service web site seems only to fault \\"brief glimpses of a violent assault, fleeting rear and partial female nudity, some profane language, frequent crude and crass terms and sexual innuendo\\" (See www(dot)catholicnews(dot)com/data/movies/13mv001(dot)htm).  I don't understand why this arm of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops doesn't mention the same concern as the National Catholic Register review.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I have often wondered what happened to Jaycee after her rescue. She and I are the same age, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for her. To come out of that and not just close herself off to the rest of the world was what real bravery is. The excerpts from her journal broke my heart. It was an excellently written book, and I wish her much success and happiness in her new life.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This post contains spoilers! I don't get all the negative comments regarding this novel. I always knew Sookie would end up with Sam. It's the only thing that made sense. Although she is a telepath, at the end of the day Sookie is just a normal girl who really wants to lead a normal life. She likes her little town, her old house, and her job. She loves the sun, goodness and life. She struggles to hold on to the light when everything around her is pulling her toward darkness. To not end the series with A Sookie/Sam hook up would be just plain wrong. This book was written a little differently than the rest. I liked that, but I can see where some people maybe wouldn't. I loved seeing all of Sookie's friends brought back into the fold and I thought the devil was an interesting addition to the scene. I would have liked to have seen a little more of him. It would have been cool if he had shown up on Sookie's porch or if there had been a little more interaction between Sookie and the vampires, but at the end of the day this was a series about Sookie. It was always her story. The vampires, werewolves, and fairies were just along for the ride. I am pleased with the ending and feel that Ms. Harris did a good job of tying up loose ends. Sookie's enemies are accounted for and taken care of, she is safe and protected, her relationships are strong and mended where there was a need, she has a good reputation, and a promising future with Sam. More importantly she is finally okay with herself and who she is. She knows there is really no such thing as happily ever after and that if things with Sam don't work she will be okay. She is finally right where she needs to be and the novel ends with Sookie finally feeling at peace with her life. Well done, Ms. Harris. Sookie deserved no less!

193700788X|1.0|I was really disappointed with this book, just like the majority of fans of the series. If I have to choose only one reason why I didn't like the book, I'll have to say it's because it doesn't make sense at all. It is not as much as Sookie ending up with Sam, is is more based on the fact that barely nothing justified that choice and the road that led there. Yes, I am a Sookie/Eric fan but I am only so because Charlaine Harris took me to love them as a couple. I was initially really invested in Sookie/Bill and I was a little reluctant when Charlaine began to brake them apart in the series, but as this was done slowly and in a way that made sense for Sookie, I was convinced that the change was justified and began to fall in love with Sookie/Eric.<br />The same can not be said for Sookie/Sam. The only factors that justify them ending up together are that they are both somehow human and can procreate, but the same can be said of Sookie/Alcide and Sookie/Quin, just to name a couple (some fans would have preferred Terry). Sam was always presented as the \\"eternal best friend\\" and nothing more, then just of a sudden he is the perfect lover for Sookie and if that doesn't work, she is fine with that too. Please, really? Sookie who would not settle for nothing and for no one, who always questioned her feelings for Eric due to the blood bond, and now she doesn't care much if it works out with Sam or not and if the cluviel dor has affected the way she sees him or not. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. It also doesn't make sense to have Eric (the fierce viking warrior) fade away as nothing more than an unpaid whore and boy toy, deprived of his tittle, his business, his money, his prodigy, his pride and his will, again IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.<br />Why make 12 books that went in a very clear direction with Eric/Sookie to finish the series with book 13 that denies all the other books and takes us back to the very boring beginning in Sookie's life? Yes, I know the answer to that question, and the answers is so the author could milk her fans out of their money with false hope and promises, but even so, I still believe she could have done that and give her fans a more agreeable ending. The books are based in a fantasy world where everything was possible, it would have required just a final strike of imagination for the author to make it possible for a more credible end with Sookie/Eric and make the majority of her fans happy, which after all are the only reason for the series success up to this point. Or she could have presented and developed a more convincing Sookie/Sam couple early on the series and I have no doubts that I would have switch by alliances once again in her favor as would have many of her fans.<br />Shortly after I started reading the Sookie books, I considered reading other CH series once my favorite vampire book series was done, but seeing the poor regard CH has for her readers' satisfaction, I will never read any of her other books in fear that once again I will be used and toyed with just for her own desires and financial benefit.<br />Do not waste your money in this book, if you need to read it just so you can bury the series and have closure, borrow it from a library or from someone who already made the mistake of buying it. If I had bought the DEA book, I would have taken it back to the store and demand my money back (I borrowed it).
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Good flick. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence really nailed it. DeNiro is awesome. Good movie to watch with your special someone
B004FP1WX0|2.0|If you are thinking this will be like the Catfish TV program, you are wrong. Niev is not the same person at all. He is much more childish and the movie is not even a fun train wreck to watch. I could tell he was getting Catfished about halfway through the movie. If he had just been a decent guy and let it go, it would have been okay. He just came across as a mean guy making fun of a pitiful woman with little joy in her life. Obviously that is not the type of guy Niev is deciding he wants to be hopefully now, but this show does not show any positive light on these kids with some video cameras and a big ego to appease.

B000001DZQ|5.0|This is a good collection for sure. there is a bit of it that is on Live Stock which is definitely worth getting also. There will never be anyone like Roy Buchanan, it is such an understatement to say that there could be any other masters of the telecaster when there is him. It is a mazing guitar work that will leave your jaw dropped. The songs that feature vocals are good and the singers are good you are just not going to be able to compete with Roy's guitar and that is the long and short of it.<br />  There is nobody that ever approached the telecaster like him, the great part is that supposedly Roy played a ton like Jimi with effects and then when he heard Jimi he went the whole way of trying to get the sounds organically from the mighty telecaster. There more than likely will never be any Tele player like Roy so feel comfortable at the altar. Danny Gatton gets real close and definitely worth a strong look.<br />  I really enjoy his cover of Down by the River, Baltimore is really cool. Dual Soliloquy and I don't know if you can really top the tone on the opening of the Messiah will Come Again.<br />  There is no way that you can go wrong with this collection, get it now

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Fast delivery and a great price. I like Tolkien a little displeased with Peter Jackson the movie stayed pretty true to the book but they did take the liberty to add story line, I think they did an injustice to Tolkien that's my opinion. but I would recommend it if you like fantasy. all in all it was worth the price.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as intriguing as some of the earlier novels but a good read.  Likable characters and a good story line.  Makes me want to visit the Caribbean.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Wow, what a pleasant surprise....even though i read the book i was still blown away by this totally unique & enthralling film.<br />This movie is moved by underlying currents of deep meaning that effectively pulled me in slowly but surely .... into a thought provoking heartfelt experience that left me glowing with new appreciation for life & all i share the journey with.<br />One reason i was able to be pulled so deeply into this was the acting....top notch, & the visuals are stunning... also....the actors are all fresh faces to me....so it bumped up the believability factor as there were no memories of past performances attached to the faces to pop up & interrupt the experience.<br />Seriously, the actor who plays the young Pi deserves an Academy award for this one.... or at least a standing ovation....HE made it believable....not the special effects.<br />Congratulations is in order for all involved in this masterpiece of a movie.<br />I put off seeing this because i figured since i had read the book...i would be encumbered by the \\"been there done that\\" syndrome....but strangely enough that was not the case at all even though it seemed to follow the books story line pretty closely.<br />I wont go into details, im sure there are plenty of reviews that are giving plot specifics...so i will wrap up the review by saying that this is one of the few movies that I KNOW i will be watching again soon...as there is just too much to take in, in just one viewing.
B0015346OM|5.0|Good book. Kept my interest the whole read. Tells the story of an important part of our history. I was too young to really recall it when it happened.
B00821PCJS|3.0|It's an OK story, but nothing great.  Acting is fine, but I don't find it very compelling or memorable.  If you want to waste an hour per week watching the tube there are worse.
0307474275|5.0|This book was great. At points it was a little slow but it more than makes up for it when the symbols kick in. I mean it is really something, this book it was. At points I just couldn't get enough of it because it was so symbolic. Like symbolic for what? Is what you are asking yourself at points in this novel. But then the symbols are explained and you sit like a fish in the fryer after figuring out what they are. But I would definitely recommend this novel at points. I read it in almost 3 days which at points is very good for me. Da Vinci was a very interesting man as this book puts it.

There are songs about past loves, current love, kids, his early days getting into music.  Rod has not lost his touch in writing music or singing great songs.  This album is a must for Rod Stewart fans!! So happy to have Rod writing new material and I look forward to the tour.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|The gameplay for this game is quite amazing.  The battle moves quite fluidly it reminds me of a Diablo game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought it was intriguing because it was funny, sappy, and told a good romance. I am not one for romance but this one left its mark on me. It was so delightful! I would suggest that little readers read another book because some topics aren't for them. They wouldn't understand. Overall I give this book five stars and a bravo to the author, John Green!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Coming from an angle that isn't common.  I enjoyed the pace of the story.  It was easy to stay with and mysterious enough to keep me coming back.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|This show manages to strike the right balance between the need to keep the viewer eager to watch another episode/the next season and the need to actually get some closure or get things done within the episode/season. The evolution in terms of new characters and the roles of existing characters is also positive, in that you keep seeing the main characters and you have some new entrants who are also worthy of interest. I liked the first season, and this one is even better.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|As an avid Robert Jordan fan this book delivers on many levels but it also is obvious that it isn't all R.J. The story felt rushed with alot of plots unfinished or without answers. Now that's not to say that I didn't enjoy the book, I did. It just left you wanting more. It was an ending but not the ending that it would have been if RJ had written it. That all being said...this is the best series I've ever read.
B003IKMR0U|3.0|Zombie Dice is a nice filler game in between heavier games for experienced gamers, and a nice quick family game too. It's a push your luck game that can reward you for taking more chances, but you can also fail big time when taking those risks.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Let's face it: when fans of Lee Child's series think \\"Jack Reacher,\\" Tom Cruise is far from the first person they think of to portray him.  Reacher is basically a brick wall, a hulking genius who is unafraid to get down and dirty and do whatever it takes to win the fight--even if that means fighting dirty.  Tom Cruise is...well, Tom Cruise.<br /><br />And yet, fans, listen up: Cruise nails it.  He knows how to nail that \\"don't mess with me look,\\" and has the off-the-cuff sense of humor that makes Reacher unpredictable.  In his (too few) fight scenes, he's brutal: the violence is surprisingly realistic (the opening scene is truly disturbing), and isn't glossed up or played down.  Some viewers may be unsettled.<br /><br />And yet, something about the film just doesn't hold up to Cruise's performance.  The story is one of the series' better ones: five supposedly innocent civilians are killed, and the alleged perpetrator requests the help of his old nemesis, Jack Reacher, a former military cop who has become a drifter.  Reacher shows up, and lo and behold, things aren't exactly as they appear.  The supporting cast is solid; Rosamund Pike, who's had a spotty career (I can't see her and not immediately think of SURROGATES, unfortunately), is good, though she and Cruise don't have much chemistry; Werner Herzog and Jai Courtney, the two primary villains, are properly despicable (Herzog's The Zec deserves a hell of a lot more screen time); and Richard Jenkins and Robert Duvall are reliably great in their limited roles.<br /><br />So where does JACK REACHER falter?  It's hard to say, but it seems to lose steam moving into the third act; granted, this is sometimes true of Child's novels, but the author usually manages to regain momentum.  The film, aside from a nice fight scene, does not.  And the abrupt ending, pretty much a staple of the series, doesn't really work on the screen.  There's nothing truly noteworthy about Christopher McQuarrie's directing or script, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.  The movie is a solid, enjoyable action film, with doses of wry humor spread throughout.  Basically, if you've read the novels (this one's based on ONE SHOT; Child gives his novels some bland titles, but at least he's never simply named one JACK REACHER), you know what you're getting.  If you aren't a fan of the series, go out and read a couple; then give this movie a chance.  It's not great, but it's definitely better than most hack action films out there, and features Tom Cruise giving a commanding performance.ther a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.

B008L40Q7E|4.0|This is one of the rare cases where the movie was a bit more believable than the book.  The film version bears a very striking resemblance to the book and doesn't take many artistic liberties, with one thankful exception:  The Krakken.  I'll not say another word about that ridiculous scene from the book and other than that, Dr. No holds up as a really good Bond book.

B0012GMWCU|1.0|I Am the Blues is billed as quintessential blues.  Unfortunately, except in rare cases such as John Lee Hooker, Son House, and Mississippi John Hurt this is all too true.  The blues is essentially an old style of music, reminiscent of folk music.  At least that was what I thought until I listened to such artists as Earl Hooker, Junior Wells, and Willie Dixon.  Sadly, most people will probably like the latter artists more.

B0000084J7|3.0|Mark Hollis, lead singer of Talk Talk fame, produces a solo album that is the equivalent of where Talk Talk was heading following their phenomenal \\"Spirit of Eden\\" and \\"Laughing Stock\\" ventures.  As those two albums played with sound and explored alternative jazzispheres (yep, made that word up) Hollis, always one to pare down thoughts lyrically, continues the trend here on his self-titled and, moreso than those other albums, also pares the soundscape down.  The music may be described as minimalist and it's true that it's barely there at times but to call it minimalist is not quite accurate; this is not merely securing the beauty of a few notes played out in long metre but rather it is letting the musicians quietly and unhurriedly (those words are important) feel their way through the song, or perhaps let the notes work themselves out of the musicians based on the poetry that they are surrounding.  To the casual listener not taking the time to listen or to the music purveyor not versed in this realm (and I for one am one of those) they will hear what sounds like piano, a broken flute, and some percussion amidst Hollis' mumbled nasal resonance of singing.  The truth is that there are at least eleven different instruments represented on the album, not including Mark's unique and trebly voice.<br /><br />So this is not going to be for everyone and while I dug the Talk Talk and where they were going it was partly because there was still quite a bit of density and thickness to the experiment.  Here, for me, there is too much quiet and space.  But I certainly appreciate the poetry as it's rare to find this type of expression, with efficiency and clarity of words laying out a tapestry of thought and imagination, put to a musical landscape.<br /><br />For people who will take purposeful time to listen and (stressed here) meditate on this work they will be rewarded.  For the latter day Talk Talk fan they should find interest even if they are not compelled by it as much as they had been by the former work (that'd be me).  For popheads weaned on the radio they should avoid.ey had been by the former work (that'd be me).  For popheads weaned on the radio they should avoid.

B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|I have to agree with may of the reviews written about the final book in the Sookie Stackhouse series. It felt like Charlaine Harris had lost all her zest and love for the characters. The plot wasn't very interesting and lacked the mystery and intensity of previous Sookie novels. It was a soulless end to a great series.<br /><br />I think other reviewers hit the nail on the head, True Blood (TV series) has taken its toll on this wonderful story. Its a shame Charlaine Harris wasn't able to maintain more control over the fate of Sookie Stackhouse and other characters such as Bill.
B005ER2RIW|5.0|This is the type of book every outdoor enthusiast should own and read at least twice! I am an upcoming scouts master and besides the actual teachings and lessons of scouts this book refreshes the enthusiasm that much more and is awesome for teaching and learning from. I rate that this could very well be the best survival book out there. No wonder it has sold more than a million copies world wide! Big up to John &#34;lofty&#34; Wiseman for passing on some of his and the SAS's knowledge.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|This movie has an eternal love message for every generation.  I have seen it numerous times and this time i bought one for my daughter and one for me.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Some of the reviews I read on movies are absolutely ridiculous with the reviewer being so full of themselves as they analyze and pick at every tiny detail. If you agree with me on that, and you are just looking for a movie that is mindless entertainment with excellent action reminiscent of the old school Kung Fu movies then you will probably enjoy this movie like I did.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I've loved the Sookie Stackhouse series for years and I guess it really couldn't have ended any different but I was hoping for a bit more. Charlaine Harris created a wonderful world and I am sad to leave it and those that live there. Adios, my old friends.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked the two main characters had a chemistry going on.  I sometime felt the guy had issues in losing his mom.
B00AQA94M4|5.0|I am a huge fan of Avantasia, though some CDs I like better than others. My favorite had been The Wicked Symphony, but this is as good if not better than that one. I highly recommend this CD, especially if you are a fan of symphonic rock.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is a great read. It brings together different story lines and ties them all together.  The relationship between Lake and Will is so believable.  The story of Eddie made me cry.  Lake's relationship with her mom and brother was heartwarming.  This book was awesome. Can't wait to read more from this author.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I enjoy playing RPG games and I loved it. Some games are bored because they are so easy. It`s really good, perfect.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am a Civil War junkie.  This book described the relationship between Lincoln and his rivals/partners better than any other book I have read on the subject.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Overall the app is the easiest alarm clock with the most options. Buy this app now. Thank me later. You're welcome.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is a fast game and did require some getting used to. I have not completed the game yet but do enjoy it a lot.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was one of the best books I ever read. The characters were magical and so was the plot. I think I got more out of the book by reading between the lines. There was a message that Stephanie Meyer was trying to get across. I think everyone will get a different message but I got message love can last forever and that love is the strongest force in the world. It might sound weird but that's what I think about this book. Everyone should read this series at least once (I read it 4 times) and try to see what get what I got out of the book. if you can't get what I got just read it the twilight saga is awesome!
B006FE83UE|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbord rates as one of the all time greats of movie history. Faithfully adapted from Harper Lee's equally wonderful novel, with great acting performances and production values this film continues to engage viewers with a story line as relevant today as it was on release. Gregory Peck won a well deserved Oscar for his lead role and rightly describes Attichus Finch as his favourite part - and Robert Duvall, on movie debut, almost stops the show in one of my favourite scenes ever.<br /><br />This 50th anniversary edition is a fully restored and remastered print and sound copy and includes two wonderful documentaries.
B005USZYDU|4.0|This book had lots of surprises, but I wish it had a better murder weapon! I have to do a project on this book, I would not suggest it for a project!!!!! All in all it was a great book!<br /><br />For 10 year olds and up though!-.-
B0001XAPY2|5.0|However, this movie is genius and I can't help but love it.  It is a really great one, and the Disney voice acting works well.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a great sequel to the hunger games. I loved how Collins brought you deeper into Katniss' emotions about her family and her feelings toward both Peers and Gale. Full of so much suspense I had a hard time putting it down at times.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the hunger game,it's a masterpiece and on excellent film. It's about hope courage facing human dignity.the hunger game is the best film I have seen this pass year. I watch the hunger game every night ofter work it's relax me.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Can't stop playing! A must have game. Keeps more up late nights. Strategy game with a some action. Could have more action but overall a great game.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|great game - stretches the imagination - nice break - tons better than trying to draw on my iphone - only compliant I can't figure out how to use acquired points to &#34;buy&#34; bombs - but I'm sure I will find it ...
B0000TB03W|5.0|super selection songs!! --- I am a fan of Shaniah, so I knew what to except from this video, and I was right!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a great game! I love trying to beat the high scores. Definitely a worthy game to download. Do it to it!
B000001Y5E|4.0|Read somewhere, I think it was Wiki, that this was one of Pink's favorites, so I bought it.  That was a good decision.  An excellent band with a strong lead singer.  When this CD wears out, I'll buy another one.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|This sucks I thought I could. Walk around like the amazing spider<br />man game. I had high hopes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  RIP OFF!!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like this game and I'm  15.  I created like a lot of stuff for my reef I bought it for my  sister then I started. Playing it
B005GFPZYK|5.0|True American hero and man, Kyle holds nothing back nor will he apologize for anything he says- R.I.P. Chris Kyle
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is radical and I do like the second one too. This gameplay is  grate . I mostly liked the  moves.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is one of the best TV programs I have seen. Didn't want to stop watching. Waiting for the next season to start.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|This series are quick reads.  Non sophisticated but still holds your interest and good for a change of pace. Read the series in order though.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is the best for people who want epic structures in survival without rescource gathering.  For people who can not leave the screen where you make the item change you just go to browse and hide the keyboard and hit the button that takes you back in KindleFire.Overall it is a great app.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The included battery report is fine -- this is more of the same, but it does what it is supposed to.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was an amazing book for many reason the author captured each persons respective so well it was so soulful and lovely and it made me cry! It is a book that many people can relate to and sets an amazing example for children 10+. I really hope she writes more books.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Was a great movie. Really brings in all of the different movies. A must see before watching Iron Man 3.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Very good, Brandon did a good job for taking over mid stream, his vision of Roberts dream came out well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find this app version really easy to use and provides hours of fun and relaxation.  Would recommend it highly
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have a few of the 24/7 games and this one is the same quality as the others. I have not had any technical problems with any of them. They aren't complicated and easy to navigate. This was a free app today. I do think it is worth 99 cents.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best because you can do whatever you want whenever you want you could build a huge castle with no sleep. For the most part you will never get tired of this game. There is a 99.9% I will get tired of this game. So get that lazy butt out of bed and only pay $3.99. to have the fun of your life.Help mojang get even more popular then he already is. !!!!!!!***PLEASE***!!!!!!!
B007JGAR6U|5.0|I bought this at the same time as my Fuji X20...replacing my Canon G7.<br /><br />Love the sleek profile...it is very unobtrusive.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I was looking for file explorer and this work great for me no issue thanks to the developer for making this app free
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Bridget Jone's Diary is one of the funnest movie's you can watch it over and over. Please make more :)
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I was getting tired of reading the same thing, over and over.  This book gave me something new and fresh.  At first I was trying to figure out how the different people and time lines would flow together, but the author  does an excellent job of conveying the storyline.  The only  thing that kept from giving this book  a perfect 5 Stars was that I would have liked to have seen a bit more interaction between the two star crossed lovers, though I understand the reasoning.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has %.  May not mean a lot to some, but it does to me.  I don't want to move the decimal.
B0097K21YW|3.0|Downloaded the game and requires little to no thinking. Great game to kill time on the bus heading to work.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Great book that takes a look at a world we can't see. A little dry but very informative. I highly recommend it.
B008NW67E0|5.0|my favorite  songs from Mumford & Sons almost daily listening recommend to anyone will not be disappointed with this purchase
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved 'The Room'.  The anticipation of what was going to open, close, spin, extend, shrink (you get the idea) next, was downright exciting.  This game was a pleasure from the start, and I want more.  Lots more!<br /> Challenging, but it's all right in front of you.  Just figure out what goes where to unlock the box step by step.  I had to start a chapter over because of a missed step-- I thought I would have to start the whole game over, but the Fireproof guys thought of that, too.  Very user friendly!<br />Congrats and heartfelt thanks go to the folks at Fireproof Games for a spectacular first effort. If they continue like this, they'll have plenty of eager customers ready to buy everything they put out.  Kindle Fire (2nd gen.-- played perfectly) users need more fresh games like this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|amc network was not my kind of channel till they came up with, walking dead, breaking bad and the killing. this type of shows are quality material. keep them coming amc
B001NHNG64|4.0|It's funny as I've never really been in to this genre before.  But the writing is smooth and smart.  I like the characters, and the storyline is intelligent and logical.  Looks like I will be buying more of these.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I've never played Mahjong before. Now I'm addicted and this app seems like a good one so far. Has many different levels and styles of games.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Excellent movie Mat plays the roll of a Linclon Town Car back seat lawyer great story line full of action this movie had me on the edge of my seat
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Wish I could sign in through the 'Game Center' on my Kindle instead of through Facebook.  I have the app on my iphone and am about to hit level 42.  On Kindle I have had to start over.  I love the game, but wish I could get the same level on both devices.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just recently started playing and I think the game is fun. It's better than any other hidden object game I've ever played
B008JFUO36|3.0|damn near nintendo quality, as bad as the CGI on any SyFy channel movie. Almost all CGI stands out like a sore thumb-except for certain uses. Bring back models...they look solid, like they have mass and \\"3dimensional\\" An example of one holdout for using models  is the film MOON<br /><br />and anything with Tom Cruise.......i better shut up
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I got this to help me catch up with missed episodes of the show, and with it in syndication now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book and think it is so sad and amazing. To me it is the best out of the 3.
B003L77GG0|5.0|wanted a copy of show since is in syndication and missed a lot of it because of job I had
B000069KE0|5.0|For young listeners, Chicago may be that band that plays a lot of love songs. But they should know that the band's first two albums were diverse--musically and politically--and featured some hard rock sounds. &#34;Chicago II&#34; is more coherent than the debut &#34;Chicago Transit Authority,&#34; so you may want to start here with outstanding songs like &#34;Wake up Sunshine,&#34; &#34;Colour My World&#34; and &#34;Make Me Smile.&#34;  A couple of lame tunes, but overall great.
B005ER6SNM|2.0|I'm not gonna rehash what a million other reviews have already stated. I seen this when it first came out and own the uncut version (why? I have no idea) and have no real idea why anybody finds it so disturbing. I love horror films but this isn't so much a horror flick as it is torture porn. If you removed the porn (and there IS porn in here) and the torture/rape scenes, there isn't much to watch. This movie tries SO hard to be over the top & I find the soundtrack to be very very annoying. I guess that was the point.<br /><br />I think this was supposed to be about what happened in The Balkan War to a certain extent, but I think that would have made a much more interesting movie. It just seemed to go for full on shock and exploitation, nothing more. I don't see how it was so well acted, although this is in no way a low budget movie. It's not in any way shape or form a typical B movie. The torture scenes (which was all the horror there was pretty much) could have easily been made more realistic if they had chosen to do so.<br /><br />Anyways, if you want to watch it watch it, but if you think it's going to be a horror movie, it's not. It's more like a sausagefest. If they cut maybe 10 minutes from this film, NOBODY would care about it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Craig is in great form as Bond. The script is witty and fun. I enjoyed the musical score as I usually do in Bond films.
B00005KAQP|5.0|Hilarious. My mom loves the singing nuns and the action. I hated the second one, my mom loved the second one. This one is a keeper.
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked this book much better than 50 Shades of Grey. I liked the story line and the relationship between Eva and Gideon.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I thought I wouldn't like this movie. I could not have been any more wrong. I loved this movie. My family, mom especially, loved this movie. It is superbly acted and makes you feel good.
B008J05EL8|2.0|Not enough guidance for using the app<br />I wouldn't  recommend this app to anyone I rate this app a two star for completely dis like
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra and Ryan are the perfect couple for this movie. It is very funny and I wish they would act more with each other. The chemistry was nice.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a really great movie. Plenty of action and adventure. Great life lesson movie!<br />Go see this movie, or better yet own a copy and watch it over and over again!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Deeply moving and superbly acted film. Extraordinary storytelling...made all the more so because it really happened. The Impossible brings you face-to-face with the most terrifying...and the most gracious...aspects of the human condition. Naomi Watts and all the children were brilliant!!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|My wife loves the show and so that is why I buy them.  I've never been a huge fan, but my wife loves it.
1451629192|5.0|I have actually owned this book for several months and have not read it til now.  I was only 5 years old when Jaycee was kidnapped so I really didn't remember her story.  I had though later in life read up on her story and knew who she was when I learned that she had been found 18 years later.<br /><br />I think this book is a must read.  And yes, I know it is not the best written book in the world, and I agree that it could have been better written with help, but I think what makes the book so great is that it is 100% Jaycee's voice and her story. It's a voice that was silent for far too long.  Jaycee is remarkably brave in sharing some horrific details of the abuse she endured at the hands of her kidnapper.  I know that had to have been so hard, but I'm so thankful she did this.  The world needs to know the truth of what these horrible people do.  Reading the story from the perspective of an 11 year old made it that much more heartbreaking.<br /><br />The real theme of this book is one of strength, and the power of the human spirit to overcome so much tragedy.  I think people don't give themselves the credit they deserve, and that there is so much we can overcome.  Jaycee is a testament to the potential for strength that we all have.  It was a privilege to read her story and all I can say is thank you to Jaycee for letting us read your story in your voice.  This book will change you if you let it.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie provided a better entertainment value than you would expect. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and recommend it to action fans.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Loved the whole album .  A good mix of music. Good vocal range.  Could do without the autotune.  Wouldn't mind hearing the unplugged version.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|You can guess the plot twists and see the movies direction. However, Mark delivers a good performance as usual and can entertain you for a watch.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book is the perfect mixture of drama, romance and inspiring heroism.the female protagonist, America singer is an inspirational protagonist will speak get mind even in the presence of a king
1401307450|5.0|This book is a bit dated now but provides humerus and deep insight into what made AK the singer and lyricist he is today.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|I received the set quickly and built it soon after getting it,  I added it to my current collection of Lord of the Ring Lego sets.  I love the difference in size of the hobbits to the humans.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|One of my favorite MW films. This has to be a \\"classic\\" in the near future for the quality of the film and edge of your seat action. Well done, well done.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great movie! I have watch it several times and so has my family. It is a collectors item as we continue to remember the attack on our country.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I saw the movie after I watched the show and was very pleased with the CGI story and acting in the movie!
B00004SYWZ|4.0|It was ten years between what has become my favorite A-ha album, \\"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\\", and seven years from the preceding and almost disappointing \\"Memorial Beach\\", that \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\" came out back in 2000.  I had such high hopes for this release and they were being met...on the first half of the album which starts off incredibly strong...but the second half of the album, while still bright and full of lush pop with some darker undertones woven throughout, felt like it began to sag.  After several listens this feeling increased with my thoughts about it drifting toward wondering if the latter album was comprised of b-side ideas (often times an artist's most interesting slice or two but with production lacking)?  I don't want to suggest that these latter songs aren't any good, they mostly vary between 3 or 4 stars, but they were overshadowed by the great first half and I felt it more and more for some reason.<br /><br />For the most part the songs are slickly produced and resonate with quiet undercurrents of lush verve; they are unhurried pieces of pop craft capped off with Morten Harkett's creamy sweet vocals.  But around track 7 (\\"The Company Man\\") the album, all A-ha, begins to feel as if the songs were either not quite finished or perhaps intended for different albums.  There was dissonance between them.  A good example of this is found between \\"I Wish I Cared\\" and the following track \\"Barely Hanging On\\" (and I like both of them) where the almost discordance of Harkett's singing on the chorus makes it feel like it was peeled from a different album than the previous falsetto sweet singing on the chorus of \\"I Wish I Cared\\".<br /><br />These are all small quips to be sure but I haven't felt this on their albums previously and have only noticed this on a few of my albums.  There's not a bad song here.  It's just that the strong first half makes the second half feel lackluster.<br /><br />Highlights of the album are the ablum opener \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\", the smooth as velvet \\"Velvet\\", the sad slow ocean pull of \\"To Let You Win\\", and Harkett's voice is near angelic on the chorus of \\"I Wish I Cared\\".  A-ha also makes good use of organic acoustic music interlaced with blips and swells of electronica.rth, Major Sky\\", the smooth as velvet \\"Velvet\\", the sad slow ocean pull of \\"To Let You Win\\", and Harkett's voice is near angelic on the chorus of \\"I Wish I Cared\\".

B00CDT41RY|5.0|At first I was a little put off after hearing mixed reviews about this movie but I have to tell you I was impressed. Quinny really knocked this one out of the park. A little long so I'm glad I watched it at home but pretty damn good!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I overclocked it just a little since I have a Z board with water cooling and this thing does everything I need it to do.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game so cool and is so action packed with fun that everyone will enjoy. It is truly awesome and great.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I know it sounds crazy to hear that something so small can make a huge difference but it can!  I removed the pre-applied paste that came on my watercooler pump just to apply this.  Well worth it!
193700788X|5.0|Glad to have received my final Sookie book.  Will miss the new stories, I've enjoyed this series very much.  Happy with the ending.
B0009VSB06|5.0|My husband said it was just what he wanted.  Works great and easy to assemble and use.<br />We are now three pennies richer.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Season 5 had great acting, scenery, etc.  I just hate to see it end.  I thought in the Arthur story line he ruled Camelot awhile and then sought the Holy Grail.  Merlin continued to counsel him.  Arthur was just too young to die!
1936594234|4.0|There's very good reminders about being a positive thinker and building that thought process. Nothing more needs to said except to live/act accordingly.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Hope there is a season 4!  Just love the setting and the attention to detail of the sets.  The actors are wonderful.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I hadn't read a sookie novel in awhile, so I really enjoyed this. It was a little light on the plot, without the customary intrigue we're used to, but I enjoyed seeing the old faces and finding resolution. Yes, maybe everything was wrapped up just a little too perfectly- we know Eric wouldn't have gone that quietly- but I think sookie deserved a happy, uncomplicated ending, so I'm ok with it.
0812983459|5.0|I loved the story line and the characters in this book.  A great story of forgiveness of others and oneself.
B001NXDSLQ|1.0|Very disappointing!  Was expecting the additional footage to be more of headlining performers.  Turned out to be the tour/showing of the museum.  Don't waste your money on this one...unless you want to see a few minutes inside the museum.
B00785P2QC|5.0|absolutely have fun with this game yeah! I enjoy that I can build my own city the way I want it I justbwish that the landmarks and some of the buildings are too expensive
B00AEFYCDW|5.0|I believe, like it or not, there is a little of Chris in all of us. Read this book. Keep an open and honest mind and live this story like you probably wanted to back when.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|works pretty much as advertised. nice. simple. reliable and free. what more can you ask for in an alarm clock app?
1604680547|5.0|I would recommend this book to all of those who love the art of quilting! It has lots of patterns and ideas for  quilts.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie is definitely worthy of buying.  I can't wait for the sequel.  All stories in this series are excellent.
B0094K1JPC|2.0|I guess I just don't like Harisson Ford as a grumpy old man.  His co-host was a bit over the top.  I've seen her do better.  I almost liked the main character and her boyfriend.  Too bad the story wasn't better.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|It certainly boosts the audio on my tablet...not as much as I'd like for use on an airplane but the audio went from &#34;can't hear it at all&#34; to &#34;atleast I can make out the dialog.&#34;
B009GJBBDQ|5.0|I believe this was one of the best bond movies Pierce Brosnan made.  The tech was a thrill and in true Bond style.  I enjoyed it from the first chase to the last.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Always loved this game. A lot better on a real arcade game, but still fun to bring back the memories. Sorry the little pac-man would not go in the direction you wanted it to all the time but it was still fun to go back in the day!!
193700788X|1.0|I cannot believe I spent almost three years buying, reading and then rereading the SVM books, only to read this boring bulls-t end to it all. I wish I had never heard of Sookie and Bon Temps. I wish I had spent my time reading something else and I REALLY wish I had never given Charlaine Harris a single cent of my money! If I could return the books I would, but alas - I have to settle for simply throwing them in the trash.
B008XFJEE2|4.0|Gutzy, saw this years ago and was intrigued, felt sorry for Kim being in that position. A lot has changed since the last I saw it. As far as the way I feel about relationships. Would never fall now for such a person!!
B001V7UXG2|4.0|If you enjoyed them in &#34;Blackadder&#34;, then &#34;Jeeves and Wooster&#34; is a must.  Hugh Laurie is wonderful as the bumbling Wooster, and Stephen Fry is likewise amazing as the wise Jeeves.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I like the twist the author put in this book. I was not prepared for how it ended. I definitely would like to discuss this book in my book club meeting.
B004EPYZOY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much even though it was an accident how I got the movie I thought I was ordering another movie & ended up with drive angry it turn out well
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I purchased  this for a 7 year old who doesn't like most traditional games but loves music. The game works very well and it's easy for him to follow. I would recommend this app.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Great book in the beginning, started to get boring though the second half of the book. A must read though, I learned a lot from this book.
B0039208JE|5.0|Renewed my love of Batman, so glad that this and Batman Returns were made. Wished Michael Keaton had been in the Batman Movies instead of George Clooney and Val Kilmer.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I don't know if Fall Out Boy have saved rock and roll, but it's entertaining to listen to them try. Definitely a must-own for Fall Out Boy fans and anyone who enjoys arena rock will enjoy it as well.
B000P0J06U|5.0|Love the Batman movies with Michael Keaton in them, don't know why they went to George Clooney and Val Kilmer.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|This is a classic. I'm from Chicago and I never tire of the movie or the wonderful cast. It's fun to see how far they've all come.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you enjoy BBC Period Dramas this is a must see. Armitage and Denby-Ashe are subtle and completely real as the two leads. The supporting cast is superb as well. The locations are stunning and the story is a true classic! Thoroughly enjoyable!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Can't believe it is the last Skokie book...I will miss Eric, Bill, Tera and Sookie... Pam and Jason...long live Fangtasia...hoping and praying for a follow up series......
B005LAII3U|4.0|Has very little to do with the original. Much more action and visual effects. I found it very well made and entertaning.
B001NA2NM4|5.0|This has to be one of the most creepiest movies that I have ever seen. Not much make up was used by the characters because the movie studio used real people from the freak shows of the 1920's - 1930's. I'm surprised that this movie isn't played on Halloween.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Another well made childrens movie. The artwork is very good and the music is great. I just love Kelly MacDonald.
B00C4QWDYY|2.0|I love this series, but season 3 isn't the greatest. The last episode is a huge letdown. Nothing big really happens, except that the person you're sick of watching finally dies. Keep your $1.99 and buy a candy bar, you'll be more satisfied.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Very contrived, predictable.  Over-acted.  It's really an insult to audiences.  I would not recommend this to anyone at all, ever.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|This movie was awful. It is cheesy and not scary in the slightest. I laughed a lot at the goofy effects. The little girl is creepier than \\"Mama\\", who looks ridiculous.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|So far its protecting my phone and no issues. I did have to purchase a new charger from Apple since the case requires a thinner one. Other than that, love it! Much better than Otterbox.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|The  story was well developed until the fist time they have sex, after that it was  just weird it lost the momentum and appealing for me, and I could not read it anymore
B003MC5N28|5.0|Just finished reading this book and I loved it, the story is very interesting very well written, I also loved that the book is just as lengthy as it needs to be, while some other authors try to make the book unnecessarily lengthy including boring and excessive details I found this book just perfect, it does deepens on details that are important for the story but not exaggerating to the point where you no longer remember what the initial idea was. I loved the characters as well, mainly Jonas and the story has a great message at the end, I will definitely read it again!
B0013816GK|5.0|I belong to a choral group which was scheduled to perform this work.  I needed a cd to help me prepare.  Having never sung this  and not knowing whether I'd like the piece, I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I read many reviews on this as well as other cds from people acquainted with other recordings of this work before making my decision.  I was not disappointed.  The more I listened to it, the more I grew to love it.  It is a keeper.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I thought from the previews that this movie would be adequate at best, but I really enjoyed it and ended up laughing out loud several times.  It was a good story for the kids with a lot of throwbacks and typical winks toward the adults.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I saw this movie twice in the movie theater.  The story, the intensity of the colors, and, if you research it, the length of time it took to bring this movie to fruition are incredible.  It was filmed in 18 locations around the world.  WONDERFUL!
0143121006|5.0|a richly written account of a young American expat that is found dead near the American living complex in Peking near the turn of the century.  This book will totally engross the reader and transport him to another time and place.  I loved all the side stories and would recommend this to any reader looking to escape the here and now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great. no changes needed! except I think that it should be the free app of the day once. so then, more people will get to play it. so then they will tell their friends about it. and even MORE people will buy the app. so I think that someone should make it the free app of the day.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Gone Girl built you up with anticipation of a satisfying ending...There was none to be found...the main character was a twit as was her husband...it did not have to be a happy ending, but for your invested time the author needed to supply for her reader an ending. Flynn is talented, but needs to revisit delivering great endings to her fans...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|WOW! Great intellectual game. No mind numbing allowed here. I enjoyed it very much, took my time playing so it was worth every penny. I will look forward to more like this.
B005LAII80|1.0|Of the few times the disc actually loads to the menu, I can never get through the first half of the movie before it freezes (both 2D and 3D).  Based on research, it is a manufacture defect with the disc.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This  linkin park cd is a replacement of one bought years back. nice to have it again. Like the 90's music.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Received early, in good shape. The batteries were fresh and they're working fine. They are for my car key fob, it was cheaper to order five than to buy one locally.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is an amazing movie I had watced it years ago and enjoyed it. I got to thinking about it and wanting my teenaged Grandson to see it. He did and he love it too. Great movie
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I have only had for a couple of days, but thus far appears to meet my needs.<br /><br />Thanks for another great app.<br />John H. Kuhl
B00BDZV7WQ|5.0|I think the was he is clear spoken and a very good rapper, I would say one of the top two.rappers and this one of his best CDs.
B001974DG0|5.0|I read this, literally, the day it was published in hardcover in the 80s. I remember buying it at a Waldenbooks. I was so eager to read it that I opened it up in the car when my parents were driving me home, and kept reading despite getting carsick and having one too many Mrs. Field's white chocolate macadamia cookies. Luckily, I got home in time not to get any sicker, and kept reading away. This is most definitely a chase novel. While the formula may sound familiar to long time Koontz readers (drifter/hero teams up with super intelligent dog to fight evil monster created by the government) it is one of his best. Just don't see the movies spawned from this masterpiece since they're not worth the time. But spending a day with Watchers, the novel, is time very well spent.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I first bought this movie when it came out many years ago. But someone took it and many other movies when I had a break in. I have been looking for it and happily found it here and reordered it. If you have not seem this movie you really need to give it a try.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I would like to read more adventures and less sex. The tantalising nature of the first and second book left me hanging on what flirtatious, but elusive, act was going to happen next. I loved \\"the cat and mouse\\" actions of the first two books. That intrigued me more than the sex. Left me wanting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just like the original.  What else can you say?  Plays just like the original card game you played growing up.
B001BR5NH6|5.0|Best 80's flick ever made.  Who doesn't love Kelly Le Brock, and of course Bill Paxton in his best role ever as Chet?
0553584537|3.0|I read this book after reading Catch Me.  I am not sure I enjoyed it as much .  If all of her D.D. Warren novels involve children.  Not sure I will read the rest.  There was too much going on, for the story to flow, and the same old stuff was repeated over and over.
B005NFJAZS|3.0|I liked this movie when i was a kid, but found it to be boring.  I will watch it again
0307352145|4.0|should read it,very informativeshould read it, you learn a lot from/this book. I will recommend it to everyone interested in non fiction books.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Reading this book was like reading a second-grader's book report about what could have been an interesting story, but written in first person.  For half the book I felt as if Amazon were playing some kind of joke on me and that this book was written by outsourced writers with minimal command of the English language.  It clearly hadn't been edited.<br /><br />In addition to the horrible writing, the book was filled with shallow characters who had inconsistent motivations that really didn't make any sense.  The storyline and timeline didn't make any sense either.<br /><br />I guess the only bright point I can give it is that the setting was interesting.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|This opened my eyes to the gruesome realities of WW2. It highlighted that humanity and civilization can be poles apart in times of such strife.
B005ES0XVO|4.0|If I don't use the heel strap, these are the perfect fit. When I use the heel strap, I need to be wearing socks. The strap pulls the shoe up against my toes and scrunches them up in the front. This also caused my toe to rub on the top of the shoe after walking for a while.<br />Simple fix to just not wear the strap.<br />Maybe I'll try stretching out the strap by putting something in the shoe while I'm not wearing it. Perhaps that would help.<br />Loses a star due to the strap issue; otherwise, it's the perfect fit.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very relaxing but fun game. Only played afew of the games, but eventually will play more. Hopefully new games will be put on when updates occur.
B00BMT9SQA|4.0|This was a heart warming film with just enough humor to keep the pace moving towards the end! It did make me realize things about my son which made me sad but also more understanding! I really did love this film and will watch it again and again!!!
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Boring - never took off, left me uninterested and I really was never curious as to how the story would end.  Boring.
B000059LGC|5.0|I hope my mother likes this movie. She loves Aagatha Christi's novels and she really liked the movie, Death on the Nile.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy to read, this compelling story does justice to the superhero in this futuristic thriller.  I think it also transcends age definitions as I am a middle aged woman.  I will definitely read more.
B007RI56NY|3.0|the album was alright thouht id try out A NEW genre but i guess i should be writing a review if i don't like the genre to much
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|I like radio and being able to switch from Pandora to AccuRadio is very cool and fits my life style exactly. I recommend AccuRadio for Kindle Fire because it is free, and easy to set up and use.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|great screen worked very well and can review everything and delete if you need more room while your out on the move
B00BF11STU|5.0|I liked this movie in all respects and disliked none of it. Especially poignant was the expression of loneliness at the very end of the show that is what I'm recalling now after two weeks or more since my viewing of it. That is what Seals is really developing in the annals of American military action; the loneliness of the decision maker at home and the action taker on the front lines.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|My grandson requested this for Christmas. He enjoyed the series when it appeared on television and wanted a copy of his own. Perfect for the animal enthusiast who can take the whole predator - prey relationship.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fyi you can play without paying people. Its hidden object with a twist.  whoever created this game has an amazing imagination!!  keep it up.
006114665X|2.0|This is a difficult review to compose.  The difficulty lies in the fact that Professor Clark starts off very well.  He covers the deep political background of the war thoroughly. He lays out the tangled rivalries, ambitions, agendas and animosities in a manner that gives the reader a good understanding of the historical context within which the 1914 assassination crisis will unfold.  The first 2/3rds of the book rate a solid 4 to 5 stars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things go downhill after that.<br /><br />I think that we have to start by drawing a critical distinction.  Deep historical background is just that... deep historical background.  It doesn't explain HOW or WHY a particular event escalates from being a potentially resolvable diplomatic crisis into a war, it only describes the context in which this transformation occurs.  Bitter rivalries can persist for decades without crossing the threshold into war.  The transformation to war requires specific choices, made by specific actors, made within a specific timeline.  The sword doesn't come out of the scabbard without someone deciding to draw it.<br /><br />If we are going to attempt to answer the question \\"How Europe went to War in 1914\\", then there's no way that we can shy away from focusing on the questions of which specific choices, made by which specific actors, at which specific points in time, resulted in the threshold to war being crossed, thereby opening the door to further escalation.  The assignment of responsibility/guilt is not a prerequisite of answering the question \\"How Europe went to War in 1914\\", but we must allow that it is a possible outcome of our pursuit of the available evidence.  There is no analytical value in avoiding questions of responsibility/guilt if doing so begins to bias your pursuit of the question you are attempting to address.<br /><br />The assignment of responsibility/guilt is something with which Professor Clark is not comfortable.  In this context, he acknowledges the Fischer thesis/school, which does assign responsibility, but makes no concerted effort to come to grips with it.  Instead, Clark simply writes, \\"Recent studies of the resulting Fischer controversy have highlighted the links between this debate and the fraught process by which German intellectuals came to terms with the contaminating moral legacy of the Nazi era, and Fischer's arguments have been subjected to criticism on many points\\"  Pardon me, but SO WHAT?!  The point is utterly irrelevant.  A far more pertinent question is what about the mountain of documentary evidence Fischer assembled to support his argument?  Forget the \\"Fischer controversy\\", it's the evidence that requires our attention -- the cables, the letters, the memoranda, all of which are produced during the crisis by the actual participants in the crisis.<br /><br />The problem is that I think that in his fervent desire to steer clear of the \\"blame game\\"/Fischer controversy, Professor Clark failed to spend enough time assimilating the full weight of Fischer's evidence or its implications.  The point is that the documentary evidence makes it very clear that the \\"sleepwalking\\" thesis is not tenable.  Decision-makers in Germany and Austro-Hungary knew well in advance that they would be crossing the threshold into armed conflict, and that crossing would be made by choice.  They had ample time to change course if they so desired.  There is ample evidence of bad faith.  There's no \\"sleepwalking\\" going on here.  There's a valid question about the ultimate personal intentions of Wilhelm II.  There's a valid question about whether particular individuals  expected the war to expand as far as it did.  However, there's no sleepwalking with respect to the decision to go to war with Serbia.<br /><br />Do the other states share equivalent responsibility?  Do they all carry their own \\"smoking guns\\" as Professor Clark claims?<br /><br />Here I have to ask a question...<br /><br />What specific choice or action did any ofthe other powers undertake which precluded the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the assassination crisis between the assassination on June 28, and the July 23 publication of Austro-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia?  Remember, without the ultimatum, subsequent actions by the other powers become moot.  There is no context for response, no reason to consider mobilization.  So what, if anything, did they do that made a peaceful resolution of the crisis impossible?  What we have to remember is that just because they had their own ambitions, agendas, hatreds, or contingency plans, doesn't mean that they're guilty of pushing the baby over the cliff.<br /><br />The thing is, it really does make a difference.  If people absorb the meme that the First World War is an accidental war brought about miscalculation, militarism, and rivalries run amok, it fosters one set of suppositions about war and peace-keeping.  However, if it's understood as a war of choice, a whole different set of lessons recommend themselves.
B00006I53S|3.0|It is a great lens but<br /><br />- Expect some slight play in the two-part extension of the barrel, expect focus and zoom rings that are not silky-smooth, at first I though it was broken, but then I've found out that it is typical from this lens.<br />- The manual focus ring is small/narrow and requires familiarity to quickly find it while shooting.<br />- No focal length lock is present - expect zoom-creep/gravity-zooming when carrying this lens in a downward position.<br /><br />Good price for the quality of picture, I'm happy.
B009CGKW10|1.0|Terrible grainy quality. Blurry, could hardly watch it. Not anywhere near HD. I would not suggest, sorry. First purchase on Amazon that didn't impress.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this is a good game I enjoy playing this game hope other people enjoy it as much as I do.would recommend it to everyone
B00BN4R7LC|4.0|Tom Cruise has always been the stereotypical pretty boy good guy in his films. Yeah he is type cast. In this movie he plays the complete opposite. That is very refreshing. This isn't the greatest film but it's not the worst either. Jaimie Fox does a very good job as well. The effort that both actors put into preparing for their respective roles is astounding. I recommend this film.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun and accurate game, great graphics! Some aspects of money and energy use within the game are frustrating but only minor. Best free game I've ever played!!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|awesome and entertaining, uplifting for the entire family. Great for men to find examples of what a father and husband should be.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|In which &#34;gods&#34; are souped-up beings with mastery over various sets of skills, able to draw and use magical &#34;power&#34; in various forms - and there's one wild-card last Druid that gets a sexy apprentice. Mostly light-hearted, dripping lots of quirky humor.
B009IKKYOK|4.0|Love Putumayo, their collections are always great and I'm rarely disappointed.  Nice mix of slow mediative along a few faster tempo songs which is nice if you're using this for a quicker paced yoga class.
B00BMQDM10|4.0|Not my favourite of her books. Took a bit to get into the story and felt a bit rushed. However, it was a fun and light read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Emotional and unpredictable, mockingjay is a solid piece of writing that  tells the final chapters in the Hunger Games trilogy.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The story is fantastic and the descriptions put you in the raft, living the adventure with Pi. It is really hard to put down.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|Cant wait for this release! But the price is a bit inflated, will wait to purchase when you lower the price. This season was creative but not as original as the first season, which makes since. Here's to season 3
B002BU0DPE|4.0|comfortable to wear for extended periods. Inline volume control module seems a little flimsy but time will tell how well it holds up. I haven't had much luck with headsets over the long haul, usually the mic fails or the headphone fails or becomes annoyingly intermittent. We'll see how long this one holds up over time.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|&#34;Life of Pi&#34; transcends the concept of a story with a theme. It clearly demonstrates the existence of God. It's also wonderful storytelling. I believe this accounts for why it is so popular.<br /><br />For a movie to appeal to my senses it must be about something that is not only interesting but that I would never expect to see happen in my everyday life. &#34;Life of Pi&#34; meets both of those criteria. To see wild animals on a lifeboat, and then to see a young man co-exist with a ferocious tiger on that lifeboat, and then to see both survive for many months while adrift in the middle of the ocean, simply defied my imagination.<br /><br />The plot, although fantastic, is very well developed and proceeds logically, which adds to the credibility of the story. Reality is represented by mathematics and a traditional religious belief, which eventually gives way to a belief in a universal concept of the divine. In other words, it may not be enough to believe in only one religion anymore. By his becoming a follower of three religions, Pi's life is transformed. He demonstrates his universality throughout the story.<br /><br />The basic plot of the story is one that many people might have thought of or written about. However, Yann Martel told this story in such a way as to make it more believable than if the plot were simply concocted from his imagination. All entities are equal when pitted against the forces of nature. It required a profound belief in God by Pi to enable him and his tiger companion to overcome enormous odds against their survival. The author brought this out in the story very well.
B008MM9630|5.0|I'm not usually big on creating farms, cities, and stuff but this actually kept me interested in it enough to keep playing and returning for more fun. I also like that u can keep in touch with other people as well on the mobile/fb thank keep up the good work
B0095G5AFU|3.0|I really do like this app, however ever since the new update I'm unable to change the font styles for my notebooks. I would give it five stars if they brought this option back.
B009KWU6Q2|3.0|my kids liked the movie. . . . . I remember watching this as a teen and it was pretty good then and I still enjoyed it now with my kids
1572815108|5.0|Why is this deck rated so well? Does that mean you should buy it?<br />All the 5 star ratings are about more than the Deck's physical quality.<br /><br />So two quick reviews. One for the casual purchaser; another review for the student of esoteric religions.<br /><br />If you are looking to read peoples fortunes at parties or other spooky and fun activities this is a good deck to have. This deck is of a higher physical quality than most. The cards are smooth without being over-glossed and very sturdy.  Also, the images are psychologically sophisticated and will give a good impression. But if you think it's ugly buy another deck. The motivations behind all the 5 star reviews don't necessarily apply to you.  When looking at other decks take care to look for the quality of the card printing and cutting.<br /><br />So why all the perfect reviews?<br />Many of us believe that if you're looking to study esoteric philosophy; there is no better deck. If you believe in the collective unconscious and are looking to understand that part of yourself ; there is no better deck. If you're into transcendental meditation, alchemy, rosicrucianism; there is no better deck. And if you're interested in ritual magick this is an invaluable tool.<br /><br />Why? Not really a conversation for amazon. But if you're a dedicated seeker of wisdom trust the reviews and just buy the thing. Every time it blows your mind, it blows it thoroughly.
1451620829|5.0|Such a personal and up close read of one of America's greatest drummers.  Some interesting insights to Peter and Kiss.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|The ending is ok but the mix of men characters and their portryal is a little short from reality. Could be better
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was a great book. I found it very hard to put down. Not just because of the romance but the sheer suspense of what could happen next. Definitely a book worth reading for a mature book enthusiast!
0385349947|4.0|I was lucky enough to get the book pretty quickly from the library ( there was 80 other people on the wait list). I dove into the book very excited!  I read each chapter with gusto and lots of nodding. Lean in is a well written and heavily supported by facts. The personal stories that Sheryl shared were really the golden nuggets for me. I wish she had shared more, especially with respect to raising two kids.<br />After reading the book, I came away feeling like I knew lots on the background about gender inequalities how we do need women in leadership roles. However you also come away with  how remarkably smooth sailing it was that Sheryl got to where she was. She is obviously smart and a go -getter, no wonder she is so successful.<br />While the book is great and I learnt alot, I do however have this ounce of \\"batting eyelids\\" and \\" rolling eyes\\" . why ? well she makes it looks easy. It seems like she has it all...money, kids, supportive family and a job she loves). Sheryl has no shortage of an amazing network of people ( look at the acknowledgement). It started out in university when Larry Summers mentored her.  Throughout her career, she was placed with great people, who seem to love her and her work. Her smooth journey, it seems is all too easy. Where were her trials? Her hardships? I mean things that make you say...wow...she overcame that obstacle!<br />While the book is a good read overall, her golden story is far from relatable to the everyday women who want to take leadership roles.

0142419400|4.0|I had heard so much hype about this book that when I finally got a chance to get my hands on it, I couldn't resist.  I am a sucker for YA Contemporary Romance so there was no reason for me not to read it.<br /><br />Well...I was immediately sucked into the story line and read it every chance that I got.  I have to admit that the writing style irked me a little bit at first, though I'm not exactly sure why.  I loved the characters, the setting and the story so much that Anna and The French Kiss was a very quick read for me.<br /><br />I don't think I'm as crazy about it as a lot of people are, but I can't deny that it was a damn good YA Contemporary.  I would definitely read it again.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It is a series that can be watched again and again and something new always catches my eye.  It seems new each time I watch.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I am a huge joe bonamassa fan I have every concert dvd he's put out and this is one of my favorites its a lot like the borderline disk he's playing as a 3 piece band he also plays a fender on several songs. The version of blues deluxe on this disk is amazing I think joe bonamassa is one of the best gitarist I have ever seen this disk has a amazing dts 5.1 soundtrack on it. This is a great disk for a fan of joe bonamassa or any blues fans . Or any one who appreciates good music

B000FFJYCU|5.0|this is the greatest and most authentic motor sport movie ever made.<br />i doubt it will ever be bettered due to the crass commercialism of motor sport today
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I could never imagine a world so depraved.  This movie is really too far beyond even a stretch of the imagination.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie... I was so excited and then so disappointed there were some slightly funny parts but the majority of it was just raunchy.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have seen many a zombie movie and read more than my share of books, but I must say that this approach is different from anything else. It deals with the global politics and the difficulties of fighting and killing something that is already dead. I don't want to give away too much, so I'll leave it at that. It does make me wonder how it is going to translate into a movie.
0307956350|5.0|The number of twists and turns in this novel make it a page turner to the very last sentence.  The author does an amazing job of creating the characters as believable.....a challenge given the storyline.  Kate and Dexter have been married for 10 years, have two children and live on the outskirts of Washington, DC.  That is where the commonality with most readers ends.  Kate has been a field officer for the CIA having done all such a position entails, and since her first child was born, an analyst for them.  Dexter thinks she works for the State Department.  Dexter, on the other hand has secrets of his own that Kate can't even begin to guess at.  One day Dexter arrives home telling Kate he has a marvelous job in Luxembourg and they are moving.  She sees this as a chance to become a fulltime Mother and have the exciting life of an ex-pat.  Leaving the Agency is difficult enough but under these circumstances, exceptionally difficult.  Nonetheless, she resigns and they move to Luxembourg.  Kate finds herself lonely and bored, and Dexter is traveling all of the time.  She makes friends with another couple and soon realizes they are there to investigate \\"someone\\".  Is that Kate for her deeds with the CIA or Dexter for reasons she cannot imagine?  And the plot twists and turns from there until the surprising conclusion.  A book worth reading.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This version does not follow the book as closly as it could have. Some of the changes were delightful and effective such as the scene when Elizabeth and Darcy meet at Pemberly but a change it was from the real story.  Because of the actors in this version it has become my favorite.
B003X8597K|4.0|I call it that because there's not much here to really love.  For one thing, it takes a tale set in ancient Rome and puts it in a II World War type setting, transforming the typical Wagner grand vision into an anti-fascist fable.  But for me it works.  And in a way, even makes the piece more acceptable.  This was Wagner in his youth, when spectacle and soaring melodies were his gods, but still a bit beyond his reach.  The original opera ran over some five hours, and that would have been pretty unbearable to me.  There is frankly only one really memorable song in the piece, but what a melody.  Sung by the hero Rienzi, a Juan Peron type despot, it is the prayer of a self-deluded man who dies in ruins.  I didn't believe his sincerity for a minute, but I did believe his pain.  This Rienzi is the Reader's Digest version, but it still runs around three hours long.  It is visually satisfying and the performance is first class singing.  As drama it is inclined to be static - but Wagner is usually far more interested in music than in action.  He gets better about that in his later masterpieces.  (I understand this was one opera he banned from his opera house in Bayreut as not up to his mature standards.)  But if you love Wagner, and always wonder about the neglected opera, here's as satisfying a way to sample it as you could find.  I give four stars, not because I have any problem with the performance, only because I believe Wagner was right.  This will never be an opera I would be willing to say I love.
B00005MP58|5.0|I liked the fact that this version follows the book very well.  The female leads were not as effective as Keira Knightley, et al, but certainly worth viewing again and again.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son in law to go with the other series. It's awesome! It's the top of the mark.
B000I9YLWG|5.0|One of the greatest films in the history of cinema.  Everyone should see this movie at least once before they die.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I love this fim and it shows just what can actually happen, or maybe has happened with mind control. Hey, maybe they got me?! ; )
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This app is so cool! You can fly and shoot just like iron man!!! It is so cool!!! Although it requires an additional download it is an awesome app if you love Tony Stark as much as I do!!!
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This is an awesome album, you will be soothed, inspired, spiritually charged as you listen to these recordings and watch the live performances.  God bless!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Before purchasing this unit I had tried two other, competing versions, both of which suffered serious flaws (one had an inherent exposure problem and the other suffered from unwanted vignetting).  This unit produces satisfactory results.  It is also simpler (thus easier) to use for 35mm slides (my only concern) because one simply places each slide into a slot on the top: you do NOT have to pre-load several slides into a carrier frame (and then empty and reload the that frame.)<br />All such 35mm slide &#34;scanners&#34; will lose a small amount of the original slide (or film) area (to avoid including part of the frame in the copy.)<br />As with the first two versions I had purchased, the documentation could be improved but it is much superior to that provided by the others.<br />For anyone owning a good, high resolution DSLR camera with macro capability I would suggest looking into purchasing a 35mm slide copying attachment for it instead.  The cost would be similar, but the results might be better.  They are readily available for Nikon, Canon, Sony, etc.  This will give you complete exposure, white balance and area control.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|The most boring, overrated, overacted, and suffocating movie in my experience! For this opinion, I must give it at least one star for computer acceptance. Actually, I give it no stars!
0307949486|5.0|Spoilers.<br /><br />Oddly I read [[ASIN:0307949508 The Girl Who Played with Fire]] first, but on the strength of that went back to the insanely popular original. Having been burnt before I'm a bit shy of blockbusters, but this is a different league to, say, a Tom Clancy. Despite extreme characters (murderers, Nazis, captains of industry, super-hackers, celebrity journalists), Larsson manages to keep relative plausibility for this genre, and supposedly smart characters don't generally do stupid things. Consider the spell woven: even though I had some pretty serious spoilers from having read the sequel, I still was thoroughly engaged: as a thriller is meant to, it got me in. In hindsight I'm not exactly sure how: the characters are generally as cold and spare as the extreme northern Swedish setting. There's nothing playful or warm, and just about all the characters are pretty meticulous. It fits that most of the times we meet the killer he is articulate and controlled, and even his barbarities are painstakingly organised and carefully categorised in a separate section to his public life. This lack of emotion and obsessive order became more clear to me when, coincidentally, I watched part of one of the movie versions which happened to be broadcast a few days after I'd finished the book. I wondered how well this would work as film with everyone so stark, controlled and emotionless. Yet the book is not merely an intellectual exercise: Larsson punctuates the story with atrocities and apposite vengeance.<br /><br />There are a few other distinctives, such as the `protagonist' title moving freely between Blomkvist and Salander - again an unusual approach. The contempt for misogyny is unsubtly foregrounded, but there is an odd mix of sympathy for victims and the demand that victims step up and take power back. I enjoyed the way that Larsson drew so much of his story from areas that he was professionally familiar with (cf. David Lodge) - publishing, business journalism, computing, Swedish politics and landscape - so authenticity and even passion were a natural part of the text.<br /><br />Funny how several of the books that I give a higher rating I have less to say about. I more just know that I was hooked and entertained while reading, and satisfied when I finished - and this is not such a common experience. So nice to not be insulted. Perhaps I'm more wired to have to articulate/purge what grated than what didn't.uting, Swedish politics and landscape - so authenticity and even passion were a natural part of the text.<br /><br />Funny how several of the books that I give a higher rating I have less to say about.

B005R32L66|5.0|I have never used Skype before this weekend.  My long distance girlfriend and I watched a movie togther it worked great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the way it captures you  in to the trama. Situations are really intetesting, and  even when it is an erotic book you will pass over that wanting to know more, and more about Christian and Ana relation. Watching that handsome man give out everything he is for Ana just tells you it' all about  love.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The photography was incredible......it was enchanting, something for the whole family to enjoy. Worth seeing , you will want to have this one in your library.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's rare to find something with solid moral character in this cultural landscape, but this is a gem. Nothing like the end of the world to serve up an excellent dose of the art of manliness. Drinks like a fine Kentucky bourbon, a 16 year old Hirsch Reserve of its genre.
0099581876|2.0|I have read The Redbreast,The Nemesis,The Devils Star,The redeemer and The Snowman.<br /><br />All the above are good but The Nemesis was a waste of time.<br /><br />After the above i tried to read The Bat which was the first Novel he wrote in 1997.It was a total struggle to read.He wrote about many things that were totally irrelevent to the murder.More about Australias native culture.Also the story was not practical.<br /><br />In the end i gave up reading.<br /><br />I am surprised he could write great novels like those above and so a vast improvement from his first efforts.<br /><br />He is still a long way away from Stieg Larsson and Cmaila Lackberg.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN YEARS!  RIVETING, SUPER FUNNY, POIGNANT<br />AND MEMORABLE.<br /><br />WOULD RECOMMEND  &#34;THE INTOUCHABLES&#34;  TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE!<br />IT'S A MUST SEE!  YOU WILL FIND IT UNFORGETTABLE!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is fun when it's working properly.  If they'd fix the issues with the existing content rather than continuing to add new rooms, they might get more people willing to pay to play.
B005K17RU0|4.0|we love the accuracy, and able to find info quickly,  but the warnings were coming in so often with updates to location weather, that we turned the alerts off
0670024813|3.0|Continues the literary prowess of a great author.  He's very specific about the anthropologic view, and I would consider it an excellent collegiate course text.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I love watching this with my daughter, although I really want to beat the parents up.<br /><br />until next time Matilda
B0097K21YW|4.0|this is a fun game for adults and kids ......we are enjoying it on the tablet so its on the go with us
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|This look like a good Bourne-like flic when advertised and Cruise's mission impossible series leads one to think this fits. Unfortunately it doesn't. Needless blood, Cruise is too smart and everyone else is too dumb. Mission impossible flics have much better plots and acting and suspense.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Its easy to move around in.<br />It is not worth buying any pearls in this game, because if you lose your data or your kindle stops working; then you've lost all your monies and levels.  Very frustrating.<br />Other than that I Enjoyed playing.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Every time I read a Sophie Kinsella book I know it will be good. Light and easy reading, perfect for by the pool!
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|According to my son, it tracks the book pretty well.  It entertained 7 and 9 year old boys, despite being a &#34;girl movie.&#34;  Danny Devito's acting is a bit over the top, and Pee Wee Herman was campy as ever, but I guess that's the style they were trying to hit.  It's a fun movie, and has a feel good ending.  Good family stuff.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Another great game from the G5 crew! Great story line. I always look forward to see what new games they will have.
1250012570|4.0|For more information, visit my blog, Such A Novel Idea.<br />[...]<br /><br />Why You Should Buy It<br /><br />The contemporary YA book has been praised by John Green, and even though it is set in the late 80′s, it will resonate with teens and adults alike.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />The first thing I love about this book is that it is set in the mid-eighties. As a child of the eighties, it was so fun to read about kids who worried about batteries (for their walkman), knew what a tape deck was and lived in a world without the technology of today.<br /><br />The second thing I love about this book is the music. The book reminded me of Perks of Wallflower in that respect. In fact, it drew a lot of similarities of Perks. But while Perks was focused on finding yourself, Eleanor & Park was focused on the blossoming relationship of two teenage misfits. The two are smart, funny, and nothing what you would expect from a `typical' protagonist. Eleanor is a tall, redhead who never wore makeup and deals with family issues so ridiculous it will make you cry at times. Park is half-Korean and while he doesn't get singled out like Eleanor does immediately, he by no means fits in. The two together are... adorable.<br /><br />The culmination of this book was something I NEVER saw coming, and it shocked me in a way that I didn't expect. I read so much that USUALLY I can pick up on the plot line pretty quickly, but this one somehow escaped me.<br /><br />On a personal note, one of Eleanor's siblings (the `baby') was two while this book progressed. I began to think about what that meant and realized that I was two in 1986. That was a bit of a mind trip for me.<br /><br />The book is about teenage love, but underneath it is about finding someone who makes you see yourself more clearly... a first love that we all wish we could have had. While there are some darker themes tackled, you will find yourself head over heels for these two misfits.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />Four out of Five Starsof Five Stars
0385349947|3.0|While there's an undeniable gender gap in the workplace that needs to be remedied, Sandberg's ideas are somewhat suspect.  She exhorts women to be assertive, but her advice/platitudes fail to account for practical issues that most non-billionaire working women (many of whom are single mothers) face on a daily basis.  There really needs to a fundamental shift on the institutional level (i.e., government and employers) to promote gender equality.  Although the aim of 'Lean In' is admirable, the means are myopic.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults alike. The characters are wonderful and the story line is engaging for adults yet easy enough for my 3 year old to follow. I haven't had a new favorite Disney movie in a long, long time, but this one did it. Not only do I have a new Disney favorite, I have a new animated movie favorite. I have watched this at least 10 times since buying it a few weeks ago and it hasn't got old yet. And an added note, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch have awesome voice overs for their characters.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Just started to play great fun.  I would pay for a game like this.  Not sure if Im willing to pay as I play
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|I HAV  ENJOYED THIS VERSION OF STAR WARS PINBALL. WOULD DEF SUGGEST IT TO ANY FAN O  THE MOVIES. IS CHALLENGING.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie reminded me of many areas in my life where it seemed all hope was gone.  I am not sure if this was based on a true story but I feel it may have been.  For those who lif\ke to look into the deeper meaning of life, and believe there is a God.. this is the movie for you!  It takes faith and challenges of life to a whole new level.  It makes you feel like your right on the boat with the main character of the movie (Pi).  This movie never got boring, it just went from excitement  to excitement from start to finish.  As a avid animal lover, and lover of challenges and adventures of life myself, this was the perfect movie for me.  I highly recommend it !  It is well worth the rental price, and you will be thinking about the deeper message of faith and never giving up, after it is long over.  I give it 5 out of 5!!
B001JRB16U|5.0|You can't feel grumpy after watching this movie. There are so many classic tunes and scenes. Steppin' Time , and &#34;I love to laugh&#34; are some that just leave me feeling great . They just do not make them like this anymore.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am very satisfied with the way the story ends. Perhaps surprisingly so. Sanderson's style does not duplicate the original books, but it flourishes at key moments into dramatic and descriptive scenes worthy of Jordan's finest storytelling. The most gratifying part is that Sanderson doesn't leave the Pattern flapping in the wind as so many do. Rather, he weaves each thread into the final tapestry and provides the closure that I believe all true fans have been waiting for, albeit in a way we did not expect. Truly, bravo, Mr. Sanderson.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I keep it at my work table , but it folds up nicely for a very usable travel sharpener. Would be great for camping supplies or on the road use.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The fact that this is based on a true story about a Spanish family made it even more enjoyable.  Articles about it indicate how close Naomi Watts worked with the mother.  Tom Holland, the young British actor, who portrayed the oldest son voiced how important and helpful it was to meet and work with the oldest son, also.  Young Mr. Holland provided an outstanding performance and was nominated and received several awards for his acting.<br /><br />This family is the epitome of family resilience.  Everyone of them did what they needed to stay alive and seek reunification.  Even the two youngest boys were gutty little kids!  As a family therapist, I learned long ago that the best \\"normal\\" families were able to cope best when crisis hit.  They didn't crumble, the regrouped and went on.<br /><br />Lastly, I read some criticism that this film did not portray the plight of the Thai people, but it did show them as most generous toward these foreign strangers and actually contributed to their success.  Without their help, it would have been almost impossible for them to survive.
B002S0OBN2|4.0|this is a good follow up to Phantom. the music is lyrically more ambitious and there is additional complexity in the arrangements. unfortunately, it is also predictable and lacks the same infectious appeal of the original. worth a listen for sure.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|I bougth it to see the 3D sequences for dog fights. Some are really good because I feel they made a good work improving them for 3D. There are 2 sequences which were just normal not noticing any improvement with 3D.<br /><br />In general I like it but seems can be improved
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|This was probably Tom Cruise's worst acting ever, he really should give up at this point.  It was action packed, but incredibly superficial.  The actors/actresses were completely one dimensional and the whole movie was filled with extremely bad one-liners.  Don't waste your time and money on this one.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I thought it was an ok game, but there are a lot of things that cost gems and really expensive things too.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Beautiful blend of education about an interesting epoch in one of our great cities and expression of love for the immigrant  people who make us great.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I HAVEN'T USED THIS REMOTE. J\I PURCHASED ITWHEN I THOUGHT THE OTHER ONE WAS STARTING TO LOSE ITS CHARGE.IT IS STILL WORKING SO  PUT THE NEW  ONE AWAY FOR FUTURE USE.
0765325950|5.0|The new guy got it right with the last volume.  It had action and characters that I remembered a hundred years ago from the first volume. A fast moving satisfying conclusion.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this was an amazing app great calculator I recommend it to anyone very good it worked great good down load if you get it it will work
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really loved this story and the ending was not what I expected.  I ordered the Distant Hours by this author and so far is just as good as this one.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Totally immersive. George Martin has done a spectacular job of placing the reader into the story. I can't wait to keep reading the series.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It's a really well written comedy. Bradley hit a \\"home run\\" with his performance. A personally recommend to watch this movie.
B001XCWPAM|3.0|I have seen all three movies before and I love them to death, but the first movie's disc was severely cracked, and also the second movie's case was damaged. Other than that, no complaints. Item arrived fast as usual.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Kept me intrigued from start to finish. I saw a lot of negative reviews and nearly didnt buy it, but I'm so glad I did!!
B00009027K|4.0|Of course I love the Album!<br /><br />My rating is for this vinyl version which is very good. A good pressing.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Everything about this movie is perfect. The soundtrack is amazing, the acting is brilliant and the story is awesome. This movie is not for everyone because there is strong language and gore, but it is hands down one of the best movies to come out in recent years.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is really cool it has rewards for you and plenty of games I  know u will like this game
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever and I just cant wait any longer for pe 0.6.2. becuz it will be the best update Eva (don't mind spelling Cu's it is to look cool)
B009NY43NY|5.0|I enjoyed the Sookie story very much. It had all the surprises and twists that we have come to expect in a Charlaine Harris series. It's too bad that this is the last Sookie Story.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|go harry potter!!! i love this series i first fell in love with the novels but once they started getting SUPER long I quit reading and relied on the films to tell me what happens :)!  go hp go!
B00B2QA646|3.0|Crazy-weird. Not sure what I think about the science changing like a play. This is one love story I would not stand up for the lovers.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I absolutely love love LOVE Harry Potter.  I love all the movies in the series but this one is my favorite I think because Harry and friends are gettting into their teenage years and it is a bit more mature than they were in the beginning and also there's the epic event of Dumbledore's final movie which he is still living in the film and I think that's a crucial piece/part of the entire series. peace love hp!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love the fade in option and the fact the you can adjust the amount of time on snooze.  Great app!  Many tones to choose from.
B0015F1VY8|5.0|i am extremely fascinated with historical movies especially in the time period this film focuses on-  I find that Queen Elizabeth 1 is one of my top 5 favorite historically influential people of all time i mean she ruled England through some intense major issues of her time. THIS FILM ROCKSSSS! :)
B003O86FMW|3.0|It's a decent transition book.  Maybe the first book just left me with much higher expectations, but I was a bit dissappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a good book totally appropriate for 11 or up kids i would recommend it to anyone my age .
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thought it was a bit melo-dramatic in some instances.  It is good enough to finish the series, but I expected more.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Honestly, I liked the book a lot. Most said it was poorly written but I happen to like it. You could argue that I liked  it because I'm 14 years old and immature, but in my opinion it was fantastic. I recommend it.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I love the songs, I love his voice, and I love him! :) best money I've ever spent on music.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Interesting plot.  Although I do not agree with many of the opinions of the writer expressed about juries and the legal system, I read this because of an interest in juvenile justice.  The point of view of the parents of a juvenile charged with a serious crime held my attention and kept me reading.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I thought it was a nice price and the product was almost new.<br />It came with all the discs and in the original package
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very interesting from a first person perspective on his service. It is not a &#34;How To&#34; manual or in depth insight into Seal training.
B00112C4EG|5.0|We live where we can see a small herd of cattle from our back windows on a neighbor's property.  As silly as it may sound, they give us immense pleasure, and having the Schleich figures in our home is a steady reminder of that pleasure.  These are higher quality than what you'd expect of ordinary toys, but if you wanted them for that purpose, they would certainly provide years of pleasure.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|The movie was too long and too slow to get to the point. The last 10 minutes was the best part of the movie.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I love this show and cannot wait to purchase the second season! I am equally excited for the third season to start airing! All of the actors are amazing in any role that they play (as in the ones who are in both seasons so far). This show is very fast-paced and has you at the edge of your seat constantly, or you may be yelling at the TV in disbelief of the events that rapidly occur. Very exciting show and worth every penny.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Nice charger.  Would prefer black in color.  Does not appear to charge items fast.  Great product for charging two items at once.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you love to think this is the best $1.99 you will spend.  I have played many great challenging games,but this one blows them all out of the water.  BEWARE,not for the soft thinker.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|This is one of my favorite Sigma Force novels out of five that I've read. My biggest (and really only ) complaint about the series is the difficulty of finding the order of the series. And, while each novel stands by itself as a story, it still kind of bites when someone seems to die, but you know they were alive in a later book, so I would recommend reading them in the order written. The order is<br /><br />1) Sandstorm<br />2) Map of bones<br />3) Black order<br />4) Judas Strain<br />5) The last Oracle<br />6) The Doomsday Key<br />7) The Devil Colony<br />8) Bloodline<br /><br />This novel and Bloodline are my favorite two. Unfortunately, Bloodline was the first Sigma Force novel I read. I recommend starting with Sandstorm and you'll enjoy the entire series as written.
0143121006|5.0|Could not put this book down, interesting history of this great city, its amazing how the police worked in those days. Daunn Munn
0385349947|4.0|I understand why some are quick to dismiss her as being an \\"elite\\" who can't possibly relate. However, I went to state school, not Harvard. I grew up solidly middle class and not wealthy. I hardly consider myself an \\"elite\\" but I found Sandberg's manifesto completely relate-able. Almost all of the things she writes about I have either done or experienced myself. Sandberg also provides some really great advice for women and encourages us to respect each other a little more. Well worth the read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far one of the best books I have read! I don't read much, but I couldn't put this one down!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This is another movie that I was surprised to enjoy. The cover kept steering me away and if it weren't for bruce willis, I wouldn't have watched it. Overall it's a great action movie that keeps you on your toes.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|The merchandise was defective and it is a lot of trouble to return something..  I have to make a special trip to UPS; also they failed to enclose a packing slip, so I don't know if they will let me return it.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|HORRIBLE! I was wishing Kevin would kill me! The plot is fantastic, but the execution was SO TERRIBLE. This movie was soooooooo slow and the only reason I kept watching, is becasue the plot was so good, I was expecting it to get better. I'd rather stab myself in the leg with a butter knife than watch this movie again.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|I really enjoyed this soundtrack. It has been my &#34;studying&#34; music for finals this last couple of days.  It is one of those rare albums that I can listen to every song and not skip.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I was surprised at how much I actually liked this movie. It had a lot of action that really kept the movie going.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|i love the game but get tired of it freezing all the time and not getting my points and the power ups not working, hopefully i will not have to delete it.
B002QYUVY8|4.0|Good movie overall. Good actors and a good plot. Only gets four stars because it did not have as much action as I was expecting.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|This movie keeps your attention throughout, you instantly love the horse and are drawn into the relationship with him and the boy. It was quite graphic in the war scenes, but that is no doubt how it was.
B007X16GFC|4.0|This was a pretty good movie overall. If you like Mark Wahlberg, it is definitely worth watching. If you don't like him, then don't. That simple
B007RCJNDE|5.0|I loved every line of it, but every Mat's line, in particular. The character have grown so much from the moment Brandon Sanderson took the pen, I'd waited nothing else from the last book of the serie.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It is a nice change from original Angry Birds and is fun with all the noise of the monkeys, etc.
1476733953|4.0|I am not a traditional sci-fi fan. Probably for the same reason I shy away from poetry and music. I believe this to be my genetic deficiency, and as such, I've long since stopped fighting it. I don't read what I emotionally can't understand. There's an essential narrative framework common to these categories, and I find no place for myself inside it. But then here I was reading Wool. Why? Good question. The answer? An intriguing publishing history. By now anyone reading this review knows the book's indie history - the shining success story - but here is what I can tell you. It's a great book. Sure, I could nit-pick about certain elements (why are there no elevators in the silos?, and the ending, well, yea, saw that coming pages before it happened, but I liked Juliette enough to stick with her), but let's cut to the much bigger chase: Mr. Hugh Howey (is that your real name, I doubt it), thanks for keeping me mightily entertained for several days and evenings. Let's hope the phenom of epigenetics kicks in here, and my offspring are more attuned to metaphorical apocalyptic melodic poetic culture than I am. In any case, I'll recommend this book to them.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|One of Le Carre's best books in ages.  A cynical look at the global war on terror conducted by drones, mercenaries, and private companies in concert with official and off the books government agencies.  Hooks you in quickly, and suddenly you are as confused as the players in this drama.
1451695195|5.0|This book not only captures you with an intriguing story, but what I received was worth so much more.  I come from a place of believing in God and had some idea of heaven.  This book gives you an idea of what to expect when you get to heaven, but more importantly, WHO to expect when you get to heaven.  I never met my older brother, that's something that won't change in this world.  But this book gave me faith that he's watching over me still and I can't wait for the day that I get to meet him in heaven.  If you've ever lost someone dear to you, invest time in this book.  I promise you won't regret it.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book overall, a nice change from the typical love stories I read.  However, started to get annoyed by the writing style after awhile and the main character.  Also, I understand it is a courtroom drama written by a courtroom lawyer, but the court scenes can become tedious after awhile.. Overall would recommend
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is addicting!! Its very easy to play. I like the tasks and being able to go to other peoples reef.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book got tons of hype, so I felt like I had to read it to understand why everyone was talking about it.  Only thought it was OK. was disappointed that someone so manipulative got their way EVERY time
0375842209|5.0|This was such an amazing novel. There is so much to say about this that I don't know where to begin. I'm just going to give my thoughts on the book.<br /><br />What I loved about this book:<br /><br />- Death narrating the story. I liked that he had a major voice in this book.<br />- Liesel and her love for books.<br />- The relationship between Liesel and her father, Hans. They had a sweet relationship and I loved that he teaches her how to read.<br />- The friendship between Rudy and Liesel.<br />- The setting of the book. I love historical fiction novels. The writer really describes everything in great detail.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book?<br />Definitely!

B0013ND30M|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves this movie.  I was a little concerned that the witch might frighten her, but it wasn't too scary.  They did a great job on the digital re-mastering.  The movie was even more beautiful then I remembered.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Cant read it my Kindle screen won't work properly.  Kindle lasted over 1 year and now it 's broken  Had to read a paperback.
B00571F26Y|2.0|I thought the book was poorly written and seemed to jump to conclusions without demonstrating the steps taken to get there.
1846141214|5.0|Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell<br /><br />\\"Outliers\\" is a fascinating journey into the world of extraordinary success, outliers.  What makes this book different and dare I say extraordinary is the focus on culture, community and family as key elements of their individual success.  Best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell takes the reader on a ride into the lives of outliers. Through fascinating stories and keen insights he shows what really is behind the success of outliers. This entertaining 336-page book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. The Matthew Effect, 2. The 10,000-Hour Rule, 3. The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 1, 4. The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 2, 5. The Three Lessons of Joe Flom, 6. Harlan, Kentucky, 7. The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes, 8. Rice Paddies and Math Tests, and 9. Marita's Bargain.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. A mesmerizing journey, I couldn't put this one down.  A page turner!<br />2. Engaging, accessible prose on the fascinating topic of outliers.<br />3. A fantastic topic in the hands of a master story teller.  Such great insights!<br />4. The book provides excellent examples of extraordinary success.  The author goes from one interesting outlier to the next and in doing so covers a wide spectrum of human interests.  Bravo!<br />5. The book is based on the compelling argument that there is something wrong with the way we make sense of success.  \\"But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine.\\"<br />6. Health in terms of a community.<br />7. Success in hockey, innate talent...guess again. \\"Yes, the hockey players who make it to the professional level are more talented than you or me. But they also got a big head start, an opportunity that they neither deserved nor earned. And that opportunity played a critical role in their success.\\"<br />8. What do the likes of Bill Gates and the Beetles have in common?  Find out. Fascinating stuff.<br />9. IQ versus practical intelligence.  \\"The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn't seem to translate into any measurable real-world advantage.\\"<br />10. The advantages of class.  \\"When we talk about the advantages of class, Lareau argues, this is in large part what we mean. Alex Williams is better off than Katie Brindle because he's wealthier and because he goes to a better school, but also because--and perhaps this is even more critical--the sense of entitlement that he has been taught is an attitude perfectly suited to succeeding in the modern world.\\"<br />11. The conditions that helped create Joe Flom. \\" If you want to be a great New York lawyer, it is an advantage to be an outsider, and it is an advantage to have parents who did meaningful work, and, better still, it is an advantage to have been born in the early 1930s. But if you have all three advantages--on top of a good dose of ingenuity and drive--then that's an unstoppable combination.\\"<br />12. The roots of the culture of honor.  \\"Cultures of honor tend to take root in highlands and other marginally fertile areas, such as Sicily or the mountainous Basque regions of Spain. If you live on some rocky mountainside, the explanation goes, you can't farm. You probably raise goats or sheep, and the kind of culture that grows up around being a herdsman is very different from the culture that grows up around growing crops. The survival of a farmer depends on the cooperation of others in the community. But a herdsman is off by himself.\\"<br />13. The ethnic theory of air planes is one of the most interesting chapters I have ever read. It's that good!  \\"In this chapter, we're going to conduct a crash investigation: listen to the \\"black box\\" cockpit recorder; examine the flight records; look at the weather and the terrain and the airport conditions; and compare the Guam crash with other very similar plane crashes, all in an attempt to understand precisely how the company transformed itself from the worst kind of outlier into one of the world's best airlines.\\" A tease...<br />14. The key to understanding why Asian children learn to count much faster than American children.  Just great stuff!<br />15. Understanding the impact of cultural differences.<br />16. The success behind the KIPP Academy.  \\"It is no exaggeration to say that just over ten years into its existence, KIPP has become one of the most desirable public schools in New York City.\\"<br />17. Gladwell brings it home, literally.<br />18. Love reading group guides!<br />19. An insightful conversation with the author, Malcolm Gladwell.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No formal bibliography.<br />2. Science light but who cares...this book rocks!<br />3.  I always take behavioral science with a grain of salt.<br /><br />In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Gladwell hits a homerun by presenting fascinating stories of outliers from a wide spectrum of the human experience.  This is one of those books that rewards the reader.  Great topic, engaging writing, and memorable stories...what's not to like?

B006DJ2JSI|2.0|You have to type in the word you are looking for before you can get into the program so it's somewhat frustration when you're in a pinch.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This new album is just another sign how great Rod is.<br />It seems the older he gets the better he gets.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|didn't expect this movie to be as funny as it was. Super cute and funloving. I would recommend this to friends.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I am hooked on this series.  I appreciated that there were a good number of episodes.  Even then, it could have been twice as long and I'd still want more episodes  .I can't wait for season 4!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Just a real pleasure to watch. Amazing graphics, good story, a lot of fun to watch. Use a big HD TV is possible.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Long movie... you won't notice. Lots of great dialogue. Fans of Tarantino will love it. As a period piece, it does a great job at portraying the bigotry of the era. Not for the faint of heart if you can't handle strong language or violence. Otherwise, you can't pass on this movie. Viewers new to Tarantino but that like Westerns will also enjoy this immensely, if you can't get beyond the language/violence that may turn off some viewers.
0060989157|5.0|maybe they are now.  Besides the point-the book is fascinating and well written.  The whole evolution of Motley Crue has everything you need for an entertaining story..<br />The book arrived in great condition.  Kudos to the seller.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|Great flick, even if you didn't see the other movie that's linked to it. Anyone in their late 20's and beyond can easily relate to the stories in this film and will find it very entertaining.
B00516G6ME|5.0|The figure overall is pretty great. The figure's pretty well sized, allowing you to appreciate how big and bulky Franky can be, but not being ridiculously big at the same time. The detailing is great...and excluding the hands...Franky's more obvious Cyborg parts are well painted and \\"shiny\\". Especially the shoulders. :3<br /><br />Now you obviously can't move the figure's parts, but frankly you shouldn't even want to. A great Franky pose, but not his trademark one. Besides, it's supposed to go on the included stand. (Includes his name, personal emblem) Or Free standing if you prefer that kind of thing.<br /><br />The heads can be swapped with ease - but DON'T LOSE THEM! Or the two small pairs of sunglasses that are included. They stay on the heads pretty well, but they're not attached, delicate, and are at risk of getting lost if you're not careful.<br /><br />I'd keep the spare parts somewhere safe, preferably somewhere where kids or pets can't get at them - assuming you have them. That way if you have a change of heart and want to swap his head, you can do so with ease.
B006M4F67A|5.0|For the best ever Mahjong game yet<br />on LINE for Android phones and games. I just love the music as it's so calming
1891252089|5.0|To those love yoga in practice, I will highly recommend this is a right book you want.<br />You might refer it every time, or you might choose just stay the posture page you are not familiar.<br /><br />This reference book is good for everyone in yoga practice.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have downloaded this application but as of yet have not used it for any other application or necessary system.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the 5-day, 10-day, and hourly reports for different locations.  I was bothered by a resident process always running in the background taking up memory and processor time that I could not figure out how to option it to stop.  So I ended up deleting it from my Android to get better performance.  No idea if this process was the culprit, but I removed any app that I could that I was not absolutely hooked on which chewed up memory and processor on my phone (HTC Thunderbolt).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app played it on my iPod now my tablet. Its great only thing I would tweak is the levels where you have to make the lines fill in empty slots. I like the straight and narrow. Connect the dots and the whole boards filled.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Makes it easy, (too easy.. LOL) to keep on buying from Amazon. I am hooked on Amazon and their ease of shopping and great prices!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|My now 19-month old son has been enthralled with the Muppets since the first time I put this movie on when he was about 14 months old. It's great for a rany day when toys aren't doing the trick, and even better for winding down and snuggling before bedtime. It's got fun characters, a great, catchy, original sountrack, and it's just adorable. That it doesn't have the typical frightening tragedy of children's movies (i.e. the violent death of a parent, as in Bambi, Finding Nemo, etc.) is a huge bonus.  My son loves it so much we re-did his room with Muppet decals and he has most of the plush characters. A very happy, cute, fun movie!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Back in December 2012 when Jack Reacher was released I figured, \\"why not read the book then watch the movie when it comes out on Blu Ray?\\" The movie is actually based on [[ASIN:0345538196 One Shot]], the 2005 9th book in Lee Child's series. One Shot was an excellent book, and I pictured a Tom Cruise-like character as Reacher knowing that I would soon be watching him in the role.<br /><br />Cruise did a decent job with the portrayal of Reacher in the movie. He nailed the dialogue. However, Cruise would be a much smaller Reacher than that of the guy in the book who stands 6'5\\" and in one chapter literally crushes a guy the size of Stallone in his bare hands. I actually noticed that they made Cruise seem as tall as some of his co-stars in several scenes, which made some of the CQC seem a bit more realistic.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie was a very good adaptation of the book. Reacher is a rough, tough character with a military police background. Now \\"retired\\" and for the most part a drifter, Reacher seems to be as much of a military police expert as he is an expert in finding trouble and fixing it. However, now as an \\"independent\\", unlike the traditional methods used by police, Reacher--while extremely intelligent--prefers the methods of Rambo to exact his justice.<br /><br />Jack Reacher learns that a guy that he used to be in the military with is accused of an atrocious crime. So Reacher makes his way to Pittsburgh (Indiana in the book)  to investigate. Turns out the guy accused of the atrocity asked the cops to \\"find Reacher\\" as one of the only statements after his arrest, because Reacher may be the only guy that could put doubt behind the accusation. This of course doesn't make Reacher any friends in the local police department who think that they have an air-tight case, and Reacher's presence certainly wouldn't sit well with anyone trying to frame the accused. Indeed, anyone trying to frame the accused might go out of their way to make life literally difficult for Reacher, but making life difficult for Jack Reacher is usually more hazardous to the health of the bad guy than it is to Reacher.<br /><br />Just like the book that Jack Reacher was adapted from, actions and scenarios are extreme at times with some implausibilities, but the movie moves quickly and is well worth a rental for fans of the action/thriller/crime drama genres.Reacher, but making life difficult for Jack Reacher is usually more hazardous to the health of the bad guy than it is to Reacher.<br /><br />Just like the book that Jack Reacher was adapted from, actions and scenarios are extreme at times with some implausibilities, but the movie moves quickly and is well worth a rental for fans of the action/thriller/crime drama genres.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Riveting story, well written. This author has done a tremendous job of weaving humanity into the difficult themes of this book
B00BBW16HW|1.0|Didn't get chance to see it!  Fell asleep Saturday night and tried to watch it today within the supposed 48 hour time limit!  No such thing!!!  Very disappointed with the \\"inaccuracy\\"!  I WANT  REFUND!
1597772992|5.0|Excellent CDs.  They are very easy to understand and the reader spoke very clearly.  I listened to these  CDs over and over again - so much great information.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Found this quite by accident while on a vacation trip. Couldn't put it down! First I was totally engaged by the storyline, then I became so involved in the individual characters and their developing relationships as the 2nd Mass fought the invaders. I watched the entire first two seasons in just a few days. Now I can hardly wait for season 3.
B00009NHC5|5.0|The special features weren't a lot but the interview with Alan Arkin was great.  He had a lot of in depth perspectives and the movie itself is a classic to begin with.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Great game, challenging puzzle game. Fifteen more words are required. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one... done!!!
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|App keeps closing and there aren't very many options at all on the free version. Overall, not thrilled with the fact that all you can do is make him repeat you and beat him up a little.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Great for passing the time with a little thought involved.  Of course, gets harder as the speed picks up.  One more word required... word.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My granddaughter just loves this game she is 4yrs old. It's simple yet educational I recommend panda hospital for kids
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game. It was a lot of fun. It has a lot of the same aspects of the movies.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I see that this book hasn't been rated well so far and I am glad I did not read reviews before I read this final book. Many think it moved too quickly, but honestly though I enjoyed every book in the series they all seemed to drag out and this book was not like that. The characters have changed. This is good. People change. The end of series should involve a change in characters and they should find fulfillment and be happy where they are in life.<br /><br />I think most reviewers were disappointed with how Mrs. Harris ended it. This world was her creation and she had the right to choose. I think she had an excellent ending. Sure it was not what I wanted, but it was a good ending none the less and if you were not satisfied with not knowing what will happen to all the characters later on; Mrs. Harris is writing a companion book that will give us all those future details.<br /><br />This book was just as exciting and suspenseful as the others and I wouldn't ask Mrs. Harris to change a thing!
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book is amazing. It has just good treats in it. It is good written and easy to read.<br />The language is fluent and the books is keeping a good tempo. The books is about Katsa and Po bascially. They are graced with each their special thing. You can be graced with killing, foresight, cooking, dancing or painting. And other things of course.<br /><br />Kristin does this book justice. There are some many books out there with good plots where the book in it self is bad. This isnt. This is one of them books you take with you. On vacation, to the cafe or to school. And you tell everyone about it.<br />About the good in this book and the bad. And that you love each charachter individually, even if they are bad.<br /><br />I love this book, and I have read it 5 times approx.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This movie jumped from scene to scene.  Didn't have a good flow and even though there were some laughs, it wasn't as funny as expected.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved it. Had great action and some comedy in it. Great special effects. I'm hoping that they make another Avenger movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a great movie. Would watch this one again.  Appealed to both my husband and me, which is difficult to do.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Saw the movie several times on cable.  Sucker for love stories.  Watch it again and again.  Also bought the soundtrack.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|This was a gift for my husband's birthday.  He liked the size of this Chimney Starter.  He liked that the coals seemed to heat faster.
B000YAA68C|4.0|Just wanted a copy of the disc to watch over and over again.  Sucker for love stories.  Loved the notes.
B004SEUJBE|5.0|This is an awesome movie, great to sing along. The cast is awsome, as well as the costumes and sets.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|ok, it might be because I'm a novice kindle user (this is my 2nd book purchase), but the maps are illegible. For a guy following the Tolkien method (start with a map) a physical book would be more satisfying-easier to flip to the map or the appendicies as needed. The content itself-this is wierd. When there is a screen adaptation I've always been one of those &#34;the book was better&#34; people. Well so far the books are pretty much identical-except that the children seem older, probably because girls that young being sexual objects would be offensive to those who don't know mideval history. So, since I consider the series to be the best thing on TV right now it would be safe to say I'm liking the books so far (I'm about halfway through the second..
1932100660|5.0|This is truly a life changing book.  This is the most comprehensive book I have ever read on nutrition and the effect it has upon our health.  The scientific research supporting the conclusions reached is truly exponential!  This book exposes how various food industries dictate the policies of the government agencies responsible for looking after the nutritional value of our foods and how these foods affect our health.  The medical field at large has very little training in nutrition and there are a lot of life threatening health conditions that can be cured and/or symptoms alleviated by a proper diet.  Every American ought to read this book!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this movie! The humor is funny without being gross or rude. Can not wait to see the second one.
B004LX0D36|5.0|How many times have I read this? Twenty at least, I think. Jane Austin's wry sense of humour and her critical appraisal of English society in the early nineteenth century always raises a smile.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels and can't wait for me to appear.  Lee writes a good story each time.  None of the books has left me not wanting to read them.

1476734941|5.0|I saw the program on TV and was intrigued with the idea, so I ordered the book.  It covers essentially the same information.  This is a very effective--and easy--way to lose weight, but more importantly, to enhance one's general health.  I liked reading some of the testimonials for their motivational effect, as well as their suggestions for dealing with problems.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I dislike it, the reason I chose this one was because it was listed as &#34;like new&#34; which was not the case. It has a big scratch on it, and looks old, plus it said it would come along with the charging cord which it did not. So that's why I hate it. It wasn't a good choice buying the PS3 controller online. I was lied too, please be more realistic and honest about the items that are on sale.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I thought it was good but it's not what I thought it was going to be like  but I think you should get it
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is a funny, one-of-a-kind movie that is simply terrific to watch.  David Spade's comedic timing is awesome.  This copy replaced our VHS copy that we donated.
B002N2SYAG|5.0|This season is just getting better and better! The dynamics between the characters in this show is well worth the watch! Love David Boreanaz! Go Angel!
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|An amazing true life story about an amazing human being!  Excellent performances by both Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt.  A must see movie.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|Just as awesome as any other season that this show has produced! Love Emily's character! Would love to see her sister on this show permanantly.
0393039765|5.0|It seems the film overshadows the book by a longshot because I never really hear anyone talk about the novel, which surprises me, because the book is an almost completely different experience than the movie. It has a darker tone to it, a more serious approach I guess you could say. I don't know what it is but it might have something to do with the more different way Marla Singer is worked into the story. It certainly goes places and I reccommend it to anyone who wants a good quick read.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The season has been so funny,scary,gory,and so sadly moving! Felicia Dey is so great. I hope to see more of her in the future episodes and seasons! The guys still got it but without Bobby they still need alittle elder guidance at times. Keep up the outstanding shows!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So good, I read them all within a 2 week span. Not for everyone, a little erotic, but not many will be able to put them down!
1582701903|2.0|The power of The Master Key System is in the original text by Charles Haanel. This book has the original public domain text<br />and a edited version of that by Ruth Miller. The edited version to me is worthless. Authors too commonly take classic works<br />such as this and edit it to try to make a name for themselves and in so doing ruin the original. Just leave the classic alone,<br />it stands by itself as a unique marvel. My suggestion is to find the truly unabridged, unedited original, or simply print it<br />out from free online sources, since it is in the public domain. At any rate, don't be distracted by cheap imitations of the<br />original. The true Master Key System is a foundation of true self-help and prosperity, in its original text.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The trailers for this film left me reluctant to see it. Somehow got the impression that it was another kids film being pushed for adults. A deeply spiritual film that leaves you thinking about it long after it is over. Beautifully done.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Love this book. Very much worth the money. Keeps you on the edge until the end. Another great book by Sparks.
B0045HCIZY|2.0|My dvd was delivered on time. However when I opened the box, the dvd was unprotected. The result was a dvd whose box was damaged. When I opened the case, the dvd was there in one piece, however it was packaged in a strange manner. The dvd was sitting up above the circular protection and the underneath cover had holes cut into it. Furthermore the plastic cover was not sealed. They claim the dvd was new. I certainly can not prove otherwise, but I have my doubts. Either way, they should be ashamed to deliver a dvd in the manner that this was shipped.
1476734941|5.0|The information by Michael Mosley is easy to understand, easily explainable, hits thoughts processes that possess the want to feel better.  I was not a believer in fasting as was my husband but have since realized the energy that is stored in my body and how to better utilize it.  I still have to get my blood work done and the weight is starting to melt away, slowly but surely. I will keep adding as I go along~
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved the book.  When I finished this one I automatically bought &#34;Walking Disaster&#34;.  I thought this was a follow up to the first one but found out it is &#34;Beautiful Disaster&#34; from a different character's perspective.  I really enjoyed both books.
160094048X|5.0|This cookie cookbook has changed my son's life and has allowed for others to share the food that he brings to school.  The cookies are wonderful, easy to make, loved by all.  My son's food allergies are not even a topic for discussion.  When we bring in cookies or cupcakes from, &#34;Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World&#34;, my son is the talk of the class.  The vast array of recipes covers all types of cookies so no one is left out.  Thank you Isa!!!
B000000WCV|5.0|What a great album, I feel Random Access Memories is a step into the past, farther than this album. Da funk back to the Punk, come on!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Awesome processor for the price. I have overclocked it up to 4.7 GHz with no problem, but ultimately decided to let it sit at 4.3 Ghz for extended life, and my computer is faster than ever. Highly recommended.
B000CCT246|5.0|All of Discovery in one movie. Better quality than Blue-Ray for some reason. Would love to get Electroma when I have the chance!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Download was easy and works very well. Verses are easy to locate and references are accurate. Verse of the day is a good inspiration to wake up too in the morning.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|My girlfriend is a huge Hunger Games fan so when I had this shipped in for a reasonable price it was a great surprise for her and she was really excited. Brand new with the wrapping. I will buy from Amazon many times and this seller if they have what I need.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't like it as much as the  others. It was very different from the others but I think it has to be like that, It was important to know what happens to Panem and how all this is going to end.<br />Katniss dissapointed me a little espacially with the whole Peeta or Gale thing but the story was ok.<br />If you have read the other book it would be too sad to stop here.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|i remember watchen the cartoon version when i was a kid  i just had to get this copy.  thought it was very funny  brings me back to when i was little kid
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had already seen the movie when I read the book. I liked the movie so I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I was afraid of being bored because I knew the story but I wasn't bored at all reading it. I like the setting, the caracters, the plot...
B00003CXRM|5.0|when this movie came out i sat and watched it with my grandma befor she pasted away and we both just cracked up. she gave me her last copy but when i moved it  got lost and it bothered me so much i had to by another copy  and when i watch it i think of her sitting beside me watchen it too  just cracken up.  this move is very funny
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved the first book and I was really wondering what could happen next ! I was not dissapointed. The beginning is quite slow, it takes a lot off time to really start but worth it and then there are lots of surprises!<br />I don't give 5 stars only beause of that and also a little because the end but of course I'm not telling you anything about that.
B004GJYROG|5.0|some people may think this movie is stupid but me  i find it funny. watch and see u will like it  2
B0053TMP24|5.0|This was an excellent book that i recommend to everyone that enjoyed the percy jackson series and it was goof
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Enjoy playing Draw Something Free  with family and friends.  we<br />can be as competitive as we wish.  I highly recommend this this app.
B003TNW044|5.0|i love friends and this was the most convenient cheapest way to get a season. would buy again and will buy the rest of the seasons
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I found this on PBS the first time I saw it.  This production is amazing and the casting was brilliant.  I think that some parts are even better than &#34;Phantom&#34;.  Love it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. I cried do much, ha. Kept me turning the pages. Absolutely loved it. Praise for John Green!
B00B7XGFO4|4.0|If I remember correctly this was a made-for-TV-event, and this production is very good for a made for tv program. I love both main characters, Scott and York did an excellent job. Scott's sideburns and York's big hair-do are so 70's!
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I read this on recommendation from some friends. As of today I have 10% of the book left and have decided to give up. I was pushing through to when all the threads are connected and everything is answered. I am about half way through this and I still have no idea what is going on. New characters, abilities and \\"things\\" (I say things because I honest don't know what the thing in the garden was, or if it was actually in the garden) are being introduced.<br /><br />Apparently the second book is amazing, but I have wasted enough of my time and I just can't bring myself to care about what happens in this universe anymore.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This was a very difficult novel to read for me as a parent and if you had read \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\", then you would find many correlating themes. Do you trust your child to do the right thing? Do you believe your child to be inherently good? A lot of tough questions are asked and some I felt unable to answer. It is definitely well written and it takes you on a journey where one questions everything you believed about yourself, your spouse and your children. Maybe that is what the author wanted. If so, he succeeded.
B00C5ZORES|2.0|Folie à Deux was great and was easily the best of all their albums. Unfortunately, Save Rock and Roll is a big step backwards musically, lyrically, and melodically, although Just One Yesterday & Young Volcanoes are very good songs.  It's also a bit hard to believe they picked up someone as lame as Courtney Love to sing on a song.  The two lead singles, The Phoenix & My Songs Know... are a bit too teeny bopper for my tastes. I suppose the main thing is that the band is back together and their will hopefully be albums in the future.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|While this book preceded my growing up in the 30's in the Midwest much of the details still resonate. He nailed it. Of course, he should have in that he was embedded among the principals. A great book to see the foundation upon which WWII was built.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I have all of her books and re-read them constantly, along with other writers like Madeleine L'Engle, and L.M. Montgomery.
B001BC5HXG|4.0|I enjoyed East of Eden very much. It seemed somewhat autobiographical but fascinating. Steinbeck is a great story teller. I will definitely be reading more of his books.
B000089RVR|5.0|I was fascinated by Dido when I started watching Roswell, which had one of her songs as the theme.  That song isn't on this album, but I have her previous CD too.
1401907725|5.0|Love these cards!!.  tThe pictures are beautiful , and phrases inspiring. The addition of the little book included is very helpful with the interpretation.<br />They arrived quickly and in perfect condition!
0375826726|5.0|I got hooked on these books from Eragon on.  The movie was a little cheesy, but I fell in love with Saphira as a baby - she was so cute.  And Robert Carlyle was great as the bad guy - still is - watch him in Once Upon a Time.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. Good for both men and ladies. It is rare that we find one we both like!
0783240287|5.0|Donny is good in this one.  I have read the Bible over and over, so it was good to see a story in it coming alive on the screen.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is one of the best games that I've come across in a while.  Fun, but not super addictive, with enough &#34;side games&#34; to keep me happy. I also love that my dragons don't die if don't play for a few days.
030746363X|3.0|This book seems like the author was hoping for all of the things that it purported to do for you.  If he got everything, then more power to him.
B00881PTRC|4.0|This is definitely a great update to this classic fun game. I really like the animation of the hangman as you go along, very funny. Definitely recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  It has been a tremendously long time since I have been this interested in a drama that does NOT revolve around characters solving crimes or set in medival time.
B007UQRW62|3.0|Singing in the Rain is one of my favorite movies so I was excited to be able to buy this special collector's edition.  The hardcover book, the small posters/prints, and the additional documentary paying tribute to how the movie and its stars has inspired so many dancers made the purchase fun and worthwhile.  However, the umbrella's design is pretty generic and forgettable.  How wonderful it would have been to have a print of Gene dancing to the song printed on it instead.  The other disappointment is the blu-ray copy of the film.  I looked forward to a very crisp print typically availed by purchasing a movie in this format. This has been the catalyst for purchasing other beloved films, and in many cases, the sharpness and improved picture have left me excited to have a blu ray version of a movie. However, that's not the case with this blu ray copy of Singing in the Rain.. much to my dismay.  It poses no significant improvement over the dvd copy I already had so overall I've got mixed feelings about this purchase. It could have been so much more of a gem to have!
B003D5X3VM|5.0|Gregory Porter has an emotive voice that speaks to us all. He is a natural breath of fresh energy opposite the common flat computerized false music being made these days. His music back-up is as real as his rich baritone. Porter seems to be a unique cross between a young Bill Withers, Donny Hathaway and Nina Simone. He is a genuine talent that I am so glad to have heard on WCLK FM 91.9 Radio in Atlanta. Shout out to radio jockey, Jamal Ahmad for playing Porter's songs frequently.
B004GXKBF6|4.0|For the price, go for this if the movies themselves are ones you enjoy.  This combo comes with 2 separate Blu Ray discs, each for its own separate movie.  Each film is the same Blu Ray as you would see if you bought the films as separate packages so getting a 2 for 1 deal is not a bad way to go.<br /><br />THE EXPRESS<br />The Express, the Ernie Davis Story based upon the life and times of the great college football hero and an inspiration to a great many during the difficult times of the civil rights movement. I won't summarize the plot and acting performances, everyone else has already done that here, so I will only focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray. It's a good movie, not great but never the less and enjoyable view.<br /><br />Video...We have a fairly clean transfer though it is plain to see that it is not a remastering of the film. There are variations between warm and cool color grading. The colors are true and natural without that color popping you see in some of the newer movies out today. In fact, the colors tend to be a touch muted and soft. This is not a negative per se but it creates a more real image. Film grain is kept to a minimum without being distracting. The only place where film grain is highly noticeable is where archival footage is played and, of course, much grain would be noticed there. I saw no artifacting nor ghosting which is rare on blu rays anyway. Overall, the video transfer, with its high Mbps rate averaging in the upper 20's provides clean contrast and true colors.<br /><br />Audio...The film defaults to lossless DTS HD 5.1 and dialogue is transparent and easy to understand. I do believe they got lazy on the audio editing as there is almost no panning or use of the discreet side and rear channels for directionality of foley effects. However, the great soundtrack comes through all channels and fully envelops you in the audio. Crowd scenes, while also using all channels sound as if they are the same in all channels without any directionality at all. Yes, there are a couple of pans from left to right but not many and certainly not as many as there could have been with good editing. The sub's job is simply to add to the ambience and that's about it.<br /><br />Extras...Plenty of deleted scenes, none that would be better served in an extended edition. Lots of other extras about Ernie Davis and the 1959 Syracuse team he helped to the championship including very interesting interviews with many of his teammates and the famed Jim Brown, who had recruited him to Syracuse, and making of documentaries.<br />For the price, if you liked the movie, get the Blu Ray. However, since this is not a comparison of the blu ray and Standard Def DVD, I can't say just how much of an improvement there will be.<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS<br />I did not have this movie on a Standard Def DVD so it certainly will not be a comparison between the two.<br /><br />VIDEO...the transfer is very clean with no artifacting or aliasing of any kind. There were no problems during playing the Blu Ray disc. The colors are deliberately desaturated and created a softer look, however, the contrast was really quite good and grain is kept to a minimum. I was surprised at how high the bit rate was, averaging in the mid 30's. There is some controversy over bit rates on Blu Ray as many believe that the higher the bit rate, the less compression there is done to the film. Others believe that Bit Rates are irrelevant and that there is no direct linear correspondence between bit rate and picture quality. In truth, bit rate is just a measure of how much data there is in a picture stream and certainly not all films need the same amount of data. I am on the fence and believe that the higher the bit rate, usually, the better the image since more data is reaching the screen.<br /><br />AUDIO.... The lossless DTS HD 5.1 audio provided an excellent spread of the soundtrack across the front stage. Dialogue is very clear and transparent and there will be no need to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control. All audio levels are the way they should be. The rear channels provide much ambient crowd noise boosted by the LFE sub channel. There is not a whole lot of discreet directionality sent to the rear channels nor need for the sub to do more than boost ambient noise. Foley effects are mostly spread across the front stage but not much panning to the sides or rear. Never the less, the audio is really quite good, just not to be used for a demo disc to show off your system.<br /><br />Extras...Plenty of deleted and extended scenes, none that would be better served in an extended edition. Lots of other extras about the original team this movie was based upon, and making of documentaries.<br />For the price, if you liked the movie, get the Blu Ray. However, since this is not a comparison of the blu ray and Standard Def DVD, I can't say just how much of an improvement there will be. Since the video on Blu Ray is as clean as it is, my bet is that there would be a somewhat significant difference and lossless audio, to me, is very noticeable on any Blu Ray as compared to a lossy codec. Lossless is always better.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.ere will be no need to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|I-3 is all about giving, so much so that the backdrop could not have been anything but Christmas.  Should you be a purist, or at least a Marvel historian like my sons, you will recognize the story lines that blur and sometimes are eliminated in I-3.  Depending on your personal preference, this may be major for you.  Blog treatises  included even here on Amazon illustrate the cosmic shifts in I-3.  From an artist's view I-3 gushes panoramic extensions in exponentially expanding directions.  Tony Stark, as melded by the incomparable RD Jr., startles once again with his chameleonesque revelation of self, the everyday guy next door who also happens to be not merely a billionaire genius hero action guy, but is in fact, Iron Man.  Generous portions of plot and character are dished out across the screen and throughout the tale, Ms. Pepper igniting the screen per usual with her unmatchable finesse at equaling her always challenging love.  Ben Kingsley had to have been overjoyed to be blessed with his role as (pseudo)Mandarin,[and that is not giving anything away!] the part having had to have been spun out of a future that was yet to exist, shimmering from his illustrious past.  The digitizers need their own review by someone that can actually explain how it is they do what they do so magnificently.  Beyond 'when movies were movies' and 'movies at their best' I-3 accomplishes every boy's dream to do it all and get it done before Christmas morning!  And, I-3 is just as fun as presents on Christmas morning. As years go by, like Die Hard and so many others, I-3 may graduate to become another Christmas favorite!

B007VUA7VO|4.0|Detailed information on battery charge status which, for me, is crucial. (Batteries don't last long in any device I own.) Good little utility.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Yes, it is really a soap opera, but done with panache, and of course those gorgeous British vistas. The acting is all at a high level (the Brits just do this better because for them it's a profession. In this country, there's still something a little naughty about it.) I'll confess the plots sometimes got a little murky, but there was always a scene coming that would leave me misty eyed. Anyway, I'd tune in to watch Dame Maggie read the phone book.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game. Was easy to play. Can't wait to get the sequel.  Love the mystery of you did it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLY AWESOME. The only think however is that i got screwed over .. I bought it when it was seven dollars and the next day, it went down to four... da fudge!!!??
B003VVAE4W|3.0|I have never been a Veronica Mars fan. The only reason I watched this episode was because I found out Alia Shawkat and Michael Cera were in it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was really worried about purchasing and reading this book because of the many bad reviews I'd read. I was pleased to discover that the book didn't end horribly tragic but instead ended in what I, and apparently the author, considered a fitting ending for a beloved character. I think Charlaine Harris is a terrific author and not only have I really enjoyed her Sookie novels, but also her Lily Bard and Aurora Teagarden series' as well.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I liked the movie very much. great movie! i wish the other casts from the previous movies were in it but nonetheless a great movie to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and my daughter does too!!! Can't wait for her to try it! She loves horses and frequently asks for one!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Awesome movie. I want to watch over and over. Must see! And all of my Kids love it. Buy it now.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|It depends on what you wnt to hear.  His TV. Appeared better the listening to it.<br />I gave my copy to a friend.  Normally I do like his music,c but this time is was sounding flat.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am really enjoying this series. It is different and exciting. Very suspenseful! I am looking forward to watching Season 2.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|sure its beautiful with the exception of the red octopus. thing looks like a child made it from a plastic grocery bag. but it limit daily friend tasks and some of the quests force you to purchase pearl items in the store. also the rare fish that create said pearls...some consume 350-10000 algae but all pay one pearl and take same amount of time (3 days) right now I have one dory quest (my only quest for two days now) asking me to grow something I cant even purchase until next level. very disappointing. but nice to look at. except the stupid octopus.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Not as exciting as Book One, Two or Three,. Although you are familiar with some of the characters, many are introduced and not as interesting as the characters with whom you developed a relationship with from previous books. But things do happen, you can trust George R. R. Martin that no character is safe! And anything can go wrong and does. Wow. I love these stories.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|For anyone concerned about our food supply, how it is manufactured, what goes in to it, how the animals are treated, and any of that kind of stuff, I say this is a decent, informative movie worth watching at least once. You should probably watch it more than once.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So much happens in this book that sometimes I just had to put it down and leave it for a day or so!  Again, I say..So much happened in this book. From Book one and two , you got so much character development and got comfortable with the characters. Well, that is a mistake!! So much unexpected events and so much can happen and does. Hate and Love could be the name of this book!! Thank you Mr. Martin.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|City of saints is such a good game at first i had some skepticism,but wow it's such an amazing game it feels just like gta vice city but better graphics ,i recommend this game for any open world game lovers ,thank you gameloft.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Having not read the books, I can't really comment on how closely the film adaptation follows them. Also, Cruise has had some stinkers the last few years so i wasnt expecting much.<br /><br />That being said, this has been one of the better action movies I've seen in a long time. Cruise and Rosamund Pike had great chemistry together. If you love action movies, this has it all: action, humor, suspense, and a plot that has some substance.<br /><br /> Would have like to seen more Robert Duvall, but other than that, no complaints.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I loved all three books in this trilogy. After reading the first book I was hooked and hastened to buy the other two. A great read!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I didn't know if I would like this book.  Not sure about &#34;hit men&#34; running around.<br />But after I began reading the book, I did like it.  Good story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So rich in characters, writing, sets...one can get invested in the cast enough to almost be willing to give up our smart phones for a weekend at Downton Abbey.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I think this may be the only app that I have on my kindle that I use frequently, that has ZERO issues. Everything just works, and that makes me happy. I bought Photoshop also, when I first got my Kindle, but find that I do not use it as often.
B00499NHLC|4.0|I really enjoyed this! A fresh new modern approach to an iconic character.  I love it! I dont know if it has been cancelled forever but I would love to see more!
B002SSUQFG|2.0|What can I say? I like watches and wanted an everyday, no frills, inexpensive, rugged watch that would still look cool and not cost too much. Apparently I was too greedy, at least for one feature.<br />I like everything about this watch (maybe apart from the fact it's slightly too small; I don't like big watches but this lacks a few extra mms), apart from one MAJOR thing: it is SO FAST you have to reset it every week at least.<br />Well I know it's not expensive, but for me that kills it.<br />Too bad, as this could be a killer sub-100$ watch.
B000AP04NI|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a little kid. It is still as good as ever. Top shelf video.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Since the setting is in 1800 London the language is very proper. The story is one of puzzle and deceit. The characters find themselves in a thick web of lies while dangerous as well as deadly puzzle pieces are laid to further bury the truth.<br /><br />Slow to go at first but all in all, a very good read!
B009AY04A8|1.0|terrible worst game ever dumb repetitive did I say lame not worth three cents lame lame lamer lamest what were they thinking lame lame lame holy crape this game is lame

B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is a very handy app for anyone who is really into music.  It allows you to identify those songs you hear on the radio (or even TV commercials).
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is a movie worth watching again and again!  I can't wait for the next one to come out in December...
B000002GB4|4.0|This item arrived within a reasonable amount of time and was in good condition.  Not really one of the greatest albums from Styx, but it has a couple of good songs on it.  I especially like Amazon's auto rip feature.
B00447L4KA|5.0|She really wanted this movie for her birthday.  I believe she has watched it everyday since she opened it.  Se was very happy!!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is such a great actor. He did a fabulous job portraying Lincoln.I would recommend this movie for everyone.
1933492953|5.0|I bought Framed Ink when it came out .And I keep referring to it. The illustrations are sumptuous and the thought behind every picture very clear and easy to follow.16 dollars for 128 page of pure genius.Thank you Marcos for taking the time to write this book, a huge fan of yours.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very nice game it's one of the best majong I have played, hour's of fun and I got free in app of the day on 12/05/13
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|The video quality was pretty bad at first... But Amazon fixed everything for me and quickly too... I could not be more pleased...
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Very cool game. However at first it takes 1/2 a GB, then it needed to download more, and today it` s asking for even more memory space (93MB).
B002NWRMVS|5.0|I love this CD. Her music is so soothing. It really relaxes me. I will definately buy more that the two I have.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My 6 year old granddaughter loved this gift.  I gave it to her today and she couldn't wait to open the box and start putting it together.<br /><br />I would recommend Lego Friends City Park Café 3061.
B0012GMVXU|5.0|This CD is a good one by Leonard Cohen. Better than the other one I bought before and gave away.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love this sweeper. It really does a good job. I am using it on my carpet for spot cleaning and also on my kitchen floor. I wanted and old style one but this one is battery operated and the battery gets recharged. It's great. You are going to love it.
0345803493|4.0|This book was the second of a sweet love story not just an erotic novel. I enjoyed reading all three books.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Only Quentin can capture the naked truth and deliver it unadulterated. Probably not intended for Mother's Day.  But even the lades will find naked refreshing.  If the sale of black fish net panty hose and bull whips go up significantly, don't be surprised.
0345803485|4.0|I have read all three books and enjoyed the sweet love story as well as the erotic side of it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is a great game but I think it needs more mobs. also I think the nether portal should work in creative and survival. otherwise great game.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|i love JT.the music is just a little too hip-hop for me.i do like &#34;suit and tie&#34;and &#34;pusher love girl&#34;.
B008EKON56|4.0|Like the title states, the connector works great but has no locking device. Its useful when using it as a player/charger in a stationary location, but not if your moving.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|He is really in his mature strength! Thanks, Joe, for another peak of your work! Waiting for your concert in Vilnius!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Book kept my interest from cover to cover.  It was a nice read on the beach.  I purchased the essential Jack Reached because of this.
B004FHCH9Q|5.0|This was such a good psychological thriller! It made me pity those with memory loss (I never knew how much it could hinder someone's life) but it also kept the mood heightened and intense with all the violence and deceit. Awesome movie
B009AZZEU2|5.0|wow. back after a 15 year hiatus. not the soundgarden i remember from the 90's, by any means. chris cornell is not hitting the screaming highs he did on motorfinger. and, they are sticking to what they do best, the slow and medium tempo heavy stuff. if you dig soundgarden (and i have all their old stuff and love it) then you'll dig this. just keep an open mind.
B006N57PXG|4.0|good read, fun and young adult friendly. It's not mind blowing, but i enjoyed it. I'd definitely recommend it if you can find it on sale.
B004259BMM|5.0|Good guitar, good voice, catchy tunes. I would recommend this to anyone, country or rock fan. Check out &#34;You'll think of me&#34;.
B002GLWMK2|4.0|Great movie showing both the music & their developing as a group. Also, look<br />at films on The Yardbirds to see what took place for Yardbirds to become<br />members of other bands, ie Led Zep
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I am not a big country fan, mostly alt rock, but I listened to some of the tracks after he performed on American Idol. This is one of my favorite CD's. Check it out.
B000GOWNPU|2.0|I am not a prude but I don't need profanity in what Hollywood thinks is<br />cutting edge or &#34;reality&#34;. Let them know you have a mind & soul!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Works perfectly. Offers different styles &amp; looks. I use the note 2 so I kinda have a phone &amp; a tablet. I find that this is the best keyboard for my needs
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|I actually saw this in a theater and am writing this review to save you the cost of the DVD.  I only wish someone had done the same before I had dropped $16 on tickets.  In all honesty, the real reason I ended up seeing this movie with my wife was that \\"Argo\\" was sold out.<br /><br />This movie was a mess from start to finish.  It seems like it was directed by a make-up artist, it's only purpose being to try to disguise the actors beyond the point of recognition.<br /><br />If that, in fact, was the point, then bravo.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, the few remaining people in the theater actually began clapping for their favorite make-up job as each actor was shown wearing each of his character's faces.  It was odd to hear an audience applauding the credits, but in truth, it was probably the most interesting part of the film.<br /><br />The story line was disjointed and not at all compelling.  I can only assume that the script was equally as bad since there were some fairly top-notch, albeit highly made-up, actors in this train wreck that could not keep it on the rails.  Why they agreed to do the film is a mystery.<br /><br />Read the book - I think it's supposed to be pretty good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks. My friend and I play this game every day. If you haven't bought this game, you need to or you are going to miss a lot of fun
B009CV7IIA|2.0|Being a child of the 80s, weaned on TRS-80s, the HHG to the Galaxy, and Monty Python, I should have liked this book. Instead, the main character came off as boastful, cold, and shallow, constantly rattling off the 100s of hours he logged playing popular 80s video games and re-watching bad 80's movies. The nostalgia does not merit a plod through poor writing and unsympathetic characters.
B00C2ISGP4|2.0|I love this movie, but the steelbook case for this edition is not up to the usual standard for steelbooks. It will not stay closed and the unit flexes too easily. Not like other steelbooks I have purchased.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|Very original. I hope there is a sequel. Better yet I hope Brandon does a full length novel on this character.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was hesitant to start watching this series.  However, a friend told me how he really got into the characters and their struggle to survive.  It is a very good series and I had a hard time turning off the TV, even at 2AM.  I am sad that I have watched all of the episodes so quicky and have to wait for the next season on TV.  I highly recommend this series to anyone that has a strong stomach and can handle some gore.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing it keeps you on the edge wondering what will happen I still can't believe that Petra and Katrina got seperated omg can't wait to read the next book
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Here's a breakdown of what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy about Flight:<br /><br />Pros:<br />● Denzel's great performance<br />● John Goodman, as Denzel's drug dealer and old friend, is absolutely hilarious<br />● The cancer ward patient (who has a smoke with Denzel & Nicole in the hospital stairwell) makes for a very enjoyable scene<br />● A 60's and 70's laced soundtrack (i.e., The Rolling Stones, Lou Reed, etc.)<br />● Don Cheadle gives a short-lived, but solid performance as well<br /><br />Cons:<br />● Scenes involving Nicole (Kelly Reilly) whose character could have been done without IMO<br />● Didn't understand the purpose of the scene with Denzel's co-pilot and his \\"Jesus freak\\" wife set in the hospital<br /><br />Honestly, I walked out of this movie the first time thinking that it was great and after seeing it a second time I still think it holds a solid 7 or 8 out of 10.  A lot of people seem to dislike the ending.  Personally, I didn't mind it - I thought it fit the story line pretty well.  To all of you who disliked the end, what do you think would have made for a good ending?
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I loved the hidden objects !! You really had to search for the  objects!! When we'll you have the sequel?? It's the best one I've played in a long time.!!!<br />johannabraddom@tds<br />I recommend this app!!It's challenging!!!!!!! Loved it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first two books were fast paced, but this book seemed to drag on. Not as good or as exciting
B00AEFXZEO|5.0|How can anyone not love this iconic film which defined a generation. This is the original film which made actor Kevin Bacon a star. The paramount transfer disappoints however and I was surprised that Paramount did not give this Blu-ray presentation the attention it deserved. Forget the 2012 remake.  This IS the original!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great time for adults also.  If you love to garden try this app out!  Even after placing an object down you can move them<br />as you wish. This game helped while resting up after surgery.
B003KK65KG|4.0|I love the way Jodi Picoult has written this book from the perspective of so many characters within the book. I really started to question whose side I was batting for by the end. Not sure about the ending.. I thought it was a bit bland after such a great twist. Other than that I couldn't put it down. I would recommend to anyone who if a fan of Jodi Picoult, it won't disapoint.
B008GZVHZI|1.0|This item is not what it claims to be and I am very upset that I paid for something that I did not receive correctly.
B00957T6X6|3.0|I decided to read \\"A Game of Thrones\\" after watching seasons 1 and 2 on HBO. My daughter had read the first books and told me that the series was pretty true to the books. I was hooked and bought the 5 books bundle.<br /><br />I read and skipped some because I had seen the 2 seasons in a marathon. I wanted to read more on the Starks.  I wanted to know how they would deal with the misfortunes the had befallen them. I read. I read. And I read. The books we're long, but I was hooked on the Starks.  They symbolized  the meaning of honor and I wanted to read about their perseverance through their struggles.<br /><br />What did I get for all my reading. More characters.  I didn't mind Tyrion Lannister; in subtle ways he made me like his character.  I finished the books but I was left wanting.  I won't even watch the show anymore.<br /><br />Who would I recommend this book to?  I would recommend it to someone who doesn't mind disappointment and reading about a million characters.  The author writes well and brings the characters to life. I just wish there hadn't been so many.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars for effort after all that writing.
B00632KSXI|5.0|high high high quality LP that came with of course two free MP3 download cards - always a great thing. AWOL really cares about quality of music and it shows with this double album. LOVE THIS BAND
B005COO1X6|5.0|This book was a good read. It read easy and was not overly descriptive. The characters were easy to relate to and very likeable.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|So very, very believable. A wide variety of voices telling a gripping story. It remained fascinating to the very end.
0156027321|5.0|Not only is this story compelling, but the author writes beautifully.  Each word is like a small jewel that creates a beautiful masterpiece.
B004WR125O|5.0|Does the job !!<br />Range is also decent enough.<br />I would recommend it to someone looking for a hassle free wireless connection for their onkyo avr.
145162445X|4.0|Professor Krauss is clearly knowledgable about the subject of the book and does a reasonable job of bringing genius level concepts down to above-average intelligence level comprehension. I handed it to a person of lesser sophistication but who was still interested in space and astronomy and they found it to be greek. Also, he constantly poked jabs at creationists. While I understood the impulse, the attitude kind of read as elitist and after the 50th or so reference I found it a bit grating. Overall, a good read if you did well in high school or undergrad level science, and you aren't some thin-skinned creationist.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Enjoyable story that provides comedy, romance and a lot of emotion. The characters interaction is believable and keeps you engaged throughout.
0312857063|5.0|The second in the Sword of Truth series is a bigger and more sophisticated novel than the original, &#34;Wizards' first rule&#34;. One of the blurbs compared it to &#34;The Empire Strikes Back&#34;. I found this to be an apt comparison. It is well worth the read!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Amazon.com keeps asking for my evaluation of products I've purchased.  This product arrive on-time and in excellent condition.  The packaging was fine and received without damage.  The product was exactly as ordered.  If I ever have a problem, I will post a negative report.  Otherwise, I have what I wanted, when I wanted and I am satisfied.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this third book an d could not put it down. It is as good as the first two and now there will b a fourth.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This was a great read..full of suspense. I would recommend this book as a great one to take on vacation with you
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I love this disc...Merchant's talents shine in it.  Her skill at writing music to aptly capture the essence of each poem and create the right 'mood' is very affecting.
0385349947|5.0|So far I really like this book.  The author is very &#34;real&#34; in her style of writing and sharing her experiences of her life in the business world.  I plan to pass it on to my grandaughters as soon as I finish it.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|The CD itself was in excellent condition as promised, but the content on the disc is what made the purchase worth it. Paramore has a new sound, yes, but it is more mature and still has a bit of the old feel. I would night recommend this album, which has a little bit of everything, to the casual listener and the hardcore fan.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|I was so looking forward to this book after having read the first one, I was so in love with the series but was completely disappointed.  It could still be a great series hoping a for a better book 3
B00005YU1O|5.0|Lucid dreaming, death, life, and artistic features. What could be better.<br />Definitely one of my favorite films of all time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Run. Jump. Swing. Zip. Tilt. Cart. Spelunk? Slide. Elude. Dash. Sprint. Turn. Power up. Become a snack. Need I say more?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As good as the other two. This trilogy is very adventurous, and I had a hard time putting the books down.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A quick read that was better than the popular movie.  Would interest people studying psychology and grief I think.  Somewhat predictable.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Awesome! Can't wait to read the next one.  I think these books are very adventurous and find myself having a hard time putting them down.
0811870413|5.0|A very down to earth, experiential guide to making real, hearty bread. The no-knead method also is a welcome breather from hands covered in a sticky mess of dough.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I must admit, I wondered how Cruise would be when playing Reacher. But IMHO, he truly makes Jack Reacher come believably alive on the screen. I think another reviewer said that Cruise nails it, and he does indeed. An exceptionally well-done film, it covers all the bases in unraveling the mystery. Give it a try.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I think it's awesome because it has more detail and jumps higher.So I really recomend this game because I love it.
B00AMXXN2W|5.0|Because these reviews are cross-posted this is a review of ISBN: 0517123207, with a cover that was defiantly made to be provocative. It depicts an (ape) allying view of going from all fours to upright. If this is what you are looking for then you need to read \\" 2001 : A Space Odyssey\\" by Arthur Charles Clarke.<br /><br />This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle : Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" ISBN: 014043268X (see my review May 24, 2000). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.<br /><br />Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).<br /><br />If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)<br /><br />The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.<br /><br />In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Book was well written and it was nice to follow her career up till present day.  I know the area she grew up so it was very familiar to me.
B004W7C5CI|5.0|Two men are sitting on a cement bench by the garden wall. One casually says there are evil spirits all around. As a woman in white glides by the second man Francis (Friedrich Feh&eacute;r) says that is my fianc&eacute;e Jane (Lil Dagover) and let me tell you what happened to us.<br /><br />As his story begins we are subjected to a weird world of light and twisted shadows. A strange Dr. (Caligari played by Werner Krauss) brings a somnambulist (sleeping man played by Conrad Veidt) to a local fair. The somnambulist knows all things and can predict the future; he prophesizes correctly Allan's (friend of Francis and rival for Jane's hand) murder and pilfers Jane from her bed chamber. But how can this be; as Francis has been keeping an eye on the doc and the snoozer all night and they have not moved?<br /><br />I leave you with this thought \\"Du mu&szlig;t Caligari warden\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:0520220692 The Ufa Story: A History of Germany's Greatest Film Company, 1918-1945 (Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism, 23)]]
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed the premise of this book, since I have been a fan of the language of flowers and I always worry about  what  happens to kids in the foster care system.<br />This book rings true  and was hard to put down . I recommend it.
1593081316|5.0|Atty. Mr. Utterson is worried, as the keeper of Dr Henry Jekyll's will. The will gives everything to Edward Hyde incase of Henry's death or disappearance.  Mr. Utterson met the hideous Hyde once and does not trust him. Well it looks like Henry's will will have to be executed as the housekeeper; Mr. Pool thinks Hyde hid Henry's body.<br /><br />Once again, I saw Spencer Tracy before I read the book, so I was anticipating a different type of story. I read \\"Treasure Island\\" so I am familiar with Stevenson's writing style but I did not realize that this story was more of a mystery that draws the conclusion and revelation in the end. The explanation of man and his duel personality is excellent and I suspect he draws on personal experience.<br /><br />I read the kindle version. It was sparse and strait forward; there was not a lot of fluff and speculation from other personalities. I made sure that the text-to speech was activated before purchasing. This helped but I had to keep reminding myself that the names were mispronounced.<br /><br />In any event without the kindle I probably would have bought the book but not gotten around to reading it for a few years.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000EYUD4 Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde Double Feature (1932/1941)]]
1451668945|2.0|The best I can say is I did read it to the end.  Not a hard read, but not one you really cared about.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Lots of dialog allowed me to get through this book quickly. Reichs didn't disappoint. An intriguing beginning that reels you in and keeps you interested until the end. Some educational bits about Yellowknife, a remote location I'd heard about but was unfamiliar with, added to my interest. Looking forward to the next book and hoping Tempe gets back with Ryan soon!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Found writing faulty but I received the message.  In his profession there are not many believers as he is.  Thanks to him for his courage!
B003TJ4YUQ|1.0|I liked the DVD very much. But the second time I tried to play it, It stopped in the middle. I have no idea why, but I was disappointed.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Lots of twists! Had me laughing and crying. I loved this movie. Definitely want to see again. A must-buy for sure!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I love this CD! Can hardly wait for the new one to be released! I have heard him play a little on<br />House, was surprised to find these CD on Amazon! Love it!!
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|I felt the only part of the show worth watching was the last 20-30 minutes. The rest of the show seemed like filler material. The fight in the house was so phoney, I almost turned the movie off. I'm glad I didn't, since it eventually picked up the pace. Finally, Tom Cruise, in my mind was not the right man for portraying Reacher. He is definitely not intimidating enough.<br />RJ
B005LF9IO8|4.0|This film moves along at a great pace and interest is maintained through out. The acting all round is spot on and Saoirse Ronan stands out amongst all the performances. I am huge Chemical Brothers fan and I found that the soundtrack really added to the movie. The perfect accompaniment to a fast paced thriller.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I've always enjoyed crows acting. He does a good job pulling off this version of Robin Hood. I would recommend this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played! Everyone should play this game my brother even enjoys this game
B004SBULWE|4.0|This free app works pretty good for most apps in shutting them down.  Yes, its free and yes, what do you expect for free.  Still, its pretty decent and if it shut down every task, then I'd give it a 5.  As it is, its a 4.5 to me and well worth it on my Pipo and my wife's Samsung Galaxy Note.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Don't buy many DVDs but had to have this one. Good price and lots of extras. Would recommend to anyone.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was pretty good, held my interest and kept me wanting to know what happened next. Good and quick read!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Another mahjong but one which will become a firm favourite. Thank you for very good graphics and sounds. Well done!
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Backed up with some of the best covers of Beatles songs, this is a great visual representation of the Vietnam era.  I enjoyed this film immensely and the music was the icing on the cake.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Hard to read but I stuck with it and it was worth it . I enjoyed the the story even though it was as I said it was hard to read I had to concentrate on each word or am I getting old?  Ha ha
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I liked the movie well enough, but it wasn't up to the same caliber as the LOTR movies, which is a shame because those were done so amazingly well. All in all though, I still liked it, just not enough to give it 4 or 5 stars.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|Very historical in its contents. I would like to see a bio before or after each segment outlining some of its authencity.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|did not work i was counting on it to get me up and failed. deleted it already and will not be using
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Mostly enjoyable, but typical Cruise character. Robert Duvall's role was a hoot, and the villains were properly menacing. I had fun seeing Lee Child in a non-speaking cameo as a desk cop (watch for it about halfway through). A decent way to spend an hour-and-a-half.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This movie was a nice welcome to the norm of these two races. If your the type that follow Vampire lore you'll enjoy this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love using evernote for all areas of work. It great! As a Bible college student, I find it useful for the ministry in taking notes and keeping up with contacts.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|These one was a whole lot better than the first. It's just a filler in my Marvel collection of moives. I'm hoping that Marvel can get Blade/ Ghost Rider/ Moon Knight together
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Started reading on a whim and couldn't put it down for two days. A modern classic that will stay with you long after you've reached the final page.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Silver Linings is one of those movies you can see and relate to. I like the roles of every charter, strong leds. I think this can pass for a mordern day one who flew over the coo coo nest.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read Hunger Games in one night and immediately started the second one. Fantastic series - fast paced and original. Put twilight to Shame. No spoilers here -- just get the whole series and start at the beginning you won't be sorry!
B009AMANBA|5.0|So many things that happened during that period of time have shaped our today world in so many ways.  Our lives are so much richer today because of Lincoln's passion and dedication....great movie!
6305558167|5.0|We have liked this movie from the beginning.  Needed it in DVD to replace VHS.  Good story line and following of the Story.
0470876417|5.0|Great book for entrepreneurs, this will help you to visualize and better understand your new or current business to optimize its potential!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Just switched to the Blu Ray version From VHS.  Excellent Movie all around for the family. We enjoy it very much.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Five stars I just love it is on my kid's tablet but to be honest I play all the time
1416575464|5.0|I've never seen Domino magazine so unlike others, everything was new to me here. I've checked out this book numerous times from the library, and ended up using many of the ideas. Just checked it out again so I can paint the picture I love on page 47 (gold frame). Some ideas used: a 'sweet asceticism' sugar pink bedroom, turned out even more gorgeous than imagined. Chocolate brown velvet curtains ceiling mounted as on page 38 - a big success. Venetian mirror in entryway as on page 29 - perfect. Earthy fiber rug as seen on many pages. Love the aesthetic represented here.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|I had forgotten how much I loved this album when I was in my teens - listening to it brought back so many memories. Especially love &#34;I Saw You&#34;....beautiful, haunting ballad.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like this style of game but I'm usually not that impressed with the story as it develops. This was creative and interesting!
B0084I3E3A|1.0|I am not happy with the purchase as the book did not contain the profile.  It is not worth the time and money to return it.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Excellent album and even better if you can find the Japanese version. In Japan at the time POP was released, an extra track was added to CDs to make them a more desirable purchase which explains why the Japanese release of Pop included an extra track, Holy Joe (Guilty Mix). Holy Joe was only performed live during U2's press conference held in a Manhattan K-mart when they announced their tour dates. Holy Joe can also be found as a b-side on many of the Discotheque singles.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Watched 90 minutes of it on a flight to Philly of all places, had to shut it off to land, tried to crank it up to see last 30 minutes , would not play, so yeah I don't like ti because Ididn't see the ending
B005XLN97M|5.0|This was a B-day gift for my little one, she absolutely loved it and still has lots of fun with it. Thank you!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I surprisingly really liked it.  I have read every novel and thought the last few were boring.  I started reading the book before I read the poor reviews.  Before I read the reviews I was enjoying the book.  I loved the return of the old characters and the book was like early books that were action packed and filled with revelations.  After I read the reviews I was disappointed, but I kept reading.  I still continued to enjoy the book.  I liked the succinct ending with no loose ends.  What do the people who wrote poor reviews have against happy endings!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie had humor, drama; was sad at times and could make you angry.  It was a way to learn about the attitudes of that time period.  I did not like the ending.
1477467041|5.0|Although this book was published years ago--it is a quick read and outlines five simple steps that will produce ideas for just about any endeavor that you wish to undertake.  Want to write a cookbook?  Design houses? Change your current job? You might have to read it twice.  Then, do the steps. Then, let it go.  Ideas will come flowing your way--in the shower, walking around, talking to friends.  It works.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie which has suspense, comedy and drama.  Great for elementary school age children who are not quite ready for real scary movies.
B00AHB92JM|5.0|Great portrayal on the origins of the character and his adventures later on. Also nice cleavage shots from Eva Mendes to keep the movie even more interesting. 2 thumbs up!!!

1400069807|5.0|This excellently researched and well-written book explores the history of processed food, and how those foods are manipulated to addict us.<br /><br />I cook from scratch for most things, because I have multiple severe food allergies. If I didn't already cook from scratch, I would after reading this book.<br /><br />Most processed food is garbage, and a lot of it is unsafe to eat. I strongly recommend this book to anyone concerned about their health and the health of their family.<br /><br />The biggest change I am going to make after reading this is to completely avoid any meat not purchesed through our local butcher or directly from organic farmers. It's truly scary what's in most meat. I will never eat processed meat again. That includes ground meat, unless I grind it.
B000057DON|5.0|I enjoyed re-visiting this landmark album more than I thought I would.<br />The production has lost none of it's edge over the years.<br />The Gunners were a strong unit til Axl's ego blew out of proportion, he was merely a cog in the machine - where he should have stayed.  Izzy was always my favorite.

B002NWRMVS|1.0|I have every Norah Jones album and this is the only one that I would give a bad rating to. The songs are horrible as well as the producing. It is like someone went out of the way to hurt her career. I recently went back to give it another listen but found it worse than before. Four other Norah fans were with me and felt the same. I have her Little Willies CDs as well as her music with the Peter Malick Group so I know her sound can be diverse but bad is bad!!
B0053FANQS|4.0|A fun movie and very enjoyable. I would recomend it to all my freinds. I liked the story very much.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|I have two admissions: I'm late to the party as far as MUSE is concerned, and second, I'm a sucker for a concept album.<br />As a writer, I gravitate towards music that tells a story, that evokes something beyond just a desire to dance (though I enjoy those on their own merits as well). Since picking up The Resistance, it has become a regular background soundtrack for when I'm writing. The soundscape they create, the innovate arrangement, and passionate (if occasionally goofy) lyrics sparkle with creativity in ways that most bands don't even dare try.<br />At times summoning the spirit of classic Queen, at times Alan Parsons Project's \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination,\\" at times the world-building ambitions of Janelle Monae or Coheed and Cambria, The Resistance is kind of like a buffet of awesome influences. It is the Exogenesis symphony in three parts at the end of the album that is the true masterpiece here--an epic at 12 minutes plus that unifies the whole.<br />A rewarding listen from beginning to end, it probably isn't for all tastes. But for those looking for a sci-fi epic in musical form that ranges from driving rock to lush classical tones (the ending of \\"United States of Eurasia\\" being a great example and a personal favorite), you can't go far wrong here. Best listened to as intended--straight through front to back.
0143122916|4.0|I bought this book because John Green mentioned it in a video. It showed what it was like in a camp in North Korea, and how difficult it is to adjust to civilization.
B003XT603Q|4.0|This was my second Murakami book after 1Q84 and I liked it.  Murakami's vivid first-person depiction of teenage angst in the backdrop of 1960s Japan was deeply personal, engrossing, and bittersweet.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|It's my favorite cd of all time at the moment. I listen to it constantly. I do recommend you get it.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This book brings you through all three at different times. At times I almost felt like I needed to dry the damp gloom from my brain. It is such a heavy story but not in a disturbing way. I do not know what exactly drew me to it but now that I have read it I think it will be dwelling in my head for quite awhile. It is almost like odd stories you know about your own family lore. You aren't always sure the details are exactly right when you remember them later but you have the basic idea. I think this is a book that I could reread several times,and always pick up on different nuances. I literally could not out it down for the second half of the book. I absolutely craved each twist and turn in Ms Winter's tale. It is an excellent book and I can not wait to see what else the author has up her sleeve.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love this movie! It is so beautiful, the perfect chick flick and I got it at an awesome price!!
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen has a talent of taking such true present principles of human society and stating them just so in her books that they catch her readers by at first surprise, then strike them with the reality of the statement itself. Jane Austen incorporates many of these statements into this book, and creates a comedy within multiple love stories with slight twists that predict the book from becoming too predictable or boring. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys Jane Austen already and who likes classic love tales with slight bits of humor and intellect integrated into the events and conversations of the overall story.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Pretty fun game.def a good time killer. Decent graphics and style of a slower rts makes it enjoyable enjoyable and fun to play. Only thing is getting coins takes a while if u don't want to spend real money
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the fact that this story had multiple love stories intertwined, and how Jane Austen keeps the reader guessing who is going to get with who next. I also admire how Austen shows Emma's character change through the relationships that she has with others throughout the story. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a classic humorous, yet at times intellectual, love story that ends very well and doesn't leave the reader screaming at the book for having a dissatisfying ending. I would give this book 10 stars if I could:), if that says anything about my enjoyment in reading this book:)
B00000G3PA|5.0|Armageddon was one of the first \\"the world's ending\\" type movies I had ever seen when it first came out on video. It's an all star cast ready to put a roller coaster of emotions rushing through each person. It's a story of Love, dedication to a job, comedic relief of the bizarre & down to earth characters. There's comedy, drama, romance, action, and a basic story-line which is completed perfectly by the characters. The actors really bring you into the movie. 5 stars for an older movie to me!
B007SSEZNA|4.0|To start off, I did read the actual book and was a very big fan of it. So, in comparison to the book, this movie is somewhat accurate, but as in all movies they did add events that never happened, and big reveals weren't as big because they had the characters give hints of secret affections and feelings in this movie. The movie is pretty slow, but I guess the book was a little too. As most readers are, I am a little biased in character portrayal also and I feel that at least half of the characters, particularly Harriet Smith, were not portrayed correctly. But then again, I am biased on that certain point. Overall, the chemistry between the characters was well portrayed and I believe that it was a pretty good movie; not bad for the rental price I paid, it was less than seeing it in a theater or something.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|Arrow has become my guilty pleasure. It took a few episodes for the writers to find their feet, but I didn't care. There aren't many shows out there other than Castle that have this kind of chemistry between the leads--in this case Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell), John Diggle (David Ramsey), and Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards). Credit has to go to the producers for shaping the show based on what does or doesn't work. Felicity's character is a perfect example. Originally intended as a one-time character, when the fans went nuts for her snark they brought her back as a regular. And what a difference it has made! She balances out the male hormones of the other two with much needed humor. It's great. And the first episode is worth watching if only for the nonverbal duel between Oliver and Diggs for whether the bodyguard can stay with his charge long enough to do his job. Diggs is not just muscle. He's got brains and a common sense to him that Oliver badly needs.<br /><br />Another factor worth singling out are the chase and fight scenes. I don't know that I've ever seen so much excellent Parkour. The fight scenes are amazing. Truly remarkable. And, as someone who has studied both fencing and the martial arts I don't often say that! Part of what I like are the way characters use the environment around them in the fight. It makes the scenes both more realistic and more exciting to watch. Kudos to their choreographer and to Stephen Amell, who does much of his own action.<br /><br />Is the show perfect? No. I find much of the back story on the island to be boring. And after nearly a full season, I can't see what ANY of the men (other than her father, for whom one expects love to be blind) see in the character of Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy).<br /><br />Other factors on the show fall in-between. Dr. Who fans will like the guest appearance of John Barrowman (who played Captain Jack Harkness) and Alex Kingston (Prof. River Song) while Dresden Files fans will be glad to see Paul Blackthorne as a regular. The writing is uneven, but generally sound and has definitely improved as the season has gone on. The eye candy is plentiful and enjoyable. On the whole, you have to give the show a huge thumbs up. It has become my guilty pleasure. Give it a chance and you may find it becomes yours as well! Highly recommended.aul Blackthorne as a regular.

0307352145|5.0|I always wished I was more extroverted and often prodded myself into situations I thought would teach me to become more so.  But after reading this book, I've come to appreciate the qualities in myself I almost totally disregarded in my short-sighted admiration for extroversion.  I thought I had to be an extrovert in order to be successful.  Now my perspective has changed and I feel I can have a far more balanced approach to achieving a satisfying and fulfilling life.

B006M4F67A|4.0|Great app for Mahjong, nice and clean layout but I took a star away because the description says: unwind to the sound of crashing waves while lazily removing tiles.... That is why i got this version. I wanted to relax with the waves but there are no wave sounds during gameplay. The game itself is good though.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was the best book in the series I am just disappointed that the author is not adding to it.  I wish this was not the finally but as they say all great things come to an end.
B0034G4OYA|3.0|I have not made it through the end of this movie yet, so I guess that speaks volumes about whether  I really like it or not.  I didn't find it funny or endearing and I get the general message about an overprotective but loving father trying to look out for his daughter but this one ranks low in the animated films category in my humble opinion.<br /><br />**Addendum - February 1, 2014 - Finally watched this movie from start to finish and I decided that I like the movie.  It is not the typical Disney or Pixar fare (translation: geared toward kids with lots of catchy songs) and probably better understood by adults (like Shrek) than kids.  The ending scene is definitely enjoyable because it has a catchy song (one of few in the movie) and my 2 year old loves dancing to it.  All in all, the movie has a sweet message/premise and is family friendly.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This is a great case! Its versitile, funtional, and handsome to boot. Im very glad i went with this model.
193700788X|1.0|I can't in good conscience recommend this book to anyone, simply because it is a very poorly written book.<br /><br />My main issue with the way the Southern Vampire Mystery series has ended is the lack of \\"mystery\\". It was the mystery format which made this series so engaging, without that blueprint the series has simply died a slow death - a whimper and not a bang. In the end, the series got distracted by the relationships and never recovered.<br /><br />I realised a few books ago, that the Sookie and Eric storyline was not going to end well. At the time I wasn't too worried about Sookie's \\"happily ever after\\" figuring Charlaine had a plan. Though I do remember adding the proviso - as long as she doesn't end up with \\"blank\\".<br /><br />Then last year as I finished Deadlocked, I realised I was unlikely to be pleased with the series finale Dead Ever After, I was right to be worried.<br /><br />I wont even go in to the plot and its issues for fans.<br /><br />This book is a poorly constructed mish mash, as have been the last three books, a strong Editorial influence is is sadly lacking. Characters from previous books have been crammed in, continuity errors abound and half finished sub-plots simply drift away to nothingness. Not to mention the random change in writting style for this book.<br /><br />Best leave this one one the shelf.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really love this game alot. I enjoy the hidden object games and its nice because it was free.  I feel it should be easier  to get the diamonds but other than that a great game. I hope they make more.
B0016J81B4|5.0|Bought these for my husband who just had a total hip replacement and needed slip on non slip shoes.  I wore these when I worked in a restaurant and they were great.  Doctor told me not to give him back his old shoes as it would make him walk like before surgery.  These are the best yet from Crocs.  They do fit better than the beach ones.  Worth every penny and a great price on Amazon!
193700788X|1.0|I wanted Sookie to be with Sam.  Happy about that.  Very unhappy about the lack of passion and the book in general.  There was a big lack of feeling in how this was written.  So I returned it.  I will not pay for a book, that I have waited a year for, that leaves me feeling sad and the writing was terrible.  I should have returned the last book when I had the chance.  I will never read another book by her again.

B0006J28BO|4.0|This movie was entertaining, but it didn't blow me away.<br />Plot: 3/5 Not well developed at all.<br />Characters: 5/5 The characters are probably the best part of the movie. They're lovable and diverse, each serving his own purpose in the story.<br />Setting: 4/5 Nice. That's about it.<br />Animation style: 3/5 The cat's look alright, and the music is great, but Haru, the main character, is a wreck. Her ears are too high up, her bangs don't come down far enough, and her skirt looks like a giant, blue, plastic bowl with a hole cut out in the middle. The lone exception to Hayao Miyazaki's great animation.<br />Total: 15/20 A pretty good movie, but don't watch it if you're looking for something truly captivating.

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is full of truth, hope, humor, friendship, and beautiful characters that you wish you personally knew.  John writes beautifully...so many sentences I re-read over and over.  TFIOS explores the idea of self-sacrifice and nobility, the idea of individual heroism and the universe, how the smallest quirk and the grandest, most metaphorical gesture hold the same weight in love and friendship.  Every once in awhile, but not nearly often enough, a book comes along that you must finish reading no matter what the time of night, or morning, and in spite of the next full day facing you after the deficit of sleep you will suffer because you couldn't close the treasure that you hold in your hands.

B009NY43NY|5.0|Ms. Harris, I loved this book!!  As you stated in the foreward of the book, some of the books were great and some maybe not so great--but I have loved the Sookie series nevertheless.  I really enjoyed how you chose to wrap up this series.  I watch True Blood as well, and I really, really wish the producers and creators would have stuck with the integrity of the series instead of going so far off track like they did last season.  I mean, it's all entertainment and I will likely continue to watch ... but so much has been missed the way they have done the series.  I read every single book, some more than once, in the series and I never failed to look forward to the next.  I am said the series is now ended, but very pleased with where Ms. Harris went with the story line.  Thank you for an excellent ride!!

It is similar to Temple Run,but I like it more. It is quite challenging but not too challenging. I think it is more for 3rd Grade and up but you could try it for younger kiddos. I Love it and I think it should be worth money instead of free,but sure glad it is free. Overall,this is my favorite app and very addictive and entertaining!!! I highly recommend it!! :)

B006LSZECO|2.0|It was Interesting in parts but overall slow moving and a difficult to believe and unsatisfying conclusion in my opinion.
193700788X|1.0|I like others feel like Charlaine Harris really got away from the whole dynamic of the characters. I mean Eric was nothing like he was in other books. Ultimately I knew Sookie wouldn't end up with Eric, that's not what bothers me. I felt totally invested/devoted to her whole series. I understand its her book to write the way she wants but after this many books, you would think fans would've mattered. I truly wish I hadn't read Dead Ever After because I hate the way it was written and ended.<br /><br />Goodluck to those that choose to read it, hope you feel differently than I did!
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Unless there is something really pressing, forcing me to stop reading, I just can't put it down. The characters, plot line, imagery...all of it is so engrossing that sometime I will get lost in what I am reading. There are time I can almost feel Saphira and Eragons anguish and will tear up. A must read!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|An inspiriing amount of scenery, as this shows the actual movie (prior Les Miserables, more musically exciting, were stage performances with SOME props, but not full movies).  I much enjoy this, especially in Blu Ray. but have only watched it once.  I think I have become either spoiled or jaded with multiple older versions of this (I have three separate performances, but none that recreate the action like this does).

B00AIBZM40|3.0|Visually stunning looking, \\"Mama\\" is a pretty good thriller but would have made a much more effective horror movie if it had been rated \\"R\\" giving the director free reign to make a scarier horror film. Under the guidence of Guillermo Del Toro<br /><br />The fact is that although \\"Mama\\" was sold as a horror film, it's more of a thriller with lots of jump scares and atmosphere to spare. What works in \\"Mama\\" works well-- Jessica Chastian and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau both give exceptional performances with Chastian doing an outstanding job in a very different role for her to date.<br /><br />Equally notable are the children ( Megan Charpentier and Isabelle N&eacute;lisse) acting in the film who give very natural performances that help \\"sell\\" the film. \\"Mama\\" manages to transcend the predictability that creeps into the second half of the film much like the creature of the title of the film.<br /><br />Writer/director Andr&eacute;s Muschietti does a good job on his first feature film which shows a strong influence of Guillermo Del Toro who produced the film.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Two little girls are stranded after their father (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in a dual role) kills their mother and goes on the run.

Both, however, became feral while on their own and when they move into a new home (observed by a psychatrist), they bring something back with them.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer looks quite nice with rich, deep blacks and terrific detail.

0515153656|5.0|I read these books and after ech one could not wait to read another.  Reacher almost became real to me because of the way Lee Child writes his character.  It is fun, fast paced and a thrilling read.  I bought this book for my son, and he is looking forward to getting it and reading it for himself.  Lee Child just might have another fan real soon...
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a nice pixelly space shooter with modern twists like the way the bad guys explode is a subtle effect.
B00006AG5N|5.0|If you like Elvis in the earlier days, then you will like this one.  Many great songs with Elvis and the Jordanaires
B0073XORCY|5.0|ian Anderson is still a greath artist. rocker AND ministrel in the same music. Lyric is fresh and poetic. Good music
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Adorable and fun.  This app is simple and delightful. A gentle easy physics game with an charming floppy jellyfish who yearns to fly.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Love love love this show!! It is very addictive and cannot wait to see what is going to happen next. I fell in love with all the main characters and their stories. A must watch
B006LSZECO|5.0|More twists and turns than a roller coaster!!  Hoped for a different ending, but how about a sequel?  I would love that.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Imagine a 2 year old saying that.  It's hilarious.  So is this movie, even though I'm sure we've watched it over 50 times now (ah, life with young kids).  I really enjoy the storyline and the voice actors are spot on (I may even like Sarah Silverman a little now, just as long as she keeps the cute kiddy voice).  For anyone born in the early 80s, you'll enjoy the geekiness and the blue ray has a cool intermission mode for the pause button.
B007THA4FI|1.0|There is no redeeming value to this book.  Every character, every family was dysfunctional and pathological.  There was little plot and little character development.  I was very disappointed in this book.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|After all these years I have to admit that as corny as this movie truly is, I still truly love it.  I remember seeing it seven, yes SEVEN times, when it was in the theaters.  Just the feel of the jets on a big screen, hard to describe.  Keep flying Maverick!
B0085A9J18|5.0|I love this movie! I can not stop watching it.  Plus I got it for a great price.  Thank you.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Is almost one of the best I have read, but not the best. Pillars is better!<br />Follet did it so more women like it than men.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Both the kids and adults love the game. My borther and boyfriend fight over who is going to play next.  Thank you.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i think this game is the best because it is sort of like temple run but u can shoot things and upgrade your suit in the lab/stark shop
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie is a good buy.  The movie unfortunately is never as good as the book, but they tried.  I still watch it and can not wait for the next movie to come out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The fact that this could really be our world of the future is the scariest science fiction tale of all!  The characters are true to life, and you find yourself rooting for them.  Ingenious plot twists and action packed scenes keep you from putting it down!  Loved every minute of it!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show, nice to watch something new. I love the sci-fi stories. Looking forward to watching more. Thanks to amazon instant video
B0061PEAUY|4.0|The newest addition to the Temperance Brennan is a bit too formulaic to get five stars.  The plot hinges on a coincidence that is obvious.<br /><br />Regardless, the book is a good read and is sure to appeal to fans of Ms. Reichs and her character, Tempe Brennan.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It lived up to the hype. Great read. Have read it three times already. Interesting characters and storyline. Kudos to E.L. James
B0076DELIG|4.0|The most recent Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch novel is as compelling a  read as are the numerous earlier installments.  Harry continues to be stubbornly convinced of the rightness of his own unique view of law enforcement which of course causes conflict with the police supervisors.<br /><br />Harry's continuing inability to form a lasting relationship with any woman is becoming a bit tiresome after 20 years.  Harry is approaching 60.  Time for him to either deal with a few of his personal demons or at least to quit inflicting them on others.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The movies came quickly and were in great condition. i love that you can buy this series in a whole set way easyer way less expensive
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is a set of 5 separate, but linked stories of a peculiar future dystopian world.  Humanity has been reduced to a few thousand people who live in mammoth underground silos.  The very atmosphere of this world is poisonous and no communication is maintained among the various silos.<br /><br />These first stories hint at a controlling conspiracy, which just might be responsible for the poison in the air.  Some plot elements (for example the exodus of people from one silo) are not consistent with the set-up.  The stories make clear that exit can only be made through a single air lock.  Yet, there is a piling of bodies outside and inside the entrance and despite the open airlock, the silo remains unpoisoned.<br /><br />Despite this and a few other jarring inconsistencies, the stories are a quick and fun read.  The series is bound to grow as there are plenty of &#34;loose threads&#34; to drive future stories.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Amazing, crazy story of bravery, courage and resilency. This is what we give when we serve...some obviously more than others. A must read!!
B00459EZLW|5.0|ELI SMILING IS NOT AN ENDING. We want more of an ending to this show.  Maybe axon should buy the rights
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|I meet my husband on this app! Of course, I did run into a couple of Romance Scammers on here too (they were 'verified' also)
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome that I got really excited when I began to download it. it may not be as updated as the other minecrafts but it will get there.
B007FRHZ4A|3.0|We found some of the set ups suggested on the cards near impossible to complete so it did have a frustration factor.  Blocks and plastic pieces could be better made for easier stacking then the game would move faster & be more fun
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Could not believe he survived all of this.  The book is graphic and drives home the horrors of these camps.  Hopefully his story will help those still in the camps.  A must read.
B00628RVV0|5.0|my grandmother saw her parents and many others lined up and shot by a Nazi death squad. of course I thought about her the whole time I watched this, she was only a little girl around the same age as Shmuel. I honestly don't think she would be able to stomach watching this film as it would be more traumatic than most of the footage from the Holocaust and other films we have seen. because she lost her childhood and innocence and lived through the war as one so young, I believe this would simply be too much for her. but not for the rest of us. I'd never even heard of this story, the book or the movie. it came up randomly on my list of recommendations and my cat accidentally pressed the play button with his paw as I was about to watch something else (I often find WWII movies completely cliche and poorly portrayed) I'm pretty sure I was *meant* to watch this beautiful movie. ALL of the cast and supporting actors were superb. Vera Farmiga as the mom was just a joy to watch. clearly Bruno was his mother's son while Gretel was her father's daughter, down to their physical characteristics I felt that was made quite clear from the start.<br /><br />this movie is wonderful on so many levels, aside from the eloquent story it is quite amazing down to the last detail. having grown up in Eastern Europe I can say that I felt quite 'at home' with the chosen location and small details. I was very happy to see the story juxtaposed against every day life of the German family who lived comfortably, ate and dressed well and the like while mere miles away people were undergoing unspeakable horrors. as to the criticism of the boys naivete, I can understand but feel that people are dwelling on this in a manner that shows their own lack of understanding and cynicism. how can an 8 year old possibly comprehend such things? I was younger than that when my family had to sit me down and explain that I was a jew. what they said made absolutely no sense (even though I knew I was different) kids were of course propagandized and taught every form of anti-semitism from a young age, but this varied from place to place, family to family. some kids played together with no real strife or tension until the war escalated. kids were not walking around with iPads and smart phones, tweeting to their friends or playing with their Xbox. those kids were beautifully naive and innocent compared to many of our children who take the stance of a young adult before they understand anything whatsoever.<br /><br />lastly, everyone who sees this film needs to picture millions of Shmuels (that child actor's face was so painfully honest and real) these were people from every corner of europe, with extended families. think of all the mothers and fathers of all the Shmuels who were tortured and sacrificed...for nothing. think of the Polish, german, hungarian and other citizens going about their daily lives while jews lived in filth, beaten and murdered daily. this movie encapsulates all of that and so much more.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|A superbly remixed recording by Steve Wilson.  It should be noted that this particular CD is a Stereo Remix and is not surround sound or 5.1.  I'm hearing things I didn't hear in either my vinyl or old CD copies.  This is one great sounding stereo CD.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Where else can you get a history show with great world wide humor all the while telling about history, politics and how life used to be.<br /><br />What an excellent show.
B0018QCXH8|3.0|I would rate this 2.5 stars, but that is not one of the choices, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and gave it 3 stars.<br /><br />This is not a feel-good movie.  The movie is about a person, Plainview, that treats people horribly, and his son, who the main character neglected and treated poorly after the son lost his hearing in an accident at the dad's work site.<br /><br />Toward the end of the movie, the main character turns into a murderer.  There is little basis for the murder; it appears as if he simply has no need to control his anger and contempt for other people.  Remove self control, and the result is murder.<br /><br />So where is the message in the movie?  At its best, the movie gets mildly entertaining.  At other times, it is a significant irritant.
0060734191|5.0|I read this trilogy years ago and it is still one of my favorite Garth Nix novels. These books are a great coming-to-age  story, about hardship, love, and trust. I may be a little bias but I highly recommend these books to anyone that would like a challenge and a story that would stick with you for years like it has for me.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|We love the movie and were excited about the music we heard.  We are fond of Hawaiian music and hadn't heard most of the sounds.  After getting the CD, this music floats around our house at every opportunity, putting us in the mood for more vacations.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and I am so glad I did! It was a really charming, interesting book. I finished it in no time!
B005PK1G76|4.0|Great for keys and other items but the sides where the cups are supposed to go into is no good at all!  Don't expect to be able to put drinks in there!
1484051564|5.0|Bought for my daughter , as a required reading for class work. It is a great book of course and we are glad we got it.. this version has very small print and may not be for everyone, but that makes it very small and light and that was important for me as they already have lots of things to carry everyday.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Was never a big fan of the pop JT, but I liked Mirrors when I heard it, so was looking to see any of his live performances.......WOW!  The big band sound is just amazing!  Check out the Youtube vidoe's of his Ellen performance of Mirrors and Pusher Love Girl and you'll be floored with the performance.  Decided to get the album and enjoying the more adult JT
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have been enthralled with the story. I really look forward to the time to read more. His character development is excellent.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have been using Evermore for six months. It appears bug free.  I primarily use it to maintain a diary of notes of the days activities for my blog.<br /><br />It would be perfect if date of creation was shown in the list view of notes along with day of the week and there was native support for inserting timestamps.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a good puzzle app. It downloaded and runs great on my kindle fire hd. They have a lot of puzzles you can get and some of them are free.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is such a fabulously well-written, well-imagined series. The characters are richly detailed and so life like. I highly recommend it.
0307730697|5.0|Someone chose it for our bookclub, and I am glad they did. Great story of our Navy Seals and Redemption!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I enjoyed the book version of the popular movie, however, I felt that the book was a less realistic portrayal of a person with bipolar disorder than the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|No words to describe. Loved it<br />From beginning to end it was a page turner. Reading the next book now.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Transport yourself to a world of sweet familiar melodies and solitary sounds.  Andrea has exceeded my expectations. His clear melodic voice doesn't disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a fun game that promotes care and responobilte.  it is woo awesome and it was solo cool. I love it.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|I personally haven't used it as much since I bought it, but my kids have no complaints. I love the Kinect, but it is somewhat picky and hard to work with.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I do not recall why I took up this novel, but I am glad I did.  It is plausible, with a fast-moving plot laying out a slow-moving conspiracy.  Congratulations, Mr. Grisham.<br /><br />I had given up on John Grisham when he wrote a novel about a fictitious Washington fixer eating his way across Italy.  It was pathetic.  In the end it was obvious that the novel provided an excuse for a tax-deductible (research, you know), gastronomic tour of Italy.
