B000UX6THK|1.0|Ordered this boxset and by the time I got through the series I realized that the last disc was missing. Very Dissatisfied.
B0034G4OUY|4.0|Plot: The plot begins pretty straight forward: \\"The Rock\\" (or whatever his real name is) gets out of jail. Without even being out a full day he kills the first guy. We later learn that he's on a revenge streak going after the people that killed his brother and almost fatally wounded him. We also get to see the stories of a hired gun hunting him and a cop (Billy Bob Thornton) chasing him.....     PQ: This presentation comes extremely close to the intended goal. It isn't overly sharp and contains a fair bit of grain but it actually comes very, very close to the theatrical presentation. Colors and fleshtones are accurate. Luckily no DNR or Edge Enhancement was used to make the Picture \\"better\\"..as the rest of this presentation, the picture quality was a welcome surprise     SQ: We are provided with a DTS HD Master 5.1 Soundtrack by Sony here and it's pretty awesome. Dialogue is always kicking. You constantly have ambient noise in the back. The subwoofer is called to action when needed. There are some nice Sound Pans too in this one. For this kinda movie a pretty good soundtrack.     Summary: Considering that I watched this movie with almost no expectiations whatsoever I was pretty blown away by this one. The story was deeper and contained more character development than the last 10 action films I saw. All the actors were on the top of their game. Even those that had very small parts. (Like Tom Berenger)... This movie is really so much more than a stupid revenge killer movie. The quality of the BD Presentation is above average. The only thing is that there were no extra features whatsoever. Even though I usually don't even mention extra features.. With that good a movie I actually wanted to watch those and was disappointed when there were none. But that's pretty much the only bad thing that can be said about this movie. Do I recommend it? Hell yeah!!!!
034552554X|5.0|I have read many good books this year and had my top ten short list ready.  Then, I picked up \\"The Language of Flowers\\" by debut novelist Vanessa Diffenbaugh.  BAM! I could not stop reading this book.  It's not a gooey love story with Victorian flora in an epistolary form.<br /><br />It is an action-packed, heart-breaking journey with an 18 year-old, recently emancipated foster child. She has a wall around her heart, \\"like a nut.\\" She fears intimate relationships, for all her life these have meant only moving on, moving away, and giving up those she cherished.<br /><br />She is homeless. She is jobless. But she has been taught the language of flowers by one of her caretakers, Elizabeth. How Victoria takes her love of flowers and her connection with growing things to make her life something new is the journey of this book. She has help along the way from people at the flower market, Renata and her family, Grant, a young man who also questions his past.<br /><br />Like moss, which thrives with no roots, Victoria finds that she can start anew in a different direction for her life than she would ever have predicted.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh sets the story in San Francisco and the agricultural country to the north of the city. The cityscape and vineyards provide contrasting pieces of Annie's life experiences.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book.  It takes the readers to new places and teaches them new things, things probably not considered before. To me, that makes for a top-notch reading experience. More, more, more please from Vanessa Diffenbaugh.
0670022411|4.0|There's just something about witches and vampires that intrigues me. So when I read that \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" was for adults - I couldn't resist. The two main characters are Diana, a scholarly witch who refuses to use her power, which is considerable as she is descended from a powerful family of witches and Matthew, a 1500 year old vampire who studies science and is sophisticated, refined and very worldly. On one level this is a forbidden love story, which is always tantalizing. In this scenario, however the stakes are ratcheted up because the consequences for disobeying are severe and permanent. The book really is much more than this however; in fact, it's quite complex and layered. Aside from the witches and vampires, the book overflows with science, mythology, history, and marvelous descriptions and historical details of the Bodleian Library, Oxford and Matthew's castle in France. The author's imagination of what witches and vampires look and act like is superb, you feel as if they could be your neighbor or co-worker. She also gives us a fascinating look at the habits of vampires; how they feed and interact with their own and outsiders. Although I found Matthews protectiveness towards Diana frustrating at times, the main problem I had with this book is the pacing. The plot moved very slowly at times with nothing happening but descriptions and dialog and the ending left many unresolved issues; perhaps because this is the first book in a trilogy. In summary this is a captivating tale for those who like the paranormal world and perhaps a nice introduction to the mystical for those who have never tried this genre. At 579 pages, it a long book, but I was still sad to see it end. I look forward to the second book in the trilogy
B003LFLPGY|5.0|The Doctor is called by an old friend named Dr. River Song from a season 4. She is a mysterious older woman that is from the Doctor's future. She calls him to fight an old enemy, the Weeping Angels. The Doctor has fought with them before in season 3. The Weeping Angels are these creatures who want power and control. They are very deadly but they have only one weakness-they cannot be seen by anyone. If anyone sees them, they will turn themselves into statues of \\"weeping angels.\\"     Dr. Song crashes a huge spaceship on a mysterious planet. The spaceship contains one Weeping Angel and it crashes on a huge mausoleum about a size of a tall building. The Doctor, Amy, Dr. Song, and a handful of soldiers priets goes inside the mausoleum to reach the ship and try to destroy that one Weeping Angel. What they found instead is an army of Weeping Angels. This is part one of a two part episode.    Out of all the episodes I watched so far in season 5, I like this one the best. Alex Kingston who plays Dr. River Song is a good actor, she keeps her character very mysterious so I am constanlty wanting to know more about her. I love how the camera and editing was used to portray the Weeping Angels, most of this episode was kept dark and it really made the mausoleum and Angels scary. Matt Smith's performance as the Doctor was light and funny. When there was a very scary moment in the show, Matt would do something to cut the edge out of it. Karen Gillan's performance as Amy Pond is good. Gillan's performance being scared by the Weeping Angel really scared me too because a Weeping Angel was jumping out of a TV screen and Amy can't get out of the room.
1439102724|4.0|What I really like about Jodi Picoult, is that she takes controversial tough topics, gives both side a fair shack, stirs up the emotions and stimulates thought. In her latest installment, she tackles the rights of gay parents and embryos, both timely emotionally charged issues. In a sensitive manner she questions the impact of same sex unions on the children born or adopted into these families and asks if society as a whole can accept rather than fear these \\"non-traditional\\" families. Picoult also does a great job of portraying the emotional and physical toll of couples with infertility issues. Again, she presents a balanced perspective not giving weight to either the female or male heartache of going through this procedure. In short, another book full of hot controversial topics, yes a bit formulaic and predictable but very much worth reading just the same. Recommend to those who like a good story or books that make you think. A must read for Jodi's fans.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|The DVD cover and opening scenes give an opening impression of formula \\"abused girl is sent into isolation and seeks revenge\\" storyline but much to my surprise it was a quite creative, layered morality message plot with fantasy dream states and an again surprising ending. Kudos to the graphics department for, although not unique, excellent CGI renderings. Also, to the music director for a selective and not overbearing range of appropriate music to support the story.     The only serious negative is that the martial arts movements were weak minimal/standard wire fare and for some reason lots of landings into a crouch stance that looks impressive but means little.     Definitely a \\"watch again\\" to pick up the nuances missed on first viewing.
0811875040|4.0|ADDENDUM (October 2011): Revised edition with corrections has been printed and is now available.  ADDENDUM: This book has been found to have several errors in printing, mostly with the \\"weights\\" of the ingredients, though the \\"volumes\\" have all been correct.  There are 2 other errors that were legitimate concerns regarding ingredient name and amount. My unprofessional review was based solely on the \\"volumes\\" therefore I experienced no problems. That being said, supposedly there is talk of a second printing but nothing concrete. Therefore, while I truly enjoy this beautiful and delicious book, you might want to wait for a possible second printing (as the publishers should do) or you can go to the publishers website for a correction sheet.  What a simply charming book from an equally charming baker! Even before you open these delicious pages, you have the sense that you are about to enjoy something very special and very different; you won't be disappointed!  Amy Ray is the chef/owner of Miette (bakery) located in San Francisco, which she officially opened in 2003. Technically, she had started her baking business under the \\"only pastel pink\\" tent of a local farmers market in 2001. Her love of things French, as well as the thought and style that represents the delicacy of the French charm, Miette is the culmination and visual expectation of those graces.  Her shoppe, her book, her style, her vision can all be seen in the glance of an eye as pastel pinks and greens and other shabby-chic hues have formed the Miette look. I am definitely enchanted with this book and offer no apologies.  The book itself is just exquisite with beautifully scalloped pages; what a fabulous idea! It makes this more than just a baking book but rather something artful.  The various pages that have splashes of pastel colors present the contents of Meg's hard work and dedication to her craft.  I enjoyed reading her \\"Introduction\\" and the opening of her \\"Cakes\\" chapter. She has an interesting approach in her attitude on baking that is different than the American way of baking. I think she feels that a person does not need to eat a big slice of cake, or a large pastry, or oversized cookie just to appreciate its flavor. Her cakes are, for the most part, limited to the 6\\" size, which if made well, is all that one really needs to satisfy.  She also discusses the fact that for some of the cake recipes, \\"while they look simple, they are very hard to master, as they require expert skill in a few basic techniques\\" therefore the reader is somewhat given pause to realize that you will need some solid baking skills and techniques.  Other baking mini-education is given throughout the book, inparticular the sidebars with each recipe. Little tidbits of info on perhaps the history or background of the baked good or perhaps a little science know-how to help you along. Many of the recipes will be based upon the basic ingredients of a standard formula on which the baked good is built therefore as with the Lemon Debutante Cake, it uses the \\"Hot Milk Cake\\" batter as its foundation.  The recipes are clear and sharp as is the photography. Not all recipes have accompanying photos but what photography is present gives you the end you yearn for in your efforts. Occasionally you will be given \\"step-by-step\\" photography, but only for those actions which might need slight clarification. The finishing touches on any of the creations will always be simple yet elegant so artistic skills or cake decorating skills are minimal.  A sampling of the CONTENTS:  Introduction  Cakes:  Hot Milk Cake (traditional white cake batter)  Coconut Mousse Cake (yellow cake w/ layers of coconut mousse, fluffy icing, & coconut flakes)  Strawberry Charlotte (white cake, ladyfinger band w/fresh strawberries, all tied w/ a ribbon)  Afternoon Cakes:  Carrot Cake (this is filled w/ currants, though I used plump raisins, coconut, and walnuts)  Banana Bread w/ Nutty Streusel (a perfectly aromatic breakfast bread; they'll wake up the house)  Tarts:  Pate Sucree Tart Shell (I just LOVE this recipe; just crumbly enough but holds well)  Lime Meringue Tart (lemon's oft-forgotten cousin)  Fresh Fruit Tart (the dessert hit of the summer harvest of berries!)  Cookies, Bars, and Pastries:  Chocolate Chip Cookies (these are a bit crispier than most but still good with a cold glass of milk)  Brownies (I double the nuts and bake them in a large pan; Miette brownies are individually baked)  Eclairs (outstanding; don't use anything but custard to fill these delicacies)  Candies and Creams:  English Toffee (my weakness; make the American version with lots of nuts)  Meringues and Marshmallows  Caramel Corn (once again, hail to the peanuts that you have to load in this!)  Miette Essentails:  These are the fillings and frostings that are used to make these works of delicate art such as Vanilla Buttercream, French Buttercream, Cream Cheese Frosting, Ganache, Lemon Curd, Syrups,etc.  Essential Ingredients and Essentail Tools:  Foods as well as the tools needed to help you become proficient in Miette baked gems.  Sources:  All the spots and places and sources to find whatever you need to bake.  Index  Should you be blessed enough to be in San Franciso, make a trip to Miette, then please tell the rest of us all about it. In the meantime, I have to go purchase another book because the one I have now is getting a bit used; happy sigh! Peace!  POSTSCRIPTS:  1) If you go to the website \\"Bakerella\\", on her Sunday, July 10, 20011 posting, she has her column all about Miette Bakery.  2) Regarding printing errors, if you Google, \\"Chronicle Books Miette\\" you will be brought to the publishers website with a corrected list of misprints to use against the book. But I must say that I am a bit taken back with the strong critiques of the book. Yes, there are 18 incidences of errors BUT for those who are advanced bakers, I am questioning the essence of the comments. They could have been written with much kinder words. Errors/incidences are:  Of the 18 incidences, 13 are speaking to the \\"WEIGHT\\" of the ingredient; the \\"VOLUMES\\" were ALL correct. Most home bakers use volume (measuring cups) so they would have had no problem with the recipes. Those bakers who are more advanced and technical, might use a scale (which I use at times). So instead of the ingredient reading as \\"1 cup/7-1/2 ounces\\", it should have been \\"1 cup/7 ounces\\". The \\"volume\\" amount recipe was correct for standard bakers so jumping all over the recipe just because the \\"weight\\" said half an ounce more, really destroyed the recipe? I mean, really? C'mon.  Of the remaining 5 \\"errors\\", 2 were the \\"YIELD\\". On one recipe, it said a yield of \\"42 cookies\\" and so you got \\"48 cookies\\"; the reviewer is upset about THAT? Was it worthy of an attack? And the other \\"YIELD\\" printing error was legitimate but certainly not fatal in that it said, \\"24 cookies\\" rather than \\"48 cookies\\". But if you're an advanced baker, wouldn't you have just adjusted your sizes before you baked them? A printing error, yes, but not worthy of such comments.  The remaining situations had 2 legitimate printing errors in type of sugar used and amount of salt; yes, these would definitely change the taste; agreed. But the last set of printing errors were in a \\"STEP\\" and that was questionable one in that some bakers would omit it anyways, as would I, so it's a mute point.  I am quite sure that Ms. Ray was most upset with this, being her freshman attempt into the cookbook world; I am also sure this was not her intention. But let's understand that this is a book, not a life-threatening emergency. The errors that some felt were important, have been noted, and that in the second printing, they will be corrected. Aim your arrows at the proofreader, not the author. Peace.
0345522478|5.0|Great new author. This book is modern fantasy, the main character one of the few male leads I've liked in a long time. He's a druid, the only one left, whose lived about two thousand years. Other characters include mythic gods (i.e., very powerful but not any wiser than the rest of us). The book is internally consistent, wraps up in one book, and seldom insulting to other belief systems. Unlike most such powerful mages in other books, this man has frienships with ordinary people.  I liked that a lot.
0802473156|5.0|I really truly believe that this book could prevent divorces. The concept of love languages is one of those light bulb concepts- once you get it, your whole view of love and relationships is illuminated.<br /><br />I first read this book as a teenager, and it was instrumental in 'detoxifying' my decade long relationship with my best friend. Once I started applying the concepts of speaking his language, our friendship grew closer and stronger- and that relationship has continued over the years, we're almost into our thirties!<br /><br />For my marriage, this book has been a key component in maximizing our marriage efforts- a turbo boost if you will, as the things we do carry exponentially more meaning when they are given in a language that is understood.<br /><br />This is a must-have for anyone in any kind of a relationship, not just a marriage. Its a book that I often give as a wedding present, and I've lent out my own copy so many times I finally just bought 3 more! Its a small book and a quick read, but the information you take away is monumental.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Such a cute way to present a pretty simple concept. Game play is easy but not tiresome. Definitely worth the 99&cent;.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the graphics, the levels get harder but still lots of fun would buy the next when it comes out! Samsung Vibrant.
B003UYUP6M|2.0|Does anyone think it is strange that the electronic version of a book about Google cost more than the hard cover version.
B002SJIO54|3.0|The 2 disc edition this great movie deserves. The only problem is that it lacks of spanish subtitles. For me is not a problem, but it is for my girlfriends and some of my friends.
6302914191|2.0|This is a review for the VHS tape, which I'm adding for the VHS listing.  Amazon, in their infinite wisdom (I know, they have a gazillion listings to do....) chose an article about the DVD in the blurb about the TAPE.  And many of the reviews here are for the DVD.  Why not include a review of Agent Cooper's BVD's?    Normally, I wouldn't care as much, but the Worldvision TAPE is horrible, muddier than the Mississippi.  I loved the show, gave it a 9.8 (the ending was an anticlimax, could have been better altho it was all pretty muddled by then)  Nowhere does it give the tape speed (good clue to bad news) but its SLP, with ALL the worst flaws.  Colors, especially the yellows of the Lodge are bleeding all over, worse than Leo's shirt.  This you might expect from a cheapo no name version  of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", but this is a major release by Aaron Spelling's company.    And, of curse, they don't include the pilot.  And how can you follow a course without a pilot.    Sadly, I bought this at a church sale for $1.50 for the SET.  I grossly overpaid.  \\"It's a must to avoid, a complete impossibility....\\"
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|The best version from this famous history!!!!!!  Jim carry one author wich I mever liked for his boring and \\"forced to be funny\\" papers, surprised myself with his interpretation, and I am obligate to say that he was more than perfect to represents the old Scrooge!!!!!!  For who loves this kind of history worth to get it to watch and watch again!!!!!
B0039PPW60|4.0|I got one of these mixers to bring on cruise with me (US Navy USS Enterprise) so i didn't have have to bring my big board with me. i have used this board at least twice a week now since i got it. both for recording and live shows. for recording i am using it with Adobe Sound Booth CS5 and for shows i am using Virtual DJ 7 Pro and Mixmister. I have also used it with VLC and a projector to play movies. I have a Toshiba laptop running Windows XP Pro with 6gb of ram and a 2GH Pros. It has stood up to the pounding i have put it through here on the ship. it has been dropped twice from about 5 feet onto the flight deck witch is covered in Nonskid (kind of like sand paper) and still works perfect. the only reason i did not give it 5 stars it the fact that it doesn't have 1/4\\" jacks or a mono out put for the main or an independent volume control for the USB audio. the alt 3&4 is a 1/4\\" out but the fact that the mute button switches between the main and alt 3&4. it is kind of weird to have audio going out with the must light on. but all and all i have enjoyed using it and i will buy other Behringer products. and amazon even got it here fast also. Took less than 2 weeks to ship it to an FPO. It showed up while we were in port in Bahrain. i have the X2442USB also.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|Love, love, love this movie. Sure, I already had a long-standing crush on Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader (Lord, so much), as well as an interest in BDSM, but the movie was about so much more.  I loved the details: the office decorated in a way that made you think of a forest, where she felt safe; the medical-like implements he used to care for his rare-and-delicate orchids; her childish way of dressing which then gives way to confident adult clothing.  She learns to trust, to release her emotions, to communicate.  Seeing the transformation from where she starts off is amazing.  It's a sexy love story about exploring and accepting who you are (particularly Spader's character).

B00005JLKB|5.0|OK, maybe my wife and I are late bloomers when it comes to watching cable series.  We recently stumbled onto Smallville and we are are now hooked on this series.  My 80+ year old father-in-law is watching it with us and he enjoys it as well.  It is fast-paced, well-written, well-acted and keeps our full attention during each episode.  We're halfway through the 1st season and have already purchased Season 2.  We love action and sci-fi movies and this fits right in with our viewing needs.  Having commercial free viewing is great via this DVD series.  We highly recommend Smallville....which has become a BIG DEAL at our house.
0399250573|4.0|The final book for the Alex Rider series is divided into two parts. The first part comes from the perspective of Scorpia - an terrorist organization twice defeated by Alex Rider. They are devising a plan to bring Alex Rider's involvement in MI6 to the attention of the world thus bringing down two enemies with one strike. They need to get Alex Rider back into the field and they have developed an idea to lead him just where they want him.<br /><br />Alex Rider's life has gone back to normal. He's happy just hanging out with his friends, doing school work, and rehearsing for the school play. Unfortunately, his normal life ends when a sniper appears on the roof across the street from his school, sending a bullet through the window into Alex's classroom.<br /><br />Jack - his guardian is determined that Alex won't be caught up in MI6 again. However, even she can not stop him from agreeing to protect his friends at school from further harm. Jack insists on accompanying him to Egypt where they will keep an eye on a school for anything out of the ordinary. Someone might be targeting the students of wealthy families from around the globe.<br /><br />Alex realizes the school isn't under threat. He knows something's not right, but he's unable to put his finger on anything specific. Instead he and Jack make plans to head to America. That's when things start going wrong - deadly wrong.<br /><br />My Thoughts: I'm sad to see the last of Alex Rider. I LOVED this series for the: action, danger, adrenaline scenes, the crazy double crossings, the spy gadgets, and the determination of one teenage boy. I think the series ended the only way it could, but I don't love the ending.<br /><br />As for the book: It took me a bit to get used to the two difference segments of the book. However, I liked learning more about Scorpia. I loved how they dropped certain clues to make their plan come together. After reading their section, I found myself annoyed at MI6. MI6 seemed naive, very naive. They also seemed horrific at research. I've always loved Mr. Smithers and was pleased he had a bigger role in the final book. I loved reading about his gadgets and tricks, especially his last trick. I loved the deviousness of the Scorpia group ad trying to uncover their plot from Alex's perspective.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|My wife and I just finished watching Season 1 and we both really enjoyed the premise of the show, the characters, and the acting.  We both enjoy sci-fi and horror movies and this series fits right in with the kind of entertainment we enjoy.  Each episode is interesting and well written.  We have yet to be bored at all.  We just purchased the next four seasons and plan to dive right into Season 2.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Real page turner. . .loved it so much I finished the Trilogy in three days.  As I went to bed each night, I would think about what was to come.  Can't wait for the movie. . though I have a feeling it may disappoint as most movies do.  Our imagination is always so much better!
0312600844|4.0|Perhaps this doesn't have the scope, humor, and delightful chaos of the Corrections - which I believe disappointed many people - but I find that the characters are as deep and full as that novel, that they evolve and reveal different aspects of their nature throughout the book.  Indeed, I also find that the characters are very different, which shows that Franzen has a great range of empathy and insight.  Current political affairs also form an integral part of the plot, liberal notions that are expressed from the characters' point of view.  I have my own interpretation of the characters, but believe the novel is so rich that many interpretations are possible.<br /><br />In many ways, the deepest character in the book is the wife, Patty.  She is a wounded person with terrible flaws, the black sheep jock of a competitive family of super achievers with the highest expectations for themselves and the world; born with a notion of wealth and privilege, they are bound for profound disappointment.  Not a single one of them finds a sustainable work identity, except perhaps late in life.  Patty wants to make up for all the hurts by creating the perfect family, to give her children what she felt she lacked:  perfect, intimate love and support.  The man she chooses is Walter, a young man of extraordinary energy and seemingly limitless good will, but their physical chemistry somehow isn't right; Patty is also in love with his best friend, a talented, charismatic musician who is a disaster as a human being.  This triangle will last, with great consequence, for the rest of their lives.  For a time, their children flourish with them, in the early years of optimism and delight in building.  Of course, things start to go wrong when the children cannot heal the terrible wounds inside their parents, who put great demands on them while giving.<br /><br />I don't want to say more on the plot as it might spoil the reading experience.  My perception of the characters varied greatly throughout the book.  At one point, I disliked all of them, thinking them bizarre and neurotic, if not worse.  Patty's depression and rage are off-putting; the relationship that the son strikes up with a neighbor girl is frighteningly symbiotic, obliterating them as individuals; the father is rigid and self-righteous, a born crank.  The family becomes an absolute, dysfunctional mess, a catastrophe, as the children go their own ways.  Then later, after many mistakes and some difficult wisdom gained, I completely believed in the more mature characters that emerged, in what can only be called a realistically tragic yet hopeful ending.  It is all about the complexity of love between husband and wife, which arises in just about all marriages that last for decades.  Patty also confronted her own demons and reconciled with her parents before her father's death.  This evolution is moving and fascinating.<br /><br />Though the book got off to a slow start for me - it is written in a less elegant style than the Corrections and it is uneven, with two long autobiographical sections that I did not feel quite worked -  I became completely engrossed and hungry to learn what the characters would do and become.  It is a long time since I got so involved with a novel, which is a gift for introspection and learning.  There are many less central characters who are very interesting, such as the musician, whose professional world and inner life come alive on the page.  There is such great subtlety in these characters as layers peel off of them, often revealed in a moment's reflection, a quote, and even a gesture.  But the book requires a slow and very careful reading, in my opinion.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  Don't get this if you want a repeat of The Corrections.  It is a different animal entirely.t one point, I disliked all of them, thinking them bizarre and neurotic, if not worse.

I could listen to this album on repeat all day!!
B004NCLKJG|3.0|This issue, like all the others in the recent set of official Sony Classical remasterings of old Metropolitan Opera radio broadcast archive performances, is more for aficionados than beginners, as witness the lack of libretti and only a cursory summary.  The presumption is that the intended audience will already have other, more polished recordings which contain full libretti and notes, so that these archived versions are something of a pendant to the more polished studio recordings, or even more modern live renditions (e.g. Bohm's 1960's cycle or the Boulez set from the late 1970's, both on the sadly lamented Philips label).    The main attraction is obviously the terrific and vintage powerhouse cast from that late 1960's generation of Wagner singers, including the patented Leonie Rysanek screams as Sieglinde, first for joy in Act I, then fear in Act II.  Where things fall mainly is with the recording quality.  I'll confess that I'm not familiar with the conductor, Klobucar.  He does an OK job, if far from spectacular, certainly without the experience that conductors like then-contemporaries Karajan, Solti, or Bohm had.  However, there's something of a backhanded virtue there, in that Klobucar doesn't get in the way of the singers.    What does get in the way is the variable recording quality, perhaps inevitable in a live broadcast, but to mention the most egregious situation, during the \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\", the voices get almost totally lost at more than one point, thus losing the \\"girl power\\" feel that this scene, of all, should have.  We're perhaps spoiled by expectations of, if not Culshaw-like spectacle, at least clarity in hearing the voices, even if they're set up to sound as though coming from a distance.  But at least with Culshaw in the studio, you could catch every word.  Not quite so here.    So definitely a curio for Ring-heads and Wagner initiates, mainly.
B0055FR5PS|1.0|If you have been in the military or love the military then I believe this movie will be up your alley. The lingo, camaraderie a la armed forces is believable.<br /><br />If you loved District 9 for it's sci-fi action and it's portrayal of the complex nuances of human nature, you will likely find this okay to deplorable. I personally found it's dialogue tedious and the trite cliched characters unlikeable. I laughed at some of the one-liners that weren't meant to be funny and found the action sequences interchangeable and honestly they dragged on and on. The special effects weren't bad, I liked the alien  mechanizations of war. The main focus of this flikk is the troupe and it's brotherhood. I just didn't care about any of them. The writers may have been ham sandwiches.

B0044XV3R8|1.0|This is not a review of the movie nor should it be.<br /><br />This is a review of this 3 disk collector's edition set.<br /><br />Yes, the extra scenes are cool.  But the fact remains that they tell you on the outside packaging, \\"3 disks and 3 versions of the film!\\"  HA!<br /><br />Funny how they FAIL to mention that all 3 versions of the film are split up between the first 2 disks.<br /><br />In other words, at the half way mark (for each of their \\"3 versions\\") you're left with a screen telling you to insert the 2nd disk.  WTF?!  I guess I just assumed that each disk would hold 1 \\"version\\" of the film.<br /><br />BF and I LOVE this movie.  Have seen it countless times on HBO and renting on dvd.  We suck and therefore didn't get to see it in theatres (please release it in theaters AGAIN!!!), but have so much love for the film anyway.<br /><br />We are appalled at the fact that there is no mention of the fact that your beloved movie is interrupted.<br /><br />BF and I tend to leave the movies we love in our dvd player and just let them run while we do other stuff around the house (cleaning mostly).  Anyway, it's fun to hear it while you work and to come over and watch certain scenes, etc.<br /><br />We simply cannot enjoy the movie this way with this \\"collector's edition\\" set.  You'd think they would realize that collectors want to view their film uninterrupted.  Fools!<br /><br />bottom line, if I don't get a refund (even tho it's opened) I'm going to be SO FREAKING pi$$ed!<br /><br />Please don't buy this.  Just get the original.  The extra opening is depressing anyway. And I'm sure the other deleted scenes are online.  or if you must maybe you can borrow from a friend or rent this version.  Just.  so.  disappointed.
B002CNTWG6|4.0|Am I the only one who even noticed when this album first came out that the chorus of \\"When It's Love\\" is a fairly straight rip-off of the chord progression and to a lesser degree the tune to which Beethoven set Schiller's poem \\"Ode to Joy\\" in the finale of his 9th Symphony? Don't believe me? Hum the well known \\"Ode to Joy\\" tune during the chorus of \\"When It's Love\\" and hold the last three notes of the melody twice as long as Beethoven gave them. See what I mean? As Willie Nelson once told Johnny Cash, \\"Good songwriters borrow, great songwriters steal.\\" Overall this was probably Van Halen's best post-DLR album.
B004H83IG4|5.0|I was first introduced to the Robert Durst mystery on an episode of TV's AMERICAN JUSTICE and was both fascinated and disgusted with this miscarriage of justice.  But power, politics and money can certainly overcome the truth.<br />ALL GOOD THINGS changes the names but retains the bizarre facts or probabilities of this still unsolved mystery.  What happened to David Marks (Durst's) lovely young bride?  Who killed his longtime author friend?  Was the death of his new buddy really in self defense?  After new evidence surfaced in the late 2000's, the writers of ALL GOOD THINGS offers some truly evocative--and credible--solutions.<br />I was truly impressed with this movie.  Its use of voice-over narrative is tastefully used and moves the plot along.  While the main thrust of the film focuses on David and Kathy's stormy marriage, the script accommodates the related crimes quite efficiently.<br />And what a cast!  Ryan Gosling is marvelous as the multi-layered David--charming, volatile, manipulative, haunted and ultimately dangerous.  Kirsten Dunst's Oscar-worthy performance as Kathy is devastating.  In her best performance to date, she inhabits the role with overwhelming depth.  Her tragic descent is captured in every facial expression and her desperate pleadings.  She's every bit as good as Rachel Portman's award-winning BLACK SWAN.<br />Add Frank Langella's self-serving father, Lily Rabe's authot and Philip Baker Hall as Marks' doomed roomie and you have a brilliant cast.<br />Roger Ebert called ALL GOOD THINGS one of 2010's best films and I concur.
0439023521|5.0|Let's just start by saying that I don't normally go for \\"Young Adult\\" books.  But after hearing a lot of people talk about this book, I had to check it out.  The story is at once engaging and terrifying.  Teenagers are forced to participate in a to-the-death game.  It's a story of courage, suspense, honor, and romance.      The story is pretty violent.  After all, the plot involves teenagers trying to kill one another.  I'd probably steer younger kids away from reading this one.     I enjoyed the romance in the book.  It was sweet, and not overdone.    All in all, this book is excellent for teens and adults.  I'm looking forward to reading the 2nd book!
B004EPYZU8|2.0|I have not seen such an incoherent pile of dog puddle in years.  As near as I could tell the only thing that holds this movie together is the laws of physics that makes it possible to create the DVD disc.  Somewhere Roger Corman must be laughing his head off. Not only did the makers off this movie produce a razor thin plotline of a movie, but they bilked the financiers and the public while doing it on a grander scale than Corman ever dreamed. Cheap plot held together with a few decent action scenes, but the only worthwhile stuff are those action scenes.  You could fast forward through the rest of the movie and come away with as much enlightenment of what the movie was about as I did watching the whole damn thing.  Those action scenes are the only thing that saves this movie from the 1 star rating.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|The first Diary of a Wimpy Kid was alright but the second one is awesome. I don't know if its because of the more Rodrick or...ah who am I kidding?! Of course its because of the more Rodrick. The movie was hilarious and the writing was really well written. This movie is for kids and adults and for the in between. I'm almost sixteen and it makes me feel like a kid again! All the actors in this movie from Zachary to Devon to even Steve Zahn are PERFECT for the roles of the DOAWK characters. I can't wait for a third one ( I really hope there is a third one) and also: EVERY ONE BUY THIS MOVIE NOW. LIKE. RIGHT. NOW!

B004K4AVAG|2.0|While liking Fame...and Fame Monster, I didn't really like Born This Way. In a way it is kind of like a movie, one of those movies where the best parts are shown on the commercial and after you see it you really don't actually like it. Well that is kinda what Born This Way is like...all of the good songs(Judas, Born This Way, Edge of Glory) are played on the radio..and the bad songs are left on the album. But...it was only 99 cents. Anyway, I say meh.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I expected a blend of talent with similiar sound.  A merger of their individual albums.  But what you get is unbelievably better.  This is solid songwriting with musicians capable in delivering the musical notes.  My personal favorites are:  Don't Let It Slide, Midnight In Harlem, Learn How To Love, Love Has Something To Say and most fave \\"Until You Remember\\".  Wow!    For me, I want a tight rhythm section in the music I listen to and \\"tight\\" is definitely defined here.  Oteil's bass working against the (2) drum kits of J.J. and Tyler sets a solid foundation.  A little surprising is Derek does not dominate with his slide work instead allowing a stellar cast to shine at critical points of each song.  Kofi's piano work on my most fave \\"Until You Remember\\" for example is perfectly set as a backdrop to Susan's vocals.  But don't worry Derek get to stretch his strings always at the appropriate time.    A lot of love radiates thoroughout this album between Susan and Derek and their bands.  Each song is treated with respect and as such there are no fillers or throwaways.  My only regret is a wish that Mike Matteson could have played a larger role on a song or two.  However, there is always the next album.    I have tickets to see Tedeschi Trucks on tour in Spartanburg on July 28th.  I relish the opportunity.  Go buy this album for 10 bucks it is a best buy and one which will rarely leave your play list.  Trust me.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What else can I say?<br /><br />I only started reading this book because I wanted to be familiar with the characters before I started watching the TV show.<br /><br />Well. My only experience with epic fantasy is with Tolkien and Jordan. I was a little hesitant to step into GoT because WoT became too ponderous to wade through by the sixth or seventh book. It took only a few chapters reading ASOFAI to where I would hold my breath at the end of a chapter before I pushed the Next Page button to see who the next chapter would be about. Some chapters I had to hold my hand over the page so I wouldn't read the bottom before the top!<br /><br />As I stated various places before, GoT is like WoT but with a fourth of the words, four times the action, and a fifth less magic.<br /><br />In other words, once I got past the introduction of the main players and who was married to whom, keeping track of who was doing what where and for or to whom, was not hard.<br /><br />Martin's fantasy world seems like a very real place in many ways. As usual thousands of years ago people came over on ships and conquered, then intermarried. The laws of physics and medicine are the same.<br /><br />Soon I was reading the book just to find out what was going to happen regardless of what the tv show was doing. There is a lot of violence and sex in this book, but I never felt it that was gratuitous.<br /><br />Yes bad things happen to good people in Westeros. Knowing that no character is safe ups the ante.<br /><br />Reading on the Kindle helps when I want to look up a character and see when we first met him or her, learn the meaning of an archaic word.<br /><br />From the first four episodes of the TV show, I can see that the script came right of the book. The TV show is great - the very first scene of men riding forth from the Wall, told me they \\"got it\\" when they made this TV series. People will be drawn in the visuals - of towers, cities, massed armies. And of course, all the gratuitous sex.<br /><br />The TV show will bring lots of new readers to these books. As great as the TV show is, the book is just so much better. If the show gets people to actually read these books, they will be pleasantly surprised.the TV show is, the book is just so much better.

B0056UHSYK|5.0|After his first album, I didn't believe David Cook could make a better album. The first album was fantastic. His sophomore album is even better. David Cook proves once again that he can sing, and the wait was well worth it.<br /><br />Every song in this album is different but great.<br /><br />Here's a breakdown:<br />1. Circadian 9.5/10-  David does it again. This song is great. It opens up the album, and establishes what the album will be about.<br />2. Right Here, With You 9/10- Even with this upbeat song, David Cook keeps the album going with a lot of emotion.<br />3. We Believe 9.5/10- Beautiful song. David Cook shows his softer side in the beginning, and delivers another emotional, beautiful song.<br />4. Fade into Me-8.5/10 - This is a slower song, but is beautiful. It's moving, and Cook shows his softer side once again.<br />5. Hard to Believe 9/10- Another good song. Not much to say about it, except that it was great.<br />6. Take me as I am 9/10- Beautiful song, very moving. Cook showcases his voice once again.<br />7.Time Marches On 9.5/10- Cook has an edgy tone in the song. It's beautiful once again.<br />8. The Last Goodbye 10/10- This song reminds me of his songs in his debut album, but to another level. Cook showcases his storytelling abilities, and his voice together. Great, beautiful, song.<br />9. Paper Heart 8.7/10- Great song. It tells a story, and Cook shows a softer side once again.<br />10. Four Letter Word 8.5/10- An edgy song, but great.<br />11. Goodbye to the Girl 9/10- Great song. Not much more to say.<br />12. Rapid Eye Movement 8.2/10- Good song. Even though I gave it a lower rating, it's still great. Cook has a great voice.<br />13.This is not the last TIme 9/10- Great song. very moving.<br />14. Let me Fall For You 9/10- Cook closes the album with this moving song. Once again, like all the songs before it, he showcases his voice.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great album. I'm not disappointed, and I'm already looking forward to his next album.<br /><br />Overall rating of album: 9.7/10

B004LAIU4I|5.0|Like many composers who's compositions  became less overtly melodic and more subtle as as the years went by (I'm thinking of Faure, Scriabin, and to a certain extent, Beethoven in his late chamber works) Paul has gone from writing those familiar soaring melodies to composing either deceivingly simpler tunes or very complicated ones. This trend is also paralleled in his lyric writing, although really, his lyrics were always challenging and advanced.     Paul also has chosen an intimate ensemble sound for this recording giving it a kind of chamber music feel. There is the usual humor, pathos, insights, soul-bearing and sometimes very personal revelations in the lyrics. Nobody else can make me laugh and cry through their songs.    And the guitar playing! Gorgeous, intricate guitar arrangements woven through and around Paul's still unchanged, beautiful voice.     This recording is a gift. The man has nothing to prove -- he's made his money and has accomplished way more artistically that just about everyone. But he still has much to say, and may G-d grant him many, many more years and opportunities to say it.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I had a tough time keeping the cables in order but that is a nice thing to have because it is very long.    The sound quality is clear and crisp for voice recordings.    I would be nice if the mic lets me know when the batteries are running flat.
030726999X|5.0|The third installment in this trilogy is simply put about closure. With Lisbeth Salander recovering from a gunshot wound to the head, an attempted murder by her father, Alexander Zalachenko, she is still at the mercy of powers high up in the Swedish Security Police. Discovering that a secret force within the Security Police has conspired to hide her father, a defected Russian agent, since before Salander's birth, Salander is aware that her life's events (her declaration of incompetence, for example) are all tied to this conspiracy within the highest levels of the Security Police.<br /><br />These agents are not quiet despite the end of the Cold War, as they continue to attempt to protect themselves and Zalachenko from the scandal that would emanate from any of this cover-up being leaked to the press. On the scene comes Mikhael Blomkvist, hero, who saved Salander's life but now must race against time and against the most powerful, secretive institution in Sweden to save Salander from being committed to a mental institution once more on the charges of attempted murder against her father.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Salander's half-brother, the murderous Niedermann, is on the run; he hasn't been seen since Salander's shooting, yet clearly he is bound to be found by someone, somewhere, at some point.<br /><br />Larsson's masterpiece continues. This is a perfect conclusion to this series and a fitting end to his legacy. All of the loose ends in this trilogy are cleared up by the end of the book, and, if anything, this book is worth the read simply for the character development of Salander and the ending.
B004UHF51S|5.0|Well, I couldn't wait and already have it on my i-Pod.  There is no stinker on this album from Michael Franks.  If you like mellow vocal jazz, this is the ticket!  Another great jazz album is Paul Hardcastle's, Hardcastle VI.  Now, where's my suntan lotion?
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This is my first book review. I just felt compelled to share this because if the synopsis had been a little more detailed regarding the second portion of the book, I would have never read it.     *Spoiler alert*    The synopsis on Amazon, I believe, is misleading. While it is true that there are haunting photographs and it is an adventure, it doesn't mention the fact that this story turns into a time travelling, shape shifting and flesh eating monster tale. In the begining of the book Jacob, the narrator, says that what has happened to him can only be described as \\"Before and After.\\" Well I LOVED the before. I was turning pages as quick as lightning to see where the \\"before\\" was taking us. I was thoroughly enjoying the pictures and loved the idea of Riggs finding these photos and piecing together a story. And then, there was the \\"after\\". \\"After\\" is some hocus pocus time loop (which I totally could've gotten into) and the disgusting monsters who attempt to penetrate the loops to eat the children and kidnap their guardian (who, by the way, is a shape shifter). A huge portion of \\"after\\" is fighting off these monsters. The \\"kids\\" (in quotes because even though they look like kids they are in their 70's and 80's in real time) are super heros. Which, I guess they sort of are, since they all have super powers. Does this book sound a little lame yet? \\"Before\\" alludes to monsters and here I was, so hoping that that was a metaphor for Nazis and I was pretty disappointed when the monster was in fact a man eating monster.
B004WJV6OY|2.0|Obviously, the music is great. Eddie is a wonderful singer and has become a very good guitarist in the last twenty years. However, the DVD is painful to watch. Way too many close ups of Eddie's face. This is not 1992 and we are not sixteen year old girls. The editing is rough and thoughtless. He stops to tell a pointless, self indulgent story while tuning a uke, and then goes directly into a song on his Martin acoustic? Amateurish. The songs that play while Eddie sits in his hotel room, brooding and writing? Embarrassing. I recommend looking around for audio recordings of his recent solo tour instead. And go buy Ukelele Songs, it's amazing.
B002ZG976U|5.0|When I began watching this movie I thought to myself this is just a remake of \\"Showgirls\\" but I was so wrong! The story idea is similar but the entire movie from costumes to music to actual acting ability is miles ahead of Showgirls!  Cher is always entertaining whether singing or acting and Christina Aguilera is surprisingly talented in the acting department and should pursue that further (as I'm sure she will) and her voice has never been stronger.  Julianne Hough is gorgeous and multi talented as is Eric Dane!  When I first noticed the bartender Jack I knew I'd seen him somewhere and it was from the O.C. where as Volchok  he was always a detestable (yet entertaining) character. And I've loved Peter Gallagher ever since first seeing him in The Idolmaker back in 1980.   Great casting, OK writing, excellent music, and top quality acting make Burlesque a must see and a must own DVD.
0801896940|2.0|O.k. help me with this.  On p. 28 the author writes (sorry if the math code is hard to read here):  \\"Lemma (Fundamental Lemma of the Calculus of Variations):    If n(t) is not identically zero in \int_a^b A(t) n(t) dt = 0,   where n(a)=n(b)=0, and   if on the closed interval [a,b] both A(t) and n(t) are twice differentiable,   then A(t) = 0 throughout [a,b].\\"  This is obviously not true, as seen in the following counterexample:    Let n(t) = sin( 2 pi (t-a)/(b-a) ), and A(t) = 1.    So, n(t) satisfies the stated constraints, and \int_a^b A(t) n(t) dt = \int_a^b sin( 2 pi (t-a)/(b-a) ) dt = 0, yet A(t)=1 is most certainly not 0.  What in the world?  Consultation of other author's expositions (e.g. Weinstock's [[ASIN:0486630692 Calculus of Variations]] or Gelfand and Fomin's [[ASIN:0486414485 Calculus of Variations]]) reveals that Neuenschwander left out the most crucial phrase in his version of the lemma: \\"If for EVERY choice of the continuously differentiable function n(t) ...\\"   How could he be so sloppy in something as fundamental as the Fundamental Lemma of the Calculus of Variations?  (I am tempted to make a physicist joke here but I won't).    Once one encounters an error this egregious --- and only on p. 28 --- how can one trust that the author is a faithful guide to this new territory?  And now my mind starts to wonder about other things in the book.  I recall the discomfort I felt back on p. 20:  \\"2.2 Formal Definition of a Functional.  Definition:  A functional J is a mapping from a set of functions to the real numbers. ... The mapping is given by J= \int_a^b L(t,x^\mu, x*^\mu) dt .\\"    Here again we find a sloppiness in scope.  He gives a particular example of a functional but calls this the definition of a functional.  Without reading other books, you would not realize that this is Neuenschwander's idiosyncratic usage, and might go away thinking that all functionals have this form.  Now I am going to wonder at every moment if the reason I don't understandsomething is because it is not true.  Am I going to have to check the literature to verify everything he writes?  That is not why I bought this book.  Tell me why I shouldn't send it back. (I did send it back).
0312600844|2.0|To begin with, I listened to the audio version of this book over a period of a month or so while doing my morning routine at the gym.  Does that count as reading?    I don't know if listening to the book at the gym colored my impression of it, but its perhaps fitting that in my mind this story is associated with many tedious hours spent on a treadmill going nowhere.  I admit I have pretty middlebrow tastes in reading; I suspect this book is meant for a more serious reader.  Is it philistine of me to want the author's deep thoughts to be woven into an entertaining story peopled with well-formed and engaging characters?  Many reviews point out that the characters are not likable, which is true.  But I couldn't bring myself to hate any of them either.  I couldn't summon up enough interest to really care one way or another.  A little humor or comic relief might have helped break up the tedium of this ponderous book, but there was very little of that.  Some of the positive reviews promised a big emotional climax at the end, but to me it just seemed to fizzle out.

630469654X|2.0|As medieval fantasy adventure goes, Ladyhawke is passable. The conceit of the lady being a hawk by day and her sweetiepie a wolf by night is clever. And it's decently executed here by director Donner, and stars Broderick, Hauer, Pfeiffer and McKern. But the music score? Who, even in the 80s, thought that something like this was a good idea for a medieval story? This awful score would barely do justice to a Starsky & Hutch or Magnum PI--where it actually might kind of properly belong. My wife and I watched the film recently and were practically rolling on the floor with laughter as this 80s musical kitsch filled our living room coincidentally with scenes from a medieval fantasy. It absolutely ruins the film.
B0034G4P8U|5.0|\\"Transformers: Dark Of The Moon\\" is great! This is how the story goes: When a mysterious event from Earth's past erupts into the present day it threatens to bring a war to Earth so big that the Transformers alone will not be able to save us.    The cast led by Shia LaBeouf (as Sam), Josh Duhamel (as Lennox), John Turturro (as Simmons), Tyrese Gibson (as Epps), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (as Carly), & Patrick Dempsey (as Dylan) is great. The directing by Michael Bay (who also executive produced) is great. The story & screenplay by Ehren Kruger is great.    The music by Steve Jablonsky is great. The cinematography by Amir Mokri is great. The film editing by Roger Barton, William Goldenberg & Joel Negron is great. The casting by Denise Chamian is great. The production design by Nigel Phelps is great. The art direction by Benjamin Edelberg, Kevin Ishioka & Richard L. Johnson is great. The set decoration by Jennifer Williams is great. The costume design by Deborah L. Scott is great. The visual effects by ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) & Digital Domain is excellent.    This is a great sequel that is just as good as its original and a sequel that is better than its recent sequel. This is another hit for Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg. This is one of the best movies of the summer and the best action movies of the year, so far.
B004L03B3S|4.0|I initially had reservations about the \\"half-brothers-in-love\\" aspect of this film. I thought I wouldn't be able to watch them \\"together.\\" But when they finally slept together, I couldn't believe what shocked me the most. It was the fact that it seemed so NATURAL! An evitability. I think that even if Franciso had been sent to live with his father in Argentina (when the boys were young), I think he & Thomas would have ended up as adult lovers anyway. I think the mother knew that too. It was almost like she knew their bond was like some unstoppable force. She KNEW that there was nothing to be done.     DIALOG SPOILER ALERT: When Pedro said: \\"...I love you because for them to understand our love, they'd have to turn the world upside down. I love you because you can have anyone you want. But you chose me...\\" OK, that pretty much did me in.      I'm glad a took a chance and bought this film. Odd, beautiful; unusual, touching.
014241722X|2.0|I was disappointed when I began to read this book. I had somehow missed that this was not the usual adult level Grisham book and wondered why it started so slowly and simplistically. I will pass this on to my 6th grade granddaughter and get her reactions to it.

The only reason people are giving this album high ratings is because it's Beyonce's album. She is highly over rated and i don't think she is all that but she does work hard so I'll give her that. My favorite album by her is still the first one and I don't think any of the other albums are any better.

It is in some ways better, and some way not as good, as the early stuff. I believe some like the \\"simple\\" or \\"raw\\" sound because they can pretend it is closer to them. It is a part of some silly fantasy they have with the art they are experiencing.    Bahhh!    This is pretty good. No it didn't floor me like \\"Skinny Love\\" or \\"Flume\\" did the first time I heard those songs. But how could it? It is from the same person that did \\"Skinny Love\\" and \\"Flume\\". I have heard it before.     And I still like it. That is the important thing.

B004KAB3ZM|5.0|Michael Collins is the veteran of two spaceflights. Gemini 10 and, more famously, as the command module pilot of Apollo 11. In this book he tells, very much in his own words, his experience as an astronaut.<br /><br />We start out with his experience in aviation. Testing experimental aircraft as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base. He eventually gets selected by NASA to be an astronaut, on the second time he submitted an application. He goes through the basic training not only in learning about the intricacies of spaceflight but also learning geology and survival training.<br /><br />He gets his chance for a spaceflight when he is assigned to a back-up crew of an early Gemini flight which put him in rotation for Gemini 10. Gemini 10 turned out to be a cram-packed, but exciting mission, consisting of two rendezvouses, dockings, two EVAs, and numerous experiments. It ended up being a very successful mission.<br /><br />Back on Earth, Collins starts his work on the Apollo program. First helping design and overseeing the work on the spacesuits the astronauts would use on the missions. He is first assigned as a back-up to an early Apollo flight. However, he is taken out of the flight rotation because of he needed to undergo surgery and recovery time. Luckily for him, the surgery did not complicate anything and he was back on full flight-status.<br /><br />He gets assigned to what is scheduled to be the big one: Apollo 11. He is assigned as command module pilot making him the member of the three-man crew not to walk on the Moon. His position is still very important and he takes his training very seriously.<br /><br />The two chapters in the book that cover the flight of Apollo 11 are, in my own opinion, the most exciting of the book. Although Collins says in other parts that he hates being asked what is was like to travel in space and to the Moon, he explains his journey so well in plain-English.<br /><br />He returns home to great fanfare and more humbled by his experience, as many of the astronauts who flew to the Moon are. The book ends around 1974 when it was published.<br /><br />All in all, I found this to be an excellent book. It would certainly be a great read for anyone curious about the experiences of an astronaut, and one that traveled to the Moon and back no less.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I loved this book. I've been searching for some information on marketing ebooks. There's a lot of vague advice out there. John gives you his story and some practical steps to get started. Thanks.
014241543X|5.0|I have to admit that this book has been on my shelf for quite a while but I just haven't gotten around to reading it. I have no clue why now. This novel was so beautifully written that I could not put it down for fear that I would miss something or get out of the zone. The accident changes Mia's life in ways seventeen year olds rarely experience and she is forced with the decision of a lifetime... literally.<br /><br />I couldn't get away from the plot of the novel or the characters. Mia's character was so well written that readers will feel as if she is a real person and a friend you are reading about. Mia introduces us to the other characters in the novel with her flashbacks and allows us to see into her life before the accident. Her parents have to be the most laid back parents ever but we find out why that is... they are a product of the music! I loved them. I could picture her little brother so vividly with his bouncy personality and blond curls. Mia also points out that she is different from them in many ways (from the dark hair to the classical music) but knows that there is a bond between her family that supersedes all of those differences.<br /><br />As a writing teacher I am constantly reading to pull examples to show my students what good writing is. This is a novel my students will be seeing quite a bit of next year. Forman's creative use of word choice creates characters whom are beyond real, a plot which is unlike any I have read before and shows how relationships play a definite role in our lives. Take a look at this portion:<br /><br />  \\"The car is eviscerated. The impact of a four-ton pickup truck going sixty miles an hour plowing straight into the passenger side had the force of an atom bomb. It tore off the doors, sent the front-side passenger seat through the driver's-side window. It flipped the chassis, bouncing it across the road and ripped the engine apart as if it were no stronger than a spiderweb. It tossed wheels and hubcaps deep into the forest. It ignited bits of the gas tank, so that now tiny flames lap at the wet road.\\" p. 13<br /><br />The imagery, figurative language and pure beauty of this section are astounding as are the rest of the novel.<br /><br />Luckily, I have the second novel in the series right on my shelf (and actually I already started reading it) and will see where the story takes me next. I cannot wait.ed bits of the gas tank, so that now tiny flames lap at the wet road.\\" p. 13      The imagery, figurative language and pure beauty of this section are astounding as are the rest of the novel.

B000002J1U|5.0|I bought Zep 3 when I was 14 when it was released new along with some Grand Funk and Jefferson Airplane stuff. Led Zeppelin 3 was probably the album that most impressed me on a number of levels of any record I have ever picked up on. The acoustic and electric mix was a serious \\"click\\" moment for me in my musical listening history...before that I just bought 45's from bands like The Doors and The Stones when I heard something on the radio I liked. After Zep 3 I was definately a much changed individual! Ever since then I have enjoyed both electric and acoustic driven songs big time. At first with Zep it was the Guitar and drums that stood out to me , but I soon gained a lot of respect for the vocal efforts of RP and the sadly much under appreciated Bass and keyboard playing of JPJ....Grand Funk was where I realized about the importance of the Bass player and drummer parts to creating the foundation of a song but Zeppelin really brought that into focus for me I think. This record also made me realize that the really good stuff I liked was not being played on commercial radio but on college radio stations..I was lucky enough to be located between two great stations at Nasson College in Springvale Maine and UNH in Durham NH...where I learned about bands like King Crimson, Yes, Tull, ELP and MANY others...<br /><br />So...got the 2014 re-do of this and have to say I really like this...ALOT! Everything just sounds better, clearer with the instruments and vocals both standing out more all at the same time. Zep Three for me at least is one of those records that I have no problem forking out the cash to get different versions of because...a much loved thing is always worth at least taking a shot at to see if it can be even more enjoyed...right? If you really like Zep three get this! The alternate takes, rough mixes and especially the version of Friends with no vocals are amazing! Over all the thing I like most about this is the much greater ability to hear what JPJ was doing...the man deserves far more praise for his contribution to LZ than he has gotten over the years!n deserves far more praise for his contribution to LZ than he has gotten over the years!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a newbie to the \\"Firefly\\" family. After seeing the excellent feature film, \\"Serenity\\", I had to find out for myself, and I'm quite impressed. I got the complete series at a good price; excellent investment. Loaded with humor, action and originality, this is definitely one to check out. No one may read this, but I am compelled to get in my 5-stars...
B002ZG994U|5.0|I never watched the television program.  It wasn't my style.  But a friend asked me to watch this and I was very surprised and very entertained.  The plot, while not original(wronged good guys trying to regain their reputation)was well done.  The pace of the movie was good.<br /><br />I think one of the main reasons I liked the characters so much was the actor's abilities.  Despite their peculiarties they were not overdone. So many films go to extremes with that.  Liam Neeson is always great!<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to even the most action-movie-shy viewer!
0345522478|5.0|(Originally I had writtened for Goodreads)<br />Fantasy, comedy, and adventure galore! Amazing starting novel for the Iron Druid. Some may say the humor was cheesy at times, but I enjoyed the laughter (Why so serious?!). Urban Fantasies can have all sorts of humor (dark, slapstick, banter, nerdy, etc.). I checked out Hearne's website to see he originally had envisioned this as comic/graphic novel series. He instead decided he'd rather expand while keeping his characters his own. So when reading, I do see those vivid moments where we have this extraordinary protagonist in action-packed situations. I personally felt it could only have been better if Hearne had tried for adding chapter illustrations (to see his visual thoughts on the events). Otherwise, I can't wait to see what is in store for Atticus and his friends later on.
0525422943|5.0|The sequel to such an amazing first book definitely did not disappoint. While written in a completely different voice and in a different style, the story of Mia and Adam was again opened for readers to explore. As with If I Stay, I could not put this one down. I read it in just a few hours. I loved hearing from Adam and seeing (again through those amazing flashbacks) what happened in the three years since we last left the characters. Seeing both Mia and Adam adults who are dealing with the issues that a rock star and a world renowned musician are faced with, was wonderful for me as a reader. Often I am left wondering, \\"What happened to these characters?\\" So many questions were answered with this novel and new stories were opened as well.<br /><br />As much as I loved the ending of If I Stay and wanted it to go on, it really could have ended there and Forman could have let my imagination go wild. I am so glad she didn't though because she has done a much better job than my brain ever could. The theme of family and its importance is still prevalent in this novel, but in a different context. Both Adam and Mia are figuring out who they are and who their family is. We all know that blood does not make us family and within every family (no matter what the dynamics) there will always be drama, misunderstandings, hurt feelings and unconditional love. That is what I loved so much. They were both trying to find that all this time without each other and then in one night... could things change for them? Have they found their balance after all these years? Go read it and see!

1435122968|5.0|This is a great collection that contains every single story that H. P. Lovecraft wrote by himself.  Each story has a wee note by esteemed editor, S. T. Joshi, concerning the story.  The first edition, which sold for $12.95, was riddled with hundreds of typographical errors; you can tell if you have that edition because it has a gold book ribbon and gold gilt on the edge of its pages.  The 2011 edition has almost all of the typos corrected; it has a purple book ribbon and silver gilt on its pages, and that is the edition you want.  The problem with ordering the book here at Amazon is that you have no idea what edition they will send you as you cannot inspect the book yourself.  But it is a great book, and includes rare items such as \\"A History of the Necronomicon,\\" plus it has lovely end papers and a sewn-in book ribbon.

0307946711|4.0|I read the one star reviews and take umbrage.  I agree the book is a little long; we get it that Dexter is self-absorbed and spiraling out of control.      The huge flaw to me is that Emma, who would no doubt lay down her life for Dexter, doesn't intervene in anyway in his two decades long self destruction.  In one instance he leaves on her voice mail a series of messages that sound almost suicidal, all in one evening.  But we never know what happened once Em got the messages.  Did she ever try to intervene in any way for the only person who made her life worth living?  Never got a hint of that.  I suppose having her intervene would push this book into the dynamics between addict and caring other which is not what this book is about (Em at social worker, Em at hospital, Em holding Dex's puking head, Em at social worker, Em at doctor)...  But I think that is what has disappointed the 'one-stars' - it has moved the plot out of the realm of truly believable.    Having said that.  A number of 'one-stars' did not like the characters.  I found 'unlikable' characters refreshing and realistic.  The 'one-stars' did not like that the coming together and afterward were not more spectacular.  I found that refreshing and realistic since Dex and Em were older, wiser, a little beaten up by life, and had been through 'star-struckness' already.  It is refreshing they grew a little tired of each other but kept pulling it back in - real love.  A 'oner' said it was formulaic - I totally disagree.  Formulaic - Dex would early on recognize what a great thing he had and go get sober and go after Em until he gets her, and she in turn would fight, then fall into his arms.  The big event that happens not so long after they get together is NOT formulaic.  I believe it is very, very difficult for us to get over our basic feelings of inadequacy.  It takes Emma decades to get over feeling ugly and insecure and getting in her own way because of it.  And Dexter decades to get to a place where he begins to feel even reasonably good about himself.  I liked them BECAUSE they realistically were so slow to improve.      While 'oners' found the ordinary detail boring, I found that it added heft to the commonness and reality of the story.  The `break-up' scene would not have been as well-set and believable without the backdrop provided by the rich detail of how horribly plastic and self-indulgent the restaurant (a metaphor for Dex's life) was.  I found the book long, but the words very economical with great flow and wit - a fast read.    The ending was a little manipulated (a 'one star'), but manipulated very well, I think.  The last few `paragraphs' came around to me into a lovely circle that said this still was a piece of fiction which directs and cajoles us toward hope and a sense of completion and fulfillment.  Lovely.  Very well done.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Why read this book?    Because this man is a marketing genius. Because unlike Amanda Hocking who keeps saying no one can duplicate what she did because it was a fluke, he actually tells you how to duplicate his success.    I find it laughable that many who give this book a low review, do so with the argument \\"If you want to make money and market your book, this is a great book, but if you want to write quality books, not so much...\\" I mean, come on, this book is not misleading. \\"How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months\\" NOT \\"How to Write the Great American Novel.\\"    I don't get it. If you're not looking for a marketing book, don't buy this book. If you want a book on how to write, look elsewhere.    I, for one, know how to write. And I'm not bad at marketing. But I haven't sold 1 million eBooks. And I want to! And I plan to! So I will listen to the man who has done it. What impresses me is that he's done it AND he has a strong business background where he made millions. I trust his business sense, and make no mistake, writing and self-publishing is a business. Too many writers are brilliant wordsmiths and epic fails at the business part.    I finished the book in 1 night. A few thoughts:    One: I used to be in sales. Insurance (Like the author) & business consulting. So I come to my writing career with many years of professional writing under my belt, as well as a sales career.    Two: Anything can be sold, and sold profitably, with the right system in place. Success is possible to duplicate if the person who generates the success knows what system they used, how and why it works, and how to present it to others.    Three: The book business is no different. The only difference in the past was lack of control over our own product. We couldn't be 'business owners', therefore we were at the whim and mercy of publishing companies. Not so now. Now, with self publishing options so easy, we are our own boss and can create and follow systems of sales that work.    Four:John Locke knows this and uses this. He created a system that worked after trying everything that didn't work. And now he's sharing it with us. I'm sooo excited I can't even tell you.    Five: You don't have to be a sales genius to do what he's saying. But his techniques are subtle. They are not hard, but please don't read \\"Get a blog\\" \\"Get twitter\\" etc. and think \\"oh I'm already doing that.\\" Unless you're making serious sales, you're likely NOT doing this.    In sales you learn fast that small tweaks to what you do or say can MAKE OR BREAK the game. Tweak what you're doing the way he tells you to and it may well work. I'm banking on it.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This is one of my all-time favortie movies.  The movie accurately details the critical events leading up to Pearl Harbor and what took place on the day itself.

B00000AF95|3.0|(3.5 stars) After the screeching disappointment of the incredibly overrated `[[ASIN:B00000AF94 Lick It Up]]', Kiss ditched Ace Frehley replacement, Vinnie Vincent (Vincent Cusano) on lead guitar and turned to Mark St John. The resulting album,`Animalize', benefits enormously from this decision. Co-writing 80% of the tracks on `Lick It Up', Cusano had heavily influenced its fast and screaming approach. With Stanley and Simmons turning to others as writing partners on `Animalize', this influence was replaced with a higher level of craftsmanship, as well as more accomplished (if somewhat over-technical) lead guitar from St John. Additionally, Michael James Jackson, who had produced the thunderous `[[ASIN:B000001ELR Creatures of the Night]]' two albums earlier, produced a much heavier drum sound for `Animalize' than had been evident on `Lick It Up' Hence, along with melodies befitting the Kiss of old, the album has a great sense of attack.<br /><br />Paul Stanley is credited as overall producer and it is a slick hard rock/ metal sound he manages to produce. Stanley also begins a writing partnership with contract songwriter, Desmond Child (along with almost every other American hard rock act in the 80s and early 90s!), which vastly improves the versatility of the songs. The album's opener `I've Had Enough (Into the Fire)' explodes off the disc/ vinyl in an uncharacteristically angry fashion before pummeling its way to the more frivolously infectious, though equally heavy, `Heaven's On Fire'. Fast paced rocker `Under the Gun' is similar to the first track. Written with African American multi-instrumentalist rocker, Jean Beauvoir (The Plasmatics, Little Steven), `Thrills in the Night' is a moody, noirish metal companion piece to `Heaven's On Fire' and another highlight of the album.<br /><br />Much has been written about Gene Simmons abandoning the band to make movies around this time, but his tracks, though as corny as ever, are both superior to those he wrote for `Lick It Up' and no more or less silly than most of his earlier compositions.<br /><br />Whatever the case, the underrated `Animalize' is a far better return to form than the over-heralded `Lick It Up'. It certainly sounds more powerful and more like Kiss.less silly than most of his earlier compositions.

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I would love to read this book, but not until the Kindle price comes down.  How can it be that the hardback and the paperback cost less than the Kindle?  Are the airwaves that expensive?  Doesn't saving trees count for anything??  I realize the Kindle price is set by the publisher. . . I'm waiting for them to wake up.  Hope it doesn't take too long, I've heard nothing but great things about this book.  I didn't want to skew the ratings, so I gave it three stars based on what I've heard and on my disappointment with the price. Maybe I'll just borrow it.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I have had only negative experiences with Turtle Beach products. I purchased the X11's not too long ago, but returned them a few days later because the sound quality and build were unimpressive (they have no bass, mind you, and the audio is very low). I then turned to my brother's PX21's which he's had for only 6 months or so. The audio and bass on these can reach high levels, which can be nice, but the sound is anything but rich, and after only a few weeks of use they stopped functioning. Maybe I'm just unlucky.<br /><br />I ordered this headset expecting an incredible piece of technology, especially with the original and hefty price tag of $200. A headset that is wireless, has surround sound AND is highly recommended? What can go wrong? Here's the deal: this headset is very light, no doubt, but this comes at a price: the build feels CHEAP, and it chews through AAA batteries like there's no tomorrow. Be prepared to change your batteries every day or two if you're a gaming fiend such as myself. Turtle Beach boasts of the surround sound and Bass Boost features on this piece like they're the most incredible features you'll ever have the opportunity to experience. Let me tell you, they're not.<br /><br />The audio is surprisingly low in all but the loudest games, the bass is pitiful, and with Bass Boost activated my headset pops almost literally EVERY TIME the bass is put to use... a.k.a every second I'm playing Black Ops, what with the explosions and such. Oh, and as fate would have it, my X41's are louder in one ear than in the other. Perfect. Finally, if you're like me, you own and use a wireless laptop/computer. With the X41's, you can't. The receiver will interfere with your laptop's connection. I am very, VERY disappointed with my purchase, and am exchanging them for the Tritton ax720's.
0307477479|2.0|I picked up this book because it was Goodreads' selection for an online book club, but I really struggled through it. In some ways it was fascinating like the way the narrative shifted from character to character and through time as well. One chapter was even the PowerPoint diary of a 12-yr-old. So strictly from an English major standpoint as one who loves words and the structure of words, I found the book intriguing. But, as a reader I was frustrated and put off by the deviant behavior of the characters. The \\"f\\" bomb was dropped so much that it exploded all around me the whole time I was trying to read the book. No less than three of the characters attempted suicide (one succeeded). They all did heavy drugs and led promiscuous lifestyles. I know of no one to whom I'd recommend this book, and that's a shame because the author obviously has literary talent. I just felt she could've written a better book.

Anyway, fast forward twenty four years. My old vinyl copy of the doors still in good shape but no turntable, my cassette copy finally bit the dust and my daughter brings home a copy of the Doors greatest hits. Excitedly i put on \\"Break on through\\" and was totally dismayed by Bruce Botniks butchering of the song. Along with \\"The End\\" he ruined what were my two favorite Doors songs.  I read The Review of the mp3 download and discovered that the correct version of \\"break on through\\" was on the download version.  If like me you like the original version of the song better than the reworked version. this is the one for you.  Unfortunately \\"Light My Fire\\" is the single version without Ray and Robbie's awesome solos. but that can be gotten on the best of package.i had to piece together an acceptable copy of \\"The Doors\\" from different sources, but now i can enjoy the album in its entirety without the unnecessary profanity during \\"the End\\" or the added lyrics in \\"Break On Through\\". I personally believe that the original versions of both these songs had more impact in their original state. that primal scream during \\"The End\\" was much more powerful than Jim Screaming the f word several times. plus i don't have to feel like a jerk listening to these songs  in front of my kids anymore.   thanks amazon... goood job.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I love this movie, The Illusionist. The acting is excellent & the story intriguing & since I already had a copy, I ordered two for gifts because all my friends like a GOOD movie. Plus Amazon had it at the right price for me to buy more than one!<br /><br />It's not new, but several people I know missed it the first time around.
0756405890|4.0|Characters have been left with plenty of room to develop, and while you never really step outside of Kvothe's sphere of observation, the world itself appears to be well constructed and waiting for you. When you include the world history, which is touched upon but never explained, it leaves you feeling very curious but a little frustrated. Having 4 stars as I feel the main story is yet to be told.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard great things about this trilogy and finally had the time to read them.  I read this book in a day. I absolutely could not put it down.  The content is depressing in a riveting way.  If you haven't read it you should!
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I hate to write bad review, but it really doesn't work after 2 months and a lot of reviews proved the same
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I gave it three stars because the author is talented at making an interesting world and the skill he has for making a book flow.  Other than that the book is rather unproductive; the plot has little to no progression. It makes me wonder how the third book will be able to finish the story.S Halfway through the book the main character is sent to the land of the fae.  This could be interesting in itself and add some plot, but instead of using it to propel the story along, talk about the Chandrian and such, the author spends about ninety percent of the time talking about Kvothe having sex with the faeling.  After that Kvothe seems almost addicted to having sex and we get to hear about it with another girl every nine pages or so. Overall the book was dissapointing and if it a first book I would not continue the series.  I probably will since I liked the first book hopefully the third book will be better.
0061537969|5.0|An amazingly writen novel that makes you cry and laugh and sometime both at the same time.     A touching tale of Denny an aspiring race-car driver, and his family trying to overcome lifes obstacles, trying to keep his family together whilst trying to achieve his dreams.     Told through the eyes of his dog Enzo, it teaches us leasons that transcend from racing to real life. Although it has alot of racing analogies it isn't so much so that it becomes exclusive to racing fans only, as I (not a racing fan per se) enjoyed it so much I can't stop raving on about it!    One of the best books I have read this year.     P.S. Keep a box of tissues handy.

0385738757|5.0|This was an excellent follow-up to The Maze Runner by James Dashner. The first book captivated me so much, I couldn't put it down and the second one did not disappoint. I read this book in the same way: barely able to put it down, thinking about it when I wasn't reading it, agonizing over it afterwards.    It's true, everything is different in this book and there is an entire new cast of characters to get to know, but James Dashner makes sure we get to know the important ones and the others, unfortunately, are cast aside. So it must be in times like this. Although the boys are not in the Glade any longer, they are in a new kind of hell, but it seems like they're actually in the real world now. That's what makes this book so interesting: after the Glade, do the boys really need to stick together now? Should they? It's a great experiment to see how they relate to one another now that they're out of the bubble, so to speak.    Another great think about The Scorch Trials is James Dashner's ability to bring on the creep. And by that, I mean everything is creepy from the beginning of the book until the end. I'm not sure if this is reality or if everyone is living in some kind of matrix. Although we're given more clues about the overall arc of the story, I'm still pretty clueless as to what's going on. Just like Thomas, I'm not sure who to trust and the people I thought I could trust, I've realized I can't. Or can I?    The Scorch Trials is a great YA thriller and I'm beyond excited to get my hands on The Death Cure, the last in the trilogy that comes out this fall. I can't wait!
B004ZQBP3Q|4.0|LMFAO's second cd is still pretty good, but I think their first cd Party Rock was better. Party Rock had a number of great songs while this cd has one: Party Rock Anthem.     I must admit that this cd has grown on me considerably since I first got it, so I guess it just needed a number of plays to really get into it. After a while some of the songs can become pretty catchy. If you are gonna buy the cd I definitely think it is worth the extra few dollars for the extra four songs. Put That A$$ to Work and Reminds Me of You are two of the best songs on the album.    Overall this album is definitely some of the best music out there this summer.     Party Rock hard my friends.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Could not put this book down. Loved this story as fan fiction and truly loving that it is now published. She is an amazing story teller, and can not wait for the next book in the trilogy to come out.
1423101502|4.0|Review Overview:        Loved that Manhattan was a battleground      Actual plot wasn't as engaging because of the lack of a main myth tied to the plot      Overall, still a fantastic series that can't be missed    While THE LAST OLYMPIAN was a fantastic conclusion to the epic Percy Jackson series, I admit that it was my least favorite of the books.    I absolutely loved the fact that Manhattan served as the battleground. Living in the city, it was fantastic to read about familiar places covered with monsters and demi-gods. I was easily able to map out the locations Percy mentioned. The map at the beginning of the book was a fantastic and beautiful addition to the book, especially those to who are not so familiar with Manhattan. I loved Daedalus's automatons sprinkled around the city - mostly because the first one, William H. Seward, is only a few blocks away from me. Immediately after reading that Percy was on 23rd Street, I was already making plans to visit the automaton. How cool.    Though I loved the setting and the bits of mythology sprinkled throughout the book, the pacing of the book completely threw me off. I honestly wasn't at the edge of my seat because it felt like Percy was always in battle. In a way, it did feel a bit anti-climactic because I felt like there was no build-up to the big battle between Kronos and Percy. I knew it was going to happen, and it became one of those events that I just felt like, okay, it's going to happen, no big deal.    Furthermore, what made this story different from the others was that there was no main myth that was woven perfectly into the story. I guess I had such high hopes after reading The Battle of the Labyrinth. The story of Daedalus was integrated so well and THE LAST OLYMPIAN only had the prophecy to pull it to the end. Lack of a central myth was a huge loss to me as a reader. The prophecy only entertained me so much and it wasn't engaging enough to me as a reader. There were no really jaw-dropping moments.    Despite my qualms with the book, it was still an enjoyable read. I still highly recommend the Percy Jackson series despite the fact that the last book was not as epic as I thought it would be. Riordan does a fantastic job tying up the series nonetheless. I was left with a warm fuzzy feeling, but at the same time, I felt like a connection between me and a close friend had been severed. I'm happy with the conclusion to the series as a whole, and I will miss the Percy Jackson cast tremendously. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a fantastic middle grade series that you cannot miss.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|just saw this movie today at the cinema in 3-D.  The actors were fine, the special effects in 3-D was the main selling point for me, and did not disappoint.  Movies like this are best viewed at the cinema and in 3-D.  You would lose something in the experience to watch an action film like this at home.<br /><br />The plot was okay, but didn't break any new super-hero ground.  (Batman and Spider-Man seem to get the best scripts).  Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds had good performances.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|It wasn't what I was expecting at all. I thought it was going to be your typical fantasy teen movie. It was much darker and creative. I loved it. There is nothing else I can say :)
B0000027RL|5.0|The first being Nirvana's \\"Bleach\\", the second being this instant classic. Why do Pearl Jam, let alone this CD still remain powerful? It's quite simple: Solid music, with easily synched instruments and captivating vocal work by Vedder. At least, that's my opinion. No matter what you may think, there's no denying the impact this band has had and continues to have, even after 20 years. They have been and probably always will be, awesome. And this is their best work!
B001KZ24NU|4.0|I had been wanting to read this series for a very long time, but I never really got around to getting a copy. My friend Tasha is a huge fan of the series and finally lent me hers and I finally got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I started reading UGLIES in the middle of finals, BEA, and the end of the semester which meant that I really did not have much time to just sit down and read. My reading experience had been extremely choppy and it made it difficult to really get into the book. However, despite my personal setbacks, I was still able to enjoy UGLIES overall, and it definitely made me think.    Tally lives in a society where at sixteen, you turn pretty. Initially, I found many, if not all, to be extremely shallow. Uglies called each other terrible names like Zitface and Squint that basically pointed out their flaws. There is this obsession with facial symmetry and looking perfect, and Tally could not wait until she turns pretty herself and moves to Pretty Town across the river. I didn't think that I was going to be able to relate to Tally at all, but she does grow as a character as the book progresses. We learn the secrets behind becoming pretty - secrets that still make my mind boggle - and Tally realizes that the whole world that she had known growing up may not be as perfect as it looks.    Other than the issues of self-image, beauty, and plastic surgery, Weseterfeld also brings up many topics that makes readers think. The book is way more than just about a teenager in a world where everyone turns pretty. He also makes readers think about issues such as genetic modification and experimental medicine. Like a good dystopian novel, he made me think of society today and how our actions could impact the world in the future.    There is a bit of romance in the novel, though it is far from the main focus. I did feel that it was a bit rushed, but there is some chemistry between the two characters. The romance does play a bigger part toward the end of the novel,and I am curious how it picks back up in the second book.    UGLIES definitely gives readers a lot to think about. Westerfeld is a fantastic world-builder and he absolutely makes you stop to think while reading. UGLIES is a fantastic example of what a dystopian novel should do: it should entertain but also make you question your actions and today's society and how it could affect that future. The scariest part about the UGLIES? While the concept seems outrageous, there are probably many people out there who wouldn't mind living amongst beautiful people.    I can't wait to continue the rest of the series! I hope I can get to them all before school starts up again in the fall. UGLIES by Scott Westerfeld is definitely recommended to fans of dystopia and science fiction.
B002ZG97RY|3.0|The war in Iraq relied on several faulty assumptions and evidence, either gathered incorrectly or simply manufactured. Then there were the beginning days of the war, where we were almost on the verge of complete victory but a few strategic mistakes such as the dismantling of the entire Iraqi army brought chaotic results. Green Zone chronicles these events through the eyes of Matt Damon, who tries to navigate his way in the chaotic early days of the war. His persistence at getting to the bottom of the secrets is futile and eventually frustrating.<br />I thought the movie was just ok, but Damon is amazing and certainly shows us the reason for his continued presence in top films. The movie highlights some of the nerve racking missions the brave soldiers go on and the selfless service for our country, which is remarkable. The movie not so much...three stars. 6/18/2011
B002FGU46C|4.0|These are good looking, light weight and durable sandals.  They're probably my fifth or sixth pair of Tevas over the last 15 or 20 years.  I currently own another pair in a different model, the Tanza.  The Tanzas are a little dressier and have a somewhat more comfy sole, though they also have a cushioning under the straps which, at the little toe, has a slight tendency to fold over when you first put them on. The Terra Fi model is simpler, more like the first couple of pairs I bought so many years ago, but the sole is somewhat harder.  I also find the styling of the back end of the soles a little over done without apparent reason.  Still, they are comfortable and suitable for use with Jeans or shorts, on trail, beach, or city street.  As with most Tevas, the three point adjustment system makes it easy to suit the sandals to the peculiarities of your own feet, assuming the soles are your correct size.  That reminds me to mention that I have found Tevas to run true to size, so I feel free to order them on line, something I have NOT found to be true for most other brands of shoes, which I have learned only to buy where I can try them on.
0553328255|5.0|This is a paperback edition of \\"The Complete Novels And Stories\\", a Sherlock Holmes collection originally released in 1986. This being the 2003 reprint, it features a foreword, and a charming little slip-box for your novels to inhabit when not being read. As you should be able to guess, this collection has everything Arthur Conan Doyle wrote featuring Holmes. Sadly, the original art from the Strand publications is not in the stories, which is a shame but, other than that, this is the best paperback version you are going to get!
B004GYOQ6A|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of the labyrinth type of game, and this is one of the less well polished versions I've tried. The graphics are quite mediocre. The ball seemed to want to catch and get hung up on everything. Many of the mazes have openings that are just a wee bit too small to get the ball through, so you have to figure out the proper path in addition to avoiding the pitfalls. Most annoying however are the moving sections, which can make the difference between finishing in a few seconds and taking a minute or more to finish.<br /><br />The app also has OpenFeint, for those of you who don't like being spied on.<br /><br />I think $4 is far too much for this game. $2 would be a more reasonable price, if it were a bit more polished. In its current state, 99 cents would be appropriate.<br /><br />Works on the Evo 3D and the Xoom.
B003UESJ9M|4.0|Kelly Canter ( Gwyneth Paltrow) is a country music superstar who has been pulled out of rehab early by her pushy husband manager ( Tim Mcgraw) to go on a comeback tour of sorts. Kelly is not eager because she is still recovering not just from alcohol addiction but also from a devastating tragedy. She does, however reluctantly agree only if she has Beau Hutton, a man with whom she is having a affair ( Garett Hedlund) as a supporting act on the tour. As her husband tries to put together the tour, we get a glimpse at the sad and lonely lives of these superstars and generally life of a band on the road.<br />There are a couple of scenes which are amazing, 1.The singing in classroom at the Make- a -Wish Foundation event.<br />2. Gywneth Paltrow, giving advice in the dressing room to Meester (Chiles Stanton) towards the end of the film.<br />3. The look on the face of Garett Hedlund as he reacts to the crowd cheering the rising star Chiles.<br />I heard a lot of criticisms of this movie; however I found the movie interesting and well acted. Each of the main characters gives some fine performances, Tim Mcgraw is excellent,trying to fulfill his dual roles as manager and husband, Garett Hedlund and Leighton Meeser  are good.  Gwyneth Paltrow still looks amazing and acts well. The songs were great for me because I love country music. This movie is not as strong as Crazy Heart, another film about country music starring Jeff Bridges but it has its own charms. I liked the film a lot. 4 stars. 6/20/2011
B0058VW36U|5.0|for some reason takes eons to load. regardless i still play all the time. very intuitive, very fun, great style.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is the most recent DVD release of this film. The picture has been restored to a spectacular crispness so, you don't need to worry about missing anything. The film itself is on the first 2 discs, while the third one has some cool bonus stuff. There is also a booklet, which has a short chronicle of the filming process and the last documented interview with Toshiro Mifune. There is no English dubbing, just subtitles but, that's how it should be. I am glad this film is in such good condition because, as Kurosawa said \\"It is wonderful to create\\".
B004XWMXX8|5.0|Wow! After the first two 4 star albums, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect here. But things have taken a different turn! This album is flat out awesome! She isnt disney channel anymore, she is teen pop. And her lyrics are amazing. Though i was surprised about the curse words, i just figured that maybe she is maturing and trying to grow up. Every song on here, i love!

0817439390|5.0|if you want to start photographing you should have this book! it gives you the basic rules to use your camera - what ever it's kind- perfectly, before  I bought this book I was I don't how to set my camera to capture great or even good shots, I was worried of using the manual set, but after I red the book I knew how to use the manual  set and I got very good pictures!
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Okay, so everyone complains that it is difficult to find the focus with this thing.  Absolutely true but that is what happens to any camera when you seriously alter the focal length of your lens.  Depending on the lens you place it on, you'll be lucky to have more than 2mm of depth of field.      That being said, I find this thing is a lot of fun to use (don't expect to take a quick snap shot, plan on spending some serious time struggling to take 50+ exposures and maybe if you're lucky you'll get one worth saving - welcome to the world of macro photography!).  What I really like about this lens adapter is the ability to really take a picture of the Gnat's a**, not just figuratively but literally. This is great lens adapter but my advise it to understand what it does how it does it before purchasing it.  It is not for everyone, especially you point-n-shot guys.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|(No spoilers)<br />I rented this and found that it had a good plot, a little humor, good acting, and a great ending.  This is a 4/5 star film - and probably needs to be watched twice in order to get all the little details about doors, water, and everyday obects that were used funny in the movie.  So you watch it once for the plot and again for the details - a disc worth purchasing.
6304806434|5.0|Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage (\\"Moonstruck,\\" Best Actor, \\"Leaving Las Vegas,\\" \\"The Rock)reunites with producer Jerry Bruckheimer (\\"Top Gun,\\" \\"The Rock\\") for yet another explosive, star-studded action thriller that soars up, up, up, and never lets you down. Screen villain John Malkovich (\\"Places In The Heart,\\" \\"Dangerous Liaisons,\\" \\"In The Line Of Fire\\") also is on board for the ride. John Cusack (\\"High Fidelity\\") is also on the ground for the landing. Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, comedian Dave Chappelle, Nick Chinlund, Colm Meaney (playing a meanie...sorry couldn't resist), M.C. Gainey, Rachel Ticotin (\\"Total Recall\\"), Mykleti Williamson and Monica Potter round out the cast. This film is as good as \\"The Rock,\\" if not better. My only gripe with the film is with the transvestite character. Did they REALLY HAVE TO HAVE something disgusting like THAT in the movie? Other than that, really good film. Steve Buscemi reminded me of Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter for the first few minutes he was on screen. I highly recommend this movie, if you're either a fan of the film \\"The Rock,\\" Jerry Bruckheimer, Nicolas Cage or John Malkovich (seriously, though, the guy CANNOT do accents when cast in a period piece). Should have been rated PG-13.

B0009PAVI2|5.0|I'd been looking for a filter case for my larger 77mm filters that I would allow me to carry them without worry.  I have an ND, Graduated ND and a Polarizing Filter that were quite inconvenient to carry.  After reading positive reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did, I can carry all three of my filters comfortably with this case. It fits easily into the front compartment on my camera bag (Lowpro 202 AW) and because it has a belt loop strap with a snap on the back, I can carry in on the exterior of my bag or even my belt if I need to have my filters handy. The case has both velcro and a plastic snap buckle to keep the filters very save inside.    I only wish it had one more pocket for my 49-58mm and 58-77mm step up rings. But then I'd be leaving a review for the Tiffen 4BLTPCHLGK Large Belt Style Filter Pouch for Filters 62mm to 82mm and it probably would be just a bit to big for my camera case.  Also the Tiffen case did not have the extra security of the velcro and snap buckle for closing and I felt that was an important feature to have.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Lots of fun! Great levels &amp; sense of humour! This is my new favourite game. I highly recommend it if you like puzzle games.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|After reading the first book, you have to continue to the second.  After all surprises towards the end of the first book, you get caught up with what's happening with Daenarys and the Starks as well as some others.  As usual, there are surprising developments, where one character seems almost villanous in one chapter is then sympathetic in a later chapter so that you're confused who is awful and who is good.  In a way, these characters come the closest to depicting real people in that people are neither good nor bad, they are just complex.  The shocks and revelations continue to come, along with some foreshadowing that is sometimes easy to say where it will go, and other times you know it will play a role, you're just not sure how.  Which is why you end up buying the next book!
B0058O84G0|1.0|Follett has lost his way in this book. The story read worse than a textbook on warfare. Stick to your knitting next time and tell stories about people
B000FQJAIW|5.0|If you grew up on Star Wars, that is, the original Star Wars from the 70's and 80's, you must own this version!  The most important thing that it contains is on Disc 2, and it's the absolute original movie, from the title crawl to the great story supported by special effects (rather than centering around special effects like the most recent versions).  It's got everything I love about Star Wars: great acting, fantastic setting, solid story, good v. evil, and rooting for the underdog.  It's a story of how a bunch of nobodies became somebody because of a power greater than any of them could imagine.<br /><br />The effects, though pedestrian by modern standards, are supported by a solid story and a believable, \\"used\\" universe that feels lived-in.  From the dirt on the X-Wings to the blaster-burns on the Millennium Falcon, the actors work well with their set pieces and look like they're actually on a different planet rather than, say, running around a blue-room that will later be rendered by a team of artists.<br /><br />If you can't tell by now, the newer Star Wars movies don't impress me.  In fact, I consider them outside the Canon entirely and deny that they have any real connection to these original works, for which I will someday break down and write fanfic prequels myself.  Yes, this makes me a huge nerd, and probably makes some of you think less of me.  But I don't care.  Think of me as Star Wars Amish, if that makes it any better.<br /><br />Anyway, if this sounds appealing to you, then buy these discs before George Lucas buys them all up and destroys them in a fascist attempt to force us to accept his ridiculous unedited vision for this universe.
0671646788|5.0|Every now and then, one read a book that truly inspires. This is exactly what David has achieved with the Magic of Thinking Big. Not only does he inspire \\"big\\" thinking, but he also takes it one step further to inspire action to make it happen. The book is filled with ideas and techniques that can be applied in our everyday life whether at home or at work. These are illustrated by real-life examples that the author draws upon - in which these techniques have proven further success, happiness, and satisfaction to those who have implemented them. Many of the ideas presented, constitute the basis for true leadership.<br /><br />A very enjoyable and educative read. It is structured in such a way as to allow the readers to read and implement specific ideas/techniques presented in one chapter without necessarily reading the entire book. This is in my opinion, the most effective way to take advantage of the wisdom presented. A highly recommended read!<br /><br />Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you may have.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"Knowledge is power - when you use it constructively.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"Action cures fear.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"Look at things not as they are, but as they can be. Visualization adds value to everything. A big thinker always visualizes what can be done in the future. He isn't stuck with the present.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"Practice adding value to things... Practice adding value to people...Practice adding value to yourself.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"...The successful person doesn't ask, \\"Can I do it better?\\" He knows he can. So he phrases the question: How can I do it better?\\"<br /><br />7- \\"Big success calls for persons who continually set higher standards for themselves and others, persons who are searching for ways to increase efficiency, to get more output at lower cost, do more with less effort. Top success is reserved for the I-can-do-it-better kind of person.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"In summation, use these tools and think creatively...Believe it can be done...Don't let tradition paralyze your mind. Be receptive to new ideas. Be experimental. Try new approaches. Be progressive in everything you do...Ask yourself daily, \\"How can I do better?\\"...Ask yourself, \\"How can I do more?\\" Capacity is a state of mind. Asking yourself this question puts your mind to work to find intelligent short-cuts. The success combination is business is: Do what you do better...and do more of what you do...Practice asking and listening...Stretch your mind. Get stimulated. Associate with people who can help you to think of new ideas, new ways of doing things.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"How you think determines how you act. How you act in turn determines: How others react to you.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"The way we think toward our jobs determines how our subordinates think toward their jobs.\\"<br /><br />11- \\"The person who does the most talking and the person who is the most successful are rarely the same person. Almost without exception, the more successful the person, the more he practices conversation generosity, that is, he encourages the other person to talk about himself, his views, his accomplishments, his family, his job, his problems.\\"<br /><br />12- \\"The test of a successful person is not an ability to eliminate all problems before they arise, but to meet and work out difficulties when they do arise. We must be willing to make an intelligent compromise with perfection lest we wait forever before taking action.

0553386794|5.0|I admit, I started to read these when I saw that HBO would have a new series  based on this series.  But, before I even watched the first episode, I read this book.  And what a ride it provides.  It surprised me that both villains and heroes are treated the same by the writer.  That is, both are used to keep the story moving, even if it means killing off characters that you would expect to be around for a while.  Everyone is at risk of being killed off.  It really grabs your attention and even if it reads like a bit of a thrilling soap opera at the beginning, the fantasy part does eventually come in.  Make sure you have a lot of time on your hands before you start because you won't be able to put it down.
0982633939|5.0|As a fan of the movie version, I'd been searching for a copy of To Catch a Thief for years. I'm thrilled to finally own the novel and found not only the story itself entertaining, but the additional information of David Dodge's life in France and the search for the location of his rented villa intriguing as well.
0316098329|5.0|Wow, this book is a page turner in every sense. I will be thinking about this book for a long time to come. I could not put this book down. Give it a read, you won't regret it.

B0038BBA4I|4.0|If you're sick of hearing what passes for pop music / top 40, then this is the music for you.  It is very soulful, insightful and has an almost revivalist feel without the preachiness.  I would call this healing music if you need something uplifting to listen to that makes your heart soar.  I know, sounds corny but I don't know how else to describe it since I don't think I've ever heard anything like it.
0061537969|1.0|Enzo the large breed mutt tells us the story of Denny Smith, a mechanic with a passion and talent for high-performance racing: his life as a single man, his courtship of and marriage to Eve, the birth of their daughter Zoe, the death of Eve from cancer, and the fallout from that untimely passing.    The life of one family as seen through the eyes of their dog is not the type of novel I would normally choose. But The Art of Racing in The Rain was a book group selection; so, like a good little group member, I bought it. Then I moved and left that book group behind. Thus, Garth Stein's book sat on the To Be Read shelf for many many months.    After I finally decided to read it, I nearly put it down when the first chapter made me cry. Wiping my tears, I persevered. About halfway through the book, I got so angry at the direction of the storyline, I nearly put it down. But I cheated and turned to the last few pages of the book to find out the resolution to that particular turn of events. What I saw convinced me to go ahead and finish the story. Grudgingly.    In other words, I did not enjoy the time spent reading this book. It has nothing to do with the quality of the writing, which is excellent; or the development of the characters, who are fully-fleshed for the most part; or the voice of the narrator, which is surprisingly enchanting.    I just don't like blatant emotional manipulation, which is usually what happens in books told by animals.
B003F5WOEC|4.0|If I've caught you with this review in some sort of transitional phase of having heard the Black Keys' previous work and not yet this record, or perhaps if you're in the process of familiarizing yourself with the band, it bears stressing that this record is definitely not like any of their prior ones.  In my case, I fell in love with the gritty, lo-fi blues rock of all their prior records, particularly [[ASIN:B0002O06N0 Rubber Factory]] , and I even found the slicker [[ASIN:B0013K6WLM Attack and Release]] to be pretty great.  This record displays a strong soul influence, as well as showing the band stretching out to embrace the influence of other genres.  I'll admit to being put off at first by this record; it's much more layered, eschewing the stripped-down rock sound for something much more intricate.  One of my pet peeves is when I know that more instruments are being played on a record than there are members in the band, so at first the multi-instrumentation of Brothers bothered me even though I liked all the songs from the start.  And perhaps it's just the indie snob in me, but it bugs me that I keep hearing songs from this record everywhere, but none from their prior works.  It's almost as if whoever picks music for commercials or TV wants to disassociate from the more raw sound.<br /><br />Either way, if you like the Black Keys, listen to this album.  If you're looking to try listening to the Black Keys, listen to this album, and also listen to some of their previous ones.  This record is a turning point for them; get a feel for which of their sounds you prefer (or maybe you prefer both!).
B003QNXPUK|2.0|This is the second Zagg shield I've had on my iPhone 4 - the first one peeled off after a weekend trip to Vegas, apparently it just couldn't stand the heat! I went and bought another one since I tossed the bad one in the garbage (not thinking about needing to send it in for the free replacement under the lifetime warranty), installed it no problem, but this one is quite a bit smaller than the original one I had on it. There are large gaps on each side where the glass isn't covered which is really annoying. I really liked my old Zagg cover, it did exactly what it was supposed to do and fit much better than this one. If I'm paying $20 for a little piece of plastic, I expect much better coverage than this. Boo!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I mean, by now, it is no surprise when favorite characters get killed off.  And you even get an ominous feeling as you read along, knowing that no good can come of certain events and interactions.  But you still hope that your feeling is wrong.  But then it wouldn't be a true book in the series A song of fire and ice if it didn't throw a few curveballs at you.  You learn how the war of the five kings is progressing.  you cheer some and you mourn some.  And you learn that the real war isn't amongst the kings, but is something more dark and frightening that is to come.  After all, \\"winter is coming\\".  And then you finish this as fast as you can so you can find out what in the world will happen next naturally.
1451626657|2.0|So, here's the thing. I know this is supposed to be one of the seminal works of American literature, and blazingly funny to boot. And while I have no doubt Catch-22 will maintain its place in the canon regardless of anything I write, I found the whole thing quite tedious.    Perhaps that was Heller's point: that war is tedious, that war doesn't make sense, that the only way for a soldier to survive a war with sanity intact is to develop a sense of the absurd and act on it. But after 144 pages, I knew I didn't care enough about Yossarian or any other character to follow the absurdity for another 300 pages.    Thus, a two-star rating simply because I didn't care.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|After seeing our heroine get abused and kicked around but seeing her giving as good as she gets, you hope that she finally will get to deliver the justice that has been long overdue.  And you won't be disappointed here.  She doesn't get to physically kick as much ass as in past books, although it does come eventually.  But she does still get to do what is necessary to nail the bad guys even while she is confined.  Because she is the indestructible Lizbeth.  She does have some help in the form of her regular crew, and we even finally get to meet the people who are the reason she is seen as a liability and why they feel it is important to shut her up.  You know she will get justice, it just isn't easy to predict how until you read it.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|To evolve you have to change and grow and that's exactly what Beyonce latest album gives us growth and change.  I inserted the cd into in my cd player and listen to every song. I love every single song on this cd.  I took time to listen to the melodies, the rhythm and her lyrics.  This cd is definitely a masterpiece.  Some of her fans will not like this cd because she has changed up her style a little, but I LOVE this cd.    Her voice is raw, filled with emotions and she seems to be expressing herself from her soul. Some of my favorite songs on this cd are 1+1 and I Care (I love her raw emotions and voice in these songs and I already know the words to these).  I Miss You is a beautiful song that I wish lasted longer. I put it on repeat a few times just to make it last longer. Countdown, Party and I Was Here are also nice songs.  This cd is one you can just insert and press play..and just listen without skipping.    Great cd!! Definitely five stars!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Played with an HTC Incredible    I only got this because it was free on Amazon. I had heard/read people raving about this game but I had never bothered to actually buy it.     I played this regularly until I made it all through to the end boss. Which was a pretty fun albeit kind of easy battle for me.    I think they did a really got job gradually ramping up the difficulty, wave after wave.    At its heart this game could probably be described as a tower defense game. You can units, plants in this case, which can be placed for defense against wave after wave of varying types of zombies.    I really enjoyed the sense of humor to this game. From the crazy neighbor with a pot on his head to disco zombies I thought it was quite entertaining.    I have larger than average hands which can sometimes cause issues. For instance when I'm trying to put down a cherry bomb to get that last zombie about to eat my brains but i end up with a sunflower (then my brains get eaten). This can be frustrating at times. A larger screen or reasonably sized hands might help with this issue.    One other negative, and I could be wrong about this, but it seems like my phone is kind of glitchy after quitting out of this game. It's like part of the game is left in memory or still some how taking up resources of the phone. So now I just reboot the phone every time I quit game just to flush the system. I have experienced this issue on two different custom ROMs (Virtuous and Skyraider 4). I have not tried it on the stock system ROM. Or perhaps my phone, released just over a year ago, is already showing it's age.

0143038419|4.0|If you feel like your life is stagnant and that you're just repeating the same cycles of bad decisions over and over, then you need to read this book.  I'm not saying you should do as the author and go out to eat, pray and love your way to a breakthrough.  But it is great to read about someone who you can relate to and how she finally found herself.  The eating part is absolutely salivating and made me wish I too could hop on a plane and eat my way through a country for a few months.  The praying part was also inspiring and made me look at meditation in a completely different way.  And who doesn't love a good love story?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Yep. It's true! I finally got around to watching \\"Firefly\\" a few months ago. I'm a full time student with a full time job so I'm pretty wary when it comes to taking on new interests that have the potential to distract me from studying. Let's face it; normal people can read a book or watch a TV show and move on with their lives, but nerd hobbies are all-consuming. Fearing a repeat of last summer (during which time I watched all 5 seasons of \\"Angel\\"), I decided to give \\"Firefly\\" a shot only when I found out how short the series was. \\"Just 14 episodes and a movie?\\" I thought, \\"How consuming an interest could this show possibly be?\\"<br /><br />Well what do you know? I'm hooked. I was hooked right away, in fact. The theme song got me. (I'm not even kidding.) I've read some books in my life that really had a profound effect on me. I've seen fewer movies that moved me as much. But for a television show to do the same is exceedingly rare.<br /><br />As of now, 3,110 people before me have written 5-star reviews about how \\"Firefly\\" is one of the greatest shows of all time, and about what a waste of potential its premature cancellation was. Honestly, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said by at least a couple thousand other \\"Browncoats.\\" The one bad thing about my \\"Firefly\\" experience is that watching it was a little bittersweet. On my first viewing, it was a bit depressing to take such a heartfelt interest in the characters, all the while knowing there was so little left of it to see.<br /><br />Fortunately fans have been given some closure with the excellent 2005 film \\"Serenity.\\" No, it's not the 5-7 (or so) seasons the series deserved to have, but it's a fitting end nonetheless. Having seen the film, I no longer feel depressed when watching the episodes.<br /><br />So if you're even later to the \\"Firefly\\" party than I was, I highly recommend that you see it. But consider yourself warned: For \\"just\\" 14 episodes and a movie, \\"Firefly\\" packs a big punch.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I have this game on the iTouch, so I had to get it on my Droid Incredible!   Its got a little bit of a lag in framerate that happens occasionally, which is strange because the Incredible has more ram than the iTouch 4.  Still a great game to play!
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|This show had me hooked every week. And to find it used on Blu Ray in this condition for under $20 was perfect.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Sadly, \\"Firefly,\\" by many accounts one of the greatest television shows ever created, was cancelled mid-way through its first season. Thousands of fans of the show (AKA \\"Browncoats\\") pressured Fox executives to continue the series, and in 2005, they got their wish. Sort of.<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" starts out not long after where \\"Firefly\\" left off, with Mal and the crew (minus Inara and the Shepherd, at first) just trying to survive and keep flying honorably (if not always legally). River (who is still crazy) gets the crew into more trouble than they've ever been in together, and it's up to Mal to lead them out of it. Characters go through some deeper development, loose ends are tied up, mysteries are explained, but of course (Joss Whedon being the cruel showman he is) the ending is left open and the audience craving far more.<br /><br />The film's not perfect. (This is understandable, of course, since it takes the place of what might have been a long, complicated series.) The \\"Hands of Blue\\" are never explained, and a hacker (\\"Mr. Universe\\") is introduced as if he'd been a recurring character all along. Perhaps he was meant to be, but simply hadn't been introduced to the show yet? Either way, I also found Mr. Universe to be more than a little annoying and clich&eacute;.<br /><br />But aside from those couple of tiny nit-picks, \\"Serenity\\" is a great film. The action scenes are suspenseful but fun, the one-liners are as witty and hilarious as ever, and a newly-introduced antagonist (a shadowy, black ops type known only as \\"The Operative\\") is the perfect antithesis to Mal. (He's the sly ninja to Mal's noble cowboy, but I digress...) I think \\"Serenity\\" is probably a pretty good stand-alone film, but I'd certainly have to recommend watching \\"Firefly\\" first.<br /><br />No, \\"Serenity\\" isn't the several seasons worth of episodes the fans wanted (and the show truly deserved), but it's a very fitting end to a series that needed closure.<br /><br />So watch the gorram thing already.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! I went to the theater to see this movie four times. I would have gone again but it was taken out of theaters too soon. I pre-ordered the day I realized I couldn't go see it.    This film shows the importance of family and friends when times are tough. It stayed true to Bethany's story and portrayed all of the real life characters accurately. Her best friend, Alana Blanchard is a main character as well and it shows the rescue exactly as she described it in past interviews. All in all, it's a great film for anyone and everyone. You'll always leave seeing this movie so happy and eager to stay positive no matter what life throws at you.

Blammed for her sisters death, Baby Doll is sent to a asylum where she dreams a different reality with 4 other girls to fight her way through her prision and escape to freedom. The movie is an art film, a metaphor that is trying to connect with its audience on a much deeper level, you have to search for its meaning, it means whatever you want it to mean. general audiences didn't understand the movie and quickly called it bad writing buts its not, its very well thought out. esspecially with the female narrative at the beginning and ending. thought provoking storyline, good soundtrack, action packed and hot girls makes this an entertaining watch.

The beginning 100 pages and ending 100 pages are great.  They keep you interested and wanting to know what happens next.  The middle 300 pages are somewhat boring.  This story will be a trilogy so I hope the author writes the second and third book with more action and less set-up.

1439177783|5.0|Portia de Rossi created a heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, beautiful book that everyone should read, but though I cried multiple times every time I read this masterpiece, even more than being painful and opening my eyes, what Portia de Rossi did with her story by sharing it with the world is ultimately inspiring. Her voice is strong, and this autobiography has something in it for everyone. Everyone can relate to at least parts of \\"Unbearable Lightness.\\" You will cheer on this beautiful, strong woman as you read of her struggles, you will cry for her pain, you will rejoice in the love she found at last with Ellen DeGeneres, and will hope that you can only have as much strength, resilience, and love. A must read for everyone. I loved and admired Portia de Rossi before I read her book, and after, I spent $90 on a signed copy.
0525423842|1.0|It isn't easy to transition into young adult/tween writing and John Grisham drives that point home with this novel. Grisham does not know how to pen the voice of a thirteen year old boy and creates unrealistic interactions with the boy's peers and parents. This is a thirteen year old kid going on sixty! One thing that I found especially irksome was the gender segregated public school Boone attended...is that legal Mr. Grisham? Old Nancy Drew books have a better perspective with today's youth. Theodore was utterly unbelievable and by the second chapter the kid got on MY nerves and I'm an adult. In reality this kid would be a social pariah. However, most things are not a complete waste of time and there was some basic/useful law advice strewn throughout the book. But the idea of kids going to their 'peer attorney' for legal advice was farfetched. In a real middle school, this boy would have had no friends to solicit advice.   The reason I read fiction geared towards young people is because I volunteer extensively and encourage youth to read GOOD books. One I would recommend for perhaps a young adult is \\"Freaky Green Eyes\\" by Joyce Carrol Oates. Her eloquence and the ability to capture human voice throughout many life stages is extraordinary.     Mr. Grisham, we appreciate your effort with this young adult venture but there's no point reinventing the wheel; stick to what you know.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Yes have about 19 different concerts available on the market, from all different eras, with countless different line-ups and of differing quality. Yes Symphonic Live has the unique selling point of being performed live in conjunction with a Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />The sound and visuals are top notch (apart from some cheesy, but thankfully short animations) and there are no major complaints to be made about the camera work or editing. The sound is equally impressive, balancing your need to hear the band's performance with your desire to hear the Orchestra's addition well.<br /><br />The actual performance is strong too, this concert stands on its own merits and is not worthwhile only because of the Orchestra's involvement.

This is no exception and could even be described as one of the best examples of this sort of collaboration. After all, their albums 'Time And A Word' and 'Magnification' have given Yes Orchestra experience before and their music is so frequently described ad grand or symphonic on its own merits.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this DVD; Yes put in a brilliant performance, it looks and sounds good, they play The Gates Of Delirium and the Orchestra adds considerably to the experience.

B003LSTK8G|4.0|Considering that I have read just about every other book about the crisis, I am pretty late to the party in reading this book. I downloaded it last week and read it through within 24 hours.    First, I have to say Lewis provides the most entertaining account of the crisis. Lewis presents an account of a few short-sellers out of about 20 who were completely short the market. I will not go into details about the short-sellers since all the other reviewers mention them. I will say, however, what's most notable is who Lewis generally left out: John Paulson. After all, he was the biggest short-seller of them all. He made the \\"greatest trade ever\\" by buying up CDS's, an insane multi-billion dollar profit.    Paulson, however, was still a typical Wall Street actor. He happened to see the crisis coming, but he also bet on it in a typical Wall Street way. Unlike Burry, who used his investment letters to say everybody else was stupid, Paulson sold his fund as merely a hedge on extreme movements in the housing market. Many investors who may not have bought the certainty of doomsday did put money for insurance against doomsday. Lewis realized his Wall Street demeanor made Paulson uninteresting and consequently Lewis dedicates only a few pages to him.    And it's a good thing he did because the short-sellers, Burry, Cornwall Capital and Eisman, all make for fascinating characters and fascinating stories. In a field of dry business writers, Lewis is the one true story-teller. He breaks up monotony about the structuring of CDO's with more and more fascinating antidotes. He does a great service for presenting the truth about the financial crisis in a form people uninterested in finance can appreciate.    The only reason I am giving 4 stars is his Epilogue and the lack of good prescriptions past blaming investment banks going public. To a certain extent, the argument does make a good bit of sense. Before the banks went public, only financially sophisticated partners made decisions.After going public, shareholders pressured the bank CEO's to do anything necessary to increase profits. Furthermore, the banks had huge incentives to make their balance sheet and accounting as opaque as possible. The shareholders just were not sophisticated enough to dig through the balance sheet and realize that they were really invested in an extremely leveraged hedge fund filled with the most opaque OTC assets. After layer upon layer upon layer of obfuscation of the banks' assets as well as its counterparty risks, the CEO's took the easy way out and focused on paper profits above everything else.    That said, I do not find the partnership argument wholly convincing. It seems like Lewis is using the argument to somehow vindicate bankers. Even after all his crazy antidotes about how bankers had no clue what they were buying and selling, the argument somehow says \\"the finance people were in fact smart, but the shareholders made them do it.\\" For one thing, going public was not just to get a big payday for partners, although that was a big part of it. Banks were also going into more capital-intensive businesses. After computers really hit finance in the 80's, banks had to find a source of capital to buy all their computerized trading desks, data centers, etc. If Salomon Brothers did not go public, another bank eventually would have. Also, not enough people mention the SEC ending commission minimums in the 70's. For whatever reason, the SEC used to mandate minimum commissions and the banks basically earned very easy money from executing stock trades for institutional investors. When the commissions ended, the banks traditional market-making business had become very commoditized. To keep making decent money, the banks had to create more and more exotic instruments with higher transaction costs and find a way to sell them. If Salomon didn't create the MBS market, with the ensuing CDO market, somebody would have eventually just to earn the higher transaction costs.    The real answer is that some sort of reregulation is needed just like we had with the FDIC and the SEC starting in the 30's. People often respond to this suggestion by saying regulators were sleeping at the switch and regulation caused part of the reason the crisis happened in the first place (especially Basel II risk-weighting of AAA tranches, which I won't get into here). This argument against regulation does not mention that regulation and regulators became very intertwined during the Reagan, Clinton and the two Bush administrations. Neither side had a real incentive to actually limit the activity of banks. The institutions who bought fixed-income instruments also didn't have a real political constituency like the retail stockholders of Enron and Worldcom. There was no political reason to make the fixed income market more transparent. With no political pressure and cushy finance jobs awaiting them, the regulators quickly became \\"partners\\" with the banks rather adversaries and past some SEC pressure for SOX compliance, there was very little if any regulation.    With the lack of regulation, the banks became more like the banks of the 1920's. Sure, there was FDIC insurance, but retail deposits up to $250,000 were chump-change compared to the various deposit-like instruments for institutions in the shadow banking sector. The opaque repo market basically functioned as a retail deposit for those wanting to park 100's of millions of dollars. Before the crisis, a bank's word was considered as good as the Treasury's. Instead of keeping their short-term money in cash, Pension funds could park the money with a bank in the Repo market and earn a bit of interest. Same story in the Money Market, which funneled funds through the Commercial Paper market. Both Repo and Commercial Paper had to be rolled over frequently, which was also part of their great appeal to Institutions. They could forgo most interest rate and couterparty risk by getting 100 cents on the dollar in a month rather than years. The banks liked this short-term funding too because it was cheap. Borrowing short and lending long is a pretty good gig if you can get it.    Another short-term financing component were OTC options. I still do not know how exactly banks put the CDS liabilities to Burry, Paulson and others on their balance sheets. Did the CDS payments just count as pure income and retained earnings? Maybe I'll find out one day. In any case, opaque OTC options had an inherent short-term liability in them waiting to explode if the bank bet wrongly. In the worst days of the crisis, all the banks' short-term financing dried up completely and margin calls went through the roof. With 1929-style regulation, it should be no surprise that there was a 1929-style bank run in the shadow sector. It isn't dumb bankers, dumb Germans, dumb stockholders, big bonuses, etc. behind the crisis, it's the lack of FDIC-style regulation and insurance for the short-term financing in the shadow sector.    I would also guess that 1 out of 10 people who started reading this review are still reading. If you're still reading, then I sincerely appreciate it. It also shows why my argument has not gotten a lot of airtime. The deposits in the shadow-banking sector don't make for great political speeches or even great books, but it's the argument that makes the most sense to me. Without drastically regulating the shadow banking sector like the retail banking sector was regulated in the 30's, we will be doomed to repeat the crisis. Before the Great Depression, a banking panic happened about once a generation. Bankers remember, control risk for a time and then the next generation of bankers bets other people's money again, causing another panic. Before the Panic of 1929, we had the Panics of 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893 and 1907. In the era of post-1980 deregulation, we have now had the Panic of 2008. Sadly I do not think Dodd-Frank goes far enough and it probably won't be our last.

B0052P5DIC|4.0|This 5-CD set, presently available in the U.S.A. (as of early July 2011) only direct from Sony Music, combines the 3 \\"Return to Forever\\" Columbia albums \\"Romantic Warrior\\", \\"Musicmagic\\" & \\"Return to Forever-Live\\", all newly remastered and sounding great. It is also notable, that for the first time ever \\"Return to Forever-Live\\" is being presented complete(as on the original 1978 4-L.P. set) as a 3-CD set, as opposed to the edited 2-CD version previously offered. On the 2-CD edited version, \\"The Musician\\" and \\"So Long Mickey Mouse\\" had been edited to half their original length. While the booklet included in this CD box set boasts that it reproduces the booklet from the original 4-L.P. box set, unfortunately it reproduces that booklet in black & white instead of the original color. I think that Sony Music could have afforded the color ink for a $50 box set.                           I should also advise you, that immediately on obtaining this box set, you should store the 3 discs from \\"Return to Forever-Live\\" in regular slim cases or jewel box, or if you can obtain them, anti-static inner sleeves(which I obtain from Japan). For some reason(though it is not an issue for the cardboard album cover replica sleeves for \\"Romantic Warrior\\" & \\"Musicmagic\\", the 3-panel sleeve for \\"Return to Forever-Live\\" has been made from a paper stock which will rapidly scratch the discs. Suffice to say that after removing and reinserting the discs from the packaging a mere 4 times, two of the discs(originally in perfect condition) are now quite visibly scratched(though still playable). I am now storing them in Japanese anti-static inner sleeves, and not reinserting them into Sony's packaging. Some day, I'll send the two discs out to a resurfacing company. Those of us who are collectors care about getting the discs in good condition. Sony & Universal are the worst offenders in creating packaging which damages the discs(for example, I had to send all of the CD & DVD discs from Sony's CD/DVD/L.P. \\"Miles Davis-Kind of Blue\\" set to a disc resurfacing company).                          As for the music in this Return to Forever set, \\"Romantic Warrior\\" features the Corea/Clarke/Dimeola/White line up, and is a dramatic improvement over the group's disappointing final Polydor album \\"No Mystery\\". \\"Musicmagic\\" debuts a new line-up where Chick Corea & Stanley Clarke are joined by Sax/flute player Joe Farrell, a new drummer, a large horn section and singer/keyboardist Gayle Moran(Stanley Clarke does some singing too). This group is  guitar-less and less frenetic than the previous group, and it seemlessly blends acoustic and electric passages. There's some brilliant composing and playing, but Gayle Moran's voice(which did not find unanimous acceptance from Chick Corea's fans) is the least appealing aspect of the group's sound. To put it mildly, she's not in the same league as original Return to Forever singer Flora Purim. The set on \\"Return to Forever-Live\\" is based around the \\"Musicmagic\\" material(in very extended versions) plus some solo showcases for Chick & Stanley, and a few jazz standards.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Charming graphics, and very clever puzzles. All the puzzles require some thinking and are very satisfying when you figure them out. Unlike Angry Birds, once you figure out the solution, you can execute it easily without relying on luck and having to try multiple times. The size of the levels is ideal for a phone game. You can play for five minutes and still make progress.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|Typically my experience isn't that far off from the Amazon reviewer consensus, but I can't believe all the negative reviews for this album.  I looked it up expecting it to be a consensus five star pick.    There is not a bad song on here.  One (Lisbon, OH) is sort of a transition into another song, and Hinnom, TX is just OK, mostly because I'm not a huge fan of Vernon's screechy, Bee Gee voice mode (e.g. The Wolves, Babys), but even that's not a bad change of pace and segues nicely into the next song.    At its best it's great.  Holocene, Michicant and Wash. are all beautiful songs that could have been off Forever Ago.  Vernon takes a bit of a different direction in other places, but I think he did a great job of putting out an album that's clearly Bon Iver without putting out the exact same thing as before.    If you're on the fence, get it; you won't regret it.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|In aspect of the game content, it is good and fun. That's the reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1. However, PopCap screwed very hard in this implementation. This is the worst migration of app from iOS to Android ever.<br /><br />First, PopCap didn't understand Android application's state. Every time when go back to the game after it lose focus, no matter how trivial it is, such as a notification popup, or the screen when auto off, the game will have to go through a significant loading process, which will take up to 10+ seconds. This kind of loading should only happen when the application is loaded for the first time or from inactive process. Why would any application ever need to spend 10s to load the state after it screen turned off and turn back on? It seems They were so confused it with iOS's application, which does not quite allow real multi-tasking, or for other unknown reasons? But whatever the reasons are, it is unreasonable, and this behavior is so annoying.<br /><br />Second, the game uses unreasonable amount of space for data. In my Nexus One, it has 15M+ of data, which is bigger than the size any of application I installed in my phone's memory. The game itself has already be put into SD, that 15MB is just \\"data\\". This amount of space is so important to me, as N1 only have 200+ MB phone memory for application install, and I usually have only 10~20MB free. With this game installed, my phone often end up with insufficient store space.<br /><br />This would have been a great game. However, PopCap simply killed it with their careless implementation of this Android version. I am very disappointed, after all this long wait for the Android version of this game.

It has wonderful humor. We first started watching this on Netflix...I went straight to Amazon and purchased both the series and the final movie, Serenity. Best buck for entertainment to be found. I recommend this for anyone who loves action, humor, a touch of the romance, all wrapped up in a top rate story line.
B001DWNUCO|1.0|Clearly, this 1979 extravaganza is the worst film I have ever seen.  It's the brainchild of Robert Guccione, publisher of Penthouse Magazine who produced two versions of the film - one 90 minute version for most audiences and a 160 minute version which is pure hardcore porn.  I saw the 90-minute version which was porn enough for me.<br /><br />Loosely based on the life of the Roman Emperor Caligula, with a cast of hundreds, the plot shows Caligula, played by Malcolm McDowell as the mentally deranged emperor in an incestuous relationship with his sister.  There's an excruciating death scene with former emperor Tiberious and then the film goes downhill from there.  Against a background of hundreds of nude females, the new emperor goes about his merry way, implementing the most gruesome tortures just for the pleasure of it.  Even when it wasn't supposed to be torture, there is a public birthing scene that made me cringe in horror.<br /><br />The cast did the best they could, with Malcolm McDowell certainly looking mentally unbalanced, but I couldn't help feeling disgusted throughout and feeling somewhat dirty after the film was over.  There is no way I could possibly recommend it to anyone.  Stay away from this film.  It is not just simply awful, it will leave you with a feeling of lingering revulsion.

B002T9H2LK|5.0|Inglourious Basterds is a cinematic masterpiece, as well as an expectation defying, genre shredding, throwback of a beast of a film that revels in not giving two shakes of a bloody bat what you think.  That's precisely what's so invigorating and thrilling about the experience of watching it.  Like many of Tarantino's films, one ends up feeling more of a participant as opposed to merely a spectator.  Things open quietly and horrifically with one of the most understated and thoroughly evil opening flourishes ever attempted to set up a ride as wild as this... and it works almost too well.  Christoph Waltz is an actor I was totally unfamiliar with before viewing this film.  By the end of the first scene I wanted to jump through the screen and wring his smarmy neck.  His performance only grows stronger through the entire production.  While some may balk at the leisurely pace taken, it not only serves to ratchet up tension for the first act, but really sets up this character for the events in the third act nicely.<br /><br />Waltz is the jewel of this production.  However the ensemble cast around him with Brad Pitt leading the way is not only excellent but littered with Tarantino staples, i.e. a retired actor making a triumphant return, stunt casting extraordinaire and gorgeous women who wouldn't know a second fiddle if it bit them on their torpedo brassieres.  Pitt especially, is brutally effective in an unrestrained performance that works great as a foil for the cool, collected sinister moves of Waltz's character.<br /><br />Besides the great acting though, what really makes Basterds shine are the ideas embodied and the indeed glorious set pieces that provide perfect stages for Tarantino's tense, interlocking morality yarns.  The highlight for me was not the much ballyhooed ending, but rather the tavern scene.  To me this scene is not just the greatest in this film but one of the greatest in film, in quite a while.  Tarantino's love of movie history really shows here, but also his mastery of dialogue, invective, foreshadowing, wordplay and ability to always SHOW rather than TELL, even while a complex conversation is in the offing.  It is a thrilling scene to watch and is a nutshell version of why the whole movie works, despite its own (at times) maniacal fearlessness.  Without the tavern scene, I can't imagine Basterds being as cohesive or affecting overall.<br /><br />In the same way the deliberate pacing of the opening scene could put some off, I can see how the occasional insistence on tapping the brakes could frustrate fans of more traditional fare, as well.  As noted there are not a lot of concessions made to the viewer, but this to me comes off more as respect than lack of fan service.  You will never feel spoon fed while watching Inglourious Basterds but you might at times feel like you want to stop and digest a bit.  To paraphrase, you can digest when you're dead.  Tarantino always has a fresh spoonful of creme ready for your strudel, no matter how you take it.  With a film like this you might need a little extra willing suspension of disbelief but if you do give yourself over to it, the ride can be unforgettable.<br /><br />The DVD itself has a lot of great special features that fans of the film will enjoy.  I would have loved a commentary, but the roundtable discussion fills in some of that information.  Being able to see the film within a film was a nice touch too.<br /><br />Lastly, it seems that some people take exception with the barbarous acts of unremitting violence perpetrated against fictional Nazis herein.  I would just like to say that you're being quite silly.  Are you afraid that anti Nazi violence in the world will spiral out of control?  It would be laughable if it, well... weren't.  The only entity in the world that engenders rage towards fascism of all flavors, is fascism itself.  Fictional representations of revenge are many times the closest victims can get to exacting the payback they have in their hearts.  If you feel that the violence portrayed here against the SS rank and file is \\"over the top\\" then check again.  Dachau was \\"over the top.\\"  Himmler was a REAL freak off the leash so cry me a Rhine.  The swastika has a target on it forever now and that's just as it should be.

B003FSTN52|5.0|When I first read about \\"the Good Wife\\" (it was up for some awards -- Golden Globe, or Emmy), I thought it sounded like a bad mix of some rather old forumlas: the lawyer show, and the show about politics.  Then I decided to pick up a copy of the first season at a local store.  Holy gadzoley, betty spagehtti!  I'm late to the game, but happy to be here! (And I've been telling folks about this show ever since finishing the First Season DVD set).<br /><br />I can _truly_ say I haven't been blown away by many TV shows upon first watching them.  Shows as varied as \\"Felicity\\", \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Wonderfalls\\", \\"Once and Again\\", \\"Firefly\\", \\"Dexter\\", \\"Trueblood\\" and \\"The Wire\\", caught and held my attention because of the quality of the writing (And with two exceptions, I discovered them all on DVD).  \\"The Good Wife\\" is jam-packed with excellent writing (here's hoping that continues into season 2 -- I'm waiting for the DVDs).  But as with those other shows mentioned, this show also has a great cast of actors: Marguiles, North and Panjabi -- excellent actors all -- lead a cast that does justice (no pun intended) to the terrific scripts they are given (the quality _does_ range, but it never goes below very good, and usually veers closer to excellent).  Not all the cases end up with a feel good, happy ending type denoument, nor do the relationships all go smoothly -- as it should be.  What's more, not even the title character is a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" -- merely complex, merely human, capable of both.<br /><br />Like the aforementioned shows, \\"The Good Wife\\" is a series so high in quality, I've bought it on DVD so I can rewatch from time to time.  It's highly recommended to anyone wanting to watch the best of what TV can offer these days (instead useless junk like \\"reality\\" TV, or mindless sitcoms).

B004N66XYE|2.0|As an avid fan of the original Upstairs Downstairs series, I was interested to see how this new miniseries would continue the story.  As most of the main characters of the original series are either dead or are now too old to continue in their roles, this would have been quite a challenge.  The only member of the original cast was Jean Marsh who played Rose Buck.  Eileen Atkins, a co-creator of the original series with Marsh, has a major part in the series as the Dowager Countess.  There is no other continuation of the original story other than the musical score and some schmaltzy mementos such as Hudson's key tag that cause Rose to smile wistfully in fond remembrance.  The characters are rather one dimensional and not particularly convincing.  The script lacked finesse and subtlety.  The set design was lavish but this did not make up for the banality of the script which seemed to be based on Barbara Cartland style pot boilers.  Some of the story lines could have been very interesting such as the flirtation by the English upper classes with fascism but these were never fully developed.  It is watchable but only just.  The reference to Upstairs Downstairs is rather misleading as it bears little relation to the original series.

B00069FLC2|5.0|This Eagle Rock Entertainment release features 1960's British pop music icons, The Shadows in a 2004 performance at the Cardiff Indoor Arena, in England, in what was then billed their `farewell tour'.  The production does a fine job of presenting the band live, and conveys the joyful attitude that these consummate professionals bring to the stage.  The tour-de-force performance is a very comprehensive representation of The Shadows career, that probably includes many fans' favorites, as the forty two song set stretches to just over 134 minutes, and includes material spanning their near five decade long musical career.<br /><br />As the backing band for singer Cliff Richard, Cliff Richard and The Shadows were one of the pioneering pop acts in the late 50's and early 60's, predating The Beatles, and the British Invasion.  In 1960, The Shadows scored their first solo success with the instrumental Apache, the first of several Number 1 hits, paving the way for their primarily instrumental based career.  The `Farewell Tour' features founding members Hank Marvin on lead guitar, and Bruce Welch playing rhythm guitar.  Brian Bennett, who joined the group in the early 60's, is on drums.  Mark Griffiths plays bass guitar, and Cliff Hall is on keyboards.<br /><br />This performance is like a fine wine, opening with a taste of the familiar Apache, and then flowing ultra-smoothly on an extended journey down memory lane, engendering plenty of warm feelings, good spirits, and nostalgic memories for long-time fans.  Listening to The Shadows, it's almost impossible for your spirits not to be uplifted.  Marvin and Welch share the vocal duties, and address the very appreciative crowd, which has a younger demographic than you might expect.  Nicely edited, the solid camerawork provides coverage of some very classy musicians, who clearly love being onstage.<br /><br />Topping off the package, is a wonderful hour long feature `The Final Tour Interview', which includes conversations with Bruce Welch, Hank Marvin, and Brian Bennett.  Discussed are the genesis and history of the group, and their decades long musical career, along with interview clips of Cliff Richard, and Brian May of Queen.  The Shadows seem to be perfect gentlemen, humble about their achievements, and appreciative of their considerable success.  This DVD is absolutely a must have, for any serious fan of band, and also highly recommend to those that appreciate 60's style surf rock instrumentals, or British pop music from the decade.ce Welch, Hank Marvin, and Brian Bennett.

B004Q7E0TA|2.0|While I sympathize with the author's pain during her illness, and am happy for her recovery, as a book, it doesn't work.  There was a way to write this book without it being a literal transcript of her stream of consciousness during the time of her extreme anorexia.  There is no distance, and frankly, the key part of the disease is boring, repetitive self-demeaning thought patterns.  It is a total obsession with the self.  A little of that would make the point, and she still could have given us a book, more on her childhood and co-workers, did she go to acting class, why did she act, at least retrospective insight into others, her self-acceptance of her sexuality, and if this is about an illness, I want to know about her recovery.      When people sit in church basements and tell their stories, the best stories are those that give time to what it was like, what happened to change it, how you recovered, and what it's like now.  I don't know what the eating disorder equivalent would be, but in AA this would be called a \\"drunkalog.\\"  The thing is, that interviews with DiRossi show a charming, funny, very bright, insightful woman.  I wish the writing showed that side of her. Or any side of anyone else besides her.
B004V2S4SS|2.0|I'm not sure what happened here, I can't quite believe it and it saddens me to break it to those viewers who have loyally followed and derived enjoyment from this series as I have during its run, but the final seventh outing of this superb show ends on a deeply disappointing and deflating note.    To preface, I learned that season seven would be the final season after I finished viewing season six and was surprised to say the least, especially so since in my opinion there had been no decline in either the consistency or inventiveness displayed by the writers (notably Glenn Gordon Caron) throughout the previous six seasons. The idea that the network executives/producers of the show had decided to end the series on a high-note seemed premature, but perhaps laudable (considering how many television series out-stay their welcome to some degree). This is in spite of the fact that I personally hadn't observed any signs that this brilliant show was growing stale. But whether that decision was correct remains debatable, all I do know is that the final seventh season does little justice to the quality of the series as a whole.    Firstly, there will be disappointment for many with the thirteen-episode format (the fewest number since season four's sixteen). But as an avid viewer of `Medium' from the very beginning I clung to the hope that the potential for this (admittedly truncated) season given the wealth of material developed in the lives of the Dubois family in previous seasons would be fulfilled. There was so much possibility to pick up old story-threads and re-visit memorable characters from previous seasons, but the only storyline that's continued here in the final season is that of Joe's mother.     The majority of the seventh season is comprised of those episodes with the familiar formula that `Medium' has always executed so well, which is the contained, stand-alone murder investigations that often result in the capture/untimely death of the obligatory male offenderwith a unique motive and/or peculiar fetish. I suppose I can't complain that so many of these episodes in the final season take advantage of that formula which has proved so successful for the series in the past, I only wish that more episodes had centered on/explored the family lives of the members of the Dubois household.     ...Mild Spoilers...     In the episode previously mentioned involving Joe's mother, entitled `Blood On The Tracks' (episode 10) there is an allusion by one of the characters that there are dark days ahead for Alison, as a result of which I expected a satisfying build-up to a gripping climax. Instead there is an episode involving Alison's brother, played by David Arquette- who please correct me if I'm wrong has never appeared in the series before- which consequently seemed to lack continuity, followed by a stand-alone murder investigation episode and ending with a time-travel episode that simply left me cold...     Episode 13- `Me Without You', the final episode of this series beloved by some many for its warmth and intrigue for six years is badly and unsatisfyingly constructed. It makes a mockery of all those storylines from previous seasons in which Alison travelled back and forth through time, learning new truths about herself and her loved ones as she made her journey. The best way for me to articulate my dissatisfaction with this episode is that I imagine the creator and writers began with the germ of an idea as to the note upon which they wanted this series to end, but the way in which they went about it tramples uncaringly on the lives of the main characters. The final scene is exactly how (knowing the characters of Alison and Joe as we all imagine we do) you would want this show to end, but it leaves a very bitter taste knowing how they and their loved ones arrived at that point.     Alison and Joe deserved a true happy ending. Perhaps it depends on your perspective whether they got one, but their daughters certainly didn't and therefore, for me, the ending just didn't ring true.
0439813786|5.0|This book is 553page long, complete with a hard-cover. It may sound IMPOSSIBLE to read it in a day, but it is not. Some of us here may do the same thing as I do when you get a new book to read. Flip a few pages, and decide if you will be having a fun time reading it, or not. This book, if you flip a few pages, you will understand immediately why I said it was possible to read this book in one day: half of the book is in drawings. Furthermore, the real story is fun and easy to understand. At first, I read this on my dad's advice (?), but now I read this on my own will.<br />The main character is a boy, who lost his parent. He was taken by his uncle to take care of stationary clocks. Even in his life of rudeness, he continued his work through his goal: fix the automaton. Since he had no parts, he stole it from the toy shop of Georges Me`lie`s (he did not know it then). Afterwards, he get caught by Georges Me`lie`s, and works in his toyshop to get his father's notebook back.<br />The end of the story is: Hugo Cabret becomes friends with Isabelle, the god-daughter of Georges Me`lie`s. the old man opens his hearts and they become great friends afterwards.<br />I think it is a good book. I mean, the pictures are perfect, the stories are perfect, and the harmony of them is the most perfect one still.

B0006AAS5G|3.0|I bought this watch after a previous watch, which was another homage to the Rolex Daytona, quit working.  I'm sure that, unlike the mechanical movement of my previous watch, this watch will last reliably.  Unfortunately, when comparing the looks of the two, the Invicta falls far short.  In the pictures, it looks just like a Daytona with a fancy textured dial rather than the plain white dial of the Daytona.  Unfortunately, in person, the numerous other differences become glaringly apparent.  Regrettably, every change that Invicta has made on the Daytona's looks are to make it more chunky, clumsy and vulgar. I'm not a huge fan of the attention-seeking texture on the dial, but I can live with it compared to the case aesthetics.  The black engraved border of the non-functional tachymeter bevel ruins the elegance of the original's, and the case towards the top and bottom replaces the tapered and convex shape of the original's with a fat, chunky block of stainless steel. Pull up a picture of the original and you'll see what I mean.  The worst part of the case, however, is the giant engraved \\"INVICTA\\" that spans the left side of the watch, an ostentatious addition that really spoils the classic look of the Daytona.<br />Like others have mentioned, the packaging is excellent, and the watch seems high quality, but if you know what a Daytona really looks like, you're going to be pretty disappointed.  I know I was certainly disappointed, but after transplanting the movement of this watch into my broken watch's case, I have a solid and attractive watch, so I can't complain.
B001I0T92Q|4.0|I find that this memory card adapter is quite handy considering I normally us just micro SD cards, it's great because I had recently bought a PSP and didn't want to by memory sticks which generally cost more than SDs, and it's nice being able to use my old micro SD cards.
B0043D2L9S|5.0|I had tried the utility belt without this harness, but the belt wouldn't stay up.  This harness fixed that problem for me 100%.  I no longer think about holding my gear, only taking great pictures!
B004EPYZU8|1.0|That was the question I had after watching the film...After the promise of 300 and the effects heavy, soulless adaptation of the Watchmen - and now this...I'm beginning to wonder if Hollywood is the one being sucker punched.  Sure the effects are great, but the fact that one remains unmoved and disengaged in the process of the film is BAD NEWS.  Vapid just about sums it up.  Abbie Cornish is great though.  Sucker Punch had the potential - but it just makes me wonder whether Mr Snyder can really make a good movie, or if he needs help in the scriptwriting department.  Probably both!!  Avoid this like the plague...
1594202710|5.0|Spectacular book! I've read dozens of books on China since my first trip there in 1978; this is book is enlightened. Kissinger does not focus on the terrible price the Chinese have paid for their world position, but rather on the extraordinary efforts made by the Chinese leadership to get there in the Chinese way. It is a remarkable story of improving the lives of more people than any political effort in my lifetime.     My wife grew up in Guangxi during the Cultural Revolution. The insights in this book even provide insights into Lao Po's sometimes unusual behavior rooted in her time away from her parents who were assigned to re-training in the rural farms then.     Highly recommended.
1558908846|3.0|This should have been awesome. Instead the poor script, over the top comic relief and cheesiness of Dredd spoiled the film for me. The music was pretty good, fantastic cast and pretty decent props and costume. I think it is better than a lot of people give it credit. It does need a new transfer though, my DVD is shocking! The worst quality DVD I own. Grain, noise and not even anamorphic. Old school transfer.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|This is probably Trowers best effort to date and really has stood the test of time. Not to say that after this album he's albums aren't good (because they are). It's just as an album - they songs are really good and flow well. And with extra live BBC tracks on here, if you're upgrading from vinyl or cassette (like I did), it's highly worth getting. I think everyone should have a copy of this in their catelgue
B000A2UBN4|1.0|This film goes in my top 5 most disliked films. The acting and music are awful all the way through. This is the film I use to measure the badness of others! Spare yourself!
B000MKXEME|5.0|I first watched this on video back in the 80's as a teenager. It was the thing to do, few mates around - watch scary movies. I still watch it to this day - you can't keep a good film down.    There was a lot of so called B grade films around the late 70's early 80's. B grade back then ment it wasn't done buy a major studio. These days B grade refers more to the shoddy acting. Thankfully - there came all sorts of new thinking and directors that went away from the traditional stories.    This on one great example. A few directors were into HP Lovecraft's stories at the time (still are) and bringing them to life on the screen. Not only does this have some great slice and dice but if funny as hell! Jeffrey Combs is so straight faced but the lines coming out of his mouth and actions - really funny for the most part.     To me, this typifies what great 80's horror was all about - good slice and dice and tongue in cheek, much like Tales of the Crypt. All the Reanimator movies are a must have - also check out Evil Dead and Phantasm.
0307463745|5.0|Very well written book, unless someone tears you away from it, it won't be easy putting it down without finishing it.     A book that never gets old and with some crazy insights.
B00382X4X2|5.0|Out of any Black Sabbath period - personally I find the writing, music styling and Dio's vocals to be the best Sabbath period. I like the older stuff, but lyrically I find Heaven and Hell + Mob Rules to have the strongest material on them. Not to mention some of most blistering guitar playing you'll hear.    I won't go into the songs in detail - I'm sure others have already done that. Personal favorites are Turn Up The Night, Mob Rules, Country Girl and Falling Of The Edge Of The World (I love the riff in here - great to get those fingers on the guitar moving).     What I will talk about is the extra tracks. If you already own this CD - get rid of it and get this one (unless you already own Hammersmith Odeon). The first CD has a couple of extra tracks. This is worth it because of the second CD live at the Hammersmith Odeon.     I was never a big fan of Live Evil - too overblown and undermixed. And Dio did sound a bit full of himself (even for me). This live CD however is better in my opinion to Live Evil with some great songs on it. The mixing is great - almost like you're there when you crank it.    The deluxe edition is the way to go. Probably the best deluxe edition in the Sabbath range as far as value and alt songs.
034552554X|5.0|This book tells the tale of a woman- raised as a foster child- who ends up back where she started.  This is a beautiful book of trial, mistakes, regret, and reconciliation.  It is a book of love- not a romantic fairy tale, but hard, yet unconditional, love.  At times I wanted to shake the main character, at other times I cried with her, but I always found myself hoping that she find herself, and a solid future.    Beautifully written; full of interesting flower tidbits.  Loved it!
B00009RAJI|5.0|This is a classic album - so the program says. I wont go into the details of each song - others have already done that. There's a reason why its a classic album - the songs are timeless and don't sound dated. Each song is a hit on this album.    I actually upgraded from a vinyl copy so wanted it on CD. This one has an extra disc of bonus tracks with it - highly worth getting for the price. If you only have one Fleetwood Mac CD in the collection - this should be it.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This was a great hit as a companion piece to a 'huge' crane - both birthday gifts for a 4 year old budding construction engineer, architect, heavy equipment operator...  He's really quite imaginative in his play with it, and what 4 yo kid DOESN'T need a dump truck?  This is a good one; his parents enjoy the working details - doors, outside 'mirrors', et al.
B000000OYQ|4.0|I first got this on vinyl in the 90's second hand. Still trying to find my musical taste so to speak, but always liked Led Zeppelin, Sabbath, Purple. This is not a Led Zeppelin album!    What it is - is a diverse mix of where Page came from and where he was heading - with a few throw backs to the blues which he loves - me too! It's also not like the Coverdale/page CD he does years later.    I still play a few licks off this album on guitar which I ripped off and incorporated into my style years back - almost a how to play blues CD!    There's a couple of songs that are so so, but for the most part I really enjoy the album. I hadn't listened to it for about 10 years until I got the new CD and was blown away again by how strong the songs and playing are.    Personal favs are Wasting my Time, The Only One (With Robert Plant), Liquid Mercury and Prison Blues. Think of Knebworth with Plant/Page - thats a bit what this sounds like.
0553584537|3.0|\\"Alone\\" kept me guessing about Catherine Gagnon--Is she an abuse victim or a murderer with Munchausen by proxy?--until the the very end, when a final plot twist left my scratching my head and flipping back through the book trying to sort out the timeline of events. The protagonist, Bobby Dodd, makes one bad decision after another as he struggles with the aftermath of killing Catherine's husband in a police standoff. His self-destructive behavior is frustrating but believable, given what we learn about his character. The Good-Will-Hunting moment he has with a therapist is much less believable--this guy would probably need to be in therapy for years, not weeks. The climatic scene is also clunky; a minor character offers a lengthy expository monologue as a couple of other characters deal with the bad guy.<br /><br />This was my third and least favorite book by Lisa Gardner; I preferred \\"The Perfect Husband\\" and \\"The Neighbor.\\" Her books are so exciting, I've already got a few others loaded in my ereader.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I had mixed emotions before buying this book  Loved Tina on SNL but disliked her forever Bush bashing. that being said after reading an exerpt about her  prayer for her daughter I decided was worth a try!! I was not disappointed, she is smart, funny, beautiful and unlike some celebrity memoirs makes you realize she faces the same struggles we all do!!!  I fell in love with her all over again!! Her spot on Sarah Palin always cracked me up and was intrigued at the backstory behind iit all!! Great light read!!!
B004AYCWZI|1.0|You may discount my review because I didn't finish the book but there are too many books in the world to waste time on one you're not enjoying ( I did make it through 95 pages which is more than the one third that I allow if I am rethinking finishing it).  I didn't care about the story's journey much less the ending, I did not \\"smell\\" the food as I was reading nor did I care to, the characters are shallow and undeveloped and who talks like that...\\"What you like to eat\\", \\"Who he?\\", \\"Brand new ting. For you, Bappu, we make kilo cheap.\\"... seriously, is this supposed to evoke an Indian accent?  And let's not forget the gratuitous grossness; I won't quote anything here but I did find some passages that completely ruined my appetite not inspiring it as claimed.  I believed the reviews on the book jacket, supported by one I read on a blog, and I wonder if they read the same book.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I started reading The Art of Racing in the Rain after my wife cried her way through the entire book. She insisted i would enjoy it, though I was highly doubtful. I finished my current read and decided to give it a quick try. I read the first half of the book before I managed to put it down. I read the second half the next night, refusing to quit even though it was terribly late. I cried.<br /><br />Last year I read How to Teach Physics to Your Dog and though the subject matter of the book was great and the writing style was very approachable, the dog was downright annoying. I was afraid that would be this case with this book. I was wrong, very, very wrong.<br /><br />Enzo is a mutt and your narrator through this amazing story. Right from the start the author tells you exactly what is going to happen and it just doesn't matter. It isn't what happens, but how you arrive at the end that pulls you along. The dog's narrative style is full of insight and astonishing humor.<br /><br />The scene with the murder of crows was amazing, not only because of the story it told, but how the author weaved it back in later in the book, evoking the darkness and anger with a simple word: murder.<br /><br />As I read through the book I couldn't help but nod my head and look at my own dog. I knew he was thinking these things. I knew he was deliberately being a pain and here was the proof right from a dogs mouth.

1433228149|4.0|Warning: Use only as directed. And with caution.<br /><br />Written in 1969, Ubik is one of Philip K. Dick's most popular science fiction novels. It's set in a future 1992 where some humans have develop psi and anti-psi powers which they are willing to hire out to individuals or companies who want to spy (or block spying) on others. Also in this alternate 1992, if you've got the money, you can put your beloved recently-deceased relatives into \\"coldpac\\" where they can be stored in half-life and you can visit with them for years after their death.<br /><br />As Ubik begins, Glen Runciter, the head of one of New York City's top anti-psi organizations, discovers that all the operatives of the top psi organization (whose telepathic fields they like to keep track of) have disappeared. This means less work for Runciter's employees and he's concerned about how they're going to get paid. When Runicter's company is offered a big job on the moon, he figures they've found the missing telepaths and he's eager to hire out as many of his inactive inertials as he can, including the new one who has a strange and disturbing power: she can nullify events before they happen. But when Runciter's inertials get to the moon, disaster strikes, and when they return to Earth, they find that life is not how they left it. In fact, time seems to be going backward and something is killing them off one by one. The only thing that might help is Ubik -- a mysterious product in an aerosol spray can... If only they can find it!<br /><br />Ubik is a fast-paced SF thriller full of classic PKD themes such as an unreliable reality, time running backward, precognition, telepathy, paranoia, drug abuse, hallucinations, and spirituality. The story is quite funny in places and includes a bit of horror, too.<br /><br />There are several plot twists in Ubik, including a big one at the end, which means that the reader is as unsure about what's going on as the characters are until the big reveal and, still, there are some questions left unanswered. Mainly we're left contemplating what PKD is suggesting about death, salvation, and God. Ubik is one of those books where, at the end, you have to review the plot in light of your new knowledge just so you can try to put it all together.<br /><br />I listened to Blackstone Audio's version read by Anthony Heald. Heald successfully handles a rather large cast of alive and dead humans, not to mention the talking appliances and doors. Thanks to Heald's skills, Ubik on audio was thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />Ubik has been named by Time Magazine as one of the Top 100 English-Language Novels From 1923 (list compiled by Lev Grossman).

B00506NRBS|5.0|Over the years I have become wonderfully mesmerized by the unique business philisophy and life approach that Derek has been throwing onto the universe since his days at CD Baby. I have read most posts at his blog and this brief book is a way to start thinking of other ways to focus on your life goals. Once again, well done Mr. Sivers.
0143038583|1.0|I bought this book for one of my graduate school seminars I took entitled \\"Feeding the Future\\" as a part of our segment in looking at industrial agriculture.  I had never read any of Michael Pollan's books before, and actually did not know his stance on agriculture and food in our modern world.  Essentially I was completely oblivious to what this book would say, and after reading it, I will never read any of his other books.  Pollan's take on today's science in agriculture is so off track I was shocked by the number of people who believe his nonsense.  I couldn't help but notice the ever so convient interviews with those who share his opinion, especially in his chapters about corn.  Dredging up a farmer who is still using practices from the 70's and completely ignoring the other side of the argument (i.e. precision farming) leaves out an essential part of modern agriculture's story.  I couldn't help thinking as I read it, \\"If it doesn't work, than why do farmers even bother?!\\"  Obviously we have not lost any of our corn industry and will not in the future, so it must be working, and well.  Also, as a 5th year genetics Ph.D student, I beg those of you who want to learn about the science behind transgenic crops, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!  His serious lack of grasping even the most basic concepts of genetics will breed even more ignorance towards this technology.  Read [[ASIN:0195393570 Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food]] by husband and wife Pamela Ronald and Raoul Adamchak; she's a plant pathologist and he's an organic farmer.  It provides a wonderful explanation on transgenic crop science and organic farming, spun as a story.  I will never recommend \\"Omnivore's Dilemna\\", unless someone wants a good laugh.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I'm picky when it comes to music. My friend played \\"Little Lion Man\\" for me and was raving about M&S. At first, I was moderately impressed. After one or two listens, I purchased the album, and was blown away. I could probably count on one hand the number of albums on which I have liked every track. \\"Sigh No More\\" is one such album.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I had seen the series on TV every Sunday and got hooked.  This is a must see season 2 to carry the story line.  The characters are intense and the story line is quite an adventure.  I am just sorry that this is the last season for the story.  If you are a romantic at heart and are looking for a knight in shining armor on a quest against a dastardly villain . . . this season set is for you.
B0055OGQCW|1.0|Le Petit Prince / The Little Prince, is a real masterpiece of Antoine de Saint Exupery. As an avid lover of the Little Prince, I have collected this book in many languages and scripts. This edition, hovewer, is NOT RECOMMENDED. It is poorly edited, with significant bad translating (with Google Translator?), and bad composition. Please wait until another publisher publish another edition of The Little Prince.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Wow...what a stunning visual feast! I don't understand the prudes here who are bashing this most delicious film. I really don't. The only thing I can come up with is that these dissenters know nothing of the vicious world of ballet. I was like many a little girl who studied dance throughout my childhood up to the adolescent years. I rigorously practiced and loved loved loved 'point'. I had friends who auditioned for professional companies only to come back home in tears.  It is a most competitive field--it is where I learned all about Bulimia and Anorexia.     This is a real glimpse into that strange and dark world and the horror motif could not be more fitting.    The Barbara Hersey character--Natalie's mom--is perfect as the former artist who never made it. Therefore-she channels everything into her only child, daughter. This movie--although a bit twisted--is very much on target with its glimpse into the exclusive world of ballet.    Kudos to Mila as well as Natalie. Excellent film. But I feel you need to know about this world before re-coiling and writing it off.
B001EO748M|2.0|While the content of the DVDs was great, the condition I received them in was appalling. I could not even watch 2 episodes as the DVD is so badly scratched as to be unwatchable, the images were distorted, and the DVD stopped playing multiple times.
B000YD7S26|5.0|I watched this because like so many others, I love Bruckner's 8th.  And of course Karajan.  But I was only familiar with Te Deum by reputation.  Al I can say is that I do not have the eloquence to even begin to do this work, and this particular performance, any justice whatsoever.  Karajan is also very different stylistically in this chorale piece as compared to the symphonic works.  Just get this, and be awed.  If you are a Christian (Catholic or Protestant), the Te Deum will overwhelm you.
B000YY67GS|3.0|I know a lot of fans prefer \\"Rising\\" but if take away the 2 big tracks the rest of the album doesn't quite inspire me as much as this album does which is consistently great from start to finish.  I guess we shouldn't be surprised though when you have great musicians like Blackmore - guitars, Powell - drums, Dio - vocal chords and Daisley - bass playing all of whom are shoo-ins for any Metal Hall of Fame as simply masters of their chosen instruments.  This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version though is a little of a mixed bag as the mlps itself isn't designed and assembled that well as my copy isn't even aligned correctly when it was glued together and the sound quality is okay but not the best that I've ever heard.  Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />Not so great mlps design, okay sound quality but great content makes this release a mixed bag.<br /><br />Verdict: wait for a better mlps release perhaps in blu-spec with a better designed mlps.
B004SBX112|1.0|I just got a pop-up ad for McDonald's. This needs to be fixed. I accidentally clicked it and my phone froze.
B00092QTZ4|4.0|I know a lot of fans prefer \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and while I've heard that album as well I can't help but feel that \\"British Steel\\" is overall the better and definitely the more enjoyable album for me.  There is a more fun and dare I say it commercial element to many of the tracks here but if given a choice between the two I feel I'd much rather listen to this album for my occasional metal fix.  I like all the tracks a lot and not just the popular \\"Breaking the Law\\" and \\"Living After Midnight\\" as tracks like \\"Steeler\\", \\"Grinder\\" and \\"United\\" are also strong and overall this album has a nice flow about it.  Tipton and Downing may also be the most underrated guitarists in metal history as their pull off seemingly incredible riffs at such speed and flawless technique that as a guitarist myself is a joy to listen and aspire to.  This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version is a bit of a mixed bag as the mlps design itself isn't that well assembled but the sound quality is very good having been very well remastered.  Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />Great content, good sound quality but average mlps design makes this mlps release of a great Judas Priest album a bit of a mixed bag but overall I'd still recommend this release.
B002E2M3LG|4.0|The original recording of Innuendo was too long to be put to vinyl so when they did they had to edit down some songs. I wish that they had issued this on two 10 inch LPs so that the original recordings could be had on vinyl.<br />Aside from that it is one of Queen's finest releases. 4 stars only for this being edited, not for the music quality.
B004L3AQFG|4.0|Having read the book `Between a Rock and a Hard place' I knew what to expect from this film and with a few minor exceptions, it remains pretty close to the original source.<br /><br />This follows Aron Ralston who is an outdoorsman who enjoys canyoneering, skiing, mountain biking and other outdoor pursuits.  When out hiking one day he gets his hand trapped between a rock and a canyon wall and it is here his ordeal begins.  Over the coming days he tries to find ways to release himself whilst steadily becoming more dehydrated, weakened and with progressively more surreal hallucinations fogging his thoughts.  Finally he takes the drastic route of cutting his hand off to secure his freedom and ultimately his life.<br /><br />James Franco is very good as Ralston and he plays the role with just enough arrogance, balanced with his genuine humility to make you understand Ralston's character and root for him throughout.  Danny Boyle also directs this in an excellent way, that fully shows the claustrophobia, fear and dire circumstances of Ralston's situation.  The scene where Aron cuts his hand off his pretty gruesome, but it is thankfully short and fully necessary to appreciate just what he had to go through during his ordeal.<br /><br />This film kept me engrossed throughout, which is especially impressive considering I have read the book a few times and know the story well.  If you have yet to read the book I can highly recommend it.<br /><br />Overall this is a gripping and inspiring story about one man's tenacity, courage and will to survive.  It makes for harrowing viewing in places, but it is certainly deserving of the praise it gets and is well worth a viewing at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Just a quick remark to those negative reviewers, they are so obvious in their attempts they are not giving \\" Sucker Punch \\" a fair review, but rather they are just trying to bash it out of their own anger or own personal problems with the movie. could you guys cut it, it is so obvious and no one is going to believe that \\" sucker punch \\" is the worst movie ever made !!    people keep saying how bad the plot was, that there was no story ? what ??!!  i really can't see what is the problem with it ?   \\" An Abusive step father sends his step daughter into an asylum claiming she is crazy, more abuse at the asylum is inflicted on her, she escapes by dissociating from reality into a fantasy world \\", that is an interesting story as any !! what exactly do people want for a plot ?    Sure the plot does lack in certain areas, and might have left things unexplained, but it does not harm the movie or make it the worst thing ever made.  I also like the fact that they never tried to add silly or funny scenes to make it more light or soft and kept it being a dark movie, unlike the silly Transformers movies, that have stunning visuals but very forced and silly humor.      Characters are interesting, and the girls were introduced gradually into the plot with good character development.    People complaining that they could not see the Girl dancing during the transition, well, BOHOO !! go cry to your mommy !! do we really have to see what happens and how she dance, what are you expecting ? live with it.    the action scenes and the sound effect editing are superb. special effects were amazing and visually stunning !! I can't believe people say that this is the worst movie ever made with this kind of unique effects that are not commonly seen in movies.    I do believe that people have different opinions, and some poeple could have not liked Sucker Punch, but the huge attack it is getting is unfair and unjust. this can't be the wrost movie ever made !! even if the producers wanted it tobe, it can't be !    Unlike most negative reviewers here, i will admit that Sucker Punch is not the perfect movie, it is not the best out there, but it is very enjoyable and entertaining. it is worth 4 stars, but i will give 5 just to make things fair a little in here !!    I am buying the DVD, and i would recommend this to any one who did not see it, and it worth buying not just renting, because it has rewatchable qualities.

B0024FAR5M|3.0|Sons of Anarchy is an FX American television show about the eponymous outlaw biker gang that operates within the town of Charming. The Sons of Anarchy sell illegal firearms and make profit off of other dubious transactions, but at the same time they have a warped and violent sense of justice that they use to protect the town from outsiders and evildoers. The Sons are by no means villains or heroes, but they carefully tread the line between the two. Jax, the main character of the series, is the prodigy of Clay, the President of the club and stepfather. Jax has a son on the way, but the mother is a junkie. Things pick up from here as we get a story about waring biker gangs, the meaning of family, and how far the Sons will go to protect their town and get vengeance.    I myself am more partial to British television. To me there seems to be greater characterization and overall better quality. For evidence, I point to shows like Inbetweeners, Misfits, Sherlock, Doctor Who and so on. I sometimes watch American television but I am careful when doing so- there's a lot of good television like Frasier and The Walking Dead, but also a lot of really bad television, like the Cape and Spartacus. So when I began to watch Sons of Anarchy, I was cautious to put it kindly. The show came from a smaller studio not known for making classic television like HBO or AMC. Additionally, no one was involved that I knew from previous television shows. However, I took the chance as I was intrigued by the vigilante concept and the tagline- \\"let freedom ride\\". And after finishing the first series, I am glad that I gave it a chance.    In the beginning of series, the first, say, six episodes introduce us to the main characters and arguably the main story- the conflict between Jax's conscience and the doings of the club. The main hero is somewhat receptive to his father's writings. His father is dead but has left behind a manuscript for a novel outlining his original vision of the Sons of Anarchy, and how Clay has taken away from this vision and turned it into a violent miscreant organization. As we get further into the series, Clay's and Gemma's (Jax's mother) plans for the club as well as the actions of the other members begin to play on Jax's mind; meanwhile, the recover of his baby son from a 20% survival chance thanks to his mother's drug use also plays a huge part, and the weight of parenthood also begins to unsettle Jax. On the whole, we have an amazingly written main character who used to be able to do whatever he wanted; now his conscience is beginning to unnerve him and added responsibilities are taking their toll. On first glance, the character is incredibly simple. However, by the end of the series we see Jax transform wildly into a new character that I can't wait to see in the second season.    However, I do have some problems with the show. There are some elements of the show which put me on edge- the graphic violence at some points is a little too much (for example, the castration of a rapist) and there is a sense of family to the club that I find a little tedious. Every time the Sons meet, they call each other brother and hug. It's an intriguing concept that they have this much love and respect for each other, however, they simply do it too much to the point that you can predict how many times they do it in one episode. The sense of family also seems misplaced as they will kill each other over betrayal or something else. If they truly were family, there would be a capacity for forgiveness.    The acting is quite good. Charlie Hunnam, Katey Sagal, and Ron Perlman are perfect in their roles. The actor who plays Prospect is also quite good as well as his tentative girlfriend Cherry. However, the other actors are only good. They serve their roles well, but you don't really get the feeling that any of the acting is that brilliant. Only Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perlman are really memorable.    The music is also really good. Most of the music is hard rock akin to Foo Fighters but with a tad more Country and Western. Two scenes are quite memorable because of the music- one a bar shootout with Irish metal playing, and the climax when Jax is walking through a graveyard, mourning the death of his best-friend's wife and the current state of the club. Whoever put this soundtrack together did a perfect job.    The show rolls on steadily, but only until the last two episodes and the climax of a story arc involving a stalker does the show pick up momentum. I didn't find myself particularly enthralled with the show, but it was intriguing. I will go on to watch the the rest of the series because I enjoyed it, but the general buzz says that season two and three get much better- they will have to be to keep my interest. If the show stays like it is during season one, then I think I would quickly loose interest. But lets see where season two takes us.    Overall, the season had good casting, good music, and about three memorable episodes. However, the show never really picked up any momentum and some of the casting was less than stellar. I would recommend it, but I think it's a show you either going to love or hate. Me, I will have to wait until the next series.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Read this on my iPad.  Couldn't put it down.  Excellent character development, thick plot.  Kinda scary, because this 'fictional' book is full of events that aren't so fictional.  A must read.
031236198X|3.0|The fable is an adorable children's story.  It is easy to read and easily points out the personality styles in dealing with change along with the 8 steps to change.  The end contains a review of the steps. [...]<br /><br />The book's value does not come from listing the steps.  Those are online.  It comes from keeping people entertained enough to read the story and creating a common vocabulary to discuss change within a corporate environment.<br /><br />I only gave three stars because I was expecting a bit more on the \\"how to apply\\" change side.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|Apparently, I'm one of the few people who had never heard Aron Ralston's story; obviously, he survived - but I had no idea how things would work out.  Thus, for me there was no \\"inevitable\\" component to the ending - and I certainly won't be describing that ending here because not knowing makes this powerful film even more intense.  127 Hours is not an easy film to watch, even for those of us who can't get enough of these \\"extreme survival\\" movies.  It's one thing to watch an awful situation that \\"could\\" happen - it's another thing entirely to watch it knowing that it really happened to someone.  It is also not without its gory moments, so anyone who faints at the sight of blood should know this going in.  Close your eyes if you have to, but see this movie.<br /><br />The story's pretty simple, really.  Adrenaline-seeking extreme outdoorsman and free spirit Aron Ralston (James Franco) heads out to Utah's Canyonlands National Park to do some biking, hiking, and rappelling.  Suddenly, he falls into a crevasse, with his right hand trapped between a gigantic rock and the canyon wall.  He knows immediately that he is in extreme trouble because he didn't tell anyone where he was going and the chances of someone else coming along to such a desolate place are few and far between.  Even if someone did come, he is trapped near the bottom of what is literally a deep but relatively narrow crack in the earth.  He had met a couple of young female hikers earlier that day, showing them the adventure of a lifetime by taking them places and doing things that were most certainly not in the guidebook, but there is little chance his absence at a party they were throwing the next night could ever translate into a rescue effort.<br /><br />The meaning of the title should be obvious.  127 hours translates to 5 days and 7 hours.  Franco truly gives an arresting performance as his character's attempts to free himself give way to a fight just to stay alive in the face of a small and dwindling supply of food and water.  Ralston's determined effort not to \\"lose it\\" is his only hope of getting out of this situation, enabling him to start rationing supplies from the start.  He doesn't waste his energy cursing God or the cruel hands of fate, nor does he ever stop trying to find a way out of the situation.  As time goes on, of course, his mental faculties begin to break down, leading to dreams and fantasies intermixing with all sorts of memories from his past.  Franco does an amazing job of reflecting all of the emotions of the entire experience, including the bits of madness that inevitably arise. Director Danny Boyle's trademark bits of visual and musical cacophony are a little annoying at first, but they really add great depth to the movie by the end, reflecting both the chaos of modern life and the individual's solitary struggle to survive.<br /><br />127 Hours is a fantastic and ultimately moving film.  The viewer forms a very real and surprisingly tight bond with Ralston, making it impossible to simply walk away from this film and forget about it. Boyle's directorial flourishes combined with Franco's stellar performance lifts this story to the universal level of survival - survival of the spirit as much if not more so than the body itself.  Must-see films are rare these days, but 127 Hours is definitely one of them.and water.

When I reached the part where she included part of the script of her portrayal of Sarah Palin, I realized she was going for filler and really didn't have much to say.

1602830452|3.0|These pieces are very well produced and the acting good, but a great production of Sherlock Holmes requires a great representation of Sherlock Holmes. Contrary to other reviewers, Clive Merrison does not, IMHO, give a brilliant representation of SH. Mr. Merrison has a maniacal laugh that I found off-putting from the first disk. I was interested to hear on the \\"Silver Blaze\\" episode (Part 5, disk 1) that after his laugh (track 3, 2min 19 sec) Watson (Michael Williams) comments \\"Before we start in on my shortcomings let me say that nothing I've ever done could possibly irritate you half as much as that laugh irritates me.\\" I quite agree and even more so since this line is NOT in Conan Doyle's text. Perhaps Bert Coules (the man who wrote the dramatization of Silver Blaze for the BBC) also was annoyed with the laugh and stuck this into the text to express his views.<br /><br />Coules believes \\"Holmes is a very repressed, withdrawn, dysfunctional man, who has deliberately removed himself from the mainstream of his society.\\" [This quote is from a BBC website, the address was taken out by Amazon] Undoubtedly this is true but the new  BBC production  plays up the morose attitude and drug addiction *too* much. For example in \\"The Reigate Squires\\" (Part 6, disk 2) we have the following exchange (track 2, 3min 28 sec): SH: \\"Do you have one particular habit in mind?\\" JW: \\"Oh, you know I do. Cocaine! In your present weakened condition indulging in that pathological and morbid game could at last rob you of the great power with which you've been endowed.\\"  Again, this is NOT in Conan Doyle's text and the BBC exaggerates Holmes' addiction. In many of these episodes we are reminded of SH's drug use, but this is not how it was originally portrayed. I believe that cocaine is referenced in the original text in only 5 stories, mostly in \\"The Sign of the Four\\".<br /><br />Personally, I found the darker, exaggerated Holmes less appealing.  I prefer Sir John Gielgud's portrayal from the mid 1950's. Sir Ralph Richardson also played a good Dr. Watson as a foil to Gielgud. (Michael Williams' recent portrayal of Watson is commendable too but quite different from Richardson's.) You can find these old BBC episodes for free on you tube and elsewhere or for sale on Amazon (there are 16 of them). In many ways these old BBC episodes stayed closer to the original text. Holmes cognoscenti may be displeased by some choices that the dramatists made in this newer BBC production. For example, in \\"The Second Stain,\\" this new BBC production has Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope discarding the key to the despatch-box so that Holmes must pick the lock before her husband appears. This change seems designed merely to fill up \\"air time\\" and is displeasing to readers who know the work. Similarly the new BBC production creates more antagonism between Lestrade & Holmes than seems indicated in the text. I invite you to listen to the old 1954 BBC version of \\"The Norwood Builder\\" (if you look for '125+ episodes, properly titled and tagged' you will find it) to see how Lestrade & Holmes can be both cordial and competitive, but do not have the impatient aggressiveness exhibited by Lestrade on track 7,1:44. Another example of a strange change in the text was the omission of Holmes \\"accidentally\\" upsetting the cigarette-box in \\"The  Golden Pince-Nez\\" case. This was a ploy to allow Holmes to examine whether the ash had been disturbed and was a crucial point. I don't understand why they chose to omit it.<br /><br />The packaging of the set is lush --too lush for me. Each story is placed on a separate disk approximately 45 minutes in length. Thus, they could not fit 2 complete episodes on one disk. I would have preferred them to split episodes across the cd's. That way we would only have about 10 disks instead of 16 cd's which would require less shelf space and less waste.<br /><br />In all, I'm not fully satisfied with this purchase, but not fully dissatisfied either. If you're on the fence you might prefer to dig up the old BBC versions (you'll love Orson Welles as Professor Moriarty in the Final problem).old BBC versions (you'll love Orson Welles as Professor Moriarty in the Final problem).

B0042816YK|1.0|Okay, I didn't read the book, but whatever magically transformative life journey this Liz character truly experienced certainly does not come across in this film. Everything feels utterly staged, phony, and artificial. The acting is boring. The storyline is boring and the flow is painfully choppy (now we eat. now we pray. now we love). This directing is horrendous (did we really need all the closeups of Julia Roberts eating spaghetti? Okay, I get it. This is the \\"eat\\" part). I am glad to see I'm not alone for a change in bashing a bad film.  Several scenes just made me wince at the insincere, artificial quality. The character does come off seeming a like a spoiled princess who thinks this weather-beaten old spirtitual advisor character can help transform her life. Sorry not buying it. Please please please! No more tedious, predictable, stale films like these. One star for James Franco for the eye candy value.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|David Cook's much anticipated Sophomore Album, This Loud Morning, is a mix of rocking upbeat numbers and thoughtful, introspective songs, creating an album with a more mature feel than his first self-titled album.    Rich lyrics are in abundance as well as rocking choruses, the whole album wraps around you with ease as each song passes.        The wistful, solemn `Goodbye to the Girl', rousing `We Believe', aching `Paper Heart' and crunching `Rapid Eye Movement' and `Circadian'.  This album has David Cook's song writing skills stamped all over it to great effect.      This album has something for everyone, and you'll be singing along to the choruses before you know it!  Highly Recommended!

I only laughed out loud maybe 4 times throughout the whole book.  The rest of the time the jokes sucked.  The biggest surprise about this book was that it made me realize how much funnier Amy Poehler is.

B004LROMSY|1.0|Pros:  Eva Green  Cons: Everything else.  Too much focus on sex and not much on story.  The romantic relationships between characters were tedious.  The location it was filmed at was nice, but the production was very sparse.  I felt like I was watching a play and the show was trying to convince me Authur ruled England with less than 20 warriors, women, children, goats and chickens.  The conflicts were tedious and I failed to see the point of them.  I couldn't understand why Author would bring the majority of his forces, less than 10 men, to defend a farm that was already collapsing. It's hard to believe a farm the size of my living room is important in any way from a strategic point of view.  Did the farm have goats or chickens they needed?  Did all of England consist of 2 shabby castles, an outpost in the middle of the woods and 2 farms?  It made no logical sense or purpose and was beyond any suspension of disbelief.  The icing on the cake was a whiny, insolent, selfish, ingrate of an Authur who cared about nothing but sleeping with his friend's wife.  I liked Spartacus but this show is far from it.  I gave this show a chance and kept watching, hoping it would improve but that never happened.  I'll pass on any further episodes and stick to Game of Thrones.
0861714911|5.0|This is the most recent of several Pali-only anthologies of Buddhist texts I've read, the other two being Word of the Buddha and Path To Deliverance, both by the famous German monk Nyanatiloka.  (The latter is especially good.)  This one is easily the most comprehensive.<br /><br />For those of you who find the suttas tough going on account of their lack of thematic organization, this book will be a godsend.  As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains in the introduction, the idea for it had its genesis in a series of lectures he gave on the Majjhima Nikaya.  His goal therein was to arrange materials from simplest to most profound, giving a progressive, graded course of theoretical and practical instruction.  He then decided to turn that approach to the Sutta Pitaka as a whole.  The result is the present work.<br /><br />The specifics of this structure are as follows, where each number refers to a part of the book:<br /><br />1.The Buddha's description of the human condition<br />2.The nature of the Buddha and his attainment<br />3.How to approach the Dhamma<br />4.How the Dhamma contributes to happiness in this life<br />5.How it can contribute to happiness in future rebirths<br />6.The Dhamma on why renunciation is the safest course to take (the perils of samsara)<br />7.The nature of the path to liberation<br />8.How to master the mind<br />9.The nature of transcendent wisdom<br />10.Stages of realization<br /><br />Each of these sections is prefaced with a substantial introduction by Bhikkhu Bodhi, and some of these are surprisingly good.  (I have often felt a little sour toward BB's writing because he is such a slave to the Commentaries and tends to express himself with a slightly stilted, pompous air.)  I was especially impressed by his introduction to part 3 (\\"Approaching the Dhamma\\"), which is, in effect, an essay on the place and nature of faith (saddha) in the Buddha's teaching.  I think anyone, no matter how knowledgeable, can benefit from these pages (81ff).  It is especially useful as a contrast to Christian notions of faith.<br /><br />So who would benefit most from this book?  I think beginning students would especially be served by it, or at least those who have until now subsisted mainly on a diet of secondary texts and haven't yet plunged into the jungle of the suttas.  This book is excellent for providing an orientation, and if read two or three times so that one really becomes familiar with the passages contained therein, when the passages are finally encountered in their full form it should prove very rewarding.  But then, anyone who wants a refresher, or a different manner of presentation from, say, the four noble truths and the three-fold training (sila, samadhi, pa&ntilde;&ntilde;'), will also benefit.ially useful as a contrast to Christian notions of faith.<br /><br />So who would benefit most from this book?

1934030554|5.0|I bought an SRM before I bought this book and I could quickly see that it would transform the way I train. However I felt like I lacked in a lot of areas \\"how can I analyze the data?\\", \\"how can I build a training system?\\", \\"what are my strengths?\\". I had already read Joe Friel's book which is great for basic training and periodization but does not go into that much depth on how to actually use a power meter. A power meter is a complex tool and if you don't know how to use it won't benefit you that much. This book tells you how to use the power meter to figure out what kind of rider you are, find your weaknesses, very good suggested exercises and teaches you how to use the tools to their full extent. Combined with Joe's book you end up with an amazing combination. The only complaint I have about it is their focus on how great WKO+ is (a software they develop), however if you've read this book you'll know enough to be able to use any other software (I personally use Golden Cheetah). I'd recommend a power meter to any serious cyclist and without this book getting a power meter is a waste of money. [[ASIN:1934030201 The Cyclist's Training Bible]]

The new effects are nothing short of superb and it looks so much better in Blu-ray! I still remember watching all these episodes on our 13 inch T.V. when I was growing up and it is SO NICE to be watching them in high def on a 46 inch television. There will never be a T.V. series that I have enjoyed more and that has meant more to me than Star Trek! To me it's just like there will NEVER be another band like the Beatles! They just don't make music like that anymore and now there is no more Star Trek! I say it's time to bring back the franchise and make another series! I just can't watch most of the crap on T.V. anymore!!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I just want all fantasy readers to know about Kevin Hearne.  I finished reading Hounded and absolutely loved the character of Atticus O'Sullivan and his wolfhound Oberon.  I enjoyed this book so much, I immediately picked up Hexed and will finish it tomorrow.  His books have a fast pace to them and they are difficult to put down once started.  Atticus and Oberon made me wish they were real.  I believe that is the highest compliment I can give to an author that makes his characters so alive.  The mental interaction between Atticus and Oberon is just so creative and funny.  I would like that kind of connection with my pets.  Kevin Hearne's stories are fresh and lively and I look forward to picking up Hammered next.  I hope Mr. Hearne has as much fun writing these books as I do reading them and hope he writes many more in this series.

B004U52VPS|3.0|Angry Birds.. the phone app that took the world by storm! Multiple versions of the game now exist on nearly all cell-phones and there is a Google Chrome app version to play on your PC. Branded merchandise is selling everywhere.. shirts, plush toys, keychain fobs, stickers, etc etc. Making a tabletop boardgame version seems like a no-brainer, right? Well I think there is a solid idea here, but in the end it's just another branded product that the license holder used to cash in with. After about 3 hours of play, my guess is that the design was put down and then printed, boxed, and shipped without anyone waiting for the test results.     On the positive side, the pieces look great. All the Angry Bird character is there on the faces. The different pigs are actually the same pieces with different stickers, but I don't think that affects the game in any other way. There is some satisfaction in the crashing sound that the pieces make when you score a hit. Younger kids are sure to enjoy the idea and probably laugh through a few hours of play before throwing it in a closet and leaving it there. For the price, that's not too terrible. That's about all I can say as a positive however...    The negatives. The different birds do not really behave differently in gameplay. Yes the shapes and weights vary, but it doesn't translate to any differences from the launcher. The fact that despite this the cards give you different birds to use on different designs is the first clue that the game was designed on paper and not tested well. The biggest downfall of the game is the launcher, and it's lack of consistency. There is no skill involved with the game, and the wide variance from one shot to the next actually makes it frustrating to play. Take ten shots with the same bird using the same pull on the launcher and your results will vary from a nearly vertical launch that travels less than two inches forward and a screaming line drive that launches three feet, missing the table completely.Most of the time our birds launched to the left of aim, but aiming to the right to compensate doesn't work since randomly they do launch straight.     If you ignore the rules which state you must be at least one foot from the castle when launching, you can reliably hit the target with soft shots. This is what was shown in the promotional video that you can see on Youtube.. however playing like this makes the game overly simple and pointless.

I watched an episode mid- season and I was hooked.I didn't think the show could get any better but season two proved me wrong .Season two is excellent it has drama, romance and action .Even though the show is about vampires ,witches and werewolves you can relate to the characters and what they are going .I recommend this DVD even if your not a fan of vampires .You will love this television show.
B0000CDL93|4.0|Anyone who spends any time around me will quickly find that there are some movies that I can watch or \\"watch\\" almost on repeat for an extended period of time (I put watch in quotes because sometimes I'll have a movie playing while either going to sleep, at the computer, cleaning, working, etc.). JFK became one of those films.     I didn't see it until probably almost 15 years after it came out. I was scouring an auction site for old, cheap laser discs to add to my collection and came across it. It wasn't much, so I ordered it. It probably sat on my shelf for another year before I remembered that I owned it and finally popped it in. I hadn't been purposely hesitating, it's just that, you know, I had heard some not-good things about it and it wasn't a priority. I was pretty blown away by it and started recommending it to anyone who hadn't seen it. Yeah, it's not exactly rooted in reality, but as a crime procedural-thriller, it's a good flic! It's got solid performances from the entire cast, Stone was doing interesting things with lighting, cinematography, etc. and it's visually interesting. And, yeah, while Costner is completely tolerable his accent is both unnecessary and pretty bad. Garrison was originally from Iowa and didn't talk like that. Heck, the real Garrison is in the film (as Justice Warren) and he sounds like hes' from the middle of the country, not the south (you can also find videos of him on Youtube). Costner plays it like Garrison is from the Bayou-- but a cartoon Bayou. Other than that, though, he's good.     I picked it up on Blu-Ray so that I wouldn't have to change discs to watch the last half (and the Mr. X monologue is one of my favorite parts). Yes, it's long spanning several years, but it's intriguing unless you can't switch off the part of your mind that just can't let this exist as entertainment instead of a documentary. It prompted me to spend a bit of time on line reading about some of the historical players in the film and reading some ofthe criticism of the film from a historical perspective. The film is fun for what it gets both right and wrong, what it represents and misrepresents, and as a supposition of what could happen and why. Also, the BD transfer is fantastic looking. Great color, the intentionally over-exposed bits are very bright, the shadows are dark, the warmly shot scenes are very nice looking. And the cast-- wow! There are enough stars and great actors in this film whose collective careers span the better part of the 20th century. And, hey, this film will give you plenty of ammo for your next Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon! You could probably get to Charlie Chaplin in just a couple jumps from here :)    I say just enjoy it for what it is: a political crime procedural with some thriller elements. If you look at this as a historical document it's my opinion that you're doing it wrong.

They're easy to make, the ingredients aren't hard to find, and often times you end up with a little extra batter (I always think of this as the authors way of letting me sneak a taste without ruining the perfect dozen!) I'm a hardcore baker, and every single one of these recipes has stood the test. In fact, I've found that vegan cupcakes are more moist, fluffy, and the frosting more creamy than the traditional alternative. If Vegan Cupcakes will take over the world, I will be happy to live under their rule.    Notes:  - To make them a little healthier (or to ease my conscience), I always use I&T's trick to make it with half and half whole wheat and all purpose flour  - I've found that cutting back on the called-for oil the teensiest bit avoids frosting feeling too oily.  - Most of the recipes can be modified to use applesauce as the base instead of oil (if you're aiming for low-fat)  - You will eat the entire tin of Newman O's if you make cookies n'cream cupcakes. Be warned.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|This movie was great.  I watched it on an airplane, and if a movie is good on an airplane then that means it is really good.  This movie is second only to Taken as far as Liam Neeson movies are concerned.
0345529057|5.0|The first book was much better than the HBO series. Much more detail into their lives. I couldn't wait to pick up the second one and it was right there!!  Now almost done with the second one and can't wait to see what happends to all the characters at the end of this one. Good for my 16 hour flight. I hope next season on HBO lives up to it!! I highly reccomend reading the books!!

0553582038|1.0|I have read the three books prior to this one and found them all quite compelling. I love the HBO series and find the books even better, very difficult to put down. The 4th however I have put down so many times I am finding it arduous to read on. Hopefully HBO will continue with the series and just skip over this book entirely.   Also, the Kindle version is horrid!!! There are SO many misspellings at times it is difficult to figure out what the word is even supposed to be. They can't even spell the author's name correctly let alone the name of the book! \\"A Fr.Asi i OR CROWS\\" is how it's written at one point. Spell check would be an asset to whoever transcribed this. Buyer beware, just go to the library for this one or borrow it from a friend. DO NOT get the Kindle version. It makes it even more difficult to get through the book.   I am looking forward to \\"Dancing With Dragons\\" and praying Mr. Martin has gone back to his original way of writing. If not it would do well if someone else finished the series.
0316098329|1.0|This novel was stupid. Absolutely rediculous. I respect what the author TRIED to accomplish however I couldnt stand reading through the 2nd chapter, every single thought/word that came from the child in this novel was so rediculous. Children are naive yes, but this wasn't anywhere near a close representation as to what a converstation with a child is like nor how they form thoughts. It probably doesnt help having 3 kids in my house but the fact of the matter is that its rediculous and absolute torture to try and put yourself through. I don't understand how anyone could want to read this. Maybe if you don't have kids, or have only been around kids that are not on or anywhere near any type of curve of development (disabilities included) you can enjoy this.   If you have ever been around a smart 5 y/o you will just be annoyed. This book was obnoxious.
1400052173|5.0|\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is a book that will stay with you long after you have put it down. It's moving story, truthful writing and often horrific facts, give a voice to a history that was ignored and then almost forgotten. The book pulls back the pretty veneer covering medical research, medical ethics, racism and poverty. Skloot shares the darkness of the Lacks' family story with respect, grace and love.  She spent 10 years researching the book and growing into a part of the Lacks family. As the New York times wrote, \\"it feels like the book Skloot was born to write.\\" It is a book that will touch your soul.
0743277708|5.0|Why did I award, for the first that ever I can recall, 5 stars to this review of Watership Down? Because, with the possible exception of The Lord of The Rings (my personal favorite and in a class of its own), this may be the best modern novel I've ever read. Richard Adams proves every point that Joseph Campbell ever made about the power of myth, or story.  In Watership Down, Adams combines a great story - the English writers' strong suit - with characterization, long thought the preserve of the American writer, while seamlessly blending in his own great love for the English countryside.     A short summary: a group of rabbits, led by Hazel, depart their warren, on the advice of Hazel's seer-like brother Fiver. They endure hardship and adventure and learn a lot of themselves until they make a new home atop Watership Down. New adventures ensue when then they determine that a need for does - for females, as they are all male - exists and they set out to 'steal' does from the forbidding warren to the south, Efrafa.  A battle of wits develops between our hardy adventurers and the Efrafans' chief rabbit, the terrifying General Woundwort.    That summary does no justice to the rich characters Adams has created in Hazel, Fiver, Blackberry, and, of course,Bigwig, nor in Woundwort himself (he gets a whole chapter) or even such rabbits as Silverweed (a cautionary character if ever there was one) or the redoubtable Captain Campion (the noble enemy). While inventive in finding ways to overcome the clear physical, and real, limitations that Adams imposes on his rabbits, by the use of the gull Kehaar and 'Dr. Adams', Adams never fails to point up the very real hardships that animals, and especially rabbits, must endure.  The epigrams which he uses to open each chapter are themselves thought-provoking and have led me to the larger works from which they are taken, to my benefit. While Adams firmly asserts, like Tolkien, that none of Watership Down should be read as allegory, I thinkany reader can read it as he wishes - as Hazel and his rabbits (the English people) fighting against Nazism, or, perhaps, the Soviet Union, or some other tyranny.      This is a book that makes you want to enter the action, to be part of the story.  At best, you can visit Hampshire and see the Downs themselves. But Richard Adams has done the next best thing and in doing so, he has made a story that will last the ages.
B004UID2LC|3.0|The previous version worked great. After uninstalling the previous version &amp; installing this one, I can't get it to download videos. So I uninatalled it and reinstalled the previous version and now it won't download videos either. Neither one will show previously downloaded videos even after restoring the download.db file. Now nothing works. I even scanned both versions with Lookout, NetQin and AVG and none of them report this app as malware.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|[Minor Spoilers.  This review is for the Theatrical Release.]<br /><br />Green Lantern -- Not as bad as the Critics Think<br /><br />First Impressions:<br /><br />What I liked about Green Lantern was the simple plot and explanation.  I have heard that some felt they would not get the film if they were new to the character or never heard of Green Lantern.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />Plots & Holes:<br /><br />The film starts out with what I thought was a clear understanding of what the Green Lantern Corps was all about.  The origin story with Hal Jordan as the Green Lantern was altered from comic book canon but that's fine.  It is only a comic book, right?<br /><br />The Parallax character was changed a bit as well from the comics.  Here the bad guy is an irresistible force, a former Guardian who looks amazingly like Galactus did from the Fantastic Four movie!  He lives on fear!<br /><br />Now, characters living off emotions and draining them to achieve power, like a spirit vampire, is not new to fiction.  I mean Star Trek had that as one show.  What's different here is that the beast tends to draw out what looks like the skeleton of the person.  The animation on this is fierce.<br /><br />Carol Ferris, played by Blake Lively, was miscast.  She tried to come off tough but was not really as forceful as the comic book character.  When she finds out about Hal the scene was funny and pokes fun at the whole secret identity thing.  In the comics, no one recognized Green Lantern as Hal Jordan as long as he wore the mask.<br /><br />Family:<br /><br />My only real criticism is that the family of characters was not fully developed.  The film touches on Hal's family, his brothers and his nephew.  They seem mad at him for being reckless or forgetting birthdays.  Why so mad?  What's the back-story if any?  Who is this nephew and why do we care?<br /><br />Green Lantern Corps:<br /><br />The whole Guardians thing and the planet Oa I felt were faithful to the comic book characters but even more so.  The Guardians are blue aliens, immortals and an ancient race who put all this together in the first place.  As in the comics they are pretty stuck up and arrogant.<br /><br />The Corps does not accept Hal at first and this is quite a blow to his self esteem as he has self doubts.  This part of the story was hard to swallow as well.  I could not see a jet pilot being so full of self doubt after earlier in the film showing such bravado and recklessness.<br /><br />Hammond:<br /><br />Hammond is a secondary villain who gains power through accidentally coming in contact with the Parallax element.  This is a far cry from the comics but is forgivable.  The back story again is missing.  He seems jealous of Hal with Carol.  Why?  What's their history?<br /><br />Credits:<br /><br />There is a cool thing with Sinestro mid credits.  Don't miss it.  It did make me excited for a sequel.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Not the best they could have done and often missed opportunities to shine.  However, this is a great summer movie to take the kids to.  And fans, don't worry if the first film does not work out.  Neither did Superman's first film.  Nor did Batman hit the screen first time running.  And the first Star Trek film was really, really long!<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds was good as the reckless Hal who grows a conscience.  Blake Lively was very good-looking but could not quite pull Carol Ferris off.  Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond would have been more a sympathetic character if he were more developed.  Mark Strong as the proud Green Lantern was really well done.  Near the end he weakens, and that's where we should have a sequel.<br /><br />I say give the franchise a chance.<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />Cast<br /><br />  Ryan Reynolds - Hal Jordan/Green Lantern<br />  Blake Lively - Carol Ferris<br />  Peter Sarsgaard - Hector Hammond<br />  Mark Strong - Sinestro<br />  Tim Robbins - Senator Hammond<br />  Jay O. Sanders - Carl Ferris<br />  Taika Waititi - Tom Kalmaku<br /><br />Crew<br /><br />  Martin Campbell - Director<br />  Donald De Line - Producer<br />  Greg Berlanti - Producer, Screen Story, Screenwriter
0670022411|4.0|If you liked Interview with a Vampire tossed in a with a bit more history and more creatures, this is up your alley. I found the story interesting and found it similar to the first Outlander book.  I will definitely read the next book in this series.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|I don't get it.  After all this time, I still do not understand the moral, theme or premise of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five.  The book starts promising; and the story captivated me early.  But, I did not have a good feel for where the story was heading even after the story ended - such as it was.  The story begins with what a first-time reader will assume to be the protagonist commiserating with his old World War II buddy.  And, the first-person narrator, who is an author, describes a book he is about to write about the Dresden firebombing in World War II.  The rest of Slaughterhouse-Five is simply that book, with the actual protagonist, Billy Pilgrim.      To make a short story even shorter, Pilgrim wanders through World War II, becomes a prisoner of war, lives underneath the firebombing of Dresden, and wanders through various points of his life courtesy of his time-traveling (although \\"traveling\\" is not completely accurate - it doesn't really matter) alien abductors, the Tralfamdorians.  Slaughterhouse-Five ends with Pilgrim.  And, we never really understand why Vonnegut begins his story with the narrator, who remains anonymous.  The author mentions before leading into the Pilgrim narrative that \\"the story is so short and jangled.\\"  I wonder Vonnegut did not insert the first chapter with the narrator after the fact to cover for the notion that Vonnegut's story is so \\"short and jangled\\" indeed.    I have read any number of possible themes for the book.  Among the most popular, of course, is that Slaughterhouse-Five is an anti-war book.  That is entirely possible.  Slaughterhouse-Five is certainly not complimentary of war or war makers.  But, it does not exactly call out the offenders either.  Rather, the theme -- if there is one -- is that war is irrational and destructive, yet inevitable.  However, by the time the reader gleans through aliens, Hollywood starlets on the Planet Tralmafadore, and optometry sessions - all courtesy of Billy Pilgrim - any hopes of finding a theme are long past.      Vonnegut's long-lived reputation as a creative narrator is well deserved.  The narration is succinct and flowing.  It has a symmetry and repetition that is endearing and captivating rather than annoying.  Unfortunately, I did not find much of a story beneath the creative writing technique.  I really wanted to like this book more.    So it goes.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I've always enjoyed Maroon 5 when they would be played on the radio but I was about to attend one of their concerts with friends and thought; you know, I should really listen to some more of their songs. So I went to youtube and was completely AMAZED! Decided to get the whole album and played in on repeat before the concert and after. (If you have a chance to see them live, I highly recommend you go!) Adam's vocals are so strong and the songs have meaning despite their upbeat sound. One of my new favorite bands. I love an artist who can deliver it both live and on record.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I don't understand why so many people complain about this show. So what if it didn't follow down the exact same story-line as SG-1 or Atlantis, It's a great show!!! I absolutely love this series and it's a damn shame all these so called Stargate fans got it canceled. Where did you have the right to ruin for the rest of us that really enjoyed this show. Shame on you MORONS. I found the story-line witty, exciting and the acting was superb. This is another Sci-Fi tragedy that this show was cut down in it's infancy.
B000002J6F|3.0|Because Buffalo Springfield and CSN&Y were my two favorite bands of their time, I purchased Manassas as an LP when it was first released in the 70's.  I still have the album today but probably haven't listened to it in 30 years.  As I recall, it was a major letdown for Steve Stills at the time and I didn't discover much in the music that I even remember today.  All this being said and having read here on Amazon the many glowing review leaves me feeling that maybe I missed something.      This is going to be a temporary review that I will update I've I've dusted off this music and given it a try again.  I hope I discover that I was wrong at the time and that this music is as special as so many review here seem to preach.      I'll let you know.

B004EPYZUI|1.0|A conglomerate of music videos for the misogynist male.  The characters are two dimensional with a very weak plot for the storyline. The resolution of the movie is jarring and disconjointed. The visual effects are beautiful but even that can put you to sleep like repetitive mindnumbing sex. Try doing the missionary position for an hour and a half with no forplay and you will get the same effects as this dvd.The viewer is the one who gets Sucker Punched!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Seriously - Buy this book.  You will not be disappointed.  I loved everything about this story; mostly it's freshness (I know similarities exist, but this flavor of it is breathtaking), but I'll share one snippet of excellence...    Kvothe as a homeless street urchine - This whole sequence was heart-wrenchingly sad.  Well done Mr. Rothfuss, well done.  You're an Arsehole for making me tearfully despair.
B00026WU82|5.0|Ballad of a thin man is one of the most best Dylan songs, although Like a rolling stone was his biggie, This album has 9 tracks and for me Ballad of a thin man and tombstone blues are two big bonuses. so every time I listen to Highway 61 revisited i just let it play all the way through and mellow out man.
B00005KB9W|4.0|Gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because Marley is always good, but this is just not his best in my opinon. His \\"Legend\\" and \\"Uprising\\" albums seem to have better sound and vocals. Don't know if because this was live that the audience created more interference or if the sound just wasn't placed as well, or what, but there did seem like a lot of just \\"noise\\" instead of the solid music of the mentioned albums. Songs are good and there are the lyrics included which is a plus. Would suggest this one if you already have other Marleys and want a more complete collection.
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|I originally bought this for my mother, but for Tv movies it aint bad if its a rainy day, but to give credit where credits due they should of made Jesse Stone a series instead of blue bloods which he stars in now. The Jesse Stone movies could have much more potenial if they had a couple of good writers and a director i would like to see it on prime time.I've seen two of the Jesse Stone movies and they have good plots but there always the same. ITs basically about a detecive from LA who went to a little town in Paradise,MA and becomes sheriff and solves murders and helps the locals, who owns a dog from a crime scene and drinks alot of scotch.
0307266303|5.0|Whether you run ultramarathons, run around the block or think about running you will enjoy the book. The book is actually much more then a race in remote part of the book. The books tangents in many ways are the best part, the Leadville 100, running shoe industry, theory of how early man learned to run.  It also introduces you to real people who live some unreal lives. The world is a more interesting place because of people who are in the book..would you drop everything and just move to a remote part of mexico with almost no game plan?. Its a real easy to read...long on the human spirit and short on splits/pace..that kind of stuff.  Really does make you want to go out and run...and if you are running...you don't mind suffering.  t mind
B00004Y6NP|1.0|BEWARE - Read the fine print.  Even if it says 1985, if it also says \\"re-issued\\" or \\"remastered,\\" it is the horribly messed up version with all the life compressed out of it - for the \\"loudness wars.\\"<br /><br />This is classic rock - really good stuff, but be sure to buy a used CD with the original mastering.  The original is breathtaking in its clarity.  Very quiet voices and instruments are clearly discernible. It is startling, actually.  Not so in the remastered version. The re-mastered version might be better for jogging with an iPod, but if you are going to listen on a good stereo, the original is far superior.  Turn up the volume.
B00200K2UG|4.0|This is a real gadget bag and has room and space and compartments for everything you want. But once you fill it up, you'd better have some wheels to put it on because it'll be H-E-A-V-Y!!! It's too big to go under an airline seat and maybe even overhead in an airplane. And you don't want to check it as baggage, with all that delicate and expensive gear! The description says it's 15.4 x 7.5 x 10.6. Don't believe it. Even empty, it's 17.5 (not counting the side pocket) x 9 x 11. Since I primarily want a camera bag for travel (I'm not a pro photographer, purely amateur with a lot of toys), this isn't it. I'm returning it and will keep looking. Whatever I get, it'll most likely be a Tamrac since I'm still using one I got about 20 years ago and it shows no sign of age. I've just outgrown it.
B000059HAI|5.0|Japanese and American filmmakers team up for a historically accurate, but nonetheless entertaining, film about the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Of all the movies about Pearl Harbor, based on those that I have seen and what I have heard about others, this one is my favorite.  It is far superior to \\"From Here To Eternity.\\"    \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" does what I did not think was possible.  It carries the Pearl Harbor story throughout a standard two hour movie.  In fact this was a two hour and 25 minute movie.  This is accomplished by showing the political maneuvering by the Americans and the Japanese leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  I had previously thought this story was too short for a movie.  It does not rely on a love story or other corny subplot to fill in screen time.    Although the special effects were probably more difficult to produce back in 1970 when this movie was released, they are still very good.  While no movie should be just about special effects, they enhance the story here.    This product is thankfully released in the original Panavision.  It features a trailer, a documentary about the Pearl Harbor attack, and commentary during the movie from the director and a Japanese film historian.

0393320928|5.0|Just absolutely wonderful - another collection of anecdotes from Feynman's life. The first part of the book almost seems indistinguishable from 'Surely You're...', using the same style of narration to present details of incidents. These 'incidents' are often unconnected and span from childhood recollections from Feynman's life and his original encounter with Arlene (his wife) to the time he spent during a trip to Brazil. Each story is amusing whilst managing to provide a deeper glimpse into the erratic, comical yet intelligent character of Feynman.<br /><br />The second and greater part of this book deals with Feynman's presence on the committee investigating the 1986 crash of the Space Shuttle Challenger, capturing the incredible dissatisfaction felt by him as he is plunged into the administrative bureaucracy of Washington and NASA. The descriptions of the shuttle and its faulty components are illustrated clearly with the help of figures and photographs. These illustrations help the reader visualize the circumstances of the crash and where the the major fault within the shuttle actually lay. These are particularly helpful in eliminating any ambiguity in the description of technical rocket components (O-rings, etc). Despite the serious content, this part of the book retains the strong elements of humor found within rest of the book. It manages to paint a ludicrous picture of the way things tended to be handled in NASA (e.g. NASA informing an official that the probability of failure of an manned rocket is 1 in 100,000 which implied that &#34;you could fly the shuttle every day for an average of 300 years between accidents- every day, one flight, for 300 years- which is obviously crazy!&#34;). He also points towards the general errors made by large organizations such as NASA due to the divide between levels of management by narrating personal conversations with the management, engineers and workers.  The perspicuous manner with which he describes his involvement in the investigation almost makes the reader feel as if he were right alongside Feynman while he was dealt the task of investigating the crash.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed &#34;Surely You're Joking...&#34; and is willing to put his mind to a bit more work to enjoy the second part of the book. Overall, it is a great book that any Feynman fan will be willing to appreciate!e investigation almost makes the reader feel as if he were right alongside Feynman while he was dealt the task of investigating the crash.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed &#34;Surely You're Joking...&#34; and is willing to put his mind to a bit more work to enjoy the second part of the book.

B004RC8NUQ|3.0|Sex without love is an impossible task?  Some ladies of the evening may disagree.  This isn't a bad movie just a totally predictable one.  For the first two-thirds of the film it seems like it's nothing but a bunch of self-absorbed yuppies yammering  about their delusional opinions on love and sex.  Ashton Kutcher's randy dad played by Kevin Kline was the only thing making the enterprise palatable.  It's only in the last third that the film redeems itself when it reaches the inevitable conclusion that yes, love between two people is a possibility.  They released this film over Valentine's Day Weekend and I guess it would be a servicable date movie though those offended by rough and frank language might look elsewhere.  Otherwise, it's pretty forgettable.  Natalie, you won an Oscar!  What are you doing in ho-hum fare like this?
B0058S0OMS|5.0|One of the best horror sequels i've ever seen, finally available on blu-ray, pre-ordered this day 1. Hopefully the transfer will be brilliant and its a shame about the extras, but anything's better than nothing, maybe if this sells well, they might add more special features to future releases. Would love that commentary that the director made back in 2001 and an extended tv cut.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I remember back in the Summer '82, better known as the Summer of \\"E.T.\\", I saw \\"Blade Runner\\".  It totally enthralled me but it's box office was lukewarm at best as was the critical reaction.  The operative tag was style over substance.  It wasn't until it was released in the then burgeoning home video market that word of mouth made the film the classic that it's considered today.  This is not to suggest that \\"Sucker Punch\\" is in that same lofty category but to draw an analogy.  As memory serves \\"Sucker Punch\\" on it's release last Spring was met with hostile reviews and plummeting box office as word of mouth got out.  I think it's more of a case of dashed expectations.  The ad campaign led you to believe that the film was straightforward comic book fantasy, or, the filmization of \\"Fox Force Five\\", the fictional TV show from \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  Director Zack Snyder has attempted something ambitious here.  He melds psychological thriller, hyper-realism, and uber-fantasy seamlessly into a work that kept me rapt.  Snyder proved he was a master visualist with \\"300\\" but here he's attempting something different.  Most of the criticism I've seen says there's no narrative but nothing could be further from the truth.  It's a richly detailed stream of conscience narrative that requires close attention otherwise you miss the rewards it reaps.  I don't know if I really loved this movie or I'm just playing devil's advocate.  Regardless, you be the judge and remember that \\"2001-A Space Odyssey\\" was trashed on initial release.
B00007KMZR|5.0|LOVED IT!! Finally I was able to buy it, after hearing the entire album on youtube; though I first discovered it while watching the videos for it.<br /><br />I'm an arts major so I happened to find out about this band because the album's music videos were in anime form.<br /><br />Except for a minor damage to the inside part of the case, it came in an almost new condition. There were no scratches or scuffing, and I didn't have to wait long for it to arrive. I would buy from this seller again.

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|There have been several adaptations of Jane Eyre, and frankly the only one that has come close to hitting the mark has been the 2008 version with Ruth Wilson. Since the novel is so lengthy and detailed, the 2008 version does it justice by stretching its screen time.  And while I understand that film makers wanted to make a shorter version that's appropriate for theaters, the whole story of Jane Eyre seemed to be lost here.   For those who care about a movie sticking close to the book, this is not the version to watch.  With a skewed timeline, characters that seem to be too good looking, and a plot that was chopped in half, it was obvious this version was rushed. It seemed that the casting directors were also looking for that 'dark, tall, and handsome' man to be ruler of Thornfield.  The book clearly states that Mr. Rochester is not at all attractive, and Jane even tells him so herself.  Michael Fassbender was too  much on the goodlooking side. (But okay, that's nit-picky.  Most people enjoy a movie more with good looking characters.)    However, I must say this: if I watched this movie without any prior knowledge of Jane Eyre whatsoever, without knowing what should be happening according to the novel, or what the film makers were leaving out, I would say this movie is pretty darn good.  The cinematography is superb, and the language is true to that time period. The writers did not dumb down the dialogue for a modern day audience. That was much appreciated.    All in all, I'm split.  While the Jane Eyre enthusiast inside me is raging in disappointment from inconsistancies and incompletion, the Hollywood drama lover is soaking in the timeless love story.  If sticking to the story doesn't matter to you, then I would go ahead with this buy. It's beautifully done. But if you cringe when a great novel is destroyed, I would look to the 2008 version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  That's where you find drama, cinematography, and a true movie adaptation.

His careful detective work, brilliant deductions, and aphorisms \\"elementary, my dear Watson\\" \\"the mind is an attic\\" and so on, have penetrated the hearts and minds of generations of readers.  He is as beloved a fictional character as any in Dickens, and maybe more so.<br /><br />As could be deduced from the above, I am a tremendous fan of Sherlock Holmes.  I have read every single story and novel at least once, and many significantly more than once.  For me, this is the book to buy, though, for the character of Dr. Moriarty is almost as fascinating as that of Sherlock Holmes, and he really only appears in the novels - there are allusions to him in some of the short stories, but not much more.<br /><br />As a closing note, this is the edition to buy!  A poor translation or a \\"children's version\\" is annoying and grating.  I must put an inferior version down and come back to the Bantam Classic!  This is the edition to buy and read and re-read.<br /><br />PS The movie was significantly above average, though imperfect (the 2010 movie).  It was a little more violent than it should have been, though the boxing scene was priceless.  The plot was even more intricate and had more twists and turns than many of the stories.  So, if a reader of this review has seen the movie but not read the book, rest assured that the original is even better!
B0057XSCJG|4.0|I wanted to see this movie at the theater but the idiots at my local theater think that action and kiddy movies are the only things worth showing. This may not have been an oscar worthy film but if a movie can make you think or feel than it's done its job. I have to say though; A.K. Olsen steals the show!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I don't exaggerate when I say that this should be required viewing in public schools.  Already in CA and in other states, students are required to take classes in both government and economics before graduating from high school.  Yet I can say with confidence that this movie contains much more valuable information than students would learn in any government or economics textbook about how the real world actually works.<br /><br />Inside Job, despite being a popular movie and recognized documentary, feels to the reader as if he is being let in on a conspiratorial secret - and in fact he has!  In the special features, in what is a scene that should have been included in the movie, even Dominique Strauss-Kahn does not dispute the basic thesis of a prominent MIT economist that leading financial companies have essentially taken over the US government.  And this is not a mere professor, however well-qualified, but rather a former leading economist of the IMF.<br /><br />How can a country go from having the financial sector comprise 8-16% of corporate profits - 1940-1982, to comprising 40% of corporate profits - 2007 - and still be the same country?  Inside Job shows how - by making the country subservient to the financial companies, and not vice versa.  Inside Job shows how this is the case, and concludes with horror that nothing has changed - the same type of people from the same companies fill the same posts, just with $2 trillion of taxpayer money.  They were emboldened rather than chastened by the financial crisis and its aftermath.  How much longer will it take until another and bigger one?  Inside Job makes the very relevant point that these crises will only get worse until long overdue structural change vis a vis the financial sector and the rest of the country takes place.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|It took me eight years to really love another one of Beyonce's solo records.  Along with her Destiny's Child material, \\"Dangerously in Love\\" is her pivotal record too me.  She still hasn`t topped that one (only my opinion), but \\"4\\" is extremely close.  All those foolish songs like \\"Kitty Kat,\\" \\"Freak `Em Dress,\\" \\"Diva,\\" and \\"Video Phone\\" are GONE!  Out the window!  We are hardly radio friendly this time around.  Thank God.  She's back to mature records/sounds like her first CD, and I am very pleased with this change.  The records on \\"4\\" that boarder the whimsical are backed by an 80's/90's retro vibe.  And once mixed with her voice, makes for some irresistibly catchy records that are befitting of the time that inspired them.  All 80's babies will automatically be pleased by these sweet sounds.<br /><br />There's something really special about \\"4\\" to me.  I won't say Beyonce has come \\"home\\" or anything, but I'm feeling as if she's bringing matters down a notch and just going for a sound that's solid and sung with a little more conviction, reason, and meaning.  I could understand why others may think the record is boring, but if you're the type that doesn't want to jump up and do her dance route, but rather sit down, and just listen and feel the beat, then this record is meant for you.  And her voice sounds fantastic.  I personally love the grit, grumble, growls, and groans.  She`s in command over the music.<br /><br />What I ask for Beyonce on her next record: Stay on track and keep going deeper.  Leave Sasha and the dance routes at home and take us further.  Dare I say produce us a soul album all together.  I never was the type to go around screaming and fighting for Beyonce, but I definitely encourage people to buy this album if you were a weary fan like myself.<br /><br />*Weakest track IMO: \\"Countdown.\\"  A \\"B'day\\" reject, I'm almost certain.  This track should have been replaced with \\"Dance For You\\" from the deluxe edition to round her latest effort out nicely.  Also, the message in \\"I Was Here\\" is great; however, it has that airy-fairy quality like the ballads from the \\"I Am...\\" album.  Not that it's bad, but it stands out differently from the other songs on \\"4.\\"  This causes me to skip it (and occasionally \\"Girls\\") to race back to the top with the powerhouse that makes up \\"1+1.\\"I Was Here\\" is great; however, it has that airy-fairy quality like the ballads from the \\"I Am...\\" album.

B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I love in Angry Birds games but since I updated this version, it won't open!  It just loads, then it forces closed!  I can't rate what I can't play!

B004SKHJF2|4.0|The idea behind Shazam is glorious - click a button on your phone, let the app listen to a song, and up pops a screen telling you the artist, title, and album of the song, as well as allowing you to purchase it from iTunes. I do not use the iTunes portion (I'm a Rhapsody user), but the only flaws I have found are in the inconsistent functioning of the app. The Encore version (which is ad-free), often takes much longer to run the free version on my wife's phone (same hardware I have), and sometimes simply locks up and refuses to run at all, which is inconvenient in a product designed to be used while driving in the car. Best way in the world to identify new music, but the code needs to tighter and less crash-prone to get 5 stars...
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Although this is not my favorite Jane Austen book, it is a pure classic.  Masterpiece does a great job of representing her work.  Great addition to my collection.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Well, I can almost see why Angry Birds is the cultural phenomenon it is - my problem with the game has to do with hardware and not the game itself. This simply won't run on my Motorola CLiq with enough speed, responsiveness, or resolution to be playable, which is a darn shame because I liked what I was able to play. Even an iPhone screen seems a bit small for the precision required by the game, though the bigger screen and faster processor alleviate the problem to some extent. I won't drop more than 1 star, but if you offer the product for some hardware and not others, you really should include the Cliq in the unplayable group - it runs, and you can sort of play the game, but not in any way that is enjoyable.
B00000IQV7|5.0|This is a great movie... a real heart warmer.  Everything with this transaction can be rated with an 'A++!!'    Thanks!!

B004GYOQ6A|3.0|This is the sort of game that I turn on when I have a minute and Im bored but i dont want to get immersed in playing on my phone.   I can easily set it down and not think about wanting to play it till the next time I need a filler in game  come on, it cant beat the wood version, but tipping your phone here and there is fun enough and its mindless. 3 stars is sufficient for this game
B0034G4P8U|2.0|I had heard that the movie was bad before going in,but I was surprised to know just how bad.  The first few minutes were interesting. The 3D was good and the story was entertaining. And I pitied Bay when Sam wasn't able to find a job. People have said that Bay was sad after people hated Falled so much,and so he tried to make Sam feal like him. Why is Bay so greedy for money anyway? He shouldn't have made this one,it is horrible to say that Megan Fox's character dumped Sam. After all they have been through??? I mean seriously! Can you imagine going back to watch the first two where the relationship was built knowing that it would be torn dow in the third?  But then it transformed faster than Magatron can into a comedy which can be compared to the Muppets. The jokes are insane and sick. I was surprised and started to worry that the whole movie would be like that.   Nope. Then came part two. Optimus Prime allows an ENTIRE city of people to die just to prove a point.   Then comes part three. BOOM! SMASH! PUNCH! BOOM! SMASH! PUNCH!,wait a moment,I thought I just watched that! It went on forever! There was a moment where I was just sitting there staring at the screen and allowing my attention to wander. I was just waiting for it to end...  And then it did end:The battle was all too fast and short.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|Awesome to see the great composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein at work with big singers like Kiri and Jose.  The songs are briljant; beautiful words put to beautiful music. The lirics of 'could be' resemble Theory U of Otto Scharmer. As good as it gets!

044661758X|5.0|Michael Connelly has done it again!  Someone once said that a brand is above all a promise. Brands become popular because companies and certain products consistently keep their promises.  When you go to a Hilton hotel or walk into a Starbuck's coffee shop you know what you are going to get.  The same is true of popular authors and Michael Connelly almost always keeps his promises.  When you pick up a Connelly novel, especially a Harry Bosch novel, you know that there will be drama, excitement, great characters who you care about, plenty of unexpected twists and turns, an extremely rapid pace, and a satisfying ending.  When reading a Connelly novel make sure you are going to have the time to finish it.  If you can't get back to it (because of something so trivial as say, work) you are going to be very frustrated.  If you do have the time you will find that reading a Bosch novel is a far more satisfying experience than either staying at a Hilton hotel or drinking coffee at Starbucks.<br /><br />  Harry Bosch is on trial for shooting a serial killer.  It is a civil case so the stakes are lower (which reduces somewhat the amount of dramatic tension).  The fact that murders with the same M.O. keep continue to take place raises serious doubts about whether Bosch has shot the right killer.  Bosch is also trying very hard to maintain his relationship with the love of his life despite being under attack from all sides. This is a great mystery that certainly keeps your attention, especially if you are a fan of the Connelly/Bosch brand (as I am).  I give this mystery a 9 out of 10.
B004GYOQ6A|1.0|force closes on open on the galaxy tab.  please fix as looks like it would be fun with the tablet
087033039X|5.0|I've read this book before from the public library.This copy came in fine condition and I am very happy to have it. I have already started a couple of projects. Great book if you do leather work!
1594481938|3.0|3.5 really. definitely an interesting and a quick read. it's my first book by this author (though i have seen 2 of the movies based on his books) and i think i'll read some of the other books now too. i'd recommend the book w/the note that even though the main theme in the book is suicide it's not a dark, dreary book, there's quite a bit of humor in it and it really was an engaging book.
B004UXXVQS|5.0|Usually when I see a greatest hits package from a band it tells me, most of the time, that they're out of ideas.    Man, this album proves that all wrong, at least where Foo Fighters are concerned. Every song is just unique and greatly stands out on its own. I'm enjoying listening to this album front to back almost every day.    Thanks to the record exec(s) that let the drummer from Nirvana get out in front and play guitar and sing without insisting that he just play the drums.    I got it for $3.99, don't pass it up if it even goes up to $20.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is a bit longer than I expected. The book and story seemed to go on and on, however, I loved every bit of it. I learned so much about cells and the history of cancer. I love how the author explained the story in a way that the reader can feel the injustice that the Lacks family felt, yet understand the other side of the coin. This book should be used in biology classes to give a real face to the history of cancer/cell research. I like the mix of science and personal stories of those involved. I could imagine each person that was described in the story, the mannerisms and quirks, the emotions of each individual. I am glad I bought this.
B0034G4P8K|4.0|The autobots are now a part of the human military complex, and are threatened by the decepticons, who want to bring their world to earth. The autobots will be eliminated and humans will be their slaves. The autobots team with Sam Witwicky to save human civilization from destruction. The visuals in this film are absolutely stunning, and I was actually grabbed by the storyline in the film. It was interesting to see if the autobots would be able to fend off their bitter rivals. Sam Witwicky is still likeable, as is his new girlfriend. The 3D effect benefits this one, as the non-stop action really comes alive. This is good escapist entertainment.
B004QYZATW|3.0|SPOILER:  I agree with the last reviewer that they both did not look their best.  AJ's hair was truly ridiculous.  I really hated the ending.  I wanted him to be the math teacher and plastic surgery plot twists never worked for me-its just not believable.  And I wanted to hate the other guy-I wanted him to abandon her at the end and let the nice guy get the girl.  Also, Depp played the character as if he were the math teacher until the end.  On the train, there was no inkling that he was Alex, all his expressions seemed very genuine, like his reaction to this beautiful woman sitting with him.  Was Alex supposed to be an Oscar-winning actor?  The only problem with getting my wish that he really was the math teacher, is you could never see a woman like her falling for a guy like that, no matter how sweet or good-looking.  So in a way, they had to make the plot twist for a happy ending.  The solution?  Why did he have to be a math teacher?  They could have made him more interesting in his own right and fixed the problem.  On the bright side, Depp was charming as always in his inimitable way.  He plays innocents very well-that's why I think the character should have remained innocent-you wanted to believe in him.  AJ does show some depth and maturity here.  Some have said she was too expressionless, but one could also interpret that as minimalism.  Its better than over-acting, anyway.  There was too much focus on her looks but she was supposed to be a glamorous woman(or at least pretending to be-another problem-was she really believable as a govt agent?), so I'm not sure we should complain.  Sexually titillating, not a family film and a bit violent for my taste.  Not all bad, but a really disappointing ending, imho.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|i love this app. it is so easy to use and love the layout and color arangments. don't even have to open a specific date it automatically gives you a preview of the event on everyday without having to click on it
0596009208|5.0|I've never programmed in Java before, and this book is a great start! A great way to teach yourself the language!
0670022411|2.0|This book starts off well enough, with a reasonably capable and independent heroine who has issues (who doesn't?) but who can take care of herself.    By the end of the book, she's a subservient, completely dominated Mary Sue of epic proportions.  Her love interest might as well make her an actual puppet, for all she's \\"allowed\\" to think for herself anymore.    Let's not even get into the insane pile of mythic and long-lost-to-the-world powers she discovers along the way.    And what was with the chapters all about wine and food?    The author seems to have forgotten what she was doing partway through the book.  It's really a pity, because it might have been a decent story if it had picked a course and stuck to it.  Even a hackneyed retelling of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" with a supernatural veneer pasted on would have been more enjoyable than what this became.    (But at least the vampires don't sparkle.)
B0015AARJI|5.0|Certainly perfect quality and usability. You need it if you want to play with friends at one PS3 console (not over internet). Perfect for fightings, races and more others cooperative or versus games.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was great.  Recorded digitally, no doubt.  I would say \\"perfect\\", but the faces seemed to lack detail.  Maybe it was too much make-up.  It looked like it was presented in 2.40:1 aspect ratio.<br /><br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was excellent.  Great surround sound and sub-woofer bass.<br /><br />I thought the movie itself was very good.  I don't believe the real inventor of Facebook is very fond of the movie, because it makes him look like a total a-hole.
B003XSSR4W|5.0|Mastering was done by the big guns at Abbey Road Studios and they did a great job! considering the time factor.<br />Bad finger was a great band that just had the sad sad luck of no other band on this earth! Do some research on them,it truly will make you cry. On a high note once again this is a must for the Badfinger collection!
B003D8KH9A|5.0|This is so nice for those pools that are too big to dump regularly, but are too small to chlorinate easily.  Keeps dirt and stuff out and helps keep algae from growing...plus keeps the pool water warm.
B000001GKC|4.0|It is important to judge this recording on its own merits. The fact that it was Herbie's last recording, underlined by the valedictory photograph on the cover, should be ignored.<br /><br />As in his performances of the Mozart Requiem, Herbie progressively sped up in the Bruckner 7th over time. His magisterial EMI recording from 1970 went for 21:49 in the first movement. Time dovetails into timelessness ([[ASIN:B0009NDKV4 Bruckner: Symphony No. 7]]). This 1989 alternative clocks up 19:42 (and the 1976 recording is halfway between [[ASIN:B00000E3F6 Bruckner: Symphony No. 7]]). Such a reduction is significant. To my ears, it lessens the hypnotism. When coupled with a more lithe instrument than the Berliners - in this instance, the Vienna Philharmonic - it is hardly surprising that some have espied a lack of grip in proceedings compared with the two precedessors.<br /><br />It comes down to preference. I am a sucker for Bruckner on the slow side. Others demur. This is one of the few Karajan recordings to secure the imprimatur, no less, of Norman Lebrecht, the flagellator of conductors (and sometimes his own delicate rump).<br /><br />One thing is sure: Herbie's grip on the coda of the First Movement is wondrous. Only Furtwangler can be mentioned in the same breath. With swords beaten into plowshears, let's end on that note.
B001HN691I|2.0|While this movie has good animation, cool characters and average action scenes, it doesn't have any comedy or charm, it's noisey as hell, its filled with bad writing and it's story is highly mediocre. Skip this flick, if u really wanna see a movie like this; watch the first movie. 2.5/10
0321701763|5.0|I was very pleased with this book and the accompanying CD. I am halfway through the lessons and already I have advanced my Photoshop skills greatly! Wonderful educational tool.
0062060554|2.0|I thought the premise of the novel was exciting and creative and I looked forward to receiving the book on kindle. I was very disappointed; the storyline had large gaping holes and I felt like I had to suspend my rational mind to believe this story. The author rushed the writing and did not take the time to create a cohesive unit. I am giving her 2 stars because the book is her first attempt.
B004XIQIPQ|4.0|Arctic Monkeys did it again. I purchased this item for my girlfriend, who's a bigger fan than me, but I admit this album is full of good songs. A little too melodic and slow at the end and, frankly, not a very right choice to have selected \\"brick by brick\\" as a single, being undoubtedly the worst song of all. Still, a very good and unique album.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I love this show. In fact im probably obsessed. the dvd is expensive but worth it. i love this show soooo much i read the books and wow...its so much drama but with a horror spin on it, which is what i love. it will leave you wanting and begging for more. watch it tuesdays @abc family 8/7 central.  ~N
B0001ADB8C|5.0|Joni Mitchel once wrote that her life has been a search por inner peace and music. Word by word this could be the epitaph of George Harrison. This box set proves that, song by song, lyric by lyric, album by album, George Harrison is the best solo beatle by far.  I know that many people dislikes this item in particular, nevertheless here we found songs that cover all aspects of life and does it with ease, elegance, style and ageless grace. John Lennon and Paul McCartney do records, Harrison creates albums that have a life itself with no compromise, no doubt, no sorrow...just the celebration of a great life.  I think that Lennon did not deserve the 5 shots that kill him. I also think that Lennon does not deserve be turn into a martyr. Lennon is, maybe, the most overestimated rock musician in all times (next to Jim Morrison).   Ten years ago Harrison died. He was a man, not a martyr.  He was a musician, not a politician.  He was the best...and time has prove it.
B002ZG99IG|5.0|The Roommate is a thriller about a collage freshman who gets a crazy roommate. The movie...its pretty good. Im not sure why it got bad reviews. The film is sorta like a remake Of SWF but it doesnt make it bad. the acting is really good and Meester and Michalka's Performances were amazing.Kelly Was ok...however, her acting at the end made up for the beginning. the directing was Weird in a good way. Two things....they could of made it a tad scarier and also, they could of added more to the plot. But the film was good, and of course, i bought the DVD!<br />~N
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I just finished this book as a light summer read and enjoyed it.  It's sort of a Twilight for grown-ups with the exception that none of the characters are human....picture a monster mash of characters in business suits  driving sport cars to their chalets and riding around on their multimillion dollar estates on horseback.  It's a fun beach read and I am looking forward to the sequel.  I don't, however, think this would be a good choice for my book club, so I will not be suggesting it as a potential title.  There's not enough discussion meat to it.  Maybe the sequel....
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Fun game, but stopped opening and I was very far. All of my unlocked levels were suddenly gone. Also, a lot of ads, and interrupts a game for ads. Needs to be fixed.
0316056863|5.0|I could NOT put this book down from the moment I started reading it! It was hilarious. Since I am also a fan of 30 Rock, I couldn't help but hear Tina's voice in my head as I read it.     True to her form, voice, and style, this book is a MUST for Tina Fey fans and for those who enjoy a good laugh.     Great read!
B004SBX112|1.0|Title says it all. The summer update requires a wifi connection for new levels or it exits the program without warning, and simply just won't work. What's the point of having it on a mobile phone if you need wifi?
0316098329|5.0|I almost gave up after 20 pages but read the flyleaf comment by Michael Cunningham and decided to read further.  I'm pretty sure that anything I say will be redundant here.  A wonderful, chilling, thought-provoking book which one reader noted \\"stays with you for days\\".  Yes, it did bring to mind Plato's Allegory of the Cave.  Using Jack as the narrator was brilliant as in \\"Strange Case of the Dog in the Night\\" ( i may have mangled that title but readers will understand).<br />The book was SO good that I'm afraid to read anything else by the author in fear of being let down, but I'll try!

0307877523|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend that I had not seen for over a year.  He had lost 60 lbs and naturally I wanted to know how.  I purchase audio books to fill my time in the car so it was a few weeks before I got started implementing the book's concepts.  The great thing about this book is that it is not a diet at all which is actually a bit frustrating at first. You have to find your own recipes and I did not want to get out my old Atkins book to get recipes because that only reminded me that this would require me to change my diet.  This book is about thinking not about recipes.  It makes you think! I had stopped wanting to think about what I was eating a long time ago.  But now I do think and it is working though slower than I had hoped; I'm 50.  No doubt it is the low carb concept but with all the reasons why.  So when things get tough and three weeks later it is still tough, you can think (or cry) your way through those tough times.  I'm not hungry but I do miss my sugar, cookies, doughnuts, etc. I'm an RN and I had an uncle that was an old country doctor; the kind that made house calls.  He passed away years ago but I remembered when I was in college he told me to give up starches and bread to lose weight. I thought he was just too old to understand the new \\"fat makes you fat\\" fad but even then he was right. The most fascinating thing I learned through this book is how ancient the low carb diet is. This is what they used to fight diabetes before there were drugs.  I would recommend this book to anyone. The only thing about this audio book is I had a hard time trying to figure out how to get the pdf pamphlet; there were no instructions.
B002WYH5N2|5.0|The Acting.  The drama.  The special attention to every poised detail best describes and places this remake-masterpiece into it's proper frame.  Sometimes excellent productions do require more funding and this one had it.  Make no mistake, the kids of today know little of exceptional cinema and what it is, or, use to be; but, from time to time one still comes shining thru on occassion.  The beleivability is stunning and memorable, describing to kind of ongoing love we all wish for.   See for yourself.  Walk emotionally into the screen itself and live afresh and be renewed.  Not all have this kind of destined love, though, for us that do, we relish the thoughts of this heavenly blessing!!
B00008G7UJ|2.0|I love the story of Romeo and Juliet, BUT this version is not my cup of tea, it seems to comical, nothing can compare to the Leonard Whiting / Olivia Hussy version, which is a classic.

B000M5AJQI|4.0|After all the hype surrounding this movie, I found it didn't live up to all the fanfare surrounding it.  I wasn't too impressed with it and felt disappointed after watching it.  Most movies I watch and feel this way, I tend to keep my initial reaction even after trying it for a second time.  This movie, however, I have grown to like more after the second and third time watching.  I don't feel I appreciated the acting as much the first time, because I kept comparing it to other movies the actors in it have made, and felt let down.  I didn't give it justice for its own movie, separate from all the many others they have made.  The ending still is not my favorite, but the rest of it is action-packed.      Leonardo Dicaprio has easily turned into one of my favorite actors.  Though he has been in movies I didn't care for (the other one with Kate Winslet that is not Titanic), most of his movies I am taken aback by how great his acting is.  It really helps add to the movie, and I have come to appreciate it a lot more.  Though he has been nominated and won some Oscars, he may be one of the most under-appreciated actors out there.  Matt Damon is another I have quickly grown to like, though his character I don't feel any remorse for at all in the movie.        I love the intensity in which both of the two main undercovers played their respective character.  It made me feel scared for Leo and I could see how torn he was in his predicament.

1926778103|4.0|The art in game and conceptually is just amazing.  The small little details within the character armor or items is great.  I'm in the process of buying this book, which to me is a no brainer.  It's unfortunate that the binding is weak and falls apart quickly, but I'm willing to sacrifice in order to own the art.  Worst case scenario is I can put the pages in a new binding.    The main reason of writing this review is the Amazon prices listed for this book are just completely outrageous.  $138 + for new or $70 + for used!????? Are the sellers on drugs????  This brand new paper back is anywhere from $30-40 anywhere I have checked.  Why amazon doesn't actually have any normal prices listed for it is beyond me.  I usually like to buy through amazon because their shipping is fast and other purchases I have done have all been great.  However, with this maniacal pricing, I will probably just head out to borders and get my copy there.  I haven't checked hard cover prices, but if it's not that much of increase in cost, it might be worth the extra money to have a solid binding and well put together book.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|I dont understand why people insist that loving dogs means I would like this book. I could not love dogs more. But this book started to irritate me from the first chapter when the dog started \\"talking\\" about being reincarnated as a human.  It is not a long book and it is a fast read so I stuck it out hoping it would get better. It didn't.  The author basically came up with his hook- the dog narrator- but does little with it. Author: \\"oh hey people will buy this book because its a story from a dog. and that dog REALLy loves his owner. And his owner REALLY loves him, and then I won't have to do much with story or character development and I can just have long expositions in place of plot because, see its a dog narrating!\\" The dog's voice is not convincing- yes I know this sounds ridiculous. But because its from the dog's point of view, it means that everyone has long conversations with the dog in ways that seem forced. The racing descriptions are overly long and tedious and as the book went on I realized I could just skim those passages; and I never skim. But it didn't matter here.  From the parts I slogged through I can tell you that you really won't miss much. I didn't think that a book could be pretentious and yet dull and badly-written, but this book is. I really wanted to like this book.  I really didn't like this book. but I am sure it made a good outline for the eventual movie. It sure reads like an outline.

0062060554|5.0|S. J. Watson has written an exceptional psychological thriller in BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP.  Quite honestly, I could not put BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP down; it kept me up late into the wee hours.  Suspenseful and disturbing, BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is one debut novel that is not to be missed.<br /><br />When Christine awoke this morning, she had no idea where she was, who was in bed with her, or how she had gotten there.  But the terrifying truth came when she looked in the mirror:  the face she saw in the mirror was not her own.  Christine was beyond shocked to see an older woman in the mirror, one who looked more like her mother than herself.  What Christine did not know, could not know was that she has amnesia, that she has lost over 20 years of her life, and that every morning, she loses it again.  You see, Christine cannot form new memories; 20 years ago, she suffered a traumatic brain injury, and she lost the ability to form and retain new memories.  Every day she wakes up, spends the mind-numbingly confused day learning about who she is and what has happened to her, and every night she goes to sleep and loses it all again.<br /><br />Until now.  Apparently, Christine was recently contacted by a doctor, Dr. Nash, who felt he could help her regain some of her memories, her life, and her sense of self.  Dr. Nash has Christine keeping a secret journal.  She is to write down everything...everything she remembers, everything she is told, everything that happens during each day.  She must write in her journal every night before she sleeps, or she will forget it all again.  Every morning, Dr. Nash calls her, tells her who he is, about the work they are doing together, and where her journal is.  And this technique seems to be working.  Christine seems to be remembering more about her past, her accident, and her life.  But she is also uncovering some horrifying inconsistencies.  Christine's husband Ben does not seem to be telling her the truth about many things.  As Christine continues along this path, she has no idea who she can trust or what is true.  And in the end, she begins to fear for her very life.  But is any of it true?  Or is she just spiraling further and further into insanity?<br /><br />BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is spellbinding.  My heart beat too fast; I became breathless.  This is truly an outstanding psychological thriller.  I felt completely caught up in Christine's search, in her devastation.  S. J. Watson creates a thrilling, chilling atmosphere that is hard to shake.  And the end, although a bit predictable, still has one final unexpected twist.  As a first novel, BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP speaks volumes about S. J. Watson's talent.  I hope to read more from him.  Well done!inues along this path, she has no idea who she can trust or what is true.

B0050CQY1W|2.0|It's not a bad cd it's just kind of generic, the songs sound the same she didn't mix things up and come out with different songs it's just blah. It kinda reminds me of another one of her albums with all the tracks are just her singing and it fell flat maybe she needs to rework it and add new singers. Just too mellow to many shades of grey, 1+ 1 sounds like Best Thing I Never Had; it sounds like she recycled old material and put a slight spin on it.
0307591549|5.0|This book reads very easily. I can also relate to the author - he brings up examples such as Seinfeld reruns and Grand Theft Auto Vice City which makes it interesting.     Principle #6 is probably the best principle of them all in my opinion - The 20 second rule. The first paragraph made me ask the same question the person who questioned Shawn Achor did. When I got to the end of the chapter it came to light.      Principle #7 is the one I liked the least. I tried to think of ways to incorporate this at work but without much luck. Maybe I need to incorporate the Zorro Circle on this first!      Why I read this book: (Not part of the review)  I finished reading this book over the course of three days. This is the first book I have ever read on Psychology. I am from an Engineering/Software background (non-Manager position) and a recent work project that I completed made me sit up. I first saw this book at a friends house in December last year and it belonged to his room mate. After reading the first chapter then, I recently picked up a copy for myself on Amazon.
0439023521|5.0|My Jr High-aged daughter and I struggled to share nicely when we were reading this first book of the three.  What a great story!  You get addicted immediately.  The characters are believeable, and so is the story.  It's futuristic in some ways, but so \\"today\\" in other ways.  My daughter asked me what my favorite parts are and there's no way I can choose a \\"favorite\\" part.  There are painful parts, sweet parts, and all are blended together into a great story that hits all your emotions at the same time.  She and I both have had a number of times when the story made us yell out, \\"NO! NO! You can't DO that! NOOOO!\\"  I devoured the second book and immediately bought the third in it's hardback version, and I HATE paying the price of a hardback. But I have to find out how the love triangle works out and how our beloved characters end up.  Three cheers for Suzanne Collins!

0062017926|3.0|I like historical fiction - a lot! Picked up this book at the local public library on a long weekend. It was my first James Rollins novel and I am left with mixed feelings.    When I read the premise before picking up the book, I was curious to find out more about Marco Polo's journey. The story line is interesting. But the writing itself leaves a lot to desire - too many cliches, inaccurate information, shallow characters, overload on the action....I can go on.    The version of the story regarding the \\"Churning of the Ocean\\" at Angkor Thom is way off. From what I can gather, he's taken existing theories/myths and modified them to suit the story. The story focuses so much on the action sequences that the characters don't have much room to develop. And the action doesn't sound believable. The writing was so predictable at times that I could guess the next sentences in a few of the scenes. Some of the metaphors used make you go \\"huh?\\".    I am glad that I got a library edition and didn't spend my money. That being said, I am going to try to read another book by Mr.Rollins to see if this was a fluke.

0553582038|3.0|This, the fourth in the series, turned out to be somewhat disappointing in light of the earlier books though you could see the problem developing in the earlier volumes as Martin plays what amounts to chapter roulette with his characters almost from the start, jumping from one character's story to another's with every chapter change. It's made for a difficult read at times because every time you get interested in what's going on with one character (and Martin is good at getting you interested!) he drops that story and jumps you to another. Most of his chapters do end well, leaving you wanting to know what happens next, but by the time the strand of each character's adventures picks up in subsequent chapters, you've all but forgotten what was going on and need  to re-orient yourself in the larger tale, even as you know you will lose the strand in the chapter you've just completed.<br /><br />This seemed to work satisfactorily in the first three books, despite the distractions it created. But by this, the fourth, it's really become a ponderous weight on narrative momentum. Also weighing this tale down is its shift in focus to what had previously been an array of secondary characters -- and the unfortunate tendency the author has of doing many of them in, just as they've really started to earn the reader's attention and sympathies. Moreover this tale is so tangled and drawn out that the various skeins never seem to tie back together into single narrative cloth. The characters are still chasing their tails around Westeros, coming and going to King's Landing where the increasingly vicious Queen Cersei is making a mess of things in the wake of the death of her father, Lord Tywin and her son King Joffrey in the last book and the refusal of her brother Jaime to resume his supportive role in their relationship after his mutilation by the slobbering mercenary leader Vargo Hoat. Faced with his own mortality and confronting his own past failings, Jaime has begun to reassess his life and doesn't like what he sees. To make amends he befriends his one-time guard and captor Brienne of Tarth who had been commissioned by the late Lady Catelyn Stark to exchange him for her captive daughters. But events on the road played havoc with that plan and Jaime eventually finds himself in charge of the Maid of Tarth. Seeking to regain his honor, he releases her to find the missing Stark girls, to fulfill the oath he had sworn to Lady Catelyn when she freed him. But Jaime, still a man of war, is eventually dispatched back to the battlefield by his vindictive sister Queen Cersei when he refuses to resume their former relationship with him in a supporting role.<br /><br />Meanwhile, little Arya Stark has made her way to Bravos by ship, after escaping Lord Beric's outlaws and the Hound, and there falls in with a religious cult of assassins who apparently promise to train her in their ways, building on the abortive fencing lessons given her by her one time Braavosi fencing master Syrio Forel who may (or may not) have died in the first book. Arya's had a tough time of it since Yoren smuggled her out of King's Landing, falling prey first to one group of marauders then another and always trying to find her way back to her mother and brother but never managing it.<br /><br />At the same time older sister Sansa Stark, still the dumbest character in all of fantasy literature, has finally been \\"rescued\\" from her captivity at King's Landing -- only to find herself part of an elaborate game set up by Littlefingers who is busy manipulating the players at King's Landing from a distance to make himself the real power in Westeros. Stupid Sansa is quickly enticed into Lord Petyr's schemes because he's nice to her (it doesn't take much more than that to fool this gal who manages to fool herself most of the time without half trying) and because she fears just about everyone else. She even takes to the deceptions Littlefingers inducts her into, eagerly accepting him as her father. Of course it was Littlefingers who betrayed her real father into the hands of Queen Cersei, costing Ned Stark his head (although in fairness it was actually stupid Sansa who confided Stark's plans to the Queen and thereby enabled Cersei to act before he could).<br /><br />Jon Snow, Stark's bastard son and now Lord Commander of the Night's Watch at the ripe old age of sixteen (maybe seventeen, depending on the time line), has sent his fat pal Samwell Tarley south to Old Town with blind Maester Aemon and Gilly, Craster's daughter and wife, to seek aid from the maesters in the Citadel while King Stannis Baratheon and his mad priestess of R'Hollar establish themselves in the north along the Wall in anticipation of the coming invasion of the White Walkers. Rumors of a young queen of Targaryen blood, and of her newly hatched dragons, have begun seeping westward from Slaver's Bay in the East and various players in Westeros begin to think the route to power lies through her.<br /><br />In Bravos Arya bumps into Samwell, who's been temporarily marooned there with his little party, but neither say enough to one another to figure out that they can help each other though Samwell is an emissary from Arya's half-brother and holds the secret of the survival of her two younger brothers. Back in Westeros, Brienne meets up with Arya's old traveling companion, Gendry the blacksmith's apprentice, and guesses his secret which even he doesn't know and almost manages to tell him that he is a bastard son of the late King Robert Baratheon, but is conveniently interrupted just as she's about to spill the beans by the arrival of old enemies. Brienne, a homely maid of powerful physique has chosen to become a knight, in the face of the unchivalrous derision of the noble knights she has known, and manages to prove her honor and nobility in this volume by running around in circles in search of the missing Sansa and Arya, albeit to no avail, and finally chooses honor over surrender when faced with the ultimate test.<br /><br />And there's a plot to kidnap King Tommen's older sister, Princess Myrcella, whom Tyrion Lannister had previously sent to the Dornish Prince Doran to foster while, among the Iron Isles, the Ironborn choose a new king after King Balon's death, and embark on a campaign of plunder and rapine in the absence of the king's peace. At the Red Keep, Queen Cersie lurches from plot to plot, alienating more and more of her supporters including her father's brother, Kevan Lannister, who refuses to help her son King Tommen when she won't step aside and return to Casterly Rock as Lord Tywin, her father, had planned. The queen, convinced she is, herself, the rightful successor to her late father proceeds to elevate sycophants and lackeys while scheming against those around her out of a growing paranoia. But as one of her aunts tells Jaime late in the book, at the seige of Riverrun, Lord Tywin did in fact have a son who was his match in wits and boldness but it was neither Jaime nor his ambitious sister, but the dwarf Tyrion who slew his Lord father to avenge a great wrong the man had done him.<br /><br />This book suffers from an overabundance of storylines and somewhat less interesting characters than its predecessor volumes. Worse, it's less focused than the others and, unlike its predecessors, each of which ended solidly, even if they still left you up in the air, this one seems to end in a whimper. A brief afterword from the author promises more to come but it seemed out of character, the author attempting to win us to the next volume by explicit promises instead of the suspense of the plot. Although the disparate storylines have generally held my interest this last book proved more chore than pleasure by the end.<br /><br />Stuart W.

I feel that he does for the cello suites what Rachel Podger did for the sonatas and partitas (never mind what the Gramophone says, sometimes I think they wouldn't have a clue) - puts a new angle on the whole manuscript.  Plenty of stiff competition of course - I love Hidemi Suzuki, Jaap Ter Linden and Peter Wispelwey - but Queyras is on an exalted level.  Very fresh, deep, robust, lyrical and technically astonishing.  He sings, he sobs, he dances.  Fast here and there but always handled beautifully (unlike Heinrich Schiff who went like a bull at a gate).  Fine recorded sound, plenty reverb as it's recorded in a church, but good detail too.  And that gorgeously rich cello tone.  Mmmmm.  Enthralling all the way.

B0038M61I2|5.0|I wanted to celebrate the Fourth of July by remembering the the unique creativity of American jazz. I first read a recent new short book by Kevin Whitehead about this American art form. [[ASIN:0199731187 Why Jazz?: A Concise Guide]].  Whitehead's book highly praises Sonny Rollins' 1957 album \\"Way out West\\" which is in my collection.  I hadn't heard it for awhile. Therefore, I decided to rehear it in celebration of the American culture that American independence ultimately helped to bring about.<br /><br />Way out West is a classic recording in every way, including the cover photo by William Claxton which shows Rollins dressed as a gunslinger in the desert holding his saxophone. The recording has been reissued many times.  I am reviewing the most recent reissue in 2010, which has not been reviewed on Amazon before now.  But the prior 1991 reissue garnered many exellent Amazon reviews from which I learned a great deal.  In 1988, reissues of this recording began to include three alternative takes not included in the 1957 initial release, substantially expanding the length of the recording.<br /><br />Way out West was recorded shortly after Rollins' famous album \\"Saxophone Collossus\\" and has unfortunately tended to remain in its shadow.  It was a pioneering recording in its own right. Rollins did not use the piano and the opportunity for chordal background it afforded.  Instead, the recording consisted of the trio of Rollins, tenor saxophone, Ray Brown, bass, and Shelly Manne, drums. The small combo and the absence of piano allowed for a tighter sound and increased opportunity for improvisation.<br /><br />The album gets its theme from three \\"western\\" tracts in which Rollins shows his ability to make imaginative, appealing music from trite material.There is great improvisatory fantasy along with humor in these songs.  In the well-known \\"I'm and old Cowhand\\" by Johnny Mercer, Rollins' has much fun with the melody as he embellishes it with sudden low tones, runs, and squacks.  He takes a long solo with extended runs. The clop-clop sound of the percussion adds a great deal.  The next song \\"Wagon Wheels\\" is a hokey tune with a slow mellow saxophone line embellished by Brown's walking bass and a flashy drum solo.  The final western song, \\"Way out West\\" is a Rollins composition embellished for all it is worth. In his book cited above, Whitehead discusses this piece as follows (p. 79):<br /><br />\\"The tune 'Way out West' ambles at a leisurely horseback lope and conveys the easy melodicism of a kid's song,ending with a paraphrase of Bing Crosby's 'Swinging on a Star'. But the 20-bar tune takes some weird turns, touching on several keys and all 12 notes in the chromatic scale.  In his solo, Rollins deconstructs its rhythms and melody in a way that's somehow good-natured and corrosive at once. That's very Monk-like. as is his appreciation for space.  Rollins trills at length, barks out phrases, slurs and distorts his line, harps on a couple of braying figures, and shows off a gloriously bleating tone.\\"<br /><br />The remaining three songs show different sides of Rollins. \\"Come, Gone\\" is Rollins' own virtuoso composition with long, soaring uptempo lines for his saxophone with flashy solos for both bass and drums. \\"There is no greater love\\" is a slow deeply-felt religious ballad. \\"Solitude\\" is a Duke Ellington composition, much recorded, which receives a lyrical reading from the Rollins trio.<br /><br />I was happy to use Independence Day to think about the freedoms we enjoy and the creativity freedom has allowed, as shown by Sonny Rollins in his \\"Way out West\\" album and, broadly, by American jazz. In its rambunctiousness, discipline, and iconoclasm, the music is an important part of American experience.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanlo with extended runs.

Even professional engineers got it wrong sometimes. Why? Not because they didn't know what they were doing, but because I didn't. Reverb? Sure. Uh, what kind? Blend, size, tone, sustain, or spread? Artificial or convolution? You can use some, all, or none. (\\"I didn't know that!\\") Delay? Sure. Uh, what kind? Blend, size, etc., etc.... (\\"I didn't know that!\\") Balancing? Room treatments? Monitoring? I'd go into the million-dollar studios and they've got these teeny, cheesy, awful-sounding speakers right on top of the console. Right where everybody can see! Do I want to hear my mix through those...things?! Hell, no, put it through those $50K jobs I see up on the wall! Auratones! What the hell's going on with that? (...\\"Oh! I didn't know that!\\")    In fact, just about every page of this relatively (300 pages of text) modest tome demanded that I stop reading, go into my studio, and find out just what the heck this guy is talking about. (\\"So that's what a gate's for. I didn't know that!\\")    And this is WAY before you get to the incredible -- and usually unique -- solutions detailed in every Mix Rescue on his SoundOnSound magazine page. (A massive archive that stands on its own, I might add.)    Watch out, though. Mike is a big fan of freeware -- and there's a LOT of it out there. (I counted almost 100 compressors in my VST folder last week -- most of them free or nearly so. Mike uses a lot of them. And that's just compressors. I say again: there's a LOT of stuff out there, most of which you don't even have to look very hard for. EQ's, delays, reverbs, synths (a LOT of synths). Again, free. Then you get to the audio mangling. (Mike is not above this, either: Glitch Girl? Say no more.... Except there's 20 other free plugins on this page. What does this one do?....) Mind you, some of these referenced apps are dated (incompatible with Windows 7) or currently unavailable, but for every one of these, ten more are filling the niche it vacated.    The material presented here is informative, as well as informed by Mike's not-so-dry British wit (my favorite: \\"Now, as everybody knows, the best processing for slap bass is that button labelled 'Mute'\\"...).    I have lived a long and happy life filled with sex, drugs, and rock and roll. But before I started reading Mike Senior's book, it had never contained so many consecutive 4 a.m. bedtimes.    Excuse me, I have to stop writing now. I have to check something in my studio....
1433502410|4.0|I was looking for a Bible other than the NIV to offer new insight to God's word. The ESV is just the ticket. The notes at the bottom are helpful but sometimes it seems the author was reaching too far or thinking too deep about things. Overall, I'm enjoying a fresh outlook.
B0016A2FFG|4.0|Al Green is a great performer and singer.  I remember seeing him on Soul Train when he first started singing. This was an CD that I still play to day....keep up the classy and soulful singing Al!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This was a good read - my husband recommended it to me because he knows I like the dystopian romantic futuristic books.  It was a little weird at first, but I got really into it and finished the book within a week or two.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's into dystopian romance.  The romantic part of this is nothing crazy - just a high school kid crush really.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Movie was very strange. I bought this movie b/c I needed a movie about governmental control for my humanities class.  Everyone I spoke w/ suggested this movie. This movie was strangely weird but addicting.  I watched it over and over again so I could write an accurate paper but I found myself liking the characters. This movie is considered a classic: a movie everyone should see before they die.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|Great movie that accurately depicts Spains waning empire with the defeat in Flanders. Historically accurate with some artistic liberties in the script. Can be considered a grand Historical novel.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I'm slowly catching up with this show because, not only are the plots/sets/characters completely amazing, but the audio commentaries by creator Matthew Weiner are really insightful and hilarious to listen to while re-watching the episodes. I love when people refer to this show as \\"boring\\". It immediately lets me know that we are not going to get along (unless they're really hot, and then I can fake a conversation, just like on the show). With the exception of \\"Breaking Bad\\", I can't think of a higher quality show that's currently on TV.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|A friend and I like to categorize people into two camps.  Those with fur.  And those without fur.  By all accounts, Dexter would \\"appear\\" to be quite bald, indeed!  Bald as the (real life) nut job (Jared Lee Loughner) that took out all those Tucsonians at the turn of this year, in one heinous act.  However, upon closer and more frequent introspection - I believe (the fictionalized) Dexter, is in essence, fur laden to the brim of (in)sanity.  However, warm and fuzzy is not the nature of this pelt.  Think cold, bristly and carnivorous - polar bear.      Although, Dex is a serial killer, he is a serial killer with a code.  Instilled into him by his revered, foster father, cop - now a decade, dearly departed and relived through memories and flashbacks.  Dexter relegates his feeding frenzy only unto his own kind.  Yes, that's right - the serial killer's, serial killer!  The ones who slip through the judicial cracks, getting off \\"scott free\\".  Or those who fly below the radar, able to keep their sKILLS all to themselves, or so they think.  Or those that do not actually pick up a weapon and do the actual deed themselves, but manipulate the victims to 'off' themselves; or frame another nut job to do their dirty work for them.  I've learned, through one season, there are many forms of serial killers.  Very few of them actually run around wielding a knife \\"Psycho\\" style.  The better ones are much more subtle.  More clever.  More organized.  But, it takes one to know one, which is why Dexter is such an asset at the Miami Police Department, where he works as a blood splatter analyst.  Having the inside scoop really helps in his line of \\"work\\".  Fitting right in with the boys, his potty mouthed sister works as an ambitious, lovelorn cop in the same precinct among the excellent cast of cops and support crew, each with their own endearing differences; the outrageous, witty banter can't be beat.  The office has more politics than Washington, DC plus all the press posturing that goes with it.  Dexter even comes complete with girlfriend.  Rita, who's fur needs a good fluffing, has her own set of intimacy issues, since her jailbait husband pillaged her village and she's left in her own private Idaho to do what little she can to connect with Dexter.  Of whom is so secretly empty, he rather likes the company, on his own terms - at arm's length.  Rita's two, well cared for, kids provide a nice buffer between the couple, too.      All in all, those of us whom can relate to Dexter, can sense our own dark side and addictions.  Maybe none so deep, dark and compelling as serial killing - but it is part of the human condition to hide, and/or do battle, and/or ignore, and/or stuff our own private wolves underneath skin.  Perhaps, we, like Dexter, who's struggles to come to a certain level of survival through personal acceptance - need to find a suitable channel for our dark side?  As it appears, by so many of our modern day headlines that these wolves have a way of slipping out sideways.  But, then there's always extinguishment.  Or is this only folly?  So there you have it - 'Dexter' in a NUT shell.  I haven't been on \\"tv crack\\" like this since my buddy Tony and his boys from Jersey (Sopranos) were around.  I have heard, for a long time, this serial killer show was pretty good.  Because I don't like to fuel my addictions, I have avoided it, altogether to date.   Ahhhh but, as of now, I am hopelessly addicted to the dark, charmingly - disarming 'Dexter'.[[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter: The First Season]]
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire picks up where book one left off. The capitol is still in control and Katniss is more desperate than ever to protect her community and over throw them. This book was well written and a definite page turner. Young teens to very old adults alike can enjoy this book.
B000YDCFRE|5.0|It is more than i expected. Used? Dont seem like. Excelent purchase. For some one who wants to be sure about timberland size, this boots 9.5m us are 28.3cms. They are a regular width.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss is the ultimate big sister, who volunteers to enter a match that means certain death for 23 other children. The book is an easy read and will have you staying up until you finish the book.
1594202710|5.0|I'm a Chinese, and I didn't give much expectation before I've bought this book. After two pages of reading, I was astonished. I's an amazing book, Kissinger gives a very different perspective on discussing China. I haven't finished it yet, but I am already recommending it to people around.    I even discussed this with my father, who is a scholar in Chinese history and literature but have no knowledge on English. I would love to translate the whole book to my father.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|Hot Fuzz is one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  I also really like Shaun of the Dead and the tv show Spaced.  I was skeptical about Paul just from the trailer but I thought, hey, its these guys, its not possible for them to be unfunny.      Soooo, I choose to believe (so that my hero worship can stay intact) they they didn't actually write this movie.  Nope, it never happened.  It was the collaboration of a below average 7th grader and one of those super smart monkeys from Project X.  I mean, sure, Virgil knows the sign for apple but can he tell a joke?  No, he can not.    Seriously, any American comedian could have done this movie.  There was none of the subtlety that makes British comedy so magical.  If I wanted cheap humor, I'd have gone to see Hot Tub Time Machine.  I expected more from you two.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie had it all..... but the main thing is it's entertaining throughout and til the very end.  What is it they say - just cause you don't have a (college) degree doesn't make you any less intelligent.  Same with this movie - an Oscar it may not have won but it is no less entertaining.  Depending on what you're looking for I guess.  This movie kept me interested til the end - no potty breaks either.  Dancing was fabulous, costumes gorgeous, nice visuals for sure and, whether or not you like Cher, she can still sing (and looks great to boot!)  And, Christina, well what can one say, she's that \\"triple threat\\" - can sing, dance AND act.
1416955070|4.0|I almost never swoon at the hot leads in these YA books.  If I'm going to dig anybody, given the choice, I usually like the quasi-geeky supporting guy.    And then there's Jace.  Poor, lonely, emotionally scarred, super hot, Jace Wayland.  He's got him some daddy issues...and some guilt issues...and, then, some more guilt issues...and some issues about his issues.  It gets a little tedious but I'm a sucker for a man in need.   It won't be everyone's cup of tea but I would recommend this book all about Jace Wayland.      Oh, and I think there are some other characters.  I seem to remember a girl - Clara, or Climey, something like that.
1936719118|5.0|An easy 1-2 hour read that will inspire those who may be \\"stuck\\". His website/blog/animated videos are also great ([...]).     The book is an excerpt of how Sivers was rejected by the big record labels and then decided to post his own music on the web for sale. This was several years before PayPal was even invented and iTunes was still many years away. In building this hobby into a business, it was always about the \\"artists\\" and sharing their music. After \\"maximizing\\" his company and the \\"joy\\" of running it had lost its luster, he sold it for a cool $22MM... and largely gave it all charity and reinvested into supporting independent music distribution.     Some of the key quotes that caught my attention:    - If it's not a hit, switch  - I Miss the Mob   - Obvious to You. Amazing to Others   - If you think life's purpose needs to hit you like a lightning bolt, you'll overlook the little day-to-day things that fascinate you; if you think revolution meeds to feel like war, you'll overlook the importance of simply serving people better.   - Ideas are just a multiplier of execution   - Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working.   - Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.     Sivers reminded me to \\"pay close attention to when you're being the real you and when you're trying to impress the invisible jury\\" (similar to Marcus Buckingham Go Put Your Strengths to Work). His words struck at my own motivations and pressure/stress that I self-inflict.     He also encourages through his book to innovate, and ignore how many others may have already executed the same idea... build upon the idea/service/product. Don't wait for the perfect idea. Experiment and start building with incremental improvements along the way.     Thanks to Sivers for an inspirational, quick but meaningful read.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I was staying up until the early morning hours to read this book. I loved the reference in the story to have Michael McConahey play the lead in the possible movie.
0061784788|1.0|this is not my favortes of Mr. Rolling books all of his other books i LOVE just not this one.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|Wish I could give it more stars- I like Eckhart, but this movie is not good. Just a remake of   Independance Day. The movie just stays on the same track of killing aliens (nothing exciting).
078401213X|5.0|I've always enjoyed Darren Aronofsky's point of view of the human mind, though he is a bit of an acquired taste.  I purchased Pi long ago off a bargain rack.  I hated it on the first view but thought there's something to this film I'm not getting.  It sat for years on the movie shelf, even making its way into the \\"sell\\" bin several times but I always pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.      When we upgraded our system to HD I watched it again.  Now I hated it even more due to the intentional film style.  Back it went to the shelf but there was a nagging thought that I'm still missing something.      Finally, one Saturday as I was deciding what movie to watch I saw Pi hibernating on the shelf.  I grabbed it and thought about watching it with the director's comments.  BINGO!!!!  Not only was Darren surprisingly entertaining, he explained with a dry wit all the things that drove me crazy in the film.  Plus he went into fun backstory detail how he was able to complete the movie on a $60k budget.  When I watched the movie again I was able to see the film from his POV and it went from no stars to five stars for me and became a personal favorite.      For all those who enjoy the film and want to be entertained, watch the director's comments.  For those who hate the movie, the director's comments will give the film meaning.
B004EPYZU8|1.0|Combine extremly out of place, unexplained action sequences with the most wretchedly depressing storylines I have ever seen. I can sum it up like this. A group of young women are sexually and physically abused constantly, then imagine that they are fighting robots and all this nonsense (I am actually a fan of this genre), when in reality their situation constantly gets worse. None of the absolutely disgusting villains get whats coming to them, there is no closure or justice whatsoever. Watching this movie is like molesting a mentally challenged person, then giving them a lollypop to suck on and telling them to 'pretend it never happened' that is the same sleazy, shameful feeling you get watching this horrible movie. I was shocked at how wrong this movie was. Very sad, horrible, depressing, exploitive, wretched, miserable movie.. easily one of the worst I have EVER seen.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's book A New Earth is a treasure, his philosophy (although he doesn't call it that) is one that makes perfect sense, and is practical and easy to understand. He talks about the current state of humanity and how the ego is preventing the unhappy people to become peaceful. The explanations and examples are spot on and describes why people act the way they do, why they're always talking about the future or trying to identify with material. Once you understand and apply what he says you will feel as if a boulder has been lifted off your shoulders, and you'll be at peace. This book also is one that sticks with you, unlike others which have bogus philosophies and make you feel good to begin with then feel bad as time goes on. I highly recommend this one.
0316098329|5.0|Another book that I delayed reading due to all the hype that preceded its release and after the release. I am glad I waited, but absolutely thrilled that the ladies of one of my book clubs picked this book out to read this year. I didn't read any of the reviews before diving in.<br /><br />Now onto my review - A heart wrenching tale of a mother who is trying with all her might to protect her son from her kidnapper, but at the same time keeping him from knowing what is in the outside world that he is missing. Esentially she has made a world for him so he doesn't understand that his situation is different from anyone else's \\"normal.\\" Some may think this weird of her - I find her to be heroic to not expose her son to the reality of the world they are trapped in while making sure that is enjoying their current status.<br /><br />Without spoiling the ending for those of you who have not had the opportunity to pick this one up - the second half is very different from the first. I am still struggling as to which half I enjoyed more.<br /><br />Because this book is written from Jack's perspective, the story is much easier to handle. At times I had a difficulty understanding what he was describing because I couldn't always get his 5 year old mind set and language. As I don't have children, I may not react to this book as my mom and sister will, but I think both groups should read and will enjoy this one.
B001GCUER0|5.0|For me the quintessential episode of this season is 2.5 \\"The New Girl\\".  Although the title is explicitly in reference to Don's new secretary, Jane, it is his relationship with his former secretary and pioneering woman copywriter Peggy that is the centerpiece of this episode.  It is Peggy who Don calls to bail him out of a drunk driving arrest while out with the wife of comic and client Jimmy Barrett.  Don's falling back on his standard and signature modus operandi of \\"forgetting\\" troubling past events, evokes an illuminating flashback in which Don visits Peggy in the hospital after she gives birth to the illegitimate child fathered by Pete Campbell.  As he sits by her bedside Don strongly urges a traumatized Peggy to \\"forget\\" what had happened and move forward.  This scene, more than any other that I can call to mind, evokes a caring side of Don that one might never expect to see.  In Don, Peggy has found the perfect mentor, as Don no doubt sees her as a person like himself from a humble background who has had to make his or her way in a world of those born with money and status--while leaving the world of one's troubled past far behind.

B004RUF9DC|1.0|What is the point of Blue Ray and HD if the technology is wasted on this dreadful transfer? Extremely bad job. Don't buy it and vote with your pocket.
0312330537|5.0|I will never forget this book and when, in a few years, I'll reread it, I will enjoy it just as much, if not more, the second time.  I can't wait for that time to come.
B001853NZK|2.0|So disappointed. I got this for my son for Christmas and the entire edge was ripped down the seam. I guess this company doesn't inspect before sending.
B0058VW36U|5.0|OK, 'Cut The Rope' totally lives up to the hype and now that it's finally available for Android devices, I couldn't wait to grab it and join the fun! This is a really solid port, and runs great on my Droid Incredible. The look and sound of this game is charming and addictive! The music especially adds just the right touch of whimsy! I can't stop playing. Send help! :)
0525425578|1.0|Did not realize this was a \\"children's book\\" written by Grisham as nowhere did I see any mention of that fact.  Consequently I was very disappointed in my purchase of this book.  Even after I read the book I thought it was a pretty lame story.
B0055FR5PS|2.0|Most Sci-Fi epics require suspension of disbelief.  That's a given.  But please!   Aliens cross interstellar space in mighty ships to annihilate earth's occupants and suck up earth's water.  A Marine platoon faces off against them in L.A.  After a seemingly endless series of tedious battles between a few gung-ho soldiers and the aliens, the aliens lose?  They're on the run?  Get real.  Marines are tough, but my advice to them under the circumstances:  Bend over, grab your ankles and kiss your a** goodbye.     Silly story, decent special effects.   If all you're looking for is mindless action, then this is the movie for you.
B000BT97AO|5.0|This is another version of Alice in Wonderland. Just like Pans Labyrinth and so on. And this may be the reason why you don`t like it. \\"Same story. Nothing new\\" \\"Just weird art\\". Ok, i did not hear you say that when you watched James Bond for the thousand time..... This is not Roland Emmerich nor Michael Bay. This is made by persons who actually got a visual different idea where you need something called FANTASY to create. This is not special effect where you need a sickening amount ot money to make. This is special effects where you need to think to create. It may not be obvious and easy like eating at McDonald or listening to Usher. This is art where you get a chance to concentrate. And oh my god do we need to be reminded about that in todays entertainment- buisness....   It`s dark, mystical, cryptical, poetic, exentric and not for children. I`m pretty shure a lot of people who enjoy this, also like Tom Waits, Neil Gaiman, Zappa, Salvadore Dali, Bjørk and other \\"strange\\" form of uncommon beauty. Also check out Keanoshow. A collection of shorts from the same director.  Thank you Dave McKean and rip Jim Henson.

B0009P5YXO|2.0|I got this sonic screw driver to add to my Doctor Who collection.  For that purpose it was ok. As a toy for a child, it is a piece of junk. It is very cheaply made, the bottoms only work if you fiddle with them. A toy made of solid plastic and operated by imagination would have been much better. It really is cheaply made and would only last five minutes if played with.
B002NPUCF8|2.0|Not knowing much about Steel Panther (other than the Van Halen tribute band stuff), I decided to check 'em out on this release.  Being able to get it as an LP was a real plus (on purple vinyl, no less!).  The over-the-top look of the band on the cover is a pretty dead giveaway to what you'll hear inside, but be warned:  as others have mentioned, SP is a self-described \\"parody\\" band; in fact, this is very clearly written on the back cover of the record.  Listening to \\"Feel the Steel\\" is very much what I wanted, musically:  a return to the '80s cock-swagger that I enjoyed at 16.  Lyrically, however, this album is barely listenable.  I get it, I get it:  it's a joke.  Right.  Okay.  The lyrics are so crude, though, they don't come across as the fetishistic fantasies of Sunset Strip sleaze rockers.  It's rather more like listening to songs written by horny 12-year-olds who are years away from getting laid...they're just so puerile and ridiculous that the effect is to take away from what is, at it's core, pretty decent metal.  *shrugs* Make up your own mind how much that matters to your listening enjoyment.
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|What a wonderful recording.  Kaufmann is one of my favorite singers and I'm always happy to be able to hear him sing again and again.  I heard him in a recital this year singing German lieder.   It was like being present at a concert for a rock star--there was foot stomping, prolonged clapping and cheering plus a number of encores.  Heard  him again  in the Met Opera's production of Die Walkure albeit the simulcast where he starred again.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I love this CD I blast up the volume and dance the whole time my husband and kids also like her music
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I really don't understand the studios...  $90 USD for a trilogy that doesn't even includes the \\"Original Versions\\"? I still have hope of an \\"Ultimate Set\\", with all the versions and a fantastic packing.  I am so tired of these Box Sets and thiny little box sets, and re-releases...and it's all the same.  The best version i still have is my lovely Laserdisc Definitive Edition Box Set.  Such a beauty will never be released again, but give us a fantastic edition with everything the fans have right to have....

B004ZQRJFO|1.0|when the beats are of poor quality, how do you give any consideration to this album?<br />zapping, it is a purely commercial event (Eminem to repay the debts he has accumulated)
B003I55BIA|5.0|I just love this book.. I never write reviews or read books twice, but this was the grand exception to that rule. The dialogue is raw and real (which can be offensive to some) but it is how high school kids talk! I hate when authors try to be so squeaky clean that they make their stories completely unbelievable. The characters are charming, and I LOVE that she wrote from both perspectives so that the reader can get into both characters' heads instead of getting a fuzzy third-person point of view. Over all, I love, love, love it.. and it is definitely worth the read (which goes for both of the Perfect Chemistry and Leaving Paradise books).
B0049P1VHS|4.0|This tv series owes a lot to the great British film 28 Days Later.  I watched this on AMC but only saw six episodes and thouhgt this was a good way to catch up on the series.  But it turns out that there was only six episodes!    Police officer Rick Grimes is shot an wakes up some time later in a hospital bed.  The only problem is that the hospital is empty.  Rick goes through the hospital in a daze unable to comprehend what he is seeing.  When he leaves, there are pile after pile of dead bodies.  With no one around, Rick heads home only to find it deserted.  His wife and son have vanished.    Rick is found by Mogan Jones and his son Duane.  Morgan gives Rick a lesson in Zombie 101.  Morgan tells Rick that people were told to go to Atlanta.  Rick decides to go to Atlanta in hopes of finding his family.  But what Rick does not know is that Atlanta has been overrun by walkers (their term for zombies).    Just outside of Atlanta is a group of survivors headed by Rick's partner Shane.    As episode one ends.  Rick is stranded in a tank in Atlanta surrounded by walkers.    Episode two -  Rick is stranded in a tank but then he hears a voice over the radio.  With the voice's help, he escapes and we meet another part of the survivor group.  The downside of Rick's rescue is that the walkers are alerted to the humans and they become trapped in a department store.  Through some ingenuity, Rick is able to save all but one of the survivors.    Episode three - Bad boy Merle is still handcuffed to the roof of the store with the walkers try to break down the door.  Rick and the rest of the department store survivors return to camp.  To Rick's surprise, two of the survivors are his wife and son.  What he doesn't know is that his wife and his partner Shane have hooked up. A rescue mission to save Merle is mounted but all they find is his severed hand.    Episode four - Since Merle escaped, now they are trying to get the guns that Rick lost in the street.  But even that goes wrong when they encounter a new group of survivors who have as ecret of their own.  Back at the camp, things are breaking down.  When things lighten up over a fish fry, the camp is attacked by walkers.    DISC 2
0307595862|4.0|According to some reviewers, Scandanavian authors such as Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell, Jo Nesbo and others are beating American hard-boiled mystery writers at their own game.<br /><br />Harry Hole, Nesbo's main character in THE SNOWMAN, is really only a modified version of Dirty Harry. He's a renegade who does things his own way, and he doesn't get along with the higher ups. He also has a drinking problem and a woman problem, as his main squeeze, Rakel, has dumped him for a doctor. Harry Hole is also unusual in that he's the only homicide investigator in Norway who has experience tracking down a serial killer, and he thinks he's got another one on his hands. Of course his superiors scoff at the idea.<br /><br />The story hops between Oslo and Bergen and Harry has a new woman partner, Katrine Bratt, to deal with. Harry notices right away that she's got quite a bit in common with him. Like Dirty Harry, Harry Hole still feels guilty about his last partner who was killed in the line of duty, something Harry feels he could've prevented.<br /><br />Harry's new case involves a perpetrator who leaves snowmen at the scene of the crime. These murders also seem to happen on the first snowfall of the year and the victims are married women who seem to have been carrying on affairs. There also seems to be a tie to a previous spate of murders and a homicide detective named Gert Rafto who has disappeared.<br /><br />There are lots of red herrings in THE SNOWMAN. If you`ve read a lot of mysteries you recognize these people for what they are and search the background for the least likely character. That might work.<br /><br />There's another American clich&eacute; happening here. The higher ups are always willing to close the case at the first sign of a likely suspect, and it's quite a black eye for them when they're wrong. This happens more than once, and they're looking for a fall guy. Guess who?<br /><br />So then, THE SNOWMAN is really just a modified version of an American murder mystery with a bunch of fjords, lots of snow, ski jumps, and strange sounding place names, and it's still better than what's on the New York Times best sellers list.ki jumps, and strange sounding place names, and it's still better than what's on the New York Times best sellers list.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle continues to be a wonderfully constructed series that has a bit of everything that will not disappoint. I look foward to series 3 with eager anticipation.
B004TE6V4M|5.0|I ordered this book in a nostalgic moment for a son who turned 30.  I first saw it at the Metropolitan Museum of Art store in NYC.  It was in sealed plastic, but I viewed the display copy and loved it.  When I saw this advertised on Amazon.  I ordered it.  Yes, it was less in cost than the museum was charging .... but when I received it, the book was not in any sealed container and it had smudges of dirt on the cover.  In addition, one of the pop up pages had to be glued because it was torn.  Since I was late in ordering this in time for his birthday, I did not return it -- but I feel a bit cheated, as I think it clearly was not new which is how it was represented to me.  The book itself is priceless.  Highly recommend it.
068817776X|4.0|Most reviews on Amazon.com critically examine the author's efforts to survive during the Nazi era by hiding her Jewish identity and marrying a German who would later become a Nazi officer. For me, this memoir was more a reminder that real, unvarnished, evil exists in the world. This young women from beautiful, sophisticated, cultured, Vienna, witnessed how quickly that veneer of civilization peeled back to reveal envy, selfishness, prejudice, and eventually complete barbarism under the opportunities (for some) and fear (for others) of the Nazi regime. Civilization untethered to a strong moral foundation is a very fragile thing. The sad irony is that less than 75 years later, so many have deluded themselves into thinking otherwise.

0316098329|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I was a little annoyed by the way it was written. Coming from the view of the five year old, the book is written how he would say the words. At first it was hard to get used to, and then after about 20 pages I did not even notice it anymore.     It is amazing how you notice the world differently after hearing it described from a 5 year old who has never seen it before. I found myself paying more attention to details after about halfway through the book. How often we pass up the beauty of the world that we live in, just because we \\"see it every day.\\" I am so thankful to little Jack for reminding me to stop and notice the details, and literally smell the flowers.
1595825045|5.0|Great book. It shows a lot of detail, the first ideas, their journey making the show, and pictures and information of every episode and characters.
0321356683|5.0|I think every java programmer should read this book. This is *not* a book for beginners looking to learn how to write Java. It is a book for an intermediate audience to teach them the best practices of the language and the things to avoid doing. Excellent read!
B004LROMSO|5.0|Some negative reviews here but perhaps you are comparing (too much) Camelot to  HBOs 'Thrones' which yes better acting & writing but I found Camelot to be great fun- I agree  With some that Arthur was a casting mistake- he is a good young  actor but just doesn't 'fit' what  We think Arthur should be like- a bit more like THOR's Chris H- if you're going the blonde route  Would have been a better choice-Joe Fiennes talents were poorly misused - he is a superb actor and  Should have had more meat in his roll- yes weak writing to blame in all counts but I wasn't comparing it to  Game-which is superior in a lot of areas-- I was just enjoying the show and having fun watching as not  Many chances( for those of us who enjoy King Arthur period shows ) to have a series to indulge in.    Have to say- the opening sequence-credits is one of THE most BEAUTIFUL show openings I've seen  In ages and the MUSIC is breathtakingly gorgeous - treat yourself to the iTunes score/soundtrack!!    I look forward to next season....warts and all :) Perhaps STARZ will indulge in some new writers  For the sophomore season - give the actors a better chance to shine! Its a good show, don't toss in the towel yet!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am a huge Kindle fan. I have, to date, bought one for: myself, my wife, 3 of my sisters, and soon to be a 4th sister.  However, unless I will be traveling, or unless I plan to sit down and read for an extended period of time, I tend to not want to carry around the full-sized Kindle reader device with me.  I would prefer to use my phone, or read on my computer.  Enter the Kindle reader for the Android. It works beautifully.  It auto-syncs when you first start it, and then you can turn pages by slide-gesturing, or using the arrow keys on the keypad (if you have a keypad on your Android phone). You can also highlight, and annotate, as well as increase or lower font size, line spacing, etc.  The only thing it won't do, is read to you like the Kindle can do, when you enable screen-reading.  Not too shabby for a free application.<br /><br />Battery drain while using it to read non-stop for 2 hours was about 35% of my total battery life, on a battery which will give me 4 hours with constant use, with a full charge.  Not bad, but not fantastic, either.  However, the Samsung Galaxy Indulge has pretty terrible battery life in general (I always carry a spare with me), so take that estimate with a grain of salt, your mileage may vary.
0062060554|2.0|Plodding, wordy, totally predictable.    After the first 50 pages, I just perused - I already knew what was going on.    Is nothing truly original - has it all \\"been done\\"?
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I downloaded this application to replace the built-in memo application that came pre-installed on my Samsung Galaxy Indulge from MetroPCS.  I am migrating to the droid from blackberry, and I wanted the title->note functionality.  As an added bonus, you can password protect/lock any memo you want, and you can setup checklists, and you can set reminders.  This application is fantastic.  I would have paid $5 for it, easy =)
B00514HDNW|5.0|Richard Matheson is one of my favorite authors and this is in my opinion his best work.<br />This book for me captures the feelings of dread, isolation, despair, etc better then<br />any book I have read.  What's interesting about Matheson is that he uses the theme<br />of isolation is many of his works.<br /><br />Note: When I first downloaded my copy it had a number of typos.  After contacting the publisher they fixed the typos which I appreciate.<br /><br />Bob
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The only hiccup I had with the game was a crash when I tried to run it right after install, after I had rebooted the OS, it ran perfectly every single time.  I just beat the adventure mode last night.  The game runs great on my Samsung Galaxy Indulge with MetroPCS. No stuttering, no slow-down, and very responsive to tap-controls.  Totally worth the price =)
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This was a great set to start my collection of Supernatural DVDs. It got here on time, and the packaging was near perfect. I was very pleased with this purchase.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|I didn't dislike the move but it was not what I expected.  This kind of mind bender movie is just not my cup of tea.  I like surprises but this wasn't even that.  You knew how this was going to end after the opening scene in the OR/Butcher shop.  Then when you figured out what was going on you knew.  The effects were pretty good but it was kind of like Sin City  just a little weird.  In the 80s moves got progressively worse and most of their budget went into special effects and promotion.  Not writing and acting.  Movies are about to go down hill again.  Three D over writing, a plot and good story is comming.  For years we have had all these special effects in place of good writing.  Don't get me wrong some good ones sneak out.  But I really miss movies with a plot and god forbid a moral.
B004LAIU4I|4.0|Paul Simon will be 70 years of age in October.  He's an official old guy.  Lest you think I'm being dismissive, trust me:  I'm pushing 60 and am right behind him.  He and Art Garfunkel were incredibly important to my cultural identity as a teenage hippie.  The music they made together, and the music Paul produced in the decades that followed, remains some of the best folk and pop music of the 20th century.  I couldn't help but think about these facts while listening to SO BEAUTIFUL OR SO WHAT, because it is the document of an official old guy looking back at the life he's known and ahead towards the eternal mystery to come.  It's sweet and poignant to listen to him sing about death, the afterlife, God and the angels, reminisce about meeting his wife and other blissful moments in his past, ponder life's miseries and inequities, and express all the confusion of someone who's lived long enough to accept the fact that he has no idea what any of it means.    As always, Paul's lyrics are astute, eloquent and funny.  In \\"The Afterlife,\\" he describes dying and feeling fine but wondering why he hasn't seen God yet.  Then a \\"voice from above/sugar-coated with love\\" explains to him:  \\"You gotta fill out a form first, and then you wait in the line.\\"  But his tongue is only partly in his cheek.  In \\"Questions for the Angels\\" he asks the question:  \\"who believes in angels?\\"  And answers it plainly:  \\"I do.\\"    Old Man Simon still has the voice of a kid, and terrific guitar chops.  The instrumental \\"Amulet\\" is a surprising and unusual offering from an artist whose guitar playing, while always more than competent, has usually played second fiddle to his lyrics and melodies.    As usual, Paul is backed up by some great players and the feeling overall is funky, with some of the Afro-pop flourishes of GRACELAND.  If I have a complaint, it's that this is so thoroughly a single body of work that it ends up being more or less one color, despite the presence of both ballads and up-tunes.Musically it's not his most original work.  There isn't an \\"American Tune\\" or a \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" or even a \\"Me & Julio\\" on this CD, but ultimately, it doesn't matter.  Simon dug way down on this one, sharing deep and intimate aspects of himself, his philosophy of life and spirituality. He's looking ahead to the end of his existence and seeking its meaning.  And he lets us in on the fact that, under his trademark humor and irony, he's a big softie whose life is informed by love and gratitude. We should all be so lucky.
B004MPEFBE|3.0|I and my family just finished watching the latest HP movie. The movie itself is very good.  However we must warn others that transfer is absolutely terrible, with several scenes unwatchable due to screen being completely black.  We are quite disappointed that Amazon would sell this product at all, much less at a premium price.  I am assuming the copy Amazon sells is the same software as what is found on a DVD, so the problem would likely be found on the discs as well.
159420229X|4.0|Very interesting read. My only complaint is that the book does not directly teach you the memory techniques mentioned. It's still extremely interesting and will point you in the right direction.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I don't get Showtime; so, I missed this series when it first aired.  Caught a few episodes on BBC America, and I was hooked. Although not completely historically accurate, who cares? It captures the flavor of the period, and was sufficiently historically accurate for my taste. Good acting, opulent costumes (more Elizabethan than Tudor, but again, who cares), and balanced portrayal of the people being portrayed. One big caution: not for children.  Graphic sex and violence. Re the violence, the torture scenes (of which there were a lot) may be graphic.  I don't know as I muted my volume and looked away after the first one.
0307388921|4.0|I'm quickly becoming a fan of Palahniuk's books, and this is the fifth book of his that I've read.  All of his books are interesting and this one is no exception.  I wouldn't suggest this if you've never read a Palahniuk book before, but this is still a very good book.    Characters    Vincent Mancini is the main character, and he is one of the most troubled characters in fiction.  His mother led him through a very troubled childhood and now she is very sick and living in an assisted living center.  Vincent also spends a fair amount of time dealing with Dr. Marshall who is in charge of his mother's care.  The last character that we see a lot of in this book is his friend Denny.  Denny and Vincent are both recovering sex addicts in the process of the 12 step program.  All of the characters are flawed but I found their actions to be understandable given the situations they're in.    Setting    Unless I'm forgetting it, I don't thing the city that this book takes place in is ever mentioned, but as with all Palahniuk books, the name of the city where the book takes place doesn't matter.    Plot    The plot unfolds on 3 different levels.  One is Vincent's daily life including everything with Denny.  The second is Vincent interacting with his dying mother.  The third and possibly most bizarre of the three is a flashback to Vincent growing up with his mother.  All three are interesting and work to develop Vincent as a character and explain some of what's going on in his head.    Enjoyment    This book is at times disturbing, at times thought provoking, and altogether as strange as any Palahniuk book.  The main idea of the book is about discovering who you really are and trying to find a purpose in your life.  It's very well done and yet another Palahniuk book that will require a reread in the future.    Overall Grade    Not what I would suggest for your first Palahniuk book, but it's a very good book that I would recommend to fans of Palahniuk books.    8/10    This and all of my reviews are also available on my blog.  Check out my profile page for a link to my blog.
6305428522|3.0|This fine movie has been on my shelf for years.  Every time I watch it I regret that it was not anamorphically processed. I guess Buena Vista has the DVD rights to the film.  I keep hoping they'll re-release it in anamorphic (unlikely) or Blu-ray (probably out of the question).    The movie itself is excellent, albeit quite long.  The cast and screenplay are both on a very high level.  One cannot fail to be moved by Paul Scofield's heart-breaking reaction as his son, Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) confesses to him that he was also given the answers to the contestant's questions on the Twenty-One program.     The line that stays with me the longest is that of the CEO of the program's sponsor, very well played by Martin Scorsese, to Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the federal investigator:  \\"You have to understand that the public has a very short memory,\\" he says with a grin. \\"But corporations, they never forget.\\"

B003HARV3Y|3.0|Harry Potter movie, but with the same Hollywood storyline that you have seen a million times before.    Nice special effects, but terrible script (you will be asking yourself 'how did they know that?').    There is not 1 single item in this movie that you could class as original. In fact the ending was so obvious, I didn't bother. Next Please!
B000WC3AJE|1.0|Good movie set botched on blu ray, though I do love these films.  I'm starting to wonder if these films even though they were theatrical releases were originally shot with video tape because the blu rays higher quality seems to betray the low video quality.  However I may downgrade this and get the DVD set instead and give this box set to an enemy because you sure wouldn't offload this on a friend.  Oh by the way, why did I purchase this you may ask, after so many previous warnings here, well I was in hope that Warner had recalled and fixed it by now, alas no such luck, maybe they can't fix it because it was shot with video tape.  Anyway buy the DVD set, I'm going to.
0321525655|4.0|1. This book is all about Crafting the Message of your presentation.  2. Principal Topic: Keep it Simple  3. Few pages about design techniques  4. Does it help? Yes it Does  5. Why? The moment you undestand that you'll only need few simple things to make a great presentation then you'll forget about the technical stuff you wanted.
B00336G7HI|5.0|Perfect condition and quick service.  It fits perfectly to my video camera and we can use it inmediately. Everything was great.

B004SBQGHS|2.0|Like app but why are we being forced to download latest upgrade through WiFi only if 3G works just fine for large downloads.
B004ULEEY8|3.0|I bought this movie because I did not get to see it at the theater, or on pay per view. While mildly entertaining, and of course as stated, predictable. I guess I expected more. The premise was good, and the aliens were tough as you might actually expect them to be. To me it shows that actors can make or break a movie. The new Lt. is a dork (as seen in Transformers 2), and the guy playing the lead cannot carry a lead role in a movie. Gee, why didnt we give the control sticks of the helicopter to the lady from Avatar? I give it 3 stars, not bad to watch...but dont buy it, it will collect dust in your collection.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I think this is one of the best reads in such along time.  Ms. James is a fabulous,witty and detailed writer.  Her descriptions of people and places makes it easy to visualize each character.  Her witty and clever use of inner personal conversations had be bursting with laughter.  Her characters are so complex and yet sublime.      Some of her verbage is so unique to this story that I can see people using some of her lines in regular conversations.  In fact, my family and friends now do!    This is a story of love, passion, humor and agnst.  Yes, there is sex but like someone pointed out previously, the story is more about the growth of love.    Ms. James has created a story that has captured my attention so fully that I have shed tears of happiness and sorrow, made me laugh out loud and held me suspense.      What more could you ask for?  Well, I guess the next book please!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Here it is. The album of the summer for 2011. I know it was released back in April but make no mistake - Wasting Light is the album of the summer.   Wasting Light rocks from the first track to very end and climaxes with Walk. If you're not listening to this CD you are missing out. Foot to the metal and beautiful at the same time. Great lyrics throughout. Wasting Light launches the Foos into U2, Chili Peppers best band out there stratosphere.  I cannot get enough of this album
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Well sort of.  Thomas Bergersen has composed for the trailer music company Two Steps from Hell for a few years, but this is his first solo album.  It's amazing regardless.      What makes this different from Invincible and upcoming Nero, is that it is very themed.  Rather than a random selection of the most popular songs.  It doesn't feel like it's jumping between styles.  It's subtly grand with a hint of epicness the whole way through.  It's not Two Steps From Hell, but it's still very good.  I wouldn't say that it's better or worse, because it's a different kind of style, but fear not, it still maintains the powerful orchestra.    It's also really nice that the album is only $9.  There are 19 songs, and considering the songs span from 3 (mostly 4) to 8 minutes, it makes for a really good deal.  And quite honestly, there isn't a single bad song on Illusions.  This is one of the albums that you'll listen to several times. Another nice thing about it, is the will probably take decades before it's considered \\"timed'.  For pretty much the same reasons that soundtracks are remembered for so long.  I wouldn't be surprised if Thomas Bergersen started scoring for movies and games.
0920668372|3.0|I was shown this book by another mom at a book fair, she loved it, I was on the fence, the mom next to us thought is was incredibly co-dependent.  I bought it anyway, and started reading it to my children - I could not finish it  - it made me cry - which made my children cry and freak out...They actually hid it from me.  SO - this is a great 'Mommy' experience book, but not for everyone.  The author, Robert Meunch is actually a famous Canadian storyteller who has his stories on CD, they are fabulous and so funny my kids who are all grown just have to quote one line from one of his stories to crack everyone up.  The book I'll love you forever actually has a song that goes with it that makes reading the book more fun...so try it and see what you think - I have actually given it to new mom's, as it supports the intense love we feel for our new babies.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|Renee Fleming, Dimitri Hvorostovsky, Ramon Vargas, MET, Gergiev... Brian Large directing the shots... WOW, can one ask for more? Every single note that I wish to post here has already been posted by Ms.Judy and Mr.Nine... nothing more to add insofar as the singing and conducting is concerned.. which is simply top class<br />BUT<br />I get the impression that the MET ran out of money for the production (sic!) after paying those superstars their fees... that they had to cut down the sets to dead leaves and other sets (or lack of them) leaving much to be desired. The waltz scene made me sick with those tacky chairs (looked like borrowed from the nearest vodka quickie joint) with dancers herded inside it.... yuck....<br />And God... what did they do to the Polonaise? I would have preferred seeing Renee Fleming dressing up instead of Hvorostovsky LOL.... That would have made it deserve more than 5 stars...<br />A reviewer whom I respect a Lot, Mr. Keris Nine takes up for the Met, and blames Tchaikovsky for this... LOL... True, Tchaikovsky may have wanted it simple, but there could have been a lot more reasons for that, economy being one of them, if you read between the lines...<br />All said and done, a production by the MET should be by all standards Grandiose.. that is what I would expect and demand for my visual benefit. They could as well have had just the stage with the singers belting away rather than these minimalist settings... BOOO and ONE STAR LESS for this.<br />But to tell you the truth, I really enjoyed it, inspite of the stuff pointed out above...would recommend it.

B003E8P9G0|4.0|As in the Previous Riordan Series, he keeps his readers on their toes. Riordan keeps it in a formula that all of his fans know he writes well in. This Series deals with Egyptian God instead of the Greek and Roman Gods in the [[ASIN:1423113497 Percy Jackson and the Olympians Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-3)]] and there is a lot of Gods. Even at the end you've only meet a 1/21 of the Gods. In this adventure you follow Carter and Sadie Kane in there adventures of becoming Egyptian Wizards. Because of this the chapters switch like in [[ASIN:142311339X The Heroes of Olympus, Book One: The Lost Hero]]. The way it just switched was the cause for the 4 stars along with the Unexplained Lingo which kept me looking in the [[ASIN:B002Y27P3M Kindle, Wi-Fi, Graphite, 6\\" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology]] Dictionary. It didn't bog it down enough so it was terrible but would like more of an explanation. All in all a great Book that should people reading for a week and a half of adventure.
B004DIPL3Q|4.0|As a lover of Wagner's music was inescapable the acquisition of the Blu Ray synthesis of the Ring conducted by Maazel with Berlin. Maazel has also distinguished itself by making orchestral version of Tanhauser (Maazel, Tanhauser Without Words, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, 1990, Sony). These versions have led to opposing views that reject (pure Wagnerists) although welcome for other people. I think that in general are welcome, as the first step in attracting new audiences to the Wagnerian operas, which length and complexity can be frightening to the uninitiated.    The Ring without words have few precedents. A version of Leopold Stokowski (partial recording in: Stokowski, London Symphony, 1966, Decca) and  José Serebrier ( symphonic fragments of the Ring, edited by Stokowski, on a Naxos recording of 2006 with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, with support from the Leopold Stokowski Society). These recordings are fragmented and cannot be compared in magnitude with the Maazel synthesis.    Maazel himself offered his The Ring Without Words in 1988 for Telarc, conducting  the Berlin Philharmonic. This is a recording of almost 70 minutes filled with energy and strength, impacting sound. The video version of 2000 (Blu Ray) has the advantage of offering more music, lasting 83 minutes (13 minutes longer than audio version), in addition to see the director and the orchestra, in high resolution of video.    However, the orchestra is not the same of 1988, now with several new players. Several passages do not have the same force and impact of the audio version. Maazel seems very rigid, even at very expressive moments of the Wagnerian saga. As another reviewer said, striking is the many empty seats in the auditorium, in a country with many wagnerians.    In general, this Blu Ray are welcomed by the work and the synthesis that can attract new interested in the powerful music of Wagner, but this version does not have the force and charm of the audio version of 1988.
006097625X|5.0|I think this is a MUST READ in comics. Very well explained and very nicely designed... Nice to the eyes, a very good reading.  Must have.
1936719118|5.0|I'll admit, when I first received an unsolicited copy of this very slim hardcover for possible review on the blog, I was less than thrilled. Written by Derek Sivers, founder of CDBaby (a website that has since sold for millions), Anything You Want, appeared to be a business book--not something I would normally read. But it was published by Seth Godin's upstart The Domino Project, and I'd so liked their last offering, Stephen Pressfield's Do the Work, that I thought I'd go ahead and give it a few pages...<br /><br />An hour later, I had wolfed down the book. (Did I'm mention its thinness?) I came away inspired by Sivers' grounded, happiness-first approach to his business, enlightened by the lessons he had learned (including those arising from his biggest blunders), and genuinely impressed by his smart and grounded approach to life.<br /><br />An accomplished, working musician, Derek describes how he accidentally fell into his business by recognizing and responding to his own unmet need. Though he was making a good living at his craft, music distribution was such a racket in the Nineties that independent artists had no shot of getting their CDs into the hands of customers wanting to buy them. Frustrating, Derek picked up a few books on coding and wrote his own html, then set up a website where people could buy his stuff. (This was pre-Paypal, so it was a huge hassle.) Soon, friends were asking him to put up their CDs as well--so many that he began charging a small fee for his time. As word spread, the site grew exponentially, but through it all, I had to admire how Sivers kept his head, stuck to his values, and very literally, put his money where his mouth is.<br /><br />So many of the lessons in this story are applicable to writers, along with anyone else valuing quality of life above blind material/financial gain. Here are a few of my favorite examples from the book:<br />1. Never do anything just for the money.<br />2. Don't pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls for help.<br />3. Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what's not working.<br />4. Your business plan is moot. You don't know what people really want until you start doing it.<br />5. You can't please everyone, so proudly exclude people.<br />6. The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book so much, I quickly passed it on to my son, who is finishing college and about to start out in the world. The two of us agreed that Derek Sivers' vision is refreshing, slightly subversive (in as much as being an idealist in the business world is an act of defiance), and entirely likable. This is a guy who understands what makes him tick and quietly but steadfastly resists societal pressure to conform. I guess maybe that make Sivers some sort of rebel after all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.3.

B000W74EQC|5.0|This is one of the greatest series of films that has ever come out.  We have watched these in our house many many times, and this, the first, is still my favorite.  We never tire of them and are watching the whole series<br /><br />The kids in this are so small, now younger than our youngest.  They are realistic kids, truly fine actors, who make you believe not just in the magic, but also their development as individuals.  Harry, with his search for family, love, and a way ahead in his life, is particularly vital.  IT is a world so complete that it is no wonder they are among the first books my kids read.  And it is very cool, in just the way kids appreciate.<br /><br />REcommended with enthusiasm.
0307716511|5.0|I was pulled in from the very first page and read this in two days.........very different and fresh way of writing.  Author had a clever way of weaving her story and pulling the reader right along.  So glad I discovered this author but now have to wait a year for her second novel, \\"Afterwards.\\"<br /><br />I loved everything about this novel because it was professional and exceptional writing.  And as an only child, the story also made me wish again that I had a sister.
B003UESJEM|5.0|The Company Men is a 2009 release of a fast-paced film about the 2008 recession in the US caused by lending institution defaults. It has been re-released in 2011 adding an alternate ending and audio comment by the writer, John Wells.<br /><br />The story focuses on Bobby played by Ben Affleck, a regional sales manager in a large ship building company owned and operated by characters played by Craig T. Nelson and Tommy Lee Jones. Chris Cooper, Kevin Costner, and Maria Bello are very good in supporting roles. The actors give strong performances, and each character they play is well-developed in short scenes.<br /><br />The company has gone from a firm that builds \\"things\\", huge ships for private industry and the military, to a holding company that has farmed out the building of product to contractors. The business plan now involves obsession with paper assets that decrease in value disastrously in the recession.<br /><br />As a junior player in the firm, Bobby is one of the first to be dismissed as downsizing becomes the emergency response of the company's executive board. Over night, Bobby becomes an unemployed suit competing for a job with hundreds of other downsized junior corporate managers. At first, Bobby resists the loss of his identity as a star on the rise in a major industry. Gradually he learns to adjust to reality and accepts a humbler role as an individual and provider for his family. Two older more established executives played by Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper find it more difficult to redefine themselves.<br /><br />The alternate ending is quite different from the original, though both involve hope for the future. The first ending shows hope in a recovering economy. The second, more in line with 2011 economic conditions, focuses on hope in the strengthening of family relationships in the reality of a worsening economy.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining and timely movie. The re-release is a good decision as we now understand the negative aftermath of the recession of 2008. I highly recommend this film for its historical information, good story, and great acting.recommend this film for its historical information, good story, and great acting.
0375851569|5.0|No introduction to reading is more fun than Dr. Seuss. These books provide wonderful read-aloud material and encourage the love of reading in youngsters. The repetitive nature of the text and the simple rhymes offer a good platform for early readers. And you can't beat the value.
1449382673|4.0|While I have worked a bit with basic PHP and also with Max MSP, for creative/school things, I am basically a newb to programming in unguided contexts. I first borrowed John Zelle's Python Programming from a friend and began working with it, which was okay, but really quite dry. (And for example the basic/beginner stuff was explained in a way that was not relevant to me -- which I understand, because it's an \\"introduction to computer science,\\" but I already understand many of those principles ...) Headfirst Python is very engaging. So the fact that it doesn't take you extremely far (according to the other reviews) disappoints slightly (just given that I only have so much money for books) but I don't feel cheated at all, in the meantime. I was hoping for a plunge into fluency in the fundamentals, and that's what I got from this!
038572179X|4.0|I only took off a star because I felt the beginning is rather long; it took a while to get going.  In spite of this I still wanted to keep reading and I am glad that I did.  The story is beautiful and after I finished it I felt powerfully about it and pondered it for quite some time.  I recommend this book and will be watching the movie.
B00406UK7S|2.0|I love history movies, particular about the ancient world, so I wanted to see this movie - alas, it was first of all a war movie that had little dept and instead far, far more gory violence than I care for. While there is a historic background to the story, it really only provides that: a background. The story is shallow and predictable and seems to serve only to justify as much violence as possible. This movie would not appeal to someone who is actually interested in history as the time period serves only as a backdrop - the very same story could have been framed in any other time without needing to go any more indept in the details of the particular historic period. Not recommended for anyone - there is little if anything to learn, not about history, not about emotion, intellect, or spirituality. Instead, once more the viewer is inundated with too many images of violence that are already over abundant in our world today.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie - prior to watching it (and doing a little research of my own about Hypatia)I had only briefly heard about Hypatia. After watching the movie I got so fascinated with the time period that I ended up ordering a book abot Neoplatonism to learn more about the philosophical and mystical ideas that she must have grown up and been educated with. A female scholar in 4th century Alexandria, she lived at the end of era - the end of the pagan world and the beginning of the christian era. While I am certain that in any movie there must be certain artistic liberties taken (for example, it seems that Hypatia was actually much older when she died than is depicted in the movie), the story is movingly told, brilliantly acted, and the sets are just amazing. But most of all, this movie sheds light on a little known figure in history, her life and accomplishments as well as tragic death. It also brings back to awareness the tragic final destruction of the remnants of the ancient library of Alexandria. What knowledge has been lost there is inconceivable (originally the library housed about 1/2 million volumes of books, of which only a small fraction has been saved), and it was lost due to human ingnorance and intolerance. The lessons that derive from her story can well be applied today, as once again we have to remind ourselves that - as exactly the Platonists believed - it is education that is crucial to eradicate hatred and intolerance. As Hypatia has said \\"there are more things that unite us than divide us\\". How very important a lesson for today!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book because my friend is a middle school teacher and explained was written for about that age group. At first it's a bit confusing however a few chapters in I was hooked. If you are thinking about reading this book DO IT! It's absolutely going to be a classic , I cannot wait to read the 2nd one.
1594744769|4.0|I love Ransom from the Mental Floss website and I love quirky books - this one met me head on. The photos really add to the tale, and what a tale it is. Starting off with a bored kid in the USA with a bonkers grandad (or is he?) ending with our not so bored kid setting off into the sunset with a motley crew, the book never fails to grip or amaze. Only getting 4 stars though because there were a few bits that didn't quite work for me. But totally brilliant and would recommend to anyone who likes things a little bit different. Aimed at teenagers but suitable for kids of all ages including grown ups.
0312330537|5.0|This book is fantastic. There is a point in the book where it seems to lose its pace rather quickly, but the first 60% or so really spoils readers.
044654759X|4.0|I think this was a \\"true to life\\" portrayal of what goes on today in our society. It is remarkable how many law enforcement people use their positions to try to control their family members while carrying dangerous weapons. This goes on day in and day out across our country. There was a mass murder in northern wisconsin by a Sheriff's deputy recently over jealousy such as this.  I think our law enforcement agencies should do more testing of individuals who may be in danger of performing acts like this.
0756404738|5.0|I really hated to start DAY 2 because I know starting means reading till the end and then waiting waiting.  I stumbled on Day 1 and was trapped.  It is rare these days for a writer to tell a real \\"story\\" in a way you are a part of it.  Both times I felt that sucking sound that pulls you in for the long term read...and will even consider rereading just to see what I missed the first time round.  I do hope Patrick will be true and make Day 3 the completion on his tale and then go on to write More.  The only reason for this is too many like RR Martin and the Gunslinger series drag on forever when the story should just be told.(ok personal angst but it does get wearisome)  Anyway, thanks for good english, great sentences, wonderful imagery, and a tale worth sitting thru then telling others.  You have a fan.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|First of all, this is a great, classic movie. Sure, it has a generic story, but it's the execution that matters, and this is one of the best. If you want a feel-good, inspiring film, this is perfect. It also feels like it could actually happen.    Anyway, the bonus features of this DVD give plenty of good insights into the making of this film. If you're a fan of The Karate Kid, this is the DVD to pick up.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I won't give you a song by song review as do some other people here who think they write for rolling stone.    If your into the blues and you like Gregg at all then simply just buy this,long story short.I would suggest not listening to the samples given here though.They simply do not give the songs the justice they deserve.I did that and thought that this would suck,but after getting it and listening to the whole cd i am totally rocked out by this cd.    Oh wait a second i have so much time on my hands that i will now critique each song note by note then i can give you my worthless opinion of the engineering then i can tell you what i think about each musician and and the instruments that they used and why they should have used something different.
B002ZG980A|4.0|When a serious car accident shakes him out of the complacency of his \\"normal\\" life, Steven Russell steps out of   the closet and into a brand new life of lavishness and good-natured con-artistry. During one of his inevitable stints   in prison, Russell befriends and falls in love with Phillip Morris, a naive younger inmate with whom he wishes to   share the rest of his life. Although his con-man ways threaten to keep him and Morris apart, Russell will do   everything he can to make sure the law doesn't stand in the way of their love!     Part comedy, part drama and part love-story, this gentle and amusing take on the real-life antics of Steven Russell   was both a wonderful surprise and a thoroughly enjoyable film. Solid performances by Carrey and McGregor.     (More information on the real Steven Russell here:   [...])     PQ and AQ were very good.
B0034G4P8K|4.0|Someday they'll come out with Jane Austen's TRANSFORMERS, and that'll shut everyone's yaps. Me, I saw TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON, and I wasn't sure whether to pat myself on the back or wallow in self-loathing. Because the parts that I liked, I really, really liked. And yet Michael Bay overnight hasn't become a more subtle, more graceful director, and so the stuff one resents about him is still there in glorious 2- or 3D. Like its predecessors, DARK OF THE MOON is essentially Michael Bay yelling at the top of his voice. If REVENGE OF THE FALLEN had a redeeming quality, it's probably  that it lowered the bar for future Transformers films. DARK OF THE MOON definitely benefits.<br /><br />It starts off really promisingly, with a revisionist look at Apollo 11 and its historic landing on the moon, and what really galvanized the 1960s space race between the U.S. and the Soviets. The first fifteen minutes or so unspool fantastically as we get to relive the momentous lunar landing complete with archival (and \\"new\\") footage of JFK, Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin. Then we arrive at the shocking revelation, that, once the public video feed is cut off, the real mission is launched, that of Armstrong and Aldrin investigating an alien vessel what crashed in the Sea of Tranquility.<br /><br />We cut to present-day Washington, DC and catch up with Sam Witwicki who is three months out of college, is jobless, is Mikaela-less. Even though Sam's been decorated with a presidential hero medal, he's feeling unappreciated. And I guess having saved the world twice now will give you that sense of entitlement, right? Sam's hot new girlfriend Carly is inspiring him to new lows of inadequacy, what with her dazzlingly successful career and her being the money maker in the relationship. And, to make things worse, his crazy parents are visiting from out of town, so Sam is girding himself for all the inappropriate humor.<br /><br />Sam seems to have lost touch with most of the Autobots. Even his pal, Bumblebee, has been making himself scarce of late. Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots have been whiling away their time by assisting their human allies with various covert ops, even as they cast a vigilant eye out for the true enemy, the Decepticons. And it was only a matter of time, isn't it? Megatron, ruinous parts and all, is still making a bid for power. He's already set his scheme in motion.<br /><br />DARK OF THE MOON is best served during its opening and closing acts. The middle bits come off as Michael Bay's indulgence in silly stunt casting and asinine goings-on. I do think that Michael Bay is savvy in the ways of staging them epic action sequences. But he flounders in those intimate moments, y'know, those acting bits which are supposed to make us care about the characters. John Malkovich's role is unnecessary and, on top of that, there's a jarring character turn which is a complete departure from the personality he'd established earlier. Ken Jeong also has a small part as \\"Deep Wang\\" but it's basically Ken Jeong playing Ken Jeong, and while I thought he was pretty funny, his performance took me out of the movie. Alan Tudyk also has a supporting part as John Turturro's (German?) assistant, and, Buddha bless him, Alan Tudyk cannot do wrong. I thought he was marvelous and wicked funny. Yet again. By the way, I do appreciate it that John Turturro tones it down somewhat (but he's still plenty quirky). Meanwhile, Frances Mcdormand comes in as the no-nonsense Director of National Intelligence. With all that acting pedigree, you'd think Michael Bay would've been able to come up with a stronger human element to the story. What does it say when the most emotive character turns out to be a yellow Chevy Camaro?<br /><br />Much noise about how the Victoria's Secret model would fare versus Megan Fox. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is just as hot as Megan Fox, and is as talented an actress as Megan. Michael Bay absolutely exploits her in this film, and you see howthat isn't such a jerk move once you realize that Megan Fox's career was launched by Bay doing the exact same thing. \\"Carly Spencer\\" serves as eye candy, and she's admirably qualified. But, oh, did the snickers roll in as the pretty, pretty model just vacuously stood there for that one timeless moment whilst Transformers mayhem tore sh-- up in the background. What the hell was Bay thinking in that scene? It's so dismissive of her character.<br /><br />The narrative touches a bit on the long-waged Autobot-Decepticon war and how the Autobots once had an opportunity to win it decisively, hinged on a game-changing invention of Sentinel Prime. And I do think it's an absolute coup snatching Leonard Nimoy to voice Sentinel Prime, who was once the Autobots' leader. Nimoy and Peter Cullen (voice of Optimus) play off each other beautifully. And I'd never heard Nimoy sound so gravelly and, er, emotional. He even drops a classic line from STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN. I'll leave it to you whether his quote was wise or groan-inducing.<br /><br />Is there a danger of becoming desensitized? Absolutely. Bay injects his patented explosions on an ad nauseam constant, and you factor in, too, Bay's detached style of storytelling, his shaky knack for swaying you with the humanizing elements. Really, this franchise was never more resonant than when it was mostly about a boy and his car in the first film. Sam Witwicki, sequel by sequel, seems to engage more and more in histrionics. It's two and a half hours' worth of the Perils of Sam Witwicki. And his girlfriend is taller.<br /><br />In the midst of warring giant robots, the humans are often overwhelmed and rendered near insignificant. So I like that, this time around, Sam and the military guys actually hold their own in certain scenes. I like that the film makes more use of slo-mo so that we can observe more closely just what the hell is going on during all the frenetic robot-on-robot violence. It's still frequently hard to distinguish who the 'bots are, apart from the higher profiled ones. I think that's Wheeljack over there sporting that stupid Einstein look.<br /><br />Aside from the silly bits, DARK OF THE MOON is surprisingly dark in tone, and one wishes Bay had done away with all the frivolous indulgences. One fallout to how high the stakes are is that we get a more brutal Optimus Prime. The last 45 minutes or so is basically one long extended battle scene set in a devastated Chicago, and I wouldn't be surprised if $100 mil went into the making of it. It is glorious special effects.<br /><br />I think, ultimately, DARK OF THE MOON does earn its spectacle. The opening segment and the last 45 minutes validate the thing. Maybe, during the saggy middle portion, you can slip out and sneak into LARRY CROWNE (although I hear that film's not exactly raking in the raves; oh, well, maybe BRIDESMAIDS is still out). Then come back for the final hour of this one. Sound like a plan? Let's do that. That way, we can skip flotsam and jetsam material such as that Autobot with the Irish accent, and Sam's annoying parents, and Malkovich's creepy Bumblebee fetish, and that tiresome LaBoeuf-Huntington-Whiteley-Dempsey triangle (which, if you're just read it, looks more like a quadrangle). I don't think any of that crap is in the Jane Austen version.<br /><br />With some amazement, I'm rating this 3.5 stars out of 5. So I guess I'm recommending DARK OF THE MOON.

B001FB4W16|5.0|This show is a great adaption of the Sookie Stackhouse novels. The entire cast really puts forth a nice team effort to produce a high quality show about Vampires trying to find their place in society. There are a lot of social justice and civil rights parallels in this to the civil rights movement and even to some degree the LGBT movement.     The PQ is outstanding, particularly for a television series. I upgraded my DVD box set for blu-ray and VERY glad I did so.     The AQ is amazing as well. 5.1 surround sound is clear, crisp, and very detailed.     I enjoyed the extras that came with it, including the funny PIP commentary.     This is an excellent show and an even more excellent presentation of the show.     Highest recommendation possible!
B0046E825G|5.0|This one was definitley the best one of them all. I absolutely loved it. It left me wondering what would happen next at the end of each chapter. By using two different pointsof view Mrs Stephanie spiced it up as well. I can hardly wait till the movie comes out!
B003IWYOF4|5.0|Watching \\"The Breakfast Club\\" brings back a certain nostalgia from the 1980's that felt fun, warm, and engaging. Seeing the \\"Brat Pack\\" together brings back so many fond memories. This is John Hughes' best movie and deserves the blu-ray treatment.     With that said, the PQ is better than the DVD, but needs improvement which is very unlikely at this point considering this is the 25th anniversary edition. Yes, a good part of the grain is cleaned up and there is a noticeable improvement, however I think it falls short of what Universal could have done with this. That being said, it is worth the upgrade as long as you are paying less than $20.00 for this.     The AQ is a more drastic improvement. This movie is very dialogue heavy so you aren't going to be \\"blown away\\" by the audio, but it is quite pleasing in HD surround sound. Where the audio shines is during the introduction, and towards the end when the music is playing. This audio remaster exceeds expectations compared to the PQ.     The extras including director commentary and interviews with the cast members years later. Those actually were pretty intriguing to watch.     Despite the fact that Universal could have spent more time and a little more money with the video quality, it is a decent upgrade and should be on the list to buy for any serious collector who enjoyed this movie.

B004A8ZX2S|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who is capable of seeing and understanding the beauty around us. A true masterpiece. This movie makes you appreciate everything a lot more without being a drama. It's not a hippy festival nor is it a mental home. For those of you who have something, which is called a soul (though it might not exist and this statement is worth less than void), you can let it free to dangle wherever it wants. You might visit your childhood, your current life and an uncertain future. This uncertain future however is not seen as something stressful but rather like a delicate dandelion in the summer wind and when related to the universe it becomes meaningless. The movie is not about religions, but about what mankind is capable of in it's peak moments: see the beauty and feel it!

1572816112|5.0|I will start this review by saying this deck is beautifully rendered. Often as an artist when I look for tarot I want to find something unique and satisfying artistically. This deck was one of those finds for me. It was made by a combination of photography and illustration.  The maker took pictures of the stone sides of old graveyard stones and asylums then twisted and used them for clothing, ground, etc.   An interesting fact is that this deck was 30 years in the making.  It is the most unique of all the decks I have seen and worked with.  The imagery is easy to read, and quite striking. The cards are larger than regular playing cards and sturdy. If you are attracted to the cover, then I'd say it's safe for you to explore this deck.  Some of the imagery is vivid and on the darker side of fairy tales. However all tarot decks have those \\"negative\\" images.  I will say that I shied away from tarot in general and stuck with oracle for a long time because I didn't like how negative some cards are.  However, this was my first tarot deck after years of not getting them.  I loved it and still do to this day.  The hermit card was disappointing to me because he is portrayed as miserable and alone instead of a learned scholarly individual. But I still love this deck. The art and energy of this deck is one of a kind, and worth having for tarot collecters. This is a deck for more forward answers with no beating around the bush.  I only keep a few decks around, and this is one of them. This is a blunt deck.  Just like every other deck it isn't for everyone, but I would recommend it to anyone attracted to the imagery here.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|I agree with the other 2 reviewers about this being a great sequel. And it coming blu-ray. But I don't I don't agree with the first reviewer about the bonus features. It's coming with a alternate ending and the 1984 documentary terror in the aisles. Hosted by donald pleasance and nancy allen. I don't call that a shame at all. I'm happy with those as bonus features.

B002XZMAJY|4.0|For those looking for a classic Peter gabriel album, this isn't it. The beauty of this disc comes from the inside, as you discover the feelings behind his interpretations of others' songs.      The production values are top notch and you still get to hear some unique \\"Gabriel\\" sounds, so this CD is made for headphone listening. \\"My Body is a Cage\\" was used in one of the last episodes of the \\"Smallville\\" TV series, to wonderful effect. That's where I heard it and sought out this album.      The CD also merits listening due to its mixture of contemporary tunes and oldies like David Bowie's \\"Heroes.\\" Gabriel could have just sung old songs from his generation, but he didn't. Isn't that what we love about him anyway?
0425238091|4.0|The House of God depicts the agonies and the few ecstasies during an internship at the top hospitals in the U.S -- though I'm told that conditions are now somewhat more humane. A doctor-friend says that the book is accurate and that his colleagues agree. What's more, he says, much of the culture carries through to hospital practice later. A movie was made from the book because it's considered funny. I think it's funny in the style of Mad Magazine. However, The House of God is also sad. What internship as described does to innocent med school grads is to dehumanize them so that they can bear the tragedies with which they must deal on an everyday basis in practice. My friend says that many doctors recover their humanity. I'm not so sure. I'm rating the book with 4 stars because I think it is required reading for anyone who is living with a doctor who is going through internship or has done so. (The docs already know about the book and don't need a review.) BTW, be forewarned: One of the primary ways in which the book says that interns alleviate their tension is through sex, primarily with nurses, but the sex is no more than a release of the unbearable tension. Sex without love becomes normal. From my friend's description of what goes on at his hospital, I gather the practice continues long after internship.[[ASIN:B004NSVE4Q The House of God]]

B0006AAS5G|5.0|I have been wearing this watch for a year now with no complaints. This is very masculine and chunky and yet it fits persons having smaller wrists like me. I had to shorten the metal band a couple of links which I did myself with ease. It feels great, looks great and a great buy. Had plenty of appreciations for it. Overall a superb buy.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I am in LOVE with David Cook's sophomore album! It is a lot softer than I thought it would be, what with the title of \\"This LOUD Morning\\". But it is profoundly beautiful. David Cook, along with some wonderful producers, songwriters, and David's band, have crafted a heartfelt and meaningful album, in which the songs tie together seamlessly to tell an arcing love story in a diaristic style. \\"This Loud Morning\\"successfully weaves together tender music box notes, throbbing guitar solos, pounding drumlines, and of course, David Cook's lovely vocals to craft a total album that is more than just a handful of songs thrown together. Melodies, the love theme, and lyrics are echoed across songs so that the songs flow from one to the next, with the songs coming together as a complete work. \\"This Loud Morning\\" is more than just 12 gorgeous songs (14 on the deluxe edition)...it's a love letter.
B003UESJEM|5.0|This movie has a timely subject - the changes corporate displacement has wreaked upon American men. With great panache and smart comedy and an assemblege of some of the finest actors of our time, an entertaining and thought-proviking story unfolds.  I don't know why, but I didn't expect much from this movie, simply because I hadn't heard much about it. This turns out to be a movie I would Highly recommended!
0061537969|5.0|I don't care for car racing, but if you share that feeling don't let it dissuade you from reading \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\".  This was a wonderfully told story, from a dog's perspective, about a man and his family and how to live well.  I thought that the dog's perspective might make the book hokey, but it absolutely wasn't.  I tore through the pages, cheered on the good guys, and wept for the ultimate heroes.  Make sure you have tissues on hand for the last few chapters.  I have two dogs of my own and it really made me think about their actions, and my own.  Do yourself a favor and get a large mug of coffee/tea, a comfy chair, and give yourself over to one of the more uniquely told and satisfying stories I've read in a long time.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|Five stars for the movie. However, the product description for the Blu-ray edition states that the film will be presented in widescreen and not the original screen ratio. In other words, information will be cropped from the top and bottom, violating Welles's composition. Bad idea.
0316010669|5.0|This book definitely explains the unexplainable. We sometimes choose logical reasoning over intuitions which leads to mistakes and even catatrophes. But the small voice inside your head saying 'yes' or 'no' to our decision making is right most of the times. This is especially true when we have less information about the decision process. Whether it be as small as buying clothes or as big as investing in a new business, the intuitive feeling can be a better guide as it is based more on experience and observation. Im marketing, that is how consumer behavior has been identified when they switch brands or buy an abolutely new product without any logical reason associated with it. The book definitely reconfirmed my conviction of 'gut feeling'.
1845902858|5.0|After reading a lot of books on hypnosis and NLP, I would have to say that this is by far the best one when it comes to learning the depth of language of it. I think page for page there is just far more intricate language than most other books on hypnosis. I believe this book is very thorough and stands out for its ability to teach an array of hypnosis language unlike some other books which teach things like very basic guided meditation. I think if you own this book, Wordweaving Volume One by Trevor Silvester and The Language Pattern Bible by Kerin Webb, I think you're well on your way to getting a thorough understanding of how the language of hypnosis really works.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Awesome to watch with your young kids, plus if you've watched it when you were younger then it'll be awesomer! I've watched it a lo-ong time ago when I was about 4 1/2 years old... totally loved the song, \\"Ev'rybody Wants to be a Cat\\" and that was the song that got me swingin'! Ev-rybod-y wants to be a cat 'cause the cat's the only cat that knows how to swaang!
B0026SCMNM|2.0|I loved the beginning of this book--the flavor of Ireland and America at that time really came through, the characters were alive and fresh and compelling.  As the book progressed, though, I was disappointed, and then when the venue returned to Ireland I found it diverged so much from the earlier characterizations as to be trite.  It was as though the author was trying to be original, couldn't allow real sentiment to prevail.  Not convincing, and my overall impression... disappointing.
B0034G4P8U|5.0|I wasn't blown away by the first movie, it was good but not great. The second wasn't as good as the first, but I have to say I loved everything about Dark of the Moon. The 3D was awesome! The movie was great! And I never was much of a Transformers fan. The movie had some minor flaws but the positives easily negated them for me. The battles were easier to distinguish between the robots, they where in much more detail than in the previous movies, the special effects were better and I loved that the human race had equal time in the fight and actually looked like they were able to fight back. And I thought Sam had a better presence in this one. He was a hero this time. I just loved this movie!
B0058VW36U|3.0|very fun and addicting game.  the developer did release this for free/( ad supported)  on getjar market. give it a shot,  has killed quite a few boredom inducing moments.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|My grandson loves all digging equipment. So, when I saw this on a website I knew this was the perfect gift.  I gave this Kettle digger to my 2 yr old grandson. HE LOVES IT!! It is in his sandbox  and he uses it everyday. I put it together my self - great directions. The delivery was quick and the price was right too. I know it is for 3yr+ but he is doing well with it.  It is very sturdy - I look forward to him getting a lot of playing time with it. Thanks.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|I am very satisfied with the service I received from amazon. There was a defect w/the same product twice, amazon graciously refunded my money. I recently had major surgery & have been ill, this was much appreciated. I now have extra complete trust in your service, have ordered & received Ugly Betty: season 4 & also some books, everything was just great. Thanks.<br />Looking forward to ordering more products w/complete confidence.  Sincerely, Donna
B004GYOQ6A|1.0|This app force closes every time on the galaxy tab 10.1. the developer should update the description to say such. that way folks don't bother installing to figure it out.
0743497465|2.0|The plot and characters were great and it would make a terrific movie, but it read almost more like a screenplay than a novel.  Lacking in character development.  If you are just interested in an exciting story, it's fine.  But if you really like to get into the lives of the people in the novels you read, I don't recommend it.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|The fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightful movie about a fox who turns from his natural animal ways and tries to take up a new profession to appease his wife, Felicity. Mr. Fox is not entirely successful in his abandonment of his foxy ways and wants to have one last score against some hated local farmers. Fox enlists his forest friends in this venture but of course everything goes wrong. One of the sweetest things about this movie is the lack of standard profanity. By that I mean, throughout the movie one will hear cuss words as in \\"What the cuss did you just say?\\" but nothing more. The stop action animation of the characters is fluid and very well done and the voice actors are some of my favorites, George Clooney, as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep, as Felicity Fox. My family and I have watched this film repeatedly and I would recommend it to families with children 8+.
0385732554|4.0|The Giver  The Giver is a book that is extremely captivating and intriguing. It will blow us as teachers with adult minds away as well as children's minds, taking them out of reality and forcing them to imagine the world in a different way. This way though, is not a happy visualization. It is a world with no color, love or joy. The one fine experience that this book offers it the revelation of us as a people to be grateful for the things in life we do have. The story follows a boy names Jonas who is chosen as the Receiver. As the receiver, he is imparted with memories from before the world was void of things we know as life and vibrancy. These memories are given to him from an old man named the Giver, who wants Jonas to not only see, but know the world through a fulfilling journey. As a reader you will be captivated by this story as it keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat as you wonder if Jonas will make it to the land of the living. The Giver would be a great tool to read before a writing lesson on science fiction. This text would most appropriately be used in a upper primary grade such as fourth or fifth grade. So next time you step outside, rejoice in the clouds, the blue sky and the birds singing outside.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This story of Jack and Ma who live confined in garden shed/prison by Old Nick is a spectacular insight into children with sensory perception issues. The first couple of chapters were a sensory issue for me because of the very distinct way Jack (the narrator) who is 5 speaks. After finally getting used to his dialect I was intrigued to the point I couldn't put the book down. I read this novel in three seperate sittings within 2 days. It is AMAZING. I would reccomend the story to anyone who is interested in what some of the possible developmental effects of abuse & neglect are and how that plays out in behavior/self esteem from the perspective of the victim. What is normal? What does normal look like when what we perceive as normal is no longer a socially acceptable norm? Very thought provoking!
0307592839|2.0|When a book's jacket is as loaded with praise and award wins as this one, expectations are going to be high.  I found this book did not live up to its hype at all.  In the \\"praise\\" section in the front, reviewers mentioned Proust and Dickens, but a great novel this is not.      It is a loose collection of short stories about people with some degree of separation from the two primary characters - Sasha and Bennie.  The problem is that there are so many characters, none of which are at all likable.  When Egan tries to have one of these poorly sketched characters say something that's supposed to be insightful or related to the themes of the book, it comes across as totally unconvincing.  Meanwhile, many of the plot points are outlandish and unbelievable (someone honestly thought suspending hot trays of oil above a crowd was a good idea?).  For all its ostensible alienation and \\"postmodern flourishes\\", this book wrings little insight out of the lives its superficial characters.    Still, there were a few interesting moments.  The Powerpoint chapter I feel is the standout of the book.  The Rhea chapter is also good.  But in general, Egan's prose is nothing special and it can't sustain this scattershot narrative.  The shifting voices and styles are not pulled off with any grace or subtlety (in the way McEwan is able to do).  They in fact become clunky and ridiculous, like the chapter told in the second person.  \\"You\\" do this, \\"you\\" say this.  It's pointless and distracting, and gimmicky.      Not recommended.  If you're thinking of picking up this book on the strength of the Powerpoint posted on Amazon's product page, you've already seen the best of it.  There are very few other good ideas in this book.
B000FA675C|2.0|As with the other Dan Brown books I've read I wasn't happy with this one.  The plot is great, the characters are wonderful.  But somehow I felt like I was reading Brown's notes about the plot and people rather than walking in their shoes and listening to their thoughts.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|Extremely disappointed. The show was apparently written and directed by juveniles who get excited walking into a Hooters Restaurant. Pretty girls with breasts exposed passes for dialogue. If you are looking for something with even a passing acquaintance with A Man for All Seasons, you will quickly recognize that this production is nowhere in sight. The dialogue is empty and sex is the story line. The costumes had bright color but were too easily tossed off. Our degraded educational system must take responsibility for those who rate this thing highly. I tried to rate this with no stars, but the system demanded that it receive at least one.
B00005M1Y4|5.0|Have always loved the Disney movies, now with a Grand Daughter, I can indulge her and me at the same time.  Starting a Disney collection for her to enjoy as much as I did.  Thank you.
0525951652|1.0|Like many others who have written reviews, I have serious issues with this book. Here are some of them listed, not in order of importance:<br /><br />1. Subject matter/History is primary. Story comes 3rd or 4th down the list. It is boring, to put it mildly.<br /><br />2. Characters are not HEROIC. Sorry, but no one here stirs you. Billy annoyed the hell out of me. So pompous. The Russians are the only really interesting ones in the book but they never quite self-actualize. Like almost everyone in FofG, they end up more of less of a side-story.<br /><br />3. Class Warfare without an alternative. An American character could have played out as the hero here. Honestly, I am not much for the British Aristocracy but neither am I for those who support Communism/Socialism with blinders on as an antidote. Where are the individualists that made so many of Ken's other books great? The story here demonizes everyone except the naive early-stage Communists/Marxist/Socialists. But then, not everyone in England or in the US thought that these ideas were sound, even back then. And not all of these were elitist snobs.<br /><br />I fear that because the setting is modern, Ken can't launch the full scale and deadly attacks that he did on tribalism/collectivism evident in his other novels. After all, why would he want to alienate the Labor Party in England? And yet, Pillars certainly is a metaphor for all sorts of political nastiness that goes on today - all with a pro-individualist slant.<br /><br />4. Lack of significant story resolutions. I get that a sequel is in the works but c'mon. 1000 pages and I can't see that Pinski thug finally get some justice served to him? So many sub-plots just fizzled into nothing.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|This is very well made. Good production values, no obvious scrimping on anything. Costumes, sets, scenics, are all brilliant. I thought the acting was generally good to very good, though some characters, at some points, were not very convincing. One of Tess's sisters looked a bit too modern for me, her hairstyle and makeup (what there was of it, of course), looking like something you might see today. One thing I felt played too big a part in this production was the music. There were times when it seemed the director was relying too heavily on the music to set the mood, and perhaps unnecessarily. Other times it was a good fit. I could not help but compare this to the Roman Polanski/Nastassja Kinski version from many years ago, and I don't know which I would choose as better, though by a narrow margin, I think it would go to the older film. I would certainly say that there is little need to see both. Naturally, being produced from the same book, the basics of the story will be the same, but I did not see any smaller points significantly exploited in such a way as to make a big difference. In the first episode of my download, I noticed some fuzziness, poor reproduction quality. I have no way of knowing whether this was the fault of the original film, or of the transmission of it to my computer. That did not influence my opinion of this overall, however. The four stars is based on performance. If you have never seen Tess, I would highly recommend seeing some version of it, whether this one or the Polanski one. There have been other versions which I have not seen, and on which I cannot comment. Anyone who thinks they have had a tough life needs to see at least one version of this, though.
0812550706|5.0|Card is a genius when it comes to communicating from the viewpoint of a child. Ender is a fascinating and wonderful character. The story is touching, believable, epic, surprising.  The characters are wonderful.  It has one of the best, most hard-hitting climaxes in literature.  Love it.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|angry birds sucks. sad this game is so popular. its just a crappy knockoff of the game tank wars (aka bomb) from the 80s.
B000P0J09W|5.0|What can you say about this movie? Its fun, silly and is a classic...its the kind of movie to watch on   a chilly or rainy day with a big bowl of buttered popcorn. 'nuff said!
0800177975|4.0|This movie was billed as an action flick during its theater release, which was a mistake. Audiences were expecting exactly that, and the movie is something entirely different: it's a comedy, and a clever one, at that.<br /><br />Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger) is the favorite action hero of young movie buff, Danny Madigan. A magic movie ticket and a wrinkle in reality transport Danny into Slater's world, where car chases are a daily event and Slater's never-before-seen police partner turns out to be a cartoon cat named Whiskers. Slater and Danny fight crime while dodging action-movie cliches right and left. Then, in a nod to meta, they hunt down a Slater-world villain who has crossed into the real world and is attempting to defeat Slater once and for all by killing the actor who portrays him.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just mock the cliches of its genre, it mocks movies themselves. Slater's closet only contains identical versions of the same clothes he's already wearing. The police captain's unintelligible scolding is revealed to be exactly that: even up close and in person, you still can't tell exactly what he's saying.<br /><br />Slater is forced to realize that he and his world (where all phone numbers start with 555) are fictional. He immediately becomes angry about all the stresses and hardships he's suffered at the all-too-casual whims of writers.<br /><br />There are lots of great details in this movie (the daydreamed Jack Slater version of \\"Hamlet\\" is priceless), and several talented character actors: Mercedes Ruehl, Charles Dance, Robert Prosky, and F. Murray Abraham all make appearances here.<br /><br />If you like irony and satire, this movie is definitely worth seeing. Here's hoping it finds the right audience on DVD, now that the studio has stopped trying to pass it off as something different from what it actually is.
0345529057|5.0|My friends have been reading this series since it first came out but i never could get into it. But now that the first season of the tv series has come and gone, i think it goes without saying that this fantasy series is a gem in the fantasy genre. the gritty realism and non conformity to the basic guidelines of happy endings and heroes prevailing over villains makes this series of books very unique. the 4 books are illustrated in the old original style not in terms of the new tv series which some people may like, its only the box which it comes in where its with art from the tv show. a must have for any fan of the tv series or fantasy aficionados.
B000W93CHC|2.0|I found Follet's historical research fascinating and love to read books like this as they bring history to life in a way no-fiction works do not. The Hundred Years War will never be a simple phrase to me again, for example.  Nor will the plague.  That said, and despite my loving the characters, I found the book preachy and dreadfully tedious.  I hated Follet's little \\"reminders\\" (a la hit me over the head with a sledge hammer why don't you) of earlier details.  It almost read like a serialized novel or a work in several volumes, with Follet restating parts of the story later as though you didn't already know it.  Heavy handed to the max.  About half way through I started skimming, and that's when a kindle is a disadvantage over a traditional book -- can't just flip pages and see what you want to skip over the way you can in paper.  The one main advantage of the kindle version--I wouldn't want to grant the book the space on my bookshelf.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|I did not think this one to be that good.  Amazing action scenes, great special effects.....  Really good.    I am shocked about the dumb, simple-minded teenager \\"highschool-love\\"  scenes...... Body language and facial expressions of the actors look as if   they belong into a Melrose-Ave episode.....  How in the world can Dreamworks allow something like that to happen?    That ruined a much bigger success and a possible multiple-movie series...    hope they`ll still do another one......
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I have never written a review on Amazon before but I felt compelled after reading some of the reviews of Josh Groban's Illuminations.    I have admittedly come late to the party when it comes to Josh Groban.  I have always admired him as being a truly gifted singer.  I remember seeing him on Ally McBeal, LOVED him in Chess (that's where he really started to win me over.) and have enjoyed his performances on PBS, etc.  But he really won me over when I finally saw him when the Straight To You Tour came to Raleigh.  I knew the voice would blow me away but I was not prepared for how funny, witty, charming and fun he would be. I loved the concert and would go see him again in a heartbeat.    I was also late to the party when it comes to buying his CDs.  But after seeing him live, I  bought Closer, Awake and Illuminations.  And Illuminaitons is actually my favorite of the three.  I have listened to Closer once or twice.  I love some of the songs (like You Raise Me Up), and while I appreciate his talent it's just a bit over-produced for me.      I do admit that some songs on Illuminations took a couple of listens to click for me and some I do occasionally skip over (hence the 4 stars)...like Au Jardin Des Sans-puorquoi and Galileo.  But I cannot stop listening to Voce Existe Em Mim or L'ora Dell Addio.  For me, Voce is the strongest song on the album and really a departure for him.  The drum sections are addicting, they go perfectly with the melody.  I love the change of tempo in the middle of the song and how the last part then speeds up.  And I love to hear him sing in Portuguese.  I think the orchestration is wonderful in this song...love the violins.  When I play the CD in my car, I start with this song, listen all the way through and then go back to it. I can't get enough of it.      And what can I say about the vocals in L'ora Dell Addio except that they are exquisite.  I think that vocally it is the best track on the album.  It moves me every single time I listen toit and that one note that he hits midway through the song never ceases to amaze me.    I'm also impressed that Josh wrote a lot of the songs on this album.  Maybe he does need work as a songwriter but I think that this is very admirable for a real first attempt.  It's not easy to put yourself out there in that way.  I love Hidden Away and Higher Window.  I think the melodies are strong in both songs and I actually really like the lyrics.  And I love the message in If I walk away and how it builds at the end.  I know some are not fans of the falsetto but I think it works.  And I admire the fact that he's taking chances and exploring different aspects of his singing.  We all know he can hit the glory notes and has such a deep, rich sound but maybe he feels the need to explore other parts of his range.  I think the part in Hidden Away when he sings, \\"Sing it out so I can finally breathe in...\\" and he goes from his head voice to his chest voice is glorious.    The two songs that have grown on me are Bells of New York City and Straight To You.  You can really tell how personal Bells is to him having just moved to NYC.  I love the flute and how the chords he's chosen actually sound like bells.  And Straight To You has become one of my favorites.  Everything from the orchestration to the vocals is just beautiful.  I think more than any song on the album you can feel the emotion when he sings.  And I love the lyrics.    I also love that this album really puts Josh's voice front and center.  I have heard many albums where the singer is over-powered by the instruments.   But on this album his voice is clearly in the forefront.  I like that the orchestration is stark in some cases and not overdone because his voice is what shines through.    So, that's my take on it.  As I said, I have never written a review before.  But I'm really enjoying this album and wanted to post my feeling about it.  This is obviously a departure for Josh and I say good for him for following his heart.  He'll never please all the critics or all the fans but at least he's being true to himself and maybe he'll pick up some new fans along the way.  Like me. :-)

0618164413|5.0|The Complete Adventures of Curious George, Anniversary Edition, is a collection of happy memories.  Whether your parents read George's many adventures to you, or whether you read them to a beloved child, this book consolidates all those fun times into one volume.  It is a wonderful way to have every book without having multiple volumes.<br /><br />I found the quality of this volume to be consistent with other mass-produced hard-bound books which are not deluxe, collector's, or limited edition copies.  This allows the book to be priced reasonably and within the budgets of more individuals.  I applaud the publishers for realizing that more expensive editions might have limited the number of families able to acquire The Complete Adventures of Curious George, Anniversary Edition.<br /><br />I would not recommend giving this book to a child who will not be having a parent read to them.  The volume is large and heavy enough to be unwieldy for small children.  It is, however, a wonderful book to give to a family who values reading aloud to their children, to grandparents who want to limit shelf space for their grandchildren's books, or to yourself as a treat.  It is a classic and a five-star work!<br /><br />I was able to purchase this from an Amazon seller, so if it is unavailable when you want one, be sure to look at those offerings.  My book arrived in perfect condition and was a real bargain.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|I was glad to see this game offered for free on Amazon. I had the free version, ad supported, and ended up uninstalling it. The ads were just way to annoying trying to play, other than that I loved this game. It's very challenging, and forcing you to focus on eye-hand control. It does get frustrating as you move up through the levels, but not enough that it isn't addicting. If you like puzzle games this is a fun game! Also works great on my HTC Evo 3g.
B0012GMZZ4|5.0|Amazon Editorial Reviews say it is paper sleeve, I receivied the jewel case CD I felt short change. The music is fantastic I would gave a 5 star for the music but Amazon need to be turthful on the type of products they carry.
B00529J7JE|4.0|All in all, a pretty good album throughout.  I've only had it for about a week now, but my first reaction is I do really enjoy the song choices here.  The album consists of a bunch of older remakes, some date really back there, others not so much.  I was familiar with probably about a quarter of them, and regardless I enjoyed either hearing her version or the new (to me) songs.  Anyway, they are all cover tunes, and by and large I think Andrea does a really good job with the material.  She pretty much has a very distinctive singing style that anyone who is familiar with The Corrs, or her previous album will enjoy.    The highlights of this album are Pale Blue Eyes, never heard it, but a catchy tune the builds from the beginning; Blue Bayou, a Roy song that she does a pretty good job with; No 9 Dream I had never heard before either, but it also pretty good by my reckoning; and They Don't Know which actually has my favorite part of this entire album.  At the very beginning of the song, you get to hear Andrea singing with only very lite guitar in the background.  No background singers, nothing just her amazing voice.  I would say for those 30 seconds or so, the CD is worth the price.    I don't think any Corrs fan would be disappointed with it, and anyone looking for something a little different then the same 12 songs they play on the radio would enjoy it too.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I was hooked from all the sexyness in the movie first. But when I watched it I also liked the plot. I would definetley reccomend. I especially like how they brought everyone from the others together. I also like the twist at the end after the crdits
B0058VW36U|3.0|This game is fun and well worth the price of admission, except for one important detail: load time.

1400032717|5.0|This book is really remarkable.  It lets the reader go inside the head of an autistic teenager.  While I have read about autism, I really never understood how one feels with this \\"handicap\\".   While Christopher, the main character in the story,  had trouble relating to the \\"normal\\" world, he was a genius in science and math.  He saw beauty in things that the average person couldn't see or understand. So what starts out as a mystery--Christopher searching for the murderer of his neighbor's dog--turns into much, much more. There have been very few books that I literally \\"couldn't put down\\", but this one actually was that good.  I recommend this book without reservation to anyone interested in a great story.
B00507ZQSO|5.0|This AIDA on dvd is really long-awaited.  Not only for the outstanding cast (also the Italian pronunciation is really good) but especially for Daniele Gatti's conducting. In my opinion, Gatti is the only one conductor of today who's able to tell us something new about this Verdian score.  The playing of the chords has an incredible touch of \\"Kammermusik\\", which remind us to some atmospheres we would couple with TRISTAN UND ISOLDE or PARSIFAL. I never heard the astonishing violas of the Met phrasing so famous like here! And what about the tension of the first part of the 4th act, where the male chorus is simply terrific without sounding clumsy? But perhaps the most affecting moment of Gatti's interpretation is the finale: thanks also to the soloists and the female chorus, you really wish to die with Aida and Radames...

0425241505|2.0|There hasn't been a PNR debut that's gotten this much buzz since Larissa Ione first made her debut. Other reviewers who have similar tastes to me even stated it was ground breaking fantasy, right up there with Nalini Singh and J.R. Ward. Both authors--along with many other well known authors--gave Dragon Bound serious high praise. So I immediately bought this book against my better judgment, because you can't ignore praise like that.     After 20 pages, I thought I hadn't read enough of the book to get to the \\"ground breaking\\" bits. Then at page 148, I realized this book had nothing special to bring to the table. Harrison's world isn't anything new. The Elder races comprise of the Dark and Light Faye, Elves (who aren't Faye??), and the Wyr. Wyr is just a fancy name for animal shifters of a wide variety--as a treat they do get a bit exotic with Dragons, Thunderbirds, Gryphons, and Harpies. People are quite aware of the supernaturals walking among them, but the history of why is sketchy at best. Harrison's whole world building feels like an after thought. The writings average quality couldn't make up for the lack of world building either. Even the sex scenes were been-there-read-that kind of material.    The humor had me coming back, as it was one of the few things that I loved about this book. The dragon sex jokes really had me rolling. Guessing what Pia's shifter form was another fun plus, until I realized my first guess was right only 50 pages in.  From there things went down hill.     Dragos is older then the world itself--he doesn't feel old he just acts like a older then snot bully with primitive mind sets. Pia was hard to enjoy as a main character, the way she was written made her at times hard to follow and deal with on an emotional level. She was raised to be careful and go unnoticed, because of her mysterious Wyr form. Everything she does is almost like she's trying to shout out, \\"Hey everybody I'm right here!\\"    In the end I will not be paying anymore attention to author praise, no matter how good the author. This is definitely comfort food for hard core PNR fans who don't mind reading the same story over and over. For PNR readers who are a bit more picky, like me, and have standards step back! The same harem of men featured in the many mate-for-life reads out there didn't scream originality. So, I'm not too confident if the future books will have any deeper world building, or character depth. It just feels like this series is going to rely on riding the genre train to keep it a float.    Sexual Content:  Cookie cutter sex scenes and some fun dirty talk.     Rating:  2/5- Average/disappointing, library check-out
B000YAA68W|5.0|If you liked Marjane Satrapi's \\"Persepolis\\" graphic novels, you will probably like this 2007 film as well.  Adapted for the screen by Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, the film brings together both \\"Persepolis\\" and \\"Persepolis 2\\"; so if you have a favorite scene from either book, you should be aware that some necessary telescoping has gone on, and therefore that favorite scene may, from your point of view, receive short shrift.  An advantage of this decision, on the other hand, is that while the film makes clear the brutality of the Islamist regime that took power in Iran after that nation's 1979 revolution, it also makes equally clear that life in the West (once the young Marjane Satrapi escapes from Iran and travels to Austria) has its own hazards.  The film reproduces well the stark black-and-white drawing style of the graphic novels (one of my students referred to the style as \\"monochromatic minimalism\\"), with switches to color photography for a couple of crucial scenes.  While the film can't do everything that the graphic novels do (Satrapi is particularly artful at making individual panels larger or smaller for the sake of dramatic effect), the story translates very well to the motion-picture medium.  I prefer hearing the dialogue in the original French when I watch the film, but an English soundtrack is available as well.  Either way, the actors who voice the parts (including Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, Sean Penn, Iggy Pop, and Gena Rowlands) do an excellent job of bringing the various characters to life.

B000002TYX|4.0|As many have said, this is a product for completists- those who are interested in how the Beatles came to be what they were and the nature of their work outside the official releases. As such, it's a useful and enjoyable overview, though it in no way compares with the material on the records that were officially released.    The issue I have is with the tracks taken from the Decca audition. Surely any Beatles fan would want to hear 'Love of the Loved', a song composed by Lennon/McCartney (mainly McCartney) and sung by McCartney instead of one of the three old potboilers that are included? In particular, why are there two comedy songs featuring George as lead vocalist at a time when he was clearly not in the same league as Paul? The only reason I can think of was that maybe there were some copyright problems, although the other two Lennon/McCartney songs recorded at the audition are included.    Otherwise, be clear what you are buying and you'll find this collection of considerable interest.

B000NYHB7S|1.0|We find Follett's medieval stories to be great, and his wartime spy novels fairly good; and so looked forward to a modern-day storyline in \\"Twin\\". It's difficult to summarize the plot without spoiling it, although the book's title helps us figure out what's going on about 150 pages before the key players do! A researcher, Jeannie Ferrami, is doing clever studies on twins raised apart, where one is a criminal and the other a good guy - working on the old nature versus nurture argument. When her best friend is raped and the good guy is blamed (but we know no way), we all presume the bad twin did it, but he's in jail. You can almost guess the rest.<br /><br />While the plot was somewhat clever and the contemporary setting a twist from the author's other work, the action here was just so far-fetched we could barely wait to get to the end - but not from suspense but rather that feeling of \\"oh, come on, this could never happen\\". When a few romantic elements are the most memorable takeaway from a Follett novel, something is definitely wrong.<br /><br />While we suppose the author was trying to illuminate issues surrounding genetic research, and to a lesser degree, computer-based searches through massive databases, we cannot in good faith recommend this totally implausible tale.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Locke sells books. There's no denying that, and there's no denying that his methods are successful.    If I'm honest with myself, the biggest joy I get from writing is entertaining others. The more people who read them, the better. Making money is a byproduct. A nice one, but one nonetheless.    Locke's \\"business plan\\" maps a perfectly logical way to get your books in front of more eyes - targeted eyes. Eyes of readers who share the sensibilities of your book. I think the single most important aspect of this short book is that - target your audience.    I highly recommend this book. I read it in one sitting and will be revisiting it again and again.

For all you self proclaimed war heros who question the validity of this story, please feel free to write a book of your own.      About the book.  It is an amazing story that every American should read.  The details suck you in and make you feel as though you are there.  You develop a personal bond with each man.  By the end I had a tear in my eye.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is not just a film about the electric guitar. It is a film about three different rock icons from three different generations, three different places and three totally different musical eras and how their love of this instrument shaped their careers in music.<br /><br />Cut to Jack White, the youngest and the cockiest of the three, out on the fields of Tennessee, building a Didley Bow--a rough and ready one-string plucking instrument--with cows looking on. If, like me, you walked into the movie with any doubt at all about his place next to the likes of Jimmy Page, that uncertainty was quickly put to rest from the get-go. Not only does he play his instruments well, he makes `em, he reinvents `em, he owns `em. Hell, he'd chew `em up if he could.<br /><br />Here are three guitar heros who were able to do something different than what had been done before. White really just plays the blues, but he does it his way. And as we peek in at him as he teaches his younger self--as if he could go back in time--we learn about his well-defined sense of aesthetic and purpose: Technology destroys creativity & truth.<br /><br />How would these three icons get along? They had met only incidentally before. So, what we see on screen is fresh, unscripted and unrehearsed.<br /><br />Cut to Edge: Like White, he has clear ideas about the sounds he wants to create. But unlike White, it is all pedals and effects. We are, then, presented with the juxtaposition of the anti-tech and the total-tech. And unlike White, he's never satisfied. He'll practice one lick all day, if that's what it takes to get it right.<br /><br />The photography is beautiful, the lighting is dramatic. It's not just a dry documentary with interviews in linear form. It's the interweaving of three different stories that turn out to be not so different after all.<br /><br />In each case, there is a turning point that inevitably leads to their becoming who they are. For White, should he even be playing the Blues, as a white kid from Detroit? For Page, how could he break free of the stifling world of session work? And for The Edge, would they be able to set themselves apart from the prevalent music of the day?<br /><br />The live footage of a U2 show, almost religious in its all around magnitude and power, reminds us of their place in rock's history. The narrative flirts from the spectacular to the personal, where we see three intimate portraits of three creative musicians each of whom had a love affair with the guitar.<br /><br />Cut to Page: He turns the volume knob on his amp, and the soft, but familiar sounds of summer emerge. Memories of road trips, romances and heartbreak are evoked, as if by magic, from the wooden instrument caressed by Page's hands. It is, as any true Zeppelin fan would have recognized from the first chord, Ramble On. And it is one of the standout moments of the film. With a seamless hit of the tone switch, the riff explodes. Goosebumps are carpeted on the Zep fan's arms. Light and shade, Page explains, by way of layered audio track. Dressed in black, with his white hair loose, his shoulders sway as he plays along the entire length of the fret board. \\"It is like a whisper to the thunder,\\" Page says.<br /><br />They exchange stories, secrets and licks and by the end of it all, a friendship and a mutual respect emerges. White demonstrates \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground.\\" It's fun to see how serious Edge is about figuring it out and getting it right. In his turn, Edge shows the others \\"I Will Follow;\\" when Page asks for clarification--\\"is this in \\"C?\\"--the delight of snooping takes on amplified proportions - a simple question made interesting because it comes from the likes of Page. He's got nothing to prove--he just wants to jam and get it right.<br /><br />And when Page launches into the opening riff of Whole Lotta Love, you know you're seeing one of those moments that are rarely seen--one of those moments where you find yourself wondering what the camera guys' faces looked like.<br /><br />In Ireland, U2 fans will soak up every moment of Edge's visit to his old school and will see the signboards where U2 became U2. We're there when he unearths the earliest, rawest recordings of themselves that exist. We hear what would become \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" which is so raw, in fact, that Bono is simply counting the time because there are no lyrics.<br /><br />At Headley Grange--where Zep recorded their third and fourth albums--Zeppelin fans will relish another remarkable scene in which Page plays \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" on mandolin, so exquisitely, while we look on from beyond the green, majestic grounds.<br /><br />We hear about their first guitars and who their influences were. The usually private Page takes us into his home and into his record collection room, where he plays air guitar to \\"The Rumble\\" with the exuberance of a child.<br /><br />Then, as if to throw us a sweet little goodie for the road, they send us off with an impromptu, acoustic take on \\"The Weight\\" by The Band, with Edge and White trading vocals.

B000RHKARY|5.0|I've been a Mayall fan since I was in Berlin. This album has Mick Taylor, John McVie, Keef Hartley, Chris Mercer(saxaphone) and Rip Kant(saxaphone). His version of \\"Pretty Woman\\" is good, better vocal, and guitar. \\"My Time After a While\\" has Mick Taylor playing guitar, great song. \\"Driving Sideways\\" is another solid sounding guitar & sax tune. Seems like everyone has covered \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" his version is good. Peter Greens \\"Curly\\", \\"Greeny\\", and missing you are flashes of his coming, Mayall has given us so many great muscans, you can hear his influence on Fleetwood Mac rythum & tempo wise.

159514188X|4.0|As a young adult librarian, I don't have time to read every book that comes across my desk.  I try and read a little bit about each title for reader's advisory purposes, but unless a book really jumps out at me, I pass it by.  A year or so I passed by \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" because it appeared to be yet another depressing, gimmicky, teen tale of woe.  A couple of weeks ago one of the regular teen patrons in the library told me that I \\"HAD\\" to read this book, so I decided, if for nothing more than making a positive connection with a reading teenager, I would try it.  I took it out, began reading, and only put it down once.  Many have said that it reads like a thriller - and it does.  It's perverse in a necessary way, and I was hooked.<br /><br />The reason I took away one star is due to one segment/storyline (SPOILER).  The girl who runs over the stop sign and causes a death was too far fetched for the rest of the story.  Every other thing that happens to Hannah  is believable - things I could see really happening to a teenager.  I wish for the sake of realism this didn't occur, but it doesn't ruin the overall story.<br /><br />I really believe this book does a great job raising awareness of how much even the smallest of actions can impact those around us in a negative way.  I overhear teen gossip all of the time, and cannot believe how consistently cruel people can be.  If this book can make a dent in that in any way, it's a valuable addition to any teenagers reading list.  I would love to see this in the hands of every teenager, and assigned as required reading.
B004YJZBCK|4.0|\\"Straight Shooter\\" lives up to its name; Paul Rodgers, Boz Burrell, Mick Ralphs and Simon Kirk[[ASIN:B000BJ62TI Bad Company]]deliver a bulldozer of a mixture of bluesy rock and ballads. Although it's not quite as strong (IMHO)as the debut , I prefer \\"Straight Shooter\\" simply because the best songs are among the best the band created whether it be the sublime ballad \\"Shooting Star\\" or the direct power driven riffs of \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\". While not quite as consistently strong (again, IMHO)as the debut \\"Straight Shooter\\" demonstrated a leap forward with some of the material.<br /><br />Audio Fidelity has had some hit-or-misses over the past two years but this one is hit straight out of the park; Steve Hoffman had access to the original mastertapes (the original U.S. release used a third generation copy)and the results are slightly stronger detail but, more importantly, Hoffman focuses on bringing a stronger midrange to his remaster resulting in an album with kick much like the original vinyl incarnation.<br /><br />The remaster by Ted Jensen sounded quite nice as well although it was louder and compressed compared to the original CD (and this one as well)but this one beats that previous edition by a long mile. I have not heard the recent Japanese edition of this album so can't compare the two of them in terms of sound quality.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the album is relatively short running under 40 minutes. It would have been nice to have the remake of \\"Easy on My Soul\\" (a song that Rodgers wrote and recorded with Kirke for the last Free album) as a bonus track (not unheard of for these gold discs on occasion)as it would have made a nice addition to the album.<br /><br />The artwork has consistently improved for the Audio Fidelity releases and that is the case here as well. I'm hoping that we'll see an upgrade/remaster of \\"Desolation Angels\\" my other favorite Bad Company album.<br /><br />Recommended.

B00000AF98|3.0|With the woeful career low of 1985's `[[ASIN:B00000AF96 Asylum]]' now behind them, Kiss turned to uber-producer Ron Nevison who had produced bands like The Babys and Jefferson Starship and had just returned fellow 70s band, Heart, to superstar status over two albums. Keyboards were a feature of all these guitar bands, so it was, in an act of outrageous audacity (to many fans), that Kiss added them to the arrangements on 1987's `Crazy Nights'. Though much is often made of this in relation to Kiss, it ignores the fact that they were used on `[[ASIN:B000001EL3 Destroyer]]', at least two songs on `[[ASIN:B000001EL7 Love Gun]]', on `[[ASIN:B000001ELN Unmasked]]' and on `[[ASIN:B000001ELP Music From the Elder]]'.<br /><br />The result is a slick, glossy, upbeat record that is part Kiss part something along the lines of Bon Jovi. In terms of their catalogue, the closest touchstone is probably 1979's '[[ASIN:B000001ELL Dynasty]]' which was also part heavy rock pop and part hard rock. Though it was certainly Kiss toned down, often to hard pop, it was light years ahead of the abominable `Asylum'.<br /><br />Working with contract songwriters they had worked with to great effect before in Adam Mitchell (`[[ASIN:B000001ELR Creatures of the Night]]') and Desmond Child (`[[ASIN:B00000AF95 Animalize]]'), the band produced some of the best songs they had written in years. As a set it is pretty strong, with even Gene Simmons delivering reasonable quality goods on most occasions - though the odd `Asylum' moments remain (`Bang Bang You' and `No, No, No'). The high points, on the other hand, are truly stellar. They even return to a (power) ballad after a three album absence - Paul Stanley's excellent `Reason to Live' (co-written with Diane Warren, who was just as ubiquitous to commercial US hard rock acts at the time as Desmond Child). Other standouts from the Stanley camp include `My Way', `Turn on The Night' and the towering hard rock melodrama of `I'll Fight Hell to Hold You'. He is also responsible for the lightweight title track, a `Rock and Roll All Night' wannabe that is nevertheless fun, even if it is overly affirmational. On all these tracks, Stanley's vocal performance is truly inspiring. Simmons' `Good Girl Gone Bad' is also a highlight (sort of like `She's So European' was to `Unmasked'). The rest is average but certainly not terrible.for the lightweight title track, a `Rock and Roll All Night' wannabe that is nevertheless fun, even if it is overly affirmational.

B001684L0A|4.0|Portraying history in a drama is a complex thing to do; ignore one event and you upset one group while if you take great words spoken but put them in a new context that is more dramatic to make it more interesting and vital on screen you upset purists but stay true to what occurred in history and you run the risk of creating a show that could easily become boring for many people. A drama is exactly that--not history nor does it pretend to be. As drama \\"John Adams\\" is gripping giving us insight and allowing us to understand our founding fathers as complex human beings.<br /><br />The cast does an outstanding job of humanizing these people from history making it possible to relate to their actions whether they be honorable or petty.<br /><br />Although based on David McCullough bestselling biography, the producers and writer Kirk Ellis used other sources in addition to the biography by McCullough to give us a broader view of the time and the drama that surrounded Adams and the birth of our country.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks positively stunning with a sharp, detailed transfer that has more depth than I saw when I rented the regular DVD. Dark scenes in particular benefit from the high definition format with richer and more accurate detail. The audio sounds terrific throughout with a nice surround lossless mix.<br /><br />For those that are concerned with 100% historical accuracy, I'd suggest reading McCullough's book and other information on Adams (because as good as McCullough's book IS he also shows a certain bias towards his subject as he interprets Adams thoughts and actions based on his writings and the writings of others)but as far as a historical drama, \\"John Adams\\" is hard to beat. For those who can't stand the \\"unsteady cam\\" shooting style that is pretty common today, you won't find a lot of long, traditional Hollywood steady shots here. The style is designed to add to the drama and create a sense of \\"being there\\"; whether or not that happens will be up to the viewer and whether or not you can tolerate that style.u can tolerate that style.

The album's musicians and singers bring the Blues' emotions of joy, heartache, humor, sorrow from the past to the present.  A beautiful blend they are with Hugh's singing, 'voicing', laughing and fabulously expressive piano playing        Mr. Laurie is a talented actor, comedian, writer but I feel that 'musician performing the Blues' is his new, true calling.  His passion for this music is a joy to behold so sit back, relax, close your eyes and let the Blues flow.  Enjoy.

As I recall much of this is repurposed from material available from the promo pieces and stuff at the website.<br /><br />\\"The Night's Watch\\" gives us background on these characters and their mission to protect the realm that is drawn from the novels.<br /><br />\\"Creating The Title Sequence\\"  and \\"Creating The Dothaki Language\\" are interesting featurettes on the creation of the wonderful evocative opening sequence of the show as well as the langauge for the fierce Dothaki that will, later, be so important to the series.<br /><br />We also get quite a few Easter Eggs included as part of this set.<br /><br />Series developers David Benioff (novelist and screenwriter of \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"Wolverine\\")and D.B. Weiss manage to stay true to what made Martin's marvelously detailed novels so popular with readers while making the show visually appealing to viewers. The series does have a convoluted plot so if you miss an episode it's wise to try and catch up by actually watching what you've missed.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the show continues to develop in popularity so it doesn't face the same fate of \\"Rome\\", \\"Carnivale\\" and \\"Deadwood\\" all three shows that were rich in character development, plot and visually stunning shows that HBO cancelled without allowing them to fully develop. The ten episodes of the first season are filled with enough twists and turns for a 24 episode normal TV show.<br /><br />The strong performances from Bean, Dinklage, Headey and others in the case make their characters rich, appealing, appalling and sympathetic at turns. The stylish direction and visually rich production design only add to the appeal of the series which has just begun to develop more of the fantasy elements towards the end of the first season.<br /><br />I can recommend \\"Game of Thrones\\" based on viewing the HBO series and although I have no idea what special features HBO has for the Blu-ray or DVD set yet, even without those extras, this show is essential viewing.ally rich production design only add to the appeal of the series which has just begun to develop more of the fantasy elements towards the end of the first season.<br /><br />I can recommend \\"Game of Thrones\\" based on viewing the HBO series and although I have no idea what special features HBO has for the Blu-ray or DVD set yet, even without those extras, this show is essential viewing.
B000068PQ7|5.0|Every year I end the summer by going to the Jersey shore for a week with a stack of obscure CD's to pass the time. A few years back Gene Clark's album \\"White Light\\" (which I had been meaning to get for years) became one of the discs in my \\"shore music\\" collection. I spent the next seven days on the beach listening to this disc over and over, and it really got its hooks into me. This was the first Gene Clark album I bought, like many I was familiar with his work with the Byrds, but the songs here prove that he was so much more than just the former singer of the Byrds. Clark was really breaking ground here; I don't think it's a coincidence that so much of what he was doing on \\"White Light\\" became so commonplace in the early seventies with bands like the Eagles having such commercial success with the same formula. Unfortunately for Clark, the brilliance of his writing and his songs didn't translate into album sales. However, reviewing this album so many years later, Clark's talent as a musician is undeniable. The melodies of some of these songs are addictive, and Clark's voice is in fine form throughout. Clark's choice of using Jesse Ed Davis as his producer for the album also proved to be a wise one, as the arrangements on \\"White Light\\" remain some of the most tasteful of Clark's recording career. I was admittedly a little skeptical about Clark's choice of covering Dylan's \\"Tears Of Rage\\", thinking prior to hearing it that there was no way he could hold a candle to Dylan's version with the Band. However, hearing Clark's version proved me wrong. His choice of doing a more plaintive version was effective and I really ended up liking it. I would say that the five bonus tracks included on the 2002 CD release are by no means essential, but for fans of Clark's they are indeed a bonus. In the years since getting this album I have bought all of Clark's albums, with the exception of the near impossible to find \\"Two Sides To Every Story\\", which I understand is to be released in 2011. \\"White Light\\" truly converted me into a die-hard fan of Gene Clark's, and these songs may just win you over as well. And is it just me, or is this one of the coolest album covers ever???2011. \\"White Light\\" truly converted me into a die-hard fan of Gene Clark's, and these songs may just win you over as well.

B0052U59F4|5.0|HOT,HOT...HOTHOTHOT!!! I couldn't put this down and when I was finished with it I was ready to start all over again and re-read it. The characters are very well written and you truly get in touch with each and every one of them. You feel what they are feeling, see, taste & smell what they are. This book was very vivid to me. There were a few editing errors but I didn't think there were as many as other reviews lead me to believe. Ms. James is a true story teller. This is such a great love story but it's definately not for the faint of heart. There are very descriptive BDSM scenes in it. I can't wait until the next one comes out!

B0028RXXFC|4.0|Sadly abandoned by HBO when the rising costs of the TV series cut into the production budget too much, \\"Rome\\" was originally envisioned to run four or five years. The first season runs at a leisurely pace compared to season two. Telling the story of the rise of Julius Caesar, the fall of the Roman Republic and the seduction of Caesar and Mark Antony by Cleopatra (although I would point out that the seduction was mutual)from the point-of-view of two common Roman soldiers Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd best known for \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" in the U.S.) and Titus Pollo (Ray Stevenson)as they are thrust onto center stage after serving Caesar, \\"Rome\\" even in its shortened two season run manages to be compelling entertainment with enough twists and turns for TWO TV series.<br /><br />One of the flaws of the series was the fact that the creators had to pack so much into so little time to conclude the series. This resulted in an often fragmented second season that jumped through story often losing important elements to help explain or detail the development of the story.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a detailed, rich presentation that has more depth than the DVD that HBO released a couple of years back. The special features included are quite nice including a pop up trivia track that allows you to learn more about Roman society as you watch the show and then seamlessly take you back to the episode you were watching.<br /><br />We get nearly three hours of extras primarily presented in standard definition including \\"The Rise of Rome\\", \\"Ceasar's Triumph\\" and \\"Gladiator\\" that focuses on the creation of these two key scenes from the film. \\"The Rise of Octavian\\" which details the rise to power of Rome's emperor as well as \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\" that gives us what we know from historical documents about the duo and their powerful alliance that united Egypt and Rome. There's also a very good featurette on the production of the second season of the series.<br /><br />While the series became increasingly fragmented by the second season due to the shortened production schedule \\"Rome\\" still manages to be a fascinating drama with strong performances throughout. Personally I feel that HBO SHOULDN'T embark on long, large scale dramas because they can't be counted on to allow the series to reach its natural conclusion unless it is a popular series like \\"The Sopranos\\".<br /><br />Recommended.e series became increasingly fragmented by the second season due to the shortened production schedule \\"Rome\\" still manages to be a fascinating drama with strong performances throughout.

B004E0Z4XK|5.0|I am an admitted Danger Mouse fan.  I have liked all of his music so far.  This album is no different.  It has that distinctful Danger Mouse sound, but what carries the day are the guest vocal spots from Jack White and Norah Jones.  I will not try to describe the nuances of their singing styles, but I will just generally say they both fit with the music.  The album is not long at all and there were two songs that should be skipped all of the time, but overall the album is worth purchasing.  There is nothing substantial in the liner notes, so if you are comfortable with a digital download, I would recommend it for this CD.
B003Y7L5W8|3.0|My interest in OMD is confined to the first 4 albums and one subsequent single. When they went all chart geared with the bland 'Junk Culture', I couldn't be bothered any further. Even with the albums I do like I find them very spotty, though the most consistent is their debut.    Then came the reunion and the new album. I listened to samples of the new album, as well as some interviews, and found that OMD have reassessed their career and also felt their first several albums were their best. Good conclusion. But they also were quick to defend their new album by saying is forward looking without forgetting their past. These aging artists who are clearly trying to recapture the essence of their heyday by having some sort of \\"return to form\\", only to claim that's not really what they are doing, just need to deal with the fact that you can sound like you did 30 years ago, though with new songs, and still have a reason to be proud of it rather than make excuses for it.    With that in mind, I purchased 'History of Modern' with optimism, but was in no way blown away. Yes, they have returned to using some analog equipment, but the songwriting is still a scattered mess. The album opens with the retro analog stylings of New Babies, New Toys, which is an album highlight, but then goes into the awful choice for a first single, If You Want It. We get back to the better material with both History of Modern (Part I and Part II). These are both strong standouts mixing retro with modern with good results. The last truly great song is the 30 year leftover track, Sister Marie Says. It rings of Enola Gay but is more interesting, IMHO. As great as the song is, the video they release for it was one of the worst ideas. Oh well...    Aside from the previously mentioned good songs, I find little else on 'History of Modern' to warrant repeated listenings. As far as I'm concerned, it's little more than an EP with a number forgettable fillers. But since I think similar of 'Organisation', I can't be too disappointed...
B001FB4W0W|1.0|It would be dark and awesome, especially after seeing its amazing cover. The storyline is okay. Vampires \\"coming out of the coffin\\" since the invention of Tru:Blood. And about them living - or being dead? - among human life. The sex is insulting to people who have an IQ. The language makes you wish you couldn't hear. And the totally fake Southern accents in itself is a slap to the face of real people of the South and Louisiana.     For it to be a vampire show, there's not much gore and blood in it. The only gore in it is when a vampire is killed or the serial killer strikes again. Biting is, of course, expected. The show doesn't even look like it should be made for adults it is so mindless. This could be TV-14 if it weren't for the sex and language. Apparently everyone in Bon Temps drinks at Merlotte's Bar and Grill and sleeps around. The F-word is so casually used it's almost disturbing. Then, not to mention, the perfect Sookie Stackhouse, whom everyone loves and wants to protect from scary Vampire Bill. Sookie is a virgin and doesn't drink, lives with her Gran, and has a sex-addict of a brother, Jason Stackhouse. Even as the seasons progressed, Sookie is still looked upon as innocent and fragile, even though she curses a lot, too, and has recently discovered a passion for sleeping with her dead boyfriend, as bizarre as that sounds.     The show just looks like porn with a currently popular storyline. The books even read like it is aimed for the young adults. But seemingly mature ones. The books are \\"better\\" than the show, but not saying it's good, either. When I saw this in stores, the season one DVD, and not knowing at the time the show was at all related to the Sookie Stackhouse Novels, this looked killer. TV-MA. So there would be a lot of violence and gore, some language, and I hoped no sex like it actually is. Of course with a vampire show I expected there to be some language and sex, just not like this. There is more than one scene per episode, and that's ridiculous, even for a horny adult.     I mainly expected it to be TV-MA 'cause of strongly explicit violence. But when I purchased episode one on iTunes, it was garbage. Trashy, foul-mouthed, and more like a cheap soap opera instead of a vampire show. The acting was so fake even for television, cheesy, lame, and truly a waste of my time.     I hope you won't consider purchasing this. If you aren't familiar with the show and what it's about, or the books it was \\"based\\" on, do yourself a favor and don't buy this. If you want gory, bloody action and exciting storylines and halfway decent, do not expect to find it in anything True Blood. You'd think with a name like True Blood it'd be cool - but it's really just not. It is terrible and cheap.     *** Please note when I said I only really expected it to be TV-MA for violence/gore, is because I have never watched anything on HBO, therefore I didn't know what to expect.
B0009QN4EO|5.0|Steven Spielberg's first and perhaps greatest masterpiece (of many) also epitomizes the summer blockbuster.

B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|With a cursory listen on NPR I was hesitant to buy the disc but I did because I am an unapologetic REM fan.  That doesn't mean that I don't think that Reveal and Around the Sun weren't crap - let me be clear about that.  But I didn't know if Accelerate was one time \\"come back\\" or if they were back for good.  One of the songs (Oh My Heart) is just a reworking of another slow Accelerate song - I got that from the NPR preview. Did they need to do it again?  Disc in hand - before popping it in I read some of the lyrics and I got worried - they seemed like a poor retread of earlier Michael Stipe, and some of them seemed quite lame to be honest - the line about \\"I am not a hater\\" - what happened Michael?  But then I listened to it and those lyrics that seemed a retread were in a new context - a good one.  And the songs, the music itself is an evolution of the band not just a copy of their earlier days in the hopes of winning back some of their dwindling fan base.  I've been there for the whole ride and while I feel like the whole period from Monster to Around the Sun (five consecutive albums - oh brother)is definitely the low point for REM there are great individual songs that came from these recordings and they tried new things.  Collapse Into Now takes the best of this bad run and the best of the past too and delivers.  I like it better than Accelerate. Give it the headphone test and really take it in.  Uberlin is classic - amongst their best and fresh. There is a good mix of rocking tunes and folksy sorts of things.  They should be touring this album.      All that said - REM from the mid 80's to early 90's is a different band.  They were a real, leading musical voice (mumbly, vague and hopeful) for a crowd of young liberals that needed expression.  That was a good time to listen to REM. We can't erase the sour period and imagine that it is 1992 again. They don't speak to me that way now.  I actually think that musically - as songwriters - they have always gotten better and this album is evidence - but the momentum for the movement frayed a while ago and it's hard to believe in REM now.      This is a good album from a classic band.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|Firstly, let me straight up say that this was an excellent film.  Neeson is very believable as an action star, action hero even -- \\"Taken\\" has him pegged for that role -- and the story line was great (did NOT see the twist at the end for a mile, so well done!)    The only reason it wasn't 5 stars is because when I was watching scenes of an American badass fighting guys trying to kill him, suffering from mental amnesia, in Germany, with a pretty blonde helping him out, the overwhelming thought was that I was watching \\"Bourne Identity\\" again.    Had there not been a \\"Bourne Identity,\\" I would have easily given this 5 stars.  The ONLY reason I held back from the highest of praise was because parts of this felt too copied.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I watched these movies when they came out  Identity - meh  Supremacy - didn't score any points  Ultimatum - pulled the rug out from under me  Watched them all again and finally got it - a rare case of both sequels being better than the first movie.    How many action movies do you see in which the protagonist fights using a book, a magazine and a ball-point pen?  Or in which he goes through mayhem just to say sorry to a girl, for killing her parents?  Or in which he looks apologetic after just choking an assassin to death?  Bourne is no Bond...whew.    The guy has no snappy one-liners, no sunglasses, no sharp clothes, no cool gadgets, no fast cars, no techno-weapons, no beautiful women hanging off his arm, and loses his girl by the second act. He has no team to back him up, there are no mega-explosions or bullet-spraying gun battles, and he is not out for revenge or to save the world. Its about a man trying to understand who he is and why he's done the things that he has.    And all this wrapped up in incredible action movies that have the least staged-looking hand-to-hand combat scenes that I have seen (Supremacy and Ultimatum). Fights with no background music, no slow-motion, all the grunting you'd expect during such brawls and the fighters just trying to use what's around them to their best advantage - close to gritty, real-world stuff.    Downsides - some scenes look a little cheesy (Identity), some a little motion-sickness inducing (Ultimatum) and some repetitiveness (all 3).    But somehow I can watch these movies over and over again...and John Powell's music is excellent.  This is simply a unique series in the action movie genre. What else can I say except that Damon as Bourne will be missed - a flawed guy in a sea of modern-day superheroes. He was what he battles now - an assassin. I like that he's so human.
1439181780|2.0|No, I am not hopping on the bandwagon here and saying I liked/enjoyed/was enriched by this book because so many others have. The author tries to promote love as the guiding and unifying force of the universe, which I would agree with, but she also defines love as \\"love of work\\", or \\"love of art\\", or \\"love of a favorite car\\", which I think is semi-ridiculous and in a way, insulting. Perhaps I'd have enjoyed this book more (I read about a third of it before deciding that, unfortunately, it was a waste of my time) if she had not tried to lump \\"excitement over a material possession\\" or \\"stimulation as a force to pursue a vocation\\" along with \\"love of a fellow person or animal\\", and included the first two in her definition of what love is.  For the previously-mentioned reasons, I could not get very far into this book. Sorry I spent my money on it (it was NOT inexpensive).

B003Y5H54W|5.0|Usually I wouldn't have cared for this one, however there is somthing about Amanda Seyfried that I find irresistable & being a fan of Gary Oldman I had to watch this one & to my surprise I liked it, I never watched any of the \\"Twilight\\" films, so I had nothing to really compare it too, this is a unique spin on not only a classic fairy tale but a film about a werewolf that sort of has a horror movie like feel to it as well as some cool suspense, the overall look of the film is nicely done, & you really feel like you are back in the dark European days, Gary Oldman once again has a field day as a would be werewolf hunter, not since the \\"Fifth Element\\" has Oldman has so much fun with a character as he does here, but it is Amanda Seyfried who really shines here, I can't picture anyone else in this role, her beauty really comes out in that red cloak, there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, but if you are looking for a beautifully shot film in a winter setting on a classic tale with two strong leads, this is one to get.

B003UESJEM|5.0|This movie really captured the experience of being outsourced or fired. I've lived a number of similar experiences and what struck me about the movie was just how real it was. It never ceases to amaze me how many people think they have it made because they have a \\"good job\\" and a nice house but yet are a couple of paychecks away from a major financial meltdown if their income ever stopped.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|After seeing the number of 1 star reviews of this cd I thought I should weigh in. If you're the type of person who orders the same thing every time you go to a particular restaurant, because you know exactly what it will taste like; then you may want to avoid buying this cd. If you're the kind who hates seeing kids grow up, and becoming young adults with developing minds of their own that may not always agree with you; then you may want to consider another cd choice as well.  On the other hand if you have a sense of adventure, and love the thrill of discovering something that challenges what you thought was true, then this cd ought to be right up your alley.  Does it sound like \\"For Emma\\"? Kind of, in all the right ways. Is it new and different? Deffinately, again in all the right ways! I say buy it. Give it a chance to sink in, and I think you will be rewarded with a beautiful experience. It is meditative and expansive at the same time. I can't wait to hear it in my car again tomorrow.
B0053R3J7G|4.0|I know, all Lego sets are worth five stars.  I love Lego too, but please hear me out.    This is Lego's second house from the Creator line for 2011, the first being the Log Cabin (5766) and the third being the Lighthouse (5770).  I like just about all the Creator sets because they avoid specialized pieces, often use ingenious building techniques, have multiple build directions, and usually come with a very useful assortment of bricks.  Creator sets are closer to how Lego was when I was a kid.    This is a two story white house with gray trim, a red roof, beige windows and a blue front door.  This set is called the Hillside House because the house and yard are raised one brick (as if on a hill).  The house has a lot going on:  an electronic sound brick for the doorbell/dog bark, a blue car, carport, cool french doors, solar panel, mini-figure, dog, BBQ, etc.  There are three builds, all of them feature a lift-off top for access to the lower floor.  The first design also has a hinged roof portion while the second and third designs have a swinging wall that allows for additional access.  I like the second design best; Lego calls it a Holiday home but it has nice modern lines and the solar panels have been turned into a small pool.    I'm not as keen on this set as the other Creator house sets for 2011.  Part of the reason is value.  Though this set features an electronic brick and has some interior features, the set shows significant price inflation.  Compare, for example with Lego 4954 from 2007, which was at the same price point but featured 1174 bricks versus the Hillside House's 714.  The Apple Tree House (5891) from last year is still widely available, is of similar proportions (though no car or sound brick) and is 35% less.  Compared to the 2011 sets, I think you get just as much playability, if not more, from the lower priced Log Cabin or Lighthouse (this latter one also includes an electronic light brick).      Another reason I recommend the other sets is theyare more unique.  I believe the 2011 Lighthouse is the first dedicated lighthouse they've offered.  The Log Cabin is also an unusual design.  By comparison, Lego often has a suburban style home in their lineup.  Similarly the other sets have more rare colors and shapes.  White bricks and red roof tiles are classic Lego, but they are fairly common.  The Log Cabin's rust roof tiles, the Lighthouse's curved corner bricks, and the Apple Tree House's blue roof tiles are more difficult to find and are very useful in making your own unique designs.      This is still a great house with many fun features.  I just don't think it stacks up as well against Lego's other offerings.  And if you are a parent who tires easily of repetitive electronic toy sounds, you will want to hide the doorbell brick.
0060872675|3.0|I like Pratchett's novels and could easily imagine that he would be a good kid's book writer. And he is but unfortunately there is not a lot of it in this one. Nice graphics, amusing story (the kids love it) but much too short.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|Beyonce is completely lost and confused. She's been in the industry a long time and we have yet to understand who she is as a musician.  I listened to the album and found myself wondering what her genre is.  Where her peers have the courage or gall to be who they want to be, she appears to be stuck in the 'what will sell, what will keep me on top and what single will warrant an indecent video which will garner interest and sales even if the song is ridiculously stupid and juvenile.'     Proof ? Well, no mature 29 y o woman should ever put her name to a song called 'We run the world'. Now, Willow Smith or The Cheeky Girls would have nailed it but come on Bee you know you can do better than that. The falsetto on the first track screamed of Aguilera or Carey but it was delivered with no emotion or personality and 1+1 was completely juvenile befitting some up and coming female rapper.    The confused Bee ???? Well, one has only got to listen to 'Best thing I never had' or 'Love on top' to hear two beautiful songs, Debarge deserves a grammy for the latter. But again as much as the songs were beautiful there is no emotion used to deliver them.  Two songs do not a great album make. Even the Diane Warren track is wishy washy. Not sure how this album will do as much of the songs are boring ballads but she needs to release 'Love on Top' if the album is to do well.
B000MV90B2|4.0|The movie \\"Waterloo' staring Christopher Plummer as Wellington and Rod Steiger as 'ol Boney' still is a classic movie, yet to be redone, remade, or rewritten as what happens with history changing events.  Students of the Napoleonic Wars can detect through this movie the on going grudge match between the two rivals as they size up one more on the battlefield following Napoleon's return from Elba. Much like the recent movie 'Valkyrie' where you know the eventual outcome of the event in question, you are still watching the events of June 15th unfold in graphic, historical order, while getting the feeling that Napoleon might just pull it off despite the blunders of his Generals (Ney's untimely cavalry charge comes to mind) and the weather induced mud, slowing Boney's reaction to the British. All-in-all, still a great movie for history buffs in general and Napoleonic enthusiast in a particular.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I'm completely addicted even though I've beat the game a few times now. I would really like to see new levels &amp; new plants in an update. Also, I really don't like that 3 seeds are chosen for you on subsequent rounds of the game. Many times the preselected seeds are not useful so getting all those coins to buy the 9th seed slot was more than negated by that.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|If you need a solid DAC for converting an optical digital audio signal to RCA or RCA to optical, this is a nice unit at a good price.<br /><br />I did some research into DAC chips. This unit contains a very good DAC chip. Having said that, I ran the audio signal from different devices through my Sony HDTV (2010 basic model) via an HDMI cable. The Sony HDTV has a DAC in it too and RCA outs (analog out is increasingly rare on HDTVs). I was able to compare audio quality running the audio through the HDMI via the HDTV DAC to RCA and then to an amp AND from different devices directly with optical (Toslink) to this DAC, and then RCA to the amp. The speakers were Magnepan MMGs. All digital audio signals that had Dolby Digital were reduced to two channel stereo in various device settings or were that way to begin with. (If your device cannot change to two channel, all you hear is noise. Some HDTVs with only optical out might not be able to turn Dolby Digital off.<br /><br />For Blueray/DVD, Pandora (via Roku XR optical out), iTunes music I bought directly from Amazon as MPEGS, and Netflix, I could not discern any difference from the FiiO D3 DAC compared to audio processed through my Sony HDTV (DAC in it unknown). I think this is in part less to do with the DAC but simply that these devices and recordings are not technically complex enough to push even a basic DAC like this. What you put in is what will come out, in this case. BTW: the Roku DAC is quite good too IMHO. Better than the Sony built in DAC. On the XR, it has RCA out on the back. I use that direct to the amp for all Roku audio.<br /><br />However, when I played audio CDs (Jane Monheit, Never Never Land) I converted to Apple Lossless in iTunes sent over WiFi to an Apple TV 2 to this DAC to my amp, the audio was better. I could also hear the tape hiss on older digital conversions of classic jazz albums I own on CD (Oscar Peterson, Night Train). I would assume, in this case, hearing hiss is a good thing as it shows you that the DAC is capturing the full recording.<br /><br />I also owned an MCM 24Bit/96K D/A converter which uses the Burr-Brown DAC. The MCM is supposed to be the best low cost DACs out there. But, frankly, unless you are an audiophile, save your money. This FiiO DAC is fine especially for the PRICE.<br /><br />All testing was done with direct amplification. No equalization or base/treble modification.<br /><br />Clarification: It was not ACC it was Apple Lossless I used! My mistake... Hopefully the audiophiles who freaked out will now calm down (except for the CD fanatics).he full recording.   I also owned an MCM 24Bit/96K D/A converter which uses the Burr-Brown DAC.

0786956291|5.0|I played D&D in college but that was awhile back so I ordered the red box when I wanted to try playing d&d with my kids (12+). This set makes it really easy. Being a dungeon master is fun but can be very time consuming. This wonderful set teaches you how to play and how to DM while you play! Of course as a DM you need to read ahead and I found myself making little cheat sheets so I'd have all the information at my fingertips when I needed it, but still it was very easy with this set. And much to my delight the kids loved it! I thought with all the video games this would not be as exciting but they really got into their characters and are thinking up quests of their own. Less screen time and more together time! Talk about a great family game night, this is it!!!    My only problem is that I'm now addicted to all the nice power cards, tiles and the pre-made adventure this kit has. I'm wishing there were a series of 10 of these boxed sets, each with a different adventure and all the markers and power cards to go with it. That doesn't seem to be available though so I'm groveling through the D&D web site looking for everything we need for our next adventure. But we've been playing for awhile now just with the original set so I it's well worth the money!    I highly recommend it!

B00403CLKK|5.0|This ie Katherine's third Music DVD. \\"Live at LLangollen\\" and \\"Katherine ih the Park\\" , which are the other Music DVDs  by Katherine Jenkins. These two are her singing with orchestra and the occasional duet with a tennor. Both leave you with a joyfull feeling. \\"Believe: Live From The O2\\", her third offering, still has the beautiful music,and her singing ie extraordinary. The stageing and showmanship make this show unique in the best possible way. She Flys while singing \\"Angle\\" with an acrobat. Very Good.
B001HN6922|1.0|My family loves Pixar films - we've seen each film in the theater, own the entire collection, and our boys have grown up loving the characters and stories.  I'd argue that many of Pixar's films deserved best picture - Wall-E, Up, and Toy Story 2 especially.  I'd even say that the first Cars film was sweet, surprisingly well developed, and a fine story.  But Cars 2 is... garbage.  Complete and utter garbage.    The plot, such as it is, could have been written by a computer.  Other reviewers cover it well, and I agree with the points that the plot was derivative, simplistic, and utterly predictable.  The morals taught in the film were so pedantic, so... trivial, that they seem as an afterthought to the endless series of explosions, frenetic and spastic action, and even poor voice acting.    Man, this film was awful.  This should have been a straight-to-DVD Target stocking stuffer, instead Cars 2 is now the cinematic abortion that will be remembered as the low point where Pixar remembered that story is important, not just animation.    I hope that somewhere, Steve Jobs is throwing a fit and trying to bring Pixar back to its roots.  After firing the folks who approved and wrote this film - and sending them to Dreamworks, where they belong.

030726999X|5.0|This title caught my attention and I mistakenly read it before reading the other 2. I loved it and reading them out of order oddly still worked fine. I'm sure I would have enjoyed them even more having read them in order, although I can't imagine how they could get better. They were interesting and suspenceful. They really satisfied my mind's desire to put the puzzle pieces together. Great stories!!
0345529057|4.0|Hello everyone!  The novels themselves are worth far more than just five stars but since I am reviewing the item I recieved here is my review:    The reason it got four stars is because I must admmit that the \\"box\\" cover is very thin almost like odinary paper...my for example got a bit damaged around the edges due to a long travel (from the US to Europe), because they are so soft.  Book covers are a very thin paperback and the icon in the middle of the book is not \\"3D\\" or how should I put it..you can't feel the picture because it's only printed on (eg. you can't feel the crown and the clash of kings book).  Plus the covers have a band (at the top) printed on that says \\"#1 New York Times bestseler\\". This for some people deminishes the collectors value.  The paper is also very thin but does not present a problem.  The reasons above are all negative so here is the positive feedback:  - the book has the same content no mather the cover, size and shape, the words are all the same  - due to its low qality paper it makes a comeback by saving space..the books are quite thin if you take in to count that they have roughly 1000 pages each    So to sum up: You really get what you pay for, I payed about 23 wich is 5 cheaper if I would order a better quality paperback (28 for all four books)

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I just now finished viewing this movie and was very moved by it. I read amost of the 1 or 2 star reviews and they were mostly about the inaccuracies to the book. That is hardly the point. It was a marvelous presentation full of marvelous performances. I highly recommend you to view the movie, whether you have read the book or not. People forget that movies are basically to be entertaining and interesting, and this mini series scores a 10 on both points, as far as I am concerned. What great performances by all the cast! Forget about the book, if you read it - just watch this movie as it is presented.  It is worth it!
B000002KXV|5.0|The brilliant composer/player/leader Donald Fagen really hit a grand slam with this wonderful 1982 release . Special mention should go to some superb players ; Greg Phillinganes and Michael Omartian (piano and keys) , Marcus Miller (bass) ,and Larry Carlton (guitar) . Everyone who contributed is a winner though . Fun while having substance (not abuse) in 1982 . Who knew ?
0316069353|3.0|I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly, but I have to say I was disappointed in this book. I, too, thought The Lincoln Lawyer was one of his best books and I love the Harry Bosch books. This book just didn't hold my attention. I did finish it although there were times when I wondered if I was wasting my time. That isn't like me. I was somewhat relieved when I read the other mediocre reviews. I decided it wasn't just me. I have to admit part of the problem was that I was watching the Casey Anthony trial the same week and even the best legal thrillers couldn't hold a candle to that. Still, I can't recommend this book to anyone - even if you're an avid Michael Connelly fan. Especially if you're an avid Michael Connelly fan.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I've been following Thomas Bergersen and the amazing epic music he's written for Two Steps From Hell, so I bought this with high expectations.  Nevertheless, my mind was blown again and again while listening to this masterpiece.  It is stunning - he captures human emotion so perfectly in this aural piece of art, that it takes me places no other music has.  When I'm feeling sad/depressed/, I turn on his music, and life seems to be better.  When I'm running and need some extra energy to push through to the end, I put on this album, and somehow it gives me the energy I need to complete the run.  It is the only music I've listened to for over a week, and I can't stop listening to it - it's more addictive than crack.  If you only buy one album in your entire life, buy this.

B003F3NDP8|4.0|The series is good, but I was disappointed in this one compared to the first 5 in that they got into a lot of \\"politically correct\\" issues, such as the green movement, gay issues and Mexican heritage. While it wasn't a major part of the series (except the gay/lesbian issue) I did not appreciate it being brought into the series. We get enough propaganda about these issues from the MSM, I don't need the same in my entertainment.
B0056BMK6K|2.0|This was largely a waste certainly not worth the price.  Here's what Mr. Locke's advice is for selling a million e-books:  1.  Write a good book - no kidding, goes without saying;  2.  Open up a Twitter account and proceed to obtain many friends who will buy your book and give you a good review - Huh?  He does not provide information as to how to do that;  3.  Start blogging to your target audience - well, how does one start a blog and get people interested in reading it?  No information, absolutely none provided.  4.  Self-publish, without any information as to how that is done.    Also, it became most annoying the way Mr. Locke tooted his own horn - oh, I get it, that was the whole idea behind publishing this book.  Shame on me, I fell for it.
0891419063|5.0|This is a wonderful book written by an extraordinary man who fought in WWII for our freedom.  This book was used is some part to make the HBO miniseries \\"The Pacific\\", which I also highly recommend.  I had a hard time finding this book at book stores, so I tried Amazon, and sure enough they had it!  It was very reasonably priced and was delivered to me very quickly by Amazon.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|There are so many wonderful surprises in this fairly ordinary action/adventure/military/thriller movie--and to me, the most important is that it was filmed in Shreveport, my hometown, second or third largest site of film-making in this country today. And \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" was a rousing movie!<br /><br />What I especially like in no particular order:<br /><br />1. The casting is so diverse! Finally, Latinos are getting their due in films and make up a large portion of actors in this one. There is also one Asian in this company. Later a woman, also Latina, joins them and shows her bravery and courage. Bravo for this attention to ethnic and gender detail!<br /><br />2. Aaron Eckhart (the big name in this film) is terrific in his role of Staff Sargeant, a man who has just turned in his retirement papers when aliens attack and he is called to second a patrol. I liked him as a genial chef in [[ASIN:B00005JPSM No Reservations]] with Katherine Zeta Jones. What a huge range of emotions to play and he was equally convincing in each. A tousled haircut can really make a man!<br /><br />3. Interesting aliens! No little white plastic-looking men as is often the norm. This time they can telepathically transport themselves over distances. The Mother ship in Los Angeles is truly eye-popping in design--kind of a Sanford and Sons grunge.<br /><br />4. There is one other woman, but she merely serves as a woman who can remain cool under pressure. Bridget Moynahan from [[ASIN:B003UD7JC6 Blue Bloods: The First Season]], thankfully, is not thrown in as a love interest!<br /><br />Perhaps some trouble areas of the film:<br /><br />1. Camera angles are often kept low to prevent the audience from seeing what is beyond the scene. Filming of a setting that is shot in Shreveport, population 200,000+ and not Los Angeles, what? a million?, must be manipulated carefully so the viewer thinks it IS Los Angeles. However, not even low angles can hide a dozen tall buildings in early and late scenes that pass as the skyline of Los Angeles. I am not complaining! Another scene passes as training ground and looks like sand hills or dunes. Actually, those are probably part of construction sites where dump trucks drive in, collect dirt, then take it to its destination. There are a number of those outside the city limits.<br /><br />2. Shaky filming in places: a clever way of preventing the viewer from seeing too much of what is beyond a scene.<br /><br />3. Helicopters flying in exactly the same formation, tilt and all, early and late. Not believable!<br /><br />4. In the final battle scene the use of the laser machine to focus on the mother ship so that a skud (or some rocket) can hit it made me laugh. There was a cord coming from that machine. Just where did Staff Sargeant plug that cord to produce a laser? The scene was among the ruins of sections of exploded elevations of interstate highways. Oh? The battery?<br /><br />5. All the heroes going right back into battle. Yes, they may be running on adrenaline, but when they come down, how dependable will they be? That was admirable, but not very efficient.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the film, particularly knowing the revenue it brings my hometown, site of the shoot. Well I remember the day the interstate was closed down so that the battle could be filmed. Ka-boom! Smoke! Pow! A fun day--and I'm sure that few minded that the interstate was closed. All kinds of thoughtful detours had been set up. It was also fun recognizing particular landmarks or neighborhoods in the film. I hope some locals had the chance to use their acting chops as well!ining! Another scene passes as training ground and looks like sand hills or dunes.

B0034G4P8U|5.0|Unlike the second movie, Dark of the Moon was actually well written and the loss of Megan Fox actually serves to improve the acting significantly, though the same sex-driven scenes are shared with a new beauty. Tied in with the NASA moon mission of the late '60s, the movie picks up with the Decepticons attempting to secure technology that will bring their home planet to Earth, allowing them to use our planet's resources to repair theirs. The special effects were top-notch and the destruction of Chicago was amazing to watch as the city was cordoned off by the Decepticons. The battle scene in Chicago's city limits to close the movie was fantastic and my boys (ages 11 and 8) were entranced throughout. Pure eye candy and definately a blu-ray purchase when released. Heck of a movie and already looking forward to seeing again.
0062060554|5.0|This debut novel by S.J. Watson is a captivating thriller that I could not put down!  I had to know what was going to happen to the main character Christine who was suffering from amnesia.  She was totally dependent on her husband Ben and didn't have any other friends or relatives to look out for her.  For a first time author this is an incredible debut!  I loved the ending but my heart was sure pounding during the journey to get there!<br /><br />Highly recommend this exciting thriller!
B00004X10B|5.0|This Tamrac bag is big, heavy, and holds an incredible amount of gear. I use it to carry an Olympus E600 and a Panasonic Lumix G2 with 12 extra lenses. (For both the E600 and the G2 - using Fotodiox adapters on OM lenses to the M4/3 Lumix mount) Lenses range from OM 200mm down to 28mm, and I still have space to spare. As you can see, it also has compartments for flash cards, extra batteries, manuals, and battery chargers with their cables. I haven't found a place to toss in the kitchen sink, but everything else fits without having to crunch it all together. The design of the bag, with the ability to customize the dividers, makes it easy to get to what I need very quickly. Fully loaded, it is heavy, heck, even empty it's heavy. Seems the Tamrac people followed the old farmer's saying \\"When in doubt, make it stout.\\" I don't think the Tamrac folks had any doubts about the design of the bag, but it is very well built, and strong. Since I've bought the bag, I've done some traveling with it, and I have no concerns about the safety of the equipment inside it - it will arrive at the destination safe and sound, and this is worth it's weight in gold.    Another reviewer mentioned using a water repellent spray on the outside of the bag, this is very good advice. I travel to tropical rain forests, and they are called 'rain' forests for a good reason. My bag has gotten rained on, (like tropical deluge type rain...) and with the spray everything remained dry and in good condition. I use Kiwi Camp Dry, [[ASIN:B000HJ7CLY Kiwi Camp Dry, Heavy Duty Water Repellent, 12oz]] you get get it on Amazon.     Again, this is a BIG, well-build camera bag. (though you can use it for other things if you want) I have a Tenba [[ASIN:B000HAAI0K Tenba 632-301 Shootout Small Backpack (Olive/Black)]] that I use with a Pentax system, and I hold it in high regard also. However, it does not hold all the gear that the Tamrac can.

B00006CXSS|4.0|One of the finest war series that I have seen.  Apart from the story and the very fine acting,the comments by the actual veterans were most interesting as well as the story of the making of the film. It is incredible how the effects were achieved.  I enjoyed  Ron Livingston's diaries, I just wish that the introductions before each section had been omitted after the first one. I think that the same could have been done before each part of the series to make it more like a movie for the viewer.  These are small complaints though. It is still a very fine production. I enjoyed it!

0307454541|4.0|'The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo' is Larsson's skillfully drawn mystery novel containing some interesting characters of which Lisbeth Solander is the most fascinating, albeit improbable, character.  I do have problems with the story, though.  In my opinion, Larsson spends too much time and too many words in getting down to the nitty-gritty of the mystery, itself.  True, he is developing the primary characters, Blomkvist and Solander, and laying the groundwork and justification for the subsequent investigation.  He just spends too much time doing so.<br /><br />When he finally gets down to the investigation, the novel becomes a fascinating page-turner.  It builds to a creshendo but, rather than ending on a high note, he lets us down.  This may because he was trying to build a little reality into a series of extreme improbabilities or, more likely, because he was trying to create openings and build a little intrigue for his sequel.  This is understandable but I believe that it is indeed possible to end things with a bang but still create reasonable possibilities for a sequel.  I find it unfortunate because Larsson was a gifted wordsmith.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Awesome show, takes a different direction than the TV series.  American Eva pilot is awesome, and Asuka is just as irritating as usual.  I will wait for Eva 3.xx and 4.xx patiently.
1401310672|4.0|This book has literal laugh-out-loud moments.. many of them. Some of the texts are lame/not very funny, but a lot are chuckle worthy and many are downright hilarious!  It's a great book for what it is - conversation starter, bathroom/coffee table book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Fantastic, Unbelievable, suspensful, nerve wracking. This is a fantastic book!! Ransom Riggs is a fantastic author and I hope he writes more books because I will snatch them the day they come out. There are pictures all throghout the book and it makes the experience even more delightful. I was reading Ransom Rigg's website and he said that he was at a flee market and found some of these photos and so after a while he wrote a story line around them and included the pictures into the story. I recommend buying this book in the real form, not the kindle version just because you can enjoy the photos better.
B004WOJ7ZE|4.0|\\"From chaos to eternity\\" is the brand new 8th studio album by the symphonic/neoclassical metal band \\"Rhapsody of Fire\\". This review will be naturally looking at the musical aspects of the album while placing emphasis on the features of the limited-edition of the album. \\"From chaos to eternity\\" is the 4th and final chapter of the musical \\"Dark secret saga\\" which debuted in 2004.<br /><br />\\"From Chaos to eternity\\" finds guitarist Luca Turilli, keyboardist Alex Staropoli, lead singer Fabio Lione, bassist Patrice Guers and drummer Alex Holzwarth joined by new guitarist Tom Hess. Musically the album is a natural continuation of its predecessor \\"The Frozen Tears of angels\\"; you can expect ambitious orchestral arrangements, extra-technical yet melodic guitars, extensive instrumental leads, speeding tempos and impeccable vocals, all deriving from a group of undisputed professionals. Once again the album benefits by state of the art production by Sascha Paeth.<br /><br />Taking a closer look at the compositions, it seems that the progressive elements within the songs have been smoothened, inducing subtle transitions from one tempo to the next and from riff to riff. In addition the album features three songs sung in Italian (in contrast to its predecessor that featured only one). In particular the album includes seven songs plus the 19-minute epic \\"Heroes of the waterfall's kingdom\\" divided in five parts.<br /><br />The limited edition comes in a hard book-like cover with an extensive booklet including a guitar lesson by Turilli for the song \\"Tornado\\", retrospective liner notes regarding the \\"Dark secret saga\\" by both Alex and Luca. Finally there is a single extra track, a cover version \\"Flash of the blade\\" by Bruce Dickinson. Overall the musical aspect of this release indeed matches the high standards of the pioneer Italian band; still it has to be addressed that this pricey limited edition should include more features (perhaps a couple more bonus songs or video clips).

B003EYVXUU|5.0|Im not going to bore anyone with a massive review. If you like vampire flicks THIS IS THE BEST.. well some might argue the Swedish version is better. I love both but I think Let Me In did so many more things right. Chloe and Kodi are magical! This is a movie thatll be with you for a while.     The slipcover did come a little damage though. My only complaint
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Having seen \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" when it first aired on television, I enjoyed the music and the sets were great. But it wasn't the book. After seeing Burton's version of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", I realized he actually understands the book. This version is very close to Dahl's. The big change is in how Willy Wonka is presented. Willy Wonka in the book does really strange things (they become stranger in \\"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator\\") with seemingly no motivation, but Burton softened him by giving him an unbending father that sort of explains his actions. Johnny Depp captured Wonka's eccentricities perfectly. Freddie Highmore as Charlie was very good.    I love how the music incorporated the poems Dahl wrote for each of the \\"naughty\\" children, and the dark tone of the music itself. The movie opening credits was fantastic. Although the special effects were fantastic, they never overwhelmed the story, but gave it more of that fairytale feel. The Oompa-Loompas were funny and a little scary at times. Burton got it that Dahl's books can be dark and frightening because children are thrown into some truly horrific and surrealistic situations, but in the end the kids always adapt and triumph.    The Two-Disc Deluxe Edition is wonderful with really good Special Features. I absolutely loved the featurette on Roald Dahl's life that had footage of him, his books and his family. I also have a great appreciation of Deep Roy who played all of the Oompa-Loompas after seeing what he had to do!    Another really good movie adaptation of a Dahl book is Danny DeVito's \\"Matilda\\" [[ASIN:B0000VCZKW Matilda (Special Edition)]]    This is my favorite movie adaptation of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\".
0670022411|5.0|A Discovery of Witches combines the darkness of the early Vampire Chronicles and the spellbinding storytelling of Anne Rice's witch stories with the mystery, pace and suspense of The Da Vinci Code while throwing in a measure of magical mysticism from JK Rowling. With the foreshadowing of inter-species warfare and unholy alliances, there's a bit of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight mixed in too. All this and it's grounded in a fascinating historical context and set against stunningly alive places. The characters will pull you in as the novel weaves its spell and keep you in its grip from the first chapter to long after you read the last page; it will leave you yearning for the immediate satisfaction of book two and book three.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|WOW I'm really impress with this album. This album shows that Selena Gomez wants to be treated as a real singer. Now that Selena Gomez is mature, the album sounds are very different from her previous album, lyrics, and every song has their unique sounds. It's rare that I like all the songs in one album but this one every song is fantastic. My favorite track has to be 'We Own The Night' (Feat. Pixie Lott) plus I'm also a fan of Pixie Lott ([[ASIN:B00436GNSU Turn It Up (Louder)]]). The CD booklet is great because it has pictures from different decades. I don't know why people make a big deal about the \\"cuss word\\" she only says the D-word in 'Hit the Lights' which the majority of people don't called it as a real profanity word. Also the lyrics are a little more mature which mean this album was meant for her grown up fans which is a good thing because her audience is broadening. Every star grows up just look at Hilary Duff ([[ASIN:B000MV9OHW Dignity]]) and Raven-Symone ([[ASIN:B0014567XO Raven-Symoné]]) and they were from Disney Channel too. Anyways this album I really recommend. I bought mine at Target because it had 4 bonus exclusive tracks.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|To put it concisely, upon first listen, I immediately dubbed this album the best album of the year and most likely the Foo Fighters best release ever (I'll see what happens when the newness wears off).  Here's the breakdown:  1. Bridge Burning 9/10: Not as instantly addictive as \\"The Pretender,\\" but a solid opener that gratifies more and more on repeated listens.  There seems to be a Cream influence in the vocals on the chorus.  2. Rope 9/10: The first single, another great, solid song, but it gets a point off for using the riff to King Missile's \\"Detachable P*nis\\" (or something very similar), which seems entirely unsuitable.  3. Dear Rosemary 10/10: This was the perfect song for Bob Mould's guest vocals.  I love it, but I'm biased because I also like Bob Mould.  4. White Limo 7/10: In the vein of \\"Podunk,\\" the B-side from the first album, this song rocks, but I'm not a fan of the scratchy vocals.  5. Arlandria 10/10: Easily one of the most instantly addictive Foo Fighters songs ever, its catchiness may be its only downfall on repeated listens.  6. These Days 7/10: The verses are a little too slow for me, but it's a good song with substance.  7. Back & Forth 5/10: This is the weak spot on the album.  It just sounds juvenile.  They're better than this.  8. A Matter of Time 9/10: It sounds new, but familiar at the same time, in keeping with the tradition of explosive choruses.  I can't figure out what it's about, but the lyrics seem like they're hinting at a big concept.  9. Miss the Misery 10/10: This one starts off heavy, then gets some great backing vocals, just has an atypical flow to it that I really like.  I think this is the one with the most potential to grow on me.  10. I Should Have Known 8/10: I'm giving this a high mark for being artistic and powerful, but honestly, it's not that much fun to listen to compared to other songs on the album.  11. Walk 10+/10: An outstanding closer, probably my favorite song on the album, quite substantive and powerful in lyrics and progression, and I love the video for it.    So, in my opinion, if you only buy one album this year, get this one.  Also, buy the actual CD so you get a piece of the master tape (not sure how they did that).
B0050CQY1W|4.0|When I heard Beyonce's first single \\"Run The World (Girls)\\" I had the feeling that her album would not be great. I feared \\"4\\" would be a mixture of pop and dance tunes with lyrics about girl power, material things, and triflin men which are the common themes to Beyonce's songs. So imagined my surprise when a friend played her album to me two days after its released and I realized for the first time....Beyonce is a woman. I even purchased the album the very same day at a cetain store because that store is the only store in the US that offers the deluxe version.    The highlights of the album (for me) are:    * I Care- Beyonce's vocals are sheer power on this song and I love the lines 'Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry. And now everytime our love goes sour,  you won't sympathize. You see these tears falling down to my ears. I swear you like when I'm in pain.I try to tell you all my fears. You still don't care? That's okay'    *I Miss You- Beyonce begins this song softly and then as the song goes along, her voice gets bigger and more desperate. The lyrics are so longing and the production has that Sade vide.    *Party (with Andre 3000)-this took me back to the 90s and reminded me of my days hanging out at the mall in the ATL with my friends. When Andre raps 'Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old. Never thought that we could become someone else's hero.Man, we were just in the food court, eating our gyros'. I get a little emotional because it shows how time flies.    *I Rather Die Young- is my favorite ballad off this album because it sums up how passionate and powerful love can be. Even though Bey tends to oversing the chorus a bit, you can feel the emotions especially when she sings \\"You're the first one ever seen that burns like gasoline. So light a match, turn off the lights.  I'm holding on to you `cause this might be our last night\\".    *Love On Top- Beyonce is singing her tail off and the music has an old school vibe. She is givingme some Patti L., some Michael J., and some Teena M. This song actually took me back to the early 80s and will shut down anyone who says Bey can't sing.    *Countdown- I love that she included a Boys II Men's classic into her song and I love how she used it--very creative. Bey is also giving us some of that urban vibe she is known for.    *Till The End of Time- rumored to be the 3rd single is great and unique. I love the drum beats and African vibe she shows on this song. Lots of energy and soul--this song will get you moving.    *I Was Here- I can't say enough about this song. I think this song will become the theme to Bey's career just like \\"What's Love Got To Do With It\\" is the theme to Tina Turner's career. Bey sings this song like she means every word of it.    The other songs are great, but the above songs stand out for me. I hope this album represents a turning point in Bey's career. What I mean is I hope she continues to grow and evolve. This album probably won't be as successful as her previous albums because its less pop and more substance, but I hope it doesn't discourage Bey. This is her 'grown up' album and its time for her to continue on her grown and sexy path.    Deluxe Version:   *Schoolin Life- is a great song with a Prince vibe but the line 'Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life' might make some people sit up.   *Dance For You- is one of those sexy grooves you heard back in the 90s. I think the line 'A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what' sums up the song perfectly.  *Lay Up Under Me- is probably the weakest of the three bonus songs. Its a happy song that will make you dance especially the chorus when she sings 'You ain't gotta worry bout a club, Just come and lay up under me tonight\\"!  *Dreaming- is not available in the US but its another great song. Its more pop than her other songs, but the best line is 'I never wished on a star when a star ain't got nothing on me'.
0887307280|4.0|It is a well written good read. The basic thesis of the book is that if you own a business, one must run the business, and not just be a specialist in the product produced. It does made sense. The author is process oriented to the extreme. Concepts such as continuous improvement and employee decision involvement are not high on the author's list. And of course, his way is the only way. Granted that conceit, there is good learning in the book and worth the read.
0399242600|5.0|nothing beats this book - it's BIG - it's durable - it's sweet - it's AWESOME for a bedtime story...having it in the board book form is a treasure
6304806418|5.0|I've watched countless times, and am invariably drawn to the characters as though for the first time. Madonna is superb and perfectly cast and Antonio Banderas is equally compelling as the character of Che.  Surprisingly, Jonathan Price is amazingly attractive as Peron.    I saw the original Broadway production and was intrigued by the persona of Evita, but I never expected to be so moved by the film version.
0399215980|4.0|this book is SMALLER than i was expecting but my son adores the little mouse asking to be everybody's friend...very cute...(hopefully teaching him about rejection - either that or it's just bumming him out)
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I don't think this can be properly appreciated without knowing how it ends. Personally, I left the theater disappointed after my first viewing - like I'd been the butt of an enormous joke, with QuentinTarantino taking full advantage of the kind of notoriety and clout he'd accumulated over the years to cash in on an intentional stink bomb. Now, a few years removed from the experience, I've given it another shot and left with an entirely different look on my face. It's a magnificent film, dedicated to building up one impossible situation after the next; two full hours dedicated to stacking the dynamite. The implication, of course, is that he'll find a way to write himself out of it - and I suppose he does, just not in a way that anyone could have expected. It's an impervious blend of Tarantino's notoriously sharp-witted dialog, his ADD-influenced lack of focus on any particular storyline for more than twenty minutes, and a deep yearning to lead his audience into a false sense of security before dumping cold water over their heads. Brad Pitt has the time of his life as the braggish, stereotypical war movie lead with an awful accent, but Christoph Waltz steals the show as a giddy turncoat Nazi sleuth. Basterds is a stroke of brilliance, weaving three distinctly different movies into one spectacular cinematic quilt. Where my initial impressions of the \\"did they just do that\\" climax were of shock and disdain, time and honest thought have transformed it into one of my favorite scenes. Ballsy, bright and bombastic, it deserves a spot alongside the director's classics.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|This product works really well.  The tripod is pretty crappy but you aren't buying this for the tripod, you are buying this because it will fit your fat phone in a case.      For me that is the iPhone 4 with a Speck case.  Most of the iPhone holders wont hold the iPhone with a case, which is a waste because everyone has a case on their phone.  The iPhone 4 with the case fits very, very snugly.  As in 1-2mm thicker and it probably wouldn't fit.  This works pretty well as it creates a very tight and secure fit.      It only really goes in one way, and that is with the home button to the left.  Other wise the volume buttons get pressed and that craps everything up.    The tripod and ball head it comes with are not really that awesome but it is mostly the tripod's fault.  The legs on the tripod don't open up enough to make it super stable.  It wont fall over on a table made of stone, but if it gets bumped it will topple over.  If you are a bit crafty you can unscrew the phillips head screw on between the legs and add a washer between where leg bracket and the ball mount.  This will allow the legs to sit down a bit more allowing them to open up a bit more making the tripod a little more stable.    Even know it helps the legs spread out more, you wont be able to orient like they show in the photo with the iPhone on the side.  The iPhone is to heavy and it will just tip over.      This unit also helps as a stabilizer.  Just holding the legs in the closed position make it more stable to move about.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Gorgeous cinematic storytelling without narration in the same vein as \\"Chronos\\" and the \\"Qatsi\\" trilogy. It's a broad look at our planet with an emphasis on the human impact, for all the good and bad that entails. \\"Baraka\\" centers itself on a series of stunningly beautiful looks at nearly every important modern issue, from religion to culture to naturalism to warfare, with a magnificent eye for composition and a light-handed touch that allows the lessons being taught to be the viewer's own. A perfectly downplayed soundtrack, mixing ambient noise from each setting with a wide range of genres and moods, further envelopes us into the scenario without standing in front of the picture. Breathtaking work that literally left my jaw open more than once, and a genuine revelation on Blu-Ray - this is the disc you really need to show off your home theater system.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|The original Karate Kid had heart, it was even realistic, it had quality actors, compelling drama and interesting bad guys. It had everything this film lacks. Jaden Smith never should have gotten this part. He really is a terrible actor. And the quick shot ridiculous impossible fighting scenes only add to the plastic flavor throughout this film. I had heard good things about this film so maybe my expectations were raised too much, but I never expected it to be this bad.     Jaden Smith, use your money to get an education, do something else. Acting is not for you. At least not yet. This is one of the all-time worst performances in a fairly big film I have ever seen. They should have cast someone a few years older who could actually do something called 'act'. Not just be the son of Will and Jada.
1441869980|5.0|Hounded was great fun to read and listen to.  I am so happy that Kevin Hearne has a successful new series.  I live in the area where the story takes place and enjoyed reading about all of the locations that I know so well.  His charactors are unusal and a little out there.  Like other authors I enjoy, Kevin Hearne will not be able to write fast enough to keep his readers happy.  I pre ordered his next two books Hexed and Hammered from Amazon so I could get them as soon as they are released.
0307716511|1.0|I'm no longer taking Amazon's recommendations for suspense novels.  I was recently disappointed by A Discovery of Witches, and now Sister is getting a big push. Two more boring \\"thrillers\\" are hard to imagine.  Sister follows snobby, racist Beatrice as she investigates the disappearance and possible murder of her free-spirited sister Tess.  Actually, Beatrice has already solved the crime, and is telling the story to a policeman in a series of sessions - which is as annoying a narrative structure as I have ever encountered.  The structure only reinforces the repetitiveness of the narrative, and spends far, far too much time detailing Beatrice's coming and goings (She's in transition. Get it? GET IT? DO YOU GET IT YET? WELL, IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE, ANYWAY.).  Sister is unusual in that it deals seriously with the depth of Beatrice's grief, a subject that is glossed over in many otherwise similar novels.  The thing is, it's glossed over for a reason - it's dead boring, and endlessly repetitive.  As another reviewer noted, Beatrice's reliability is slightly called into question as certain aspects of the story ring false, but I personally feel that the flaws are in Lupton's writing and are not intentional.  Finally, I don't want to head into spoiler territory, but given the ending of the novel... the herrings are too red, and the reveal is a terrible \\"Had I But Known\\" cliche.

0451197879|1.0|I'm pretty used to a slow start in a Stephen King novel, but you've got to be kidding me Stephen! It felt like I was reading a nursery rhyme. It was sooooooo boring. THrough the whole book you just keep waiting for something to happen. You think that something is bound to happen in the next ten pages... or the next.... or the next.... and then you reach the back cover and.... nothing. You are disappointed and I think this is the real reason Bachman \\"died\\".

0451197968|5.0|I am a dedicated S.K. reader, and i have read probably 25 or so of his countless books. I have to say that the books by \\"Richard Bachman\\" may be his best works. 'The Running Man' is very gripping, and i read it on a plane ride from NY to AZ. I started at takeoff and finished during the descent- and I have to say that it was one of the few S.K. books that I was sad to have end. It was well thought out, and it made me want to kneel down before the good lord and pray that this isn't what the future holds.           All in all, if you just starting to read Stephen King, this is the one to start out with. It's not as far-fetched as some of his other books, and it will make you want to read more and more.          Buy it. Read it. You won't regret it.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|I reallly like this CD. The songs are great blues tunes that for the most part haven't been listened to very often (now days) or been released by other artist (untill now). Great Memphis blues musicians like BB King, Charlie Musslewhite just to name a couple grace several songs. I think that Cindy performs outstanding vocals on all of the songs. However; in my opinion, there are a few songs that the vocals seem kind of forced and are not as smooth and free flowing as a blues song is. The CD jacket and liner notes are gerat. But, I kind of wonder why such an attractive lady as Cindy would take such dark pictures for this CD jacket (my only guess that the show must go on). Don't get me wrong: YOU SHOULD BUY IT . Thank you Cindy for doing a blues CD and opening up the blues to a new audience. After all, Blues Music is Americas Music and our gift to the world.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Wow, what great series!!  This works on so many levels. First, lets talk about the plot of this awesome series.<br /><br />It seems that there were 5 friends: Spencer, Aria, Emily, Hannah and Allison. Allison was the leader of the group, and could make you popular just being with her. The one day, Allison has vanished and the world comes crumbling around the four other friends. They drift apart without their leader. Then when a body is found, the four friends (and the rest of the town) finds out that it's Allison, and hold a funeral for her. That's when things start to happen. The Pretty Little Liars are soon stalked by someone calling themselves \\"A. A is sending text messages to the pretty little liars, letting them know that their life is about to chance, One of the text messages reads, \\"I'm still here bitches, and I know everything. - A.\\"  A knows all of their dirty little secrets and is ready to spill them all, unless A doesn't get her way. The pretty little liars all have secrets they want to keep in their closet, but A has other plans.<br /><br />This is such a fantastic series, it works on so many levels.  Lets start with the theme song. It's perfect.  The eerie thing is that the song is called, \\"Secrets\\", and the song fits the show. However, the song was written before Pretty Little Liars came out, you would honestly think that the song was written for the show. Excellent.  A second aspect that makes the show such a hit is the many plot twists and turns. Folks, there's a lot of them to keep you hooked from week to week. In some ways, each episode ends in a mini cliff hanger. Something to make sure that you'll tune in week after week.<br /><br />A third draw to the show is that characters are so fantastic. Pretty Little Liars has a fantastic cast. Here's who we have:<br /><br />Spencer: She's the perfect child, and her parents expect the best from her. Not just the best, but she has to be perfect in everything that she does. Perfect classes to make a perfect resume for college. Perfect grade, and perfect activities after school.  Everything to make it look like that Spencer has the perfect life. However, Spencer has some secrets that she wants to keep in her past. The problem is that A wants to expose all of them, when the time is right.<br /><br />Emily: Emily has to come with terms of who and what she is. She knows that not everybody will be willing to accept her for who and what she is. She know her parents won't, and she has to deal with that.  She's also a star on the swim team, but not everyone is thrilled with her, and some feel that she's in the way. A will have no problem pushing the right buttons to let secrets out.<br /><br />Hanna: Hanna has been through a lot in her life. Her parents are divorced, and her mom really doesn't have to much time for her.  She also has to deal with the divorce of her parents. She was a fat as a pre teen and early teen. Then she met Allison, and her life changed. Hanna has climbed the social latter. She's lost the weight and become the queen of the school. Not to worry, A is there to knock her back down.<br /><br />Aria: Aria has a lot of secrets to hide, and A knows them all. Aria has a new boyfriend (can't say who here, I don't want to spoil it) and she has to keep it as quiet as she can.  This is one secret that can't get out.  Aria also has to deal with something that she found out about her dad, something that will change all of their lives.  The problem is that when Aria found out the secret about her father, Allison was there, so she knew it too. Aria has a lot to lose, and A will be sure that she does lose it, everything.<br /><br />There are several other characters in the series, and all of them add to the fantastic cast.<br /><br />Now if you're like me, and you've read and loved the series, then this show will still work for you and keep you glued to the series. See, the plot of the TV show is the same as the books, it has the same feeling and plot. However, the series has many plot lines that the book didn't have. In that aspect, it's fresh and new.  I have no idea who A is in the series, and I can't wait to find out.<br /><br />Stephen King said \\"A good book doesn't give up all of it's secrets all at once.\\"  That's exactly  how I feel about this series.  That goes for the book series and TV series.  You won't find out all the secrets at once, and you don't want to. This is a fun ride, and I can't wait to see how it plays out. If you start this series, I can promise you won't be sorry.esh and new.  I have no idea who A is in the series, and I can't wait to find out.    Stephen King said \\"A good book doesn't give up all of it's secrets all at once.\\"  That's exactly  how I feel about this series.  That goes for the book series and TV series.  You won't find out all the secrets at once, and you don't want to. This is a fun ride, and I can't wait to see how it plays out. If you start this series, I can promise you won't be sorry.

People complain about the audience participation chorus (or \\"children's chorus\\" as dubbed by some radio DJs) that is incorporated into some of the songs --but I actually enjoy it. For me, it bridges the gap between you, the band, and the music coming out of your speakers. It seems Epic at times as with the short intro song \\"Escape.\\" The music and voices rise in unison telling you THIS IS WAR.. It's cheezy, but that actually gave me chill bumps the first time I heard it (playing it at a decent volume through great speakers at night doesn't hurt either).<br /><br />I won't go on and on about the popular songs which are also amazing and have plenty of reviews already.. but I do want to mention Stranger In a Strange Land. It's not your typical rock song, more of a techno/rave/electric mix that puts you in a wonderful zone. I like driving through the city at night listening to it. My husband actually asked me who it was by since it didn't sound like typical 30STM.<br /><br />About the cover/version - I actually have the deluxe version of the cd that also comes with the dvd and some nice bonus tracks: [[ASIN:B0043RGY60 This Is War [Deluxe Edition]]] So my cd cover is white with black WAR lettering. There are also other colors available for the deluxe version. The tiger cover cd is JUST the cd, no dvd. I was confused at first when looking the item up on amazon to buy.<br /><br />Also, this cd is sound-mixed wonderfully! It doesn't sound hollow or lacking as with some cds. The volume levels and depth of sound enhance the overall feel of the music/lyrics. I would recommend buying the actual cd versus the mp3 album because I think cds sound better --something you definitely want to take advantage of in this case. Hope it helps..
0618871713|2.0|The book was disappointing.  It lacked all sense of wonder and discovery because Bechdel tells us her father was gay early on and once acknowledged, it's hard to believe there was ever a time when she didn't know.  Her explorations into lesban life are equally flat-- much like her ongoing saga of \\"Dykes to Watch Out For\\" in which lesbianism seems (at best) an immature emersion into masturabation and oral sex between women.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Once again Mr. Rollins has out done himself! By far this is his best book yet. It makes me wonder if he can continue to push the envolope further and in any way surpass his stellar efforts he achieved in this awesome book. If I have any complaint with his books is that it is hard to think about all the facts and details and try to figure it all between the non stop action and high anxiety of situations he throws his characters into. Awesome, fantastic, incredible!! Thank You for all your hard work, it was well worth it.  By far My FAVORITE AUTHOR!!!!
B002DQLGHU|5.0|To paraphrase Jackson Pearce, you'd have to be living under a sorcerer's stone if you were not aware that the last Harry Potter movie is due out this summer.  Very soon in fact!  So with that in mind, I decided to make my way through the books and the movies to prepare myself for this final big event - the last movie and our farewell to Harry and his friends.<br /><br />When these books first came out I had no interest in them. None.  My siblings were all in an uproar (my sister was also 11, so she's grown up with Harry) but I dismissed the books as fanciful nothings, young adult fiction, psh when would I ever want to read that?  I mean, at that time I was caught up in the fantastic world of romance novels. (Yes, that was sarcastic and true at the same time!)<br /><br />But then, around the release of the fourth book, I decided to pick up the series and see what all the fuss was about.  Since that first reading of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I've read the book four times (one of those times out loud to my niece and nephew), and every time the book just gets better and better, and I think a large part of that is due to the movies.<br /><br />Now, I'll first say that yes, a lot of the original books didn't make it into the movies, specifically for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I missed Peeves, the potions Hermione has to get through to help Harry stop Quirrell, the introduction of Malfoy in the train (and not on the steps) and little details here and there (such as explaining to Harry where the pictures came from in the book Hagrid gives him at the end).  But overall, I think the movie did a fantastic job of bringing to life the wonder, excitement and awe I felt while reading the book.  I loved the portrayal of Quidditch and the main dining hall at Hogwarts, and I still catch my breath at that first sweeping view of the school.<br /><br />In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the weakest of the books, in terms of development - but it also captures the innocence of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and grabs the reader by the hand and gently introduces them into the world of Hogwarts, allowing time for us to catch our breath and relax into it all.  That's the best way to introduce children to the world of fantasy and Rowling did a marvelous job.<br /><br />I'd be remiss if I didn't mention, in closing at least, how much I've also come to appreciate Dudley, and the Dursley's.  They add comedy to the stories, but also that necessary anchor to the \\"muggle\\" world - the other side of what might have been had Harry's mother not been magical.<br /><br />Feel free to join me in the next several days as I read, watch and review these books and movies.  You do not need to read or watch every one, or do both, or.. well, do whatever you wish and chime in with your thoughts, your hopes for the upcoming movies and how you plan to fill the void after the last movie has been watched.of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and grabs the reader by the hand and gently introduces them into the world of Hogwarts, allowing time for us to catch our breath and relax into it all.

But, the second half loses all its steam; I felt like there was no story after their marriage started falling apart...you're kind of waiting for it to end at that point.  Furthermore, Omar Sharif was not particularly well-casted in my opinion.
B0057AOOZ0|5.0|OMG, OMG! This is the best Beyonce album yet! I love the different sound she has on this one. It makes me think that her travels all over the world during her break was the inspiration for this one. I think that this sounds completely different from her past works. This album really displays how talented she is and how much control she has over her voice. I love listening to her range vary from smooth and low to perfect pitched high. This album is so awesome I can listen to it from track 1 to track 12 uninterrupted. I brought the version with extra tracks and I am so glad she included those songs. I'm not sure why some critics are giving this album a low rating maybe they been sipping on haterade juice too long. Dont let the haters make you miss out on a fantastic album. This is a MUST BUY!! BUY IT NOW!

B004UQPM4E|5.0|Superb. Comprehensive. All any fan will ever need.     Extras are fabulous. Multiple documentaries and commentaries with plenty of terrific, fascinating retrospective info that digs deep into what a monumental achievement getting the original 1978 \\"Superman\\" to screen was, followed by the bizarre downward slide of the series.     And, once and for all, we get the lowdown on how Director Richard Donner and the Producers parted company in such poisonous fashion. Amazing considering they'd just released one of the most popular movies of all time, the progenitor and benchmark for all superhero films to follow.    The mostly diabolical \\"Superman IV\\" looks nice and crisp on Blu. The commentary by writer Mark Rosenthal dishes on the troubled production - you can tell he's struggling to be gracious. And his bitterness manifests in amusing ways like his utter contempt for poor Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (or more specifically his haircut..) wow, did Pillow beat up Rosenthal for his lunch money or something?    As dreadful as the fourth movie is,  'Superman III' comes off as the most misbegotten of the series. Trashing the spirit and integrity of the character for cheap, flat slapstick humour - humour that had began to seep into Lester's 'Superman II' sequences.     What the Hell was Superman ever doing playing second banana to Richard Pryor? Worst of all, he and the movie simply aren't funny. Apart from the ever reliable Reeve, virtually EVERYTHING that made I & II so memorable is missing.    Ironically, Bryan Singer was so reverential to the Donner original, it became a millstone round his neck that makes 'Superman Returns' a suprisingly dull retread. And it really doesn't pop on Blu-ray like it should.    Here's hoping new director Zack Snyder can make Superman fly high again. The Man of Steel deserves it.

0762434279|5.0|Every day, people are told \\"study hard, get good grades, and find a secure job.\\"  The reality is that most people who find good jobs and work for 30 years have nothing to show for it or cannot retire.  In his book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki argues that students do not receive an adequate education in school and are unprepared for the real world.  Sure, many students study hard, but they leave school without learning basic financial skills that will help them in real life.  He believes that most students and adults are not financially literate and do not understand even basic financial ideas.    Mr. Kiyosaki tells a familiar story.  He believes that people always say \\"if only I had a raise, a better job, or made more money, everything would be great-- I would be rich.\\"  However, Mr. Kiyosaki points out that usually, the more money people make, the more they spend.  If you get a raise or a better job, usually a person will buy a bigger house or a new car.  The more money they make, the more debt they will have.  Instead, he argues, that your wage does not make you rich or poor.  Rather, what you do with your money every month is what makes you rich or poor.  Some people have only one job but understand how to invest and save--they are the people who become rich and are not dependent on anyone.  However, other people have three or four jobs or have a high wage but continue to buy bigger and more expensive things each month.  Although they make a lot of money, they are poor and are dependent on their job.  If they lose their job, they lose everything.    Mr. Kiyosaki argues that this is not because people are stupid but because they have never learned basic financial and accounting skills.  Without these skills and knowledge, people cannot make good money decisions.  They do not understand how to budget their money, save, or invest in something that will make more money.  Instead, most people buy things that cost them more money each month.    To fix this problem, Mr. Kiyosaki argues that children need to be taught basic finance and accounting and home and at school.  He believes that you should study hard, work hard, study finance, and invest.

0316017930|1.0|While this may be a \\"fascinating\\" read for some, Gladwell's \\"ideas\\" aren't new, just new to a few now... in many ways, just  more \\"pop\\" culture spit.   While many of Gladwell's assertions have outlier insight, (but most are straw men) they are not the definitive truth.  While no one makes it alone and while those in power can prevent anyone from achieving in  a particular circumstance, the human will is too powerful to be so underestimated - hence the Asian axiom  that the only door closed to you is one you will not open. That truth does not guarantee that a tiger may  not be behind the door - only that we have the power to open all doors - how we do so and when we do so  make the difference. Sometimes tigers eat men - that's the natural state of the world, not evil.  Evil is man's choice and man's choice only - as is good -  amazing changes and ethical/moral standards have been achieved and have  revolutionized the world because individuals refused to give up and were willing to pay the price.  Live free or die is not a lyric in a silly camp song.  We never think of evil being chased by good - just the opposite as if good is some kind of coward,  and there is always a price to be paid as much for good as for evil - being good can lead to many lonely  nights and can land one in Auschwitz -  so the decision becomes how an individual wants to pay the price, not if - cowering in  a dark corner or on his/her own terms - hence the axiom that is a truth - accept but never surrender!  NEVER SURRENDER - lay low for awhile, enter by the back door, set out meat for the mad dog, but always carry a gun to a gun fight  and when you decide to fight, use all the power you have - sometimes that is direct, but sometimes that is  just like martial arts - re-direct the negative force back to the enemy - return the question with another question -  there are lots of ways to kill the enemy - Gladwell doesn't touch on this - the human will is the most powerful force  on the Earth - Americans have forgotten that - the USA is a Constitutional Republic, not a Democracy, and that  means The People rule - BRING BACK THE GREEKS!  Gladwell not only doesn't address the power of human will, but he neglects to focus on choice and responsibility -  our current culture has tried to eliminate that - but mommy and daddy and big government cannot take  care of everyone's selfish self-centered right to choose, but not pay - THAT DESTROYS ANY NATION because  the whole idea of choice without paying for it is a lie - Gladwell is trying to present absolutes where there are none -  he sells many books that way - BUT BE A CRITICAL THINKER - things that seem so easy and so pat never are -    When everyone else is spending their money, you save yours.  When everyone no longer has money to use, you will have it.  These are the kinds of truths Gladwell conveniently forgets or never knew - pop psychology is dangerous because  it presents \\"answers\\" that are too simply or presents answers where there are none -  Life is not about answers, but about asking the right questions and understanding that only the victim  asks \\"why me?\\" while the wise person asks \\"why not me?\\" and \\"it ain't over until the fat lady sings - until then watch out.\\"      Logic and the fallacies that govern statements should be taught from grade school on - then we wouldn't be so gullible.

0061784788|4.0|James Rollins, Preston/Child and Steve Berry are my favorite thriller writers, with Rollins leading the pack. Both Rollins and Berry screw up their firearms descriptions now and then, but Rollins is much better at getting things right than Berry. It sounds trivial, but a good novel leads to suspension of disbelief and a jarring error brings you out of that suspension.<br /><br />This time, though, Mr. Rollins created a fatal flaw by failing to correctly identify the painter who did the enormous Declaration of Independence painting hanging in Washington DC and featured on the back of the two dollar bill. TRUMBULL painted it, not TURNBULL. This means plot devices such as a riddle containing \\"...turn the bull...\\" are meaningless.<br /><br />I loved the book, although Sigma Force should be renamed Smegma Force since all of the main characters can't stay out of bed with another main character, but overall the series is great. Seichan deserves better than Gray though. Painter needs to dump Lisa for everyone's favorite Eurasian assassin.<br /><br />As a Native American I truly appreciated Mr. Rollins respectful and favorable comments on and use of Native American characters.<br /><br />Love the book, but TRUMBULL not TURNBULL.
0316017930|4.0|In a statistical sample, data points that deviate greatly from the norm are called \\"outliers\\". In Malcolm Gladwell's book, he looks at people who are statistical outliers; those who do things that are out of the ordinary. What is it about some people that makes them truly stand out? Why are some extremely successful when others are not?<br /><br />First and foremost, Gladwell is a story teller. Few people could make so much statistical analysis into a page-turner, but he has succeeded! The individual stories told in the book are fascinating, but the way he weaves them all together into one larger \\"story of success\\" is truly amazing.<br /><br />In the end, readers discover that real success is the result of much more (but definitely not less) than intelligence and ambition. Our cultural legacy (extending back several generations) also plays a large role, as do many seemingly random occurrences that are out of our control, such as one's place and time of birth.<br /><br />The entire book was good, but of particular interest to me were \\"The 10,000 Hour Rule\\" and the section speaking about the parenting method known as \\"concerted cultivation\\". Both of these are especially relevant to my field of music education, as they are among the more controllable factors mentioned in the book that can lead to excellence in music (among many other things).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for all readers. It's one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time, and gave me a lot to think about. If you're looking for a book that will tell you exactly how to become a wildly successful statistical outlier, this is not it, but it will help you see yourself and the world around you differently.

B004289ZW0|3.0|Works, but nothing to rave to my friends about.  Instructions for use minimal.  Mine kind of works when it wants to.  Unless you protect it well, you can rub against something in your flight bag and it will turn itself on when not needed. I've only been using mine a week and now it won't turn off. I have to charge it before every use because it has run its battery dead.  Instructions have no clear method of calling for customer service or returning it.  It appears to work with the IPAD generic map program, and for aviation application I used it with Foreflight and it worked...even though the instructions say don't use it on \\"aeroplanes\\".
B000WQWPKA|3.0|As you would expect BR video quality is quite superb, with excellent detail throughout. However, I was very disappointed to discover that numerous scenes were cut from the movie including an entire subplot. The DVD Directors cut include a subplot of the boy becoming deathly sick. This entire plot was deleted. Also noticed a scene of the Alien craft in the hanger deck, where Jeff Goldblum was given a tour of the inside of the craft when they first arrived at Area 51. This scene was cut as well.    If you already have the DVD Directors cut then keep it as a backup. The BR video / audio quality is superior but the Directors cut version makes the movie seem complete.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|I keep seeing this compared to Goonies & ET. It's got it's similarities but it differs radically, and these differences may mean that it's not a good movie choice for kids. I'll explain below, plus here's the pros and cons of this movie:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. The acting is phenomenal. The kids are just amazing. Each of them was absolutely believable and brought depth to their characters. I could totally relate to several of the kids. The adults were good as well, but they really weren't featured and developed enough to make a huge difference.<br /><br />2. The production value was amazing. What else would you expect from a Speilberg movie! The action sequences were riveting.<br /><br />3. The 1979 setting was very authentic and fun. Since I was around in that time period, it was great to see.<br /><br />4. The relationships between the kids were so well developed, and the main kids individual characters were beautifully written for and developed. This was what made the movie worthwhile.<br /><br />5. As in Goonies and ET, the kids are the heroes in this movie. They're the ones who know the truth and act on it for good. They're pure of heart, resourceful, determined and put themselves at risk to act like heroes.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. This had a horror movie feel. There was plenty of violence, and it was scary. This movie is not for young kids. Those who don't like horror should avoid this movie. Granted most of it wasn't explicitly gory, but there was some blood and plenty of people died violently. There are many moments designed to shock, startle and scare you. Though it's rated PG-13, I'd say it feels closer to an R rating to me.<br /><br />2. If you're looking for a feel good alien like in ET, it's not here. The audience is not given much of a chance to emotionally connect with the alien. It's ugly, scary, violent and mysterious. I don't want to give anything away, but this is not a feel good, cuddle the alien, cute movie similar to ET. You may still enjoy this flick, but go in with the right expectations.<br /><br />3. There are tons of holes in the movie. There are many questions that are never answered, and a couple featured characters that are never fully explained. I don't always mind holes in movie lines if the movie is entertaining, but in this movie it was hard to ignore.<br /><br />4. The story line just wasn't that original. Take a bunch of different movies, put them in a jug and shake them together and you get this movie. I don't always mind a repeated story line if it's entertaining or moving, but this was just okay for me.<br /><br />So I'd say that if you like horror, this movie may be for you, though you may be disappointed with the lack of explicit gore. If you like scifi, this movie may be somewhat satisfying, but it probably won't be in your top 20. If you like coming of age movies, you'll love the story lines around the kids. If you love special effects, there are some good ones here. This movie is definitely not for young kids or for anyone who shouldn't be viewing horror.<br /><br />I'd say this is a video to rent on DVD. Then if you love it, buy it..        3.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead goes above and beyond the standard zombie genre of the blood-thirsty undead feasting on the terrified living.  What we have here is a fascinating insight into the interpersonal relations between a ragtag band of survivors that borders on an anthropological study that would have made Margaret Mead proud.  Yes, The Walking Dead gives us some of the best undead special effects and terror that I have seen since the classic remake of Dawn on the Dead, but the main focus of the series zones in on how the human animal acts and reacts when taken out of his/her comfort zone. Unlikely heroes rise to the occasion alongside standard villains.    My only gripe?  Not enough Lennie James!  I hope Morgan and his son, Duane, turn up in season 2.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|It takes a couple of times to listen to this album until it fully grows on you but from the first time you will realize R.E.M. finally released something living up to their (20-year old) standards. I would put this with 5 of their best albums - along with Murmur, Green, Out of Time, and Automatic. I will go even further and say that if you judge it by consistency, it jumps to third place after Murmur and Out of Time. Every song here is great, I never skip anything, and it flows naturally from beginning to an end. My only complain is that production is a bit too harsh but the material is so good that production can not really ruin anything. Highly recommended.
0767802519|5.0|Jean Reno is absolutely brilliant in his quiet, yet highly dangerous, portrayal of a French hitman who reluctantly takes little Natalie Portman under his wing.  The little girl humanizes the hitman and you find yourself actually rooting for the paid assassin, even more so when oily, reptilian bad guy Gary Oldman pops up.  I can honestly say that before The Professional, I'd never considered a hitman to be the hero, but this movie changes all of that!  Reno has a quiet intensity that makes you pay attention to his every move and nuance.  Action film lovers will not be disappointed: there are plenty of shoot 'em up scenes and blood flying about to keep them happy.
B0000009SM|5.0|It used to really irk me when people cited this one as their favorite Zappa album, because it just seemed more than a little absurd considering how close chronologically, stylistically and performance wise it is to Roxy and Elsewhere, which is MY favorite, easily. That's how ridiculous we sad rotten creatures can be, forever fixating on and magnifying the most inconsequential of our minute differences. Either one is worthy of the crown. And, in fact, there are still other albums that could easily challenge for the throne. For me Zappa's true genius is most expressed in his live performances, and it's Roxy's unusually relaxed pacing that distinguishes it from his other \\"live\\" albums. Though he edited Roxy perhaps just as much as most other albums there are still quite a few unaltered passages of genuine group magic. Chester Thompson set such compelling, soulful beats and Zappa responded so passionately, especially on More Trouble Every Day - my all time favorite Zappa performance and, I think, his most gut wrenching, flesh searing solo. But, though it shares nearly all of the personnel of the Roxy album, and is the last official release to be credited to The Mothers of Invention, One Size Fits All is a different beast, a unique creature in its own right. It's more progressive, more elegant, more restrained than Roxy and therefor, from a strictly intellectual perspective, more impressive. I don't necessarily demand intellectual excellence in my music. Fact is, I often revile it. But One Size Fits All is just so damn superb. There are moments here that defy rationality, that soar off into the vague, hazy ether of pure imagination. The tighter they got the further out they'd go. One Size Fits All is a worthy rival for my one true love, and as such is an irresistible mistress that I often sneak off with to remote, fantastical places. Anyway, that's my 2 cents, and then some...

B0000009SG|5.0|It's crazy how prescient, how aware Frank was of his position on the American musical landscape. He decides to raise a little money to finance some of his more challenging, more interesting projects and, like a flipping a switch, he produces Overnight Sensation, and - Cha Ching - the cash rolls in! Cynical extremists fault this album's obviously calculated posture, but they refuse to acknowledge that even the most gifted artists are able to surpass their own intentions. There's nothing here that you could accuse of pandering to a less sophisticated audience. No one can honestly call any of these tunes pop. It's not just a respectable Zappa specimen, but it's also a marvelously compact, terrifically potent distillation of so many of his greatest concepts and impulses. It plays like a whirlwind tour of Zappa-land, featuring succinct samples of his irrepressible humor, his compositional ingenuity, his guitar wizardry, and his ambitious - quixotic - conceptual integrity. Dinah-Moe Humm is hardly radio friendly. And Montana is so subtly sarcastic that it could not help but confuse the masses. I'm the Slime is so viciously contemptuous of mass entertainment, who would pay for it? No song here is anything like common, crass or corny. Yet the album sold quite well, Frank got his roll, and thankfully some more absurd, brilliant, unique projects were subsidized. These are not minor, deficient, inconsequential commercial trinkets. They are succulent nuggets of Zappa's masterful madness. It's all part of his ongoing continuity.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The first week or so, I ran Alarm Clock Xtreme simultaneously with my home alarm, afraid that an app might make me late for work due to failure.  Not any longer!  I've got the full blown trust for this app, I love how it lets me customize from day to day.
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|This album is another masterpiece by Bat For Lashes. While Fur and Gold took us through the fresh feeling of travelling through a mystical forest, Two Suns, deffinitly takes us to more of a jungle, of magic, and mountains of power. Also, into our bedrooms alone, searching for someone we've lost in the dark, glass and emerald cities with crystal towers, into the galaxy with moving, dancing planets. So many places Two Suns has taken us.       I deffinitly recommend this album. Natasha Khan (Bat For Lashes) Has done it again in an inspiring collage of drums, auto harp, piano and more. It will be the top choice of an album someone may love to listen to alone, relaxing. Or outside, where you can sing along to the tracks, and hear your own voice echo back at you, not caring if you sound terrible.     For anyone longing for escape, or dreaming of magic. Deffinitly listen to this album.
0064407667|3.0|I decided to order the first book in this series because of the \\"kid craze\\" surrounding the series. Any book that engages and excites students this much is a book I have to read to see what all the fuss is about. These books are relatively easy reads with plots that are not too complicated. I can see why they would be so entertaining to kids due to their spooky nature and zany characters. Hidden within the text are great moral lessons and wonderful vocabulary. The author engages the reader by including them and directly speaking to us upon occasion. These books do not talk down to the reader and will excite students to see what happens in the following books.  I will be including this series in my classroom library alongside great quality reads such as Newberry Award winners and Honors books.
0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey is hilarious as always in this entertaining biography. It is also very interesting to hear her take on being a woman in a field run by men.  Without being preachy she makes some very interesting points.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I watched this three times in as many weeks.  Danes does a fantastic job of acting: research? empathy? Somehow she does it.  A moving story that pulls no punches.  Watching it was a threshold moment for me --- allowing me finally to know for certain that someone else's world, no matter how 'different' or 'difficult', is as real as mine.  I would make this required viewing in any number of school and professional training courses.
0786838655|4.0|The Lightning Thief / 9780786838653<br /><br />I'm kind of a sucker for mythology remakes, so I guess it was a foregone conclusion that I would like \\"The Lightning Thief\\". Percy Jackson really comes to life on the page as a sweet 12-year-old kid who is struggling from the weight of having lost his father, dealing with a horrible step-dad, and coping with ADHD and dyslexia. With all these problems, and in and out of schools like a revolving door, how was he to guess that he's a godling child, son of Poseidon, and with a brain stubbornly hardwired to read ancient Greek and be alert on the battlefield?<br /><br />For all its \\"kid-focus\\", \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is surprisingly and admirably true to the myths that it builds upon. Since monsters can't be permanently killed, just 'defeated', Percy gets to visit quite a lot of mythological fare -- like the Medusa -- and it's quite interesting to see how Riordan has re-imagined the ancient gods and monsters of myth in their new, modern settings. The story, too, is surprisingly grim under the surface: since godlings naturally attract monsters to them, many of them are forced to live permanently at the safe \\"summer camp\\" for half-bloods, far away from their mortal families; protected prisoners, living life in a gilded cage.<br /><br />If there's anything I don't like about \\"The Lightning Thief\\", it's perhaps that the writing can be a bit rough at times. Percy-the-narrator is fond of parenthetical asides, which often takes me right out of the action for some reason and reminds me that I'm reading a book; and some of the world-building at the beginning is quite slow if you already know the premise of the book (which, now that it's a major motion picture, you probably already do). On the other hand, I finished this book in a day because I quite simply couldn't put it down, so I can't criticize it too strongly -- Percy Jackson may be rough around the edges, but it has a heart and soul that will keep up reading until the end.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
B000002LCD|4.0|Im not sure how it give 1/2 stars. But regardless Im enjoying the CD very much. Had it on Cassette way back when and just recently got the DVD that I used to have on VHS. Seeing the movie again reminded me about the soundtrack so i came here to Amazon and ordered it. I love the Movie and I think it only got bad reviews way back when because the critics just didnt like Madonna and so automatically gave it bad reviews/press. Loved the Movie so much kinda wore out the VHS tape lol. Anyway, Peace everyone.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If your history education is lacking, the many references could make the story boring.  However, if you have a competent understanding of history and a curiosity of the occult, this is a very cleverly written novel.   I am anxiously waiting for the next book.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I spent the last couple of hours reading this absorbing romance.Maybe it's was my fascination with bad boy Travis or my understanding of Abby's character.But I totally enjoy the story,the author gives you a smooth ride through the narrative. I got love at first sight with Travis, I got touched with every smile, every fight and I lived in fear of the worse. This is not the best book ever but surely is a great journey through a very enjoyable romance. I can resume my thoughts saying that I end up with a big smile that remind me of my teenagers dreams.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and I can't believe that I've never heard of it until recently. I have already read the second and third books in the series and I know that each one just gets better and better! This is a must have for all who like young adult paranormal fiction! The characters are totally relatable. If you don't like this book then you're either too old or you have brain damage. I am obsessed with this series and the authors!

1907590250|4.0|Literature is art and when we think of the visual arts or the performing arts a hallmark of great artistic works is the ability to revisit the work and gain something from it each time. A great book is not different. It is one you can read and reread and not only appreciate it each time, but also dicsover different nuances with each reading which lead to a deeper understanding. The Sun Also Rises is not great simply because it is a strong example of modern American literature; it is great because although his style is lean and appears simplistic the unity of effect is not.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|Disregard the nonsense spewed out by some of the negative reviewers regarding this thriller. I can only guess at some of the motives behind the negative reviews. Maybe the fact that the wolves are shown to be what they are. Predators. If you read the writings of early explorers, trappers, colonizers etc... there are numerous cases of wolf attacks on humans. Read pages 434 and 435 of the book HISTORY OF THE WESTERN MISSIONS AND MISSIONARIES IN THE UNTIED STATES. The attack happened in the state of Kentucky. The book was printed in the 1850's. Father DeSmet was the author. This is just one of many such historical records of wolf attacks on humans. I am a huge nature lover but am baffled by the dishoesty of other nature lovers. A fact is a fact. Under certain situations healthy and non rabid wolves will prey on humans. This bull about wolves never attacking humans is a bunch of mularky. The only bad part of the movie was the tasteless crude sexual jokes.

6305692572|4.0|I won't comment on the movie itself, because that's entirely up to taste; I'll just review the physical product.    The DVD came with a pretty standard length of shipping, packaged in a somewhat padded envelope. The case was completely busted on the bottom corner, with pieces rattling around inside the case and envelope. The DVD itself had a few discouraging scratches because of the broken case pieces. I'd like to note that the seller isn't responsible for the damage to the product during shipping, that's entirely on the carrier, although the seller may want to look into an alternative if this sort of thing persists from other customers.    Otherwise, it is the legitimate DVD, and an excellent addition to my collection.
B004AUGJS8|5.0|I'm David Marks.<br />David Marks (Ryan Gosling), is one very disturbed man. After being left alone by his father, Sanford Marks (Frank Langella) as a seven-year-old child, he witnessed his mother's violent suicide. This had furthered his life forever to become off track from what is expected of him. He must possess a hardened strength of character always demanded from his overly controlling father.  All of his life, things are forced on David without exception. He is the eldest and will be required to carry on the family's crooked and high-grossing real estate business from a certain point onward. He is being groomed surrounding the business from the outset. David does not argue with his father as concerning him there is no gauntlet to throw down while he follows orders in an almost robotic fashion. He is always mercilessly being put down as a weakling, a completely shameful person in front of others or set up for ridicule around his father and his company.<br /><br />Director Andrew Jarecki introduces us to the fictitious character David Marks who is based on the real-life case of Robert Durst. An actually chilling case it is with the information that has been discovered since this movie's release... David is on the way to a company's high society, black-tie function. He is all dressed in a tuxedo for the party, after returning from a call for his father when he gets rerouted to go fix a leak in an apartment which their family business owns because his father is just cruel enough to have David do it in lieu of a contracted plumber. This is when he is much younger, quite a lot younger and rebelling just a bit although David cannot totally. He walks into the apartment of his future bride Katie (Kirsten Dunst).  Sanford does not approve of their relationship or subsequent marriage as she is not, &#34;One of our people&#34;. She dreams of going to medical school and becoming a doctor. Also, wishes to have children with David after they are married and open a health food store in Vermont. Of which they do and are blissfully happy then without the pressures of David's father. Sanford soon shatters their happiness and coerces them to move into a big-money apartment that they really do not want. It does not fit in their 'simple life' plan.<br /><br />They are still in the first stages of their love when Katie announces her pregnancy. Unfortunately, they did not discuss this issue before marriage. Katie is shocked when David finally tells her he neither wanted her pregnant now nor wants to have children in the future to Katie's complete devastation. A full reason for this rationale is never offered.  The disjointed and macabre way of thinking that David suffers really starts to become more realistic here. Consequently, Katie must handle the pregnancy concerns by herself and she is never the same after this trauma, plus having to handle it all alone only complicated the matter. In fact, nothing is ever the same and the plot of the movie begins to go off in different directions and on different paths.<br /><br />I don't want to add in any spoilers to the movie so I'll try to end this part rather vaguely. It is at this point where Katie disappears. David apparently suffers some type of mental breakdown or calculated state of rage that throws his life out of control. The writers make both seem plausible through the narration that continues throughout the movie from the outset. David is talking while on the stand during his trial in 2003 from the beginning of the film right on through to its ending. After the aforementioned happenings occur, the second part of the movie plays out like the bizarre second half of a two-part stage play. This is a completely engrossing movie, extremely psychological and so well acted. When the film ended I felt like I was sort of in shock for what had happened here with Katie. Also very suspicious of this terribly damaged man. Is he suffering because of his father's cruelty and over his wife's disappearance?It is so difficult to discern where his mind and thoughts are at. As I looked at him, his look frightened me and so did his demeanor. If you enjoy frightening mysteries and surreal crime dramas, this movie may appeal to you. I remember running this through my mind after viewing this for such a long time. Andrew Jarecki had me in the palm of his hand with this movie especially because it is based on a true story that is completely unimaginable<br /><br />*A perfect companion piece to this movie or by itself also is the six-part T.V.

1400052181|5.0|Nonfiction can often be boring. Medical Science writing can be even more boring. But Rebecca Skloot has managed to write a book that you can't put down. I powered through the book and enjoyed every bit, that alone is an amazing feat of writing. The book is technical, detailed, scientific and completely enthralling.    With over 700 reviews, I won't rehash the book as many other reviewers have done fine reviews. However, I have to say as someone with zero medical background, Skloot did an incredible job of clearly explaining how the process of cell replication works, and how and why Hela was so special. I felt like I had gained a window into the topic and a glimpse at what is going on behind closed doors at both hospitals and research centers.    And I would never had predicted that a book about medical science would bring tears to my eyes. But this book did by describing Henrietta's daughter's tortured relationship with her mother, her mother's cells, John Hopkins and with Skloot herself. Medical ethics, race relations, doctor/patient relationships, tissue research, tissue use ethics - this book would have been fascinating if covering one or two of these topics alone and yet ably covers all of that list and more.    If you don't have time to read many books, put this one at the top of your list. It is probably going to be my favorite book of 2011.
B004G600A4|5.0|My best friend bought me this DVD for my birthday and I LOVE it! The story is so charming and fun and is a wonderful Disney twist on a classic fairytale! I love it very much.

I am very happy I bought this DVD and am a very satisfied customer!
B000VUCIZE|4.0|I found this book overall well written & well thought out. There were times I felt it strayed off topic but the book still held up. I definetly think the battleground many religions seem to find are not consistant with the peacefull claims they make & this book delves into the reaons why such battles are being actively sought.
0307276902|2.0|This was a very difficult book to read.  There are run-on sentences, intentional, but a hard style to read.      It was a book that lead up to a whole lot of nothing.  The best part of the book was the at the very end with the summary about what happened to the other people.    I sincerely could not read this book again, which was very disappointing because of all the hype.  What the hell was Oprah thinking????
B0034G4P8K|3.0|This movie was certainly not the worst scifi superheroish movie I've ever seen. It had some very good qualities to the storyline.    The battle at the end does go on much longer than it needed to. It began to lose some of the audiences interest as it continued on and on. However, the first two transformers movies did the same thing.    It was also rather obvious they were killing the bulk of their characters just so that they had a reason to end the franchise and not make a fourth movie. Ending on a third movie is becoming a bit of a cliche'. So many have ended on 3 movies that it's becoming very sad that they decided this magic number is the perfect place to fall on their swords. Some movies have decided not to follow the crowd and managed to make it past the third movie and further. Such as X-Men, Narnia, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Lord of the Rings.    Bottom line it was a good movie, but not good enough to warrent 5 stars. I plan to buy it when it is out on DVD, and recommend others to watch it.

B004LWZW42|3.0|X-Men First Class turned out much better than expected. It complimented the original movies very good, and had some great storylines of it's own. However, it played along as it was in the continuity of the other X-Men movies, but had some major errors in the timeline. This brought down the quality of the movie. Magneto seemed to be so childish, not thinking of anything but his petty revenge, unlike in the other movies thinking of the mutant cause. In the end of the movie he seemed like a puppet of Sabastian Shaw, even though Shaw is killed, Magneto takes up his cause.    Regardless, I am still very pleased that X-Men broke the curse of ending on a third movie that so many movies fall into, or let themselves end on (spiderman, transformers, the new Batman movies, Jurassic Park, the Matrix). It's sad to see so many great movies not leading the group, but falling into a pattern of ending on the same number of movies. X-Men did manage to rise above that.    It's not the greatest superhero movie of the year, Green Lantern was much better, but I highly recommend X-Men First Class to anyone interested in seeing a good superhero movie and I plan to buy it when it comes out on DVD.

0525422943|5.0|I was impressed with If I Stay so when I discovered there was a sequel, it was a no-brainer that I would read it as soon as possible. It was interesting to me that Where She Went was told from Adam's point of view, and since the reader doesn't learn too much about Adam in If I Stay, that concerned me a bit. I was worried that I wouldn't like it or wouldn't connect to the story - I wanted to hear from Mia, darn it! But I shouldn't have worried - in Forman's expert hands this book was done perfectly. I'd even go so far as to say I liked it better than the first one.    Where She Went is much different from its predecessor, so please don't expect another book exactly like If I Stay. Instead, this book is much more plot-driven, the reader learns much more about Mia and Adam's relationship, and by the end I personally felt that I had really and truly gotten to know both of these characters. It just felt more... concrete, I guess you could say. The first book was more dream-like, whereas this one had a solid beginning, middle, and end. What I liked most was that there was a clear conclusion to things - it made me feel like these characters were at the best place they could be and I was allowed to be happy for them. I was allowed to put them away in my mind. In the first book, the end left me with tons of questions (and at the time I didn't know she was going to write a sequel), but in this book I feel like most of those questions have been answered and I closed the book feeling more at peace with Mia and Adam's situation.    I know I said I was worried about Adam telling me this story instead of Mia, but I really shouldn't have been. Adam was the perfect person to tell this story and I loved hearing from him. It's not often that a YA book with a romance involved is told from the male perspective and it was refreshing for sure. And in this case, it really worked - Adam's pain at losing Mia was palpable, even when he couldn't acknowledge his feelings they were clear as dayto the reader. Forman perfectly captured the way boys have a tendency to squash their feelings, to bury them in something else (in Adam's case, that something else would be his music, and the issues he created with his band and his girlfriend). It was also interesting to read about Adam's view of Mia, given the fact that I felt that I knew her so well from reading the first book. A great technique overall and I'm very glad Forman chose to tell this story from Adam's point of view.    Where She Went really and truly worked for me. It's a very rare thing when I can enjoy a sequel to a novel better than its predecessor, but in this case I must say that I did. While I enjoyed If I Stay, it would have been an incomplete book without Where She Went coming after. I would definitely recommend reading both of these novels.
0439023521|5.0|I bought this book for my 11-year-old daughter, who tore through it in a few days.  Then she wanted me to read it so we could talk about it.  I did so and was pleasantly surprised at what an exciting, enjoyable book this was.  No wonder it is so popular!  I read it in one sitting -- quick read, interesting story, great action, and a herione your really care about.  Five stars.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Easily the freshest sound to hit airwaves since MGMT's debut in 2008, Foster the People is a band surging with kinetic electro-pop energy that's hugely contagious. Like Miike Snow and the aforementioned MGMT, Foster the People has crafted a feel-good album whose sound is likely to have the same effect on oneself as the consumption of four Red Bull vodkas. Inexplicably your Blood Alcohol Level will rise over the legal limit and put you and others in harms way if deciding to operate a motor vehicle with \\"Torches\\" in your stereo. Your hands will come off the wheel and you will dance until your car hits something.<br /><br />If there is a fault to be found on this album, it's that it's so damn addicting... and if any of you took Health class in high school, you know that addiction can often lead to overdosing. So it may be advisable to take it easy on the replay button as you could wind up getting sick of all the pop.<br /><br />Highlights of the album include: \\"Call It What You Want,\\" \\"Waste,\\" \\"I Would Do Anything For You,\\" and \\"Warrant.\\" \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" and \\"Helena Beat\\" are as notable, but have also lost a bit of their notoriety from having been played several months in advance to the albums release.<br /><br />GRADE: A-

B003VR5PPY|2.0|This game is rated \\"mature,\\" but doesn't seem to actually be for adults. The main problems? Poor writing, incessant repetition, and incredibly easy puzzles.    The rave review for this title are primarily based on praise for the interesting and creative story (which makes sense, since this game is quite literally 90% story and 10% interactive puzzles). I agree that the story, as a whole, is good. However, the writing itself is so poor and repetitive that anything redeeming about the story is lost. One would think that a \\"mature\\" game would be written at an adult reading level.     It isn't merely that it moves slowly -- concepts are repeated over and over (presumably so that you catch the \\"important\\" stuff), and it feels as though this was written for a 12-year-old. Particularly obnoxious examples of this is full repetition of unnecessarily detailed instructions every time you click on a puzzle (e.g. entering a combination - a full paragraph of explanation), detailed discussion of basic arithmetic, repetitive and excruciatingly descriptive details that do not add to the story, a character's internal dialogue that paraphrases the conversation that you just read, etc.    Further, the story is written with all of the sophistication of a high school creative writing assignment (which, I suppose, is suggested by the repetition). Not only is the sentence structure poor and distracting, there is close to no believable character development. As a person who cries at almost every movie, I had no empathy whatsoever for any of these characters. For a game that is primarily story-driven, this is damning. Story-driven games, one of my favorite genres, can be done well (see, e.g., Heavy Rain). This, however, is poorly executed.    As for the remaining 10%, it's fairly boring. To compare it to Myst is laughable. I'm fine with easy games, but when action is hours apart, it's a snooze. The game could have included more interactive elements without detracting from the story. I don'tunderstand why they didn't have you, say, actually walk down hallways instead of describing it in three poorly written paragraphs. If the writing was better, it would have been tolerable. Alas, a good concept, marred in execution.
B004UHPU5E|5.0|Rather than trying to act as an \\"apologist\\" for this album, let me just say that it is best appreciated if it is approached on it's own terms. I was prepared to be disappointed but when I sat down and LISTENED to it, I found it intriguing and rewarding. There is a rich complexity in the way this music is realized which is especially apparent on \\"The Light of Day\\". In terms of the organic integration of Fripp's soundscape approach with more conventional songwriting and instrumentation, this may be his most successful outing yet.    The DVD Audio layer sounds panoramic and very rich in detail and the alternate mixes, video for the title track and the couple of improvisations with Jakszyk and Fripp are very welcome additions. As a long time \\"fan\\" of King Crimson, Robert Fripp and the ProjecKts, I highly recommend this recording with the proviso to \\"expect the unexpected\\".
B00275EHJG|4.0|The original Toy Story movies came out when I was 1 and 5 years old, and I owned the second one on video for a while. Hearing about a third one, I knew that it was going to be something really special, and the result was certainly not a derivative film that lost some of its' predecessors joy and fun through a long lapse of time, it was a fun movie that had some redeeming value added to it.    At least 10 years have passed since the second Toy Story, and Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, the Potato Heads (Mrs. Potato Head lost an eye), Rex, Hamm, and the Alien Trio have wanted their now 17-year old owner Andy to play with them.  But finding out that their owner is going to college, they wonder where they will end up. Looking in his box, Andy decides to take Woody to college and put the rest of the toys in the attic, but he gets caught up with something and his Mom misinterprets it as trash. She then leaves the bag with the toys out at the end of the driveway as the garbage truck comes. After making a narrow escape, the toys believe that Andy was throwing them away and Woody tries to convince them that he was putting them in the attic. Not believing Woody (as usual), the toys seek refuge in a donation box to Sunnyside Daycare, where Molly's Barbie doll had been donated as well. Arriving at Sunnyside, the toys get to know new toys including Lots'O'Huggin Bear, Stretch the Octopus, Big Baby, and Ken, who instantly falls in love with Barbie (and vice versa). With the supposed new toys chosen to be in the Caterpillar room, Woody decides to escape Sunnyside believing that Andy will still want him, but he accidentally gets picked up by a girl named Bonnie, who takes him home. Meanwhile, the rest of the toys are tortured by the younger kids, and then decide to move to the more gentle and more aware kids of the Butterfly room. Buzz attempts to try and request going there, but is stopped by Lotso, Big Baby, and Ken, and is resetted. Meanwhile, Mrs. Potato Head looks through her other eye which was left at Andy's house, and finds out that Woody was right. In an attempt to leave, the toys confront Lotso, and end up being captured and put in cages, Barbie breaks up with Ken, Buzz was reset to work for Lotso and Mr. Potato Head was put in the sandbox. Meanwhile, at Bonnie's, Woody makes a few new friends with Dolly, Trixie the Triceratops, Mr. Pricklepants, and Chuckles the Clown, who tells Woody the cold, hard truth about Sunnyside and how Lotso was replaced by his owner Daisy, after she accidentally left him, Big Baby, and Chuckles behind. Hearing that his friends are in danger, Woody heads back to the daycare to retrieve his friends, and is warned by a play-telephone that he shouldn't have returned. But in an effort to try and get out, the telephone tells Woody the secrets to get out of Sunnyside. Putting together a plan of his own and reuniting with his friends, Woody uses Barbie to go back with Ken as a diversion to fix Buzz back to normal, and the security camera toy monkey is knocked out. However, trying to reset Buzz back to normal was a misfire, as Buzz accidentally was put in Spanish mode and falls in love with Jessie. The toys make it to the dumpster, which is described as the only way out, but are found by Lotso and his gang, who had broken the telephone to reveal what was going on. Woody then confronts Lotso about his old owner, Daisy, and Big Baby soon turns on Lotso and throws him in the dumpster. The garbage truck then came and dumped everyone (with the exception of Lotso's gang and Barbie and Ken) into a truck. At the Landfill, the toys narrowly escape danger twice, and head for a fiery furnace, with the exception of Lotso, who escapes by using a ladder, and the Alien Trio, who run after a crane. The toys hold hands thinking that it is the end, but the Alien Trio saves them by using the giant \\"claw\\" as they say. The toys then hitch a ride on a garbage truck to get them back to Andy's, and the toys all willingly get into the attic box. Woody then signs a note saying to donate to Bonnie's house, and signing it from Andy's Mom. Andy then takes the toys to Bonnie's and he plays with her and with the toys for the last time. Andy then drives off to college, and Woody says in a sad tone, \\"So long, partner\\".    The end of the film is somewhat sad, as all other finales to franchises are normally. The story is relatively simple, and there is a home movies scene early on that is a bit dull, which doesn't quite make the film as good as Up, Finding Nemo, or WALL-E, but the music and songs by Randy Newman are nice, upbeat, and reminiscent of its' predecessors. The voice cast is just as good as they were 10 1/2 years earlier, and the new ones added (Michael Keaton, Whoopi Goldberg, Timothy Dalton, Ned Beatty, Bonnie Hunt, Kristen Schaal) are excellent choices. Altogether, a heartwarming, entertaining flick that families will certainly enjoy.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Better than the ususal \\"boxing\\" movie for many reasons. Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg, actors able to take on roles and play them convincingly, never reminding you of another role they've played are great portraying Dicky Ecklund and Mickey Ward; the whole cast does well as who they're portraying.  Wahlberg actually boxes, not using stuntmen as he prepared to play Ward since it was decided he'd star in this (around 4 yrs ago).  Bale plays a great crackhead in his portrayal of Dicky Ecklund. I've watched this movie more than once and probably will again many more times.  All the way around considering drama, action, emotion - I think this is a great flick and will probably look at other movies directed by David O.Russell.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The only places to find a non special edition copy of the original trilogy are: the 80s VHS tapes; the 1993 laser-discs; the 90s THX VHS versions; the 2004 \\"bonus feature\\" of the original, non-anamorphic, transfer of the 1993 laser-disc versions (which don't fit to your TV).        Can't we have a good cleaned up version on DVD or Blue-Ray-- sans special edition non-sense?

0345529057|5.0|This is a nicely packaged set of books that are the paperback edition. There was some confusion as to this being a mass market edition or not but whatever the classification is it is well worth the price and the print is to me the standard size and easy to read with an older set of eyes.    The total number of printed pages is over four thousand so you will have enough fascinating reading material for at least the near future. I never read a book by this author but became interested after seeing the HBO series. Mr. Martin brings you to a world that seems as real as the one we live in with beautiful descriptions of both people and places that are well depicted in the series. Enjoy.
B003X73QA8|3.0|The songs on this album are quite good but the sound quality of the actual cd totally sucks.  Maybe mp3s on an ipod sound ok but on any decent hifi this cd is un-listenable.

B000001FQQ|2.0|Two years after the glossy `[[ASIN:B00000AF98 Crazy Nights]]' Kiss returned with an album that tries very hard to be as bad as 1985's `[[ASIN:B00000AF96 Asylum]]'. Closing out a decade that had seen their focus all over the place in attempts to regain their 1970s glory (and compete with imitators who were outselling them) this record gives the distinct impression that the whole machine had almost ground to a halt.<br /><br />At first, there is very little to recommend about `Hot in the Shade'. The production credit says Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, so presumably that means Simmons had the upper hand. Whatever the case, its biggest crime is that it shares a distinctly under-produced sound with `Asylum'. The whole record sounds cheap and thin. Even worse, it is mostly boring, full of uninspired tired clich&eacute;-ridden tracks. Even Paul Stanley's efforts are mostly underwhelming. To add insult to injury, there are 15 songs to suffer through, with Mercury Records promoting it upon release as a bargain with over 70 minutes of music. If they were good songs, maybe. Instead it is mostly just painful ... and sad ... and dull.<br /><br />Composing again with various corporate writers who were working with every other hard rock American band - Desmond Child, Dianne Warren, Holly Knight, Bob Halligan - it is surprising that the results aren't at least mildly compelling. Highlights include Paul Stanley's partnership with Michael Bolton (yes, really) on `Forever', a song that is reminiscent of `Reason to Live' on `[[ASIN:B00000AF98 Crazy Nights]]' and sports some wonderful classically inspired finger picked guitar from Bruce Kulick and some impressive vocal gymnastics from Stanley.<br /><br />The other interesting thing to note is that the handful of remaining semi-reasonable songs are co-wrtten with Vinnie Poncia, who produced and co-wrote on the two pop albums (`[[ASIN:B000001ELL Dynasty]]' and `[[ASIN:B000001ELN Unmasked]]') Kiss made a decade earlier. Compared to `Hot in the Shade' they are true masterpieces. The best of these tracks - `Silver Spoon' (with Stanley) - is truly fine and the most impressive song on the album. Simmons' 'Cadillac Dreams', with its subtle horn flourishes, is also worth a listen, as is Stanley's 'King of Hearts'. The Simmons and (21st century Frehley replacement) Thayer composition, 'Betrayed' is also infectious. Most of the rest are, tragically, flat out forgettable, if not truly terrible (that prize goes to 'Prisoner of Love'.and 'Boomerang').<br /><br />With Guns N' Roses riding high in the charts and Alice Cooper making a comeback, this uninspired release from Kiss was hard to understand.eces.

B0031RAOVY|3.0|I don't see what is so great about the last third of a movie that is quite depressing and drags viewer down, down, down.  So that if is how the real story was (supposedly), they could have summarized that part in the last few minutes with the kid telling the story and focused more on the bond between Hachi and Gere's character.  As some have mentioned also, it seems the other people in Hachi's life were stupid and the dog needlessly suffered because of it.  This could have been a great film, but the ending sinks it.
B001FOPODS|5.0|This is a beautiful animation version of the classic story of Peter and the Wolf.  The  material explaining how the film was makes a good addition to the DVD.

B0051BVQFG|5.0|I just finished watching Battle:  Los Angeles.  It was a fantastic movie and I highly recommend it. It was wonderful to see the Marines fighting to protect our soils from the \\"inhuman invaders\\" who were trying to colonize our planet.    It was much more gritty than \\"Independence Day\\", and it is basically a war movie, with stereotypical hero's.  Hollywood or not it was refreshing to see our Military doing what they were meant to do.....defend our soils.      Who says all ET's have good intentions?

1416914285|4.0|I've had the first 3 books of this series sitting on my shelves for at least a year.  The covers were tempting enough but there was just something else I always wanted to read.  I finally gave in and WOW!!!  What an awesome new world we have been given.  The characters seem like real people.  Not just words on pages.  They have depth and emotions that just make you want to be part of their world.  The two main characters, Jace and Clary, are perfectly writen and you root for them throughout the whole book.  Cassandra Clare is such a wonder at building a story.  She gives so much detail that everything comes alive in this book.  I have no problem trying to picture what all of these new characters look like, even the demons.  There is no detail lacking in this book.  I have to say I'm not the target demographic.  I'm 34yo.  I love GOOD YA fiction and I love this book.  The only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because I've already read all 3 books!  ;)
B002ZG974M|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I laughed until I cried! This is a great documentary for moms and baby-lovers alike. I highly recommend!
0307454541|5.0|In general I liked the book. The action wasn't as fast paced as some murder mysteries, but the author has a good writing style and the characters seem very real. Also it gives us some of the flavor of life in Sweden. I would recommend it.
0064410935|5.0|This book is based on a small farm owned by the Zuckermans. Fern is a young girl who falls in love with a pig named Wilbur. She saved his life when she stepped in on his behalf after seeing her father trying to kill the young runt. She agrees to let Wilbur grow up on her uncle's farm. Wilbur becomes very lonely and looks to his barnyard gang for a true friend. He meets a spider named Charlotte. She is a very devoted friend and proves her friendship to him by planning a way to save him from being turned into the family's breakfast. This is a book based on friendship and loyalty. Charlotte and Wilbur become extremely close friends and this book tells a tale of their companionship and faithfulness to one another.   I would love to use this book in a classroom. I think that it teaches the students a good lesson while keeping them involved with a longer story. The audience finds themselves wanting to know more about the characters and what will happen to them. I think some books can drag on and on for chapters with no true meaning behind it, but this book will prove to be a very rewarding tale that makes you happy, sad, and confused as to why you fall so in love with animals on a farm. I would use this book for third or fourth grade. I think this is an appropriate age because they will need to start reading chapter book, but this one in particular is a very easy read. This will also keep the class interested in what they are reading and does not seem to be biased on which gender it appeals to. This book could also be used in higher grades simply because this story never gets old and any age could enjoy the tale told of true friendship between a pig and a spider.

1593072937|4.0|This is unlike anything I have ever read.  It remains as shocking, in many ways, today as it did when originally released.  This is a unique literary effort that also happens to be strongly illustrated.
0375823352|5.0|First:Since I cannot do half stars, I rate this book 4 1/2 stars.  Second: I would like to say that this is a review for the trilogy as a whole.  Third: I apologize for my poor review-writing :)     This trilogy has recieved plenty of bad press and reviews for its blatant opposition to the church and to religion as a whole. I agree with none of the opinions on religion in this book, nor do I agree with the people who say that this is a terrible book that should be avoided.   I first read His Dark Materials when I was 5th grade, just before the movie came out. Being so young, I did not see what made people so angry about these books that I had liked so much until I reread the series now as a 15-year-old. The second time around, I found the story just as magical as before. I picked up on what I did not the first time I read the trilogy and still loved it.     The Amber Spyglass begins just where THe Subtle Knife ended. This book is driven by the same pose and quick dialogue as the first two books and moves nearly as quickly. Nearly. I was drawn to the parts where the focus lay on Will and Lyra, but when it changes to Dr. Mary, the story slowes considerably, drawing into explanations and observations on Dust.     The story told in the entire triglogy is brought to a great close, with a bittersweet ending that is as unreal as it is beautiful. I did feel that some of the information in the battle seemed to be missing, but I liked the way that Will and Lyra's story ended. The trilogy and its world were well created with great dialogue, but when the story moved away from the main characters, it did become slow. I would recomend this trilogy to readers who enjoy fantcy and \\"epic\\" stories with a great deal of unwritten symbolism and meaning. Please do not ommit these books because of the manner in which religion is dealt. This is a work of fiction set in a parallel world. The opinion of the author alone. You do not have to agree with him. Anyway, I hope I haven't bored you with my badly written review but thats all I have to say. If you read this far, thanks! And I hope you consider reading His Dark Materials.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|My husband has the novel. He saw the movie. He saw this and always wanted to pick it up, but always put it off. He was thrilled to get the movie and all the \\"bells and whistles\\" that comes with the Ultimate Cut.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|Poor, poor Jacob! What Meyer did to his character should be criminal. Bella should not be able to get everything she wanted and then some.  I was hoping for a fight, but Meyer seems to avoid any fighting at all. I was expecting a lot more from the last book, also may I add, the ending seemed to be rushed and incomplete. (THERE WAS A TON OF EDITING PROBLEMS!!!!)

B000TGJ80S|3.0|There have been many movie versions of the Bram Stoker classic Dracula. Frances Ford Coppola turned it into a love story that found fulfillment centuries after the love began. The story is not about Dracula's search for women, but for a single woman. The film is interesting, but is very campy in how the actors act and how they look.<br /><br /> The story starts in 1462 when a secret order of Dragons (from which, according to Coppola, the name Dracula is derived) goes out to fight against the Moslem invasion. The count kisses his wife goodbye and thanks God for having her. He is successful, but the Moslems take revenge. They order an archer to shoot an arrow into the wife's room telling her that the count was killed. Grief stricken, she commits suicide. When the count returns, the priests tell him that since she committed suicide she is damned forever. He becomes furious, curses the priests, drives a sword through the church cross, and is punished by God by being turned into a vampire.<br /><br /> Four centuries later, in 1897, Dracula travels to England and discovers that his wife has been resurrected as Mina, the fianc&eacute;e of a man called Harker. He is determined to be reunited with her. He drinks the blood of Mina's friend and makes her his slave. He enchants Mina who little by little begins to recall her earlier life with the count. She drinks Dracula's blood and, although she had married Harker, insists that she wants to be with the count forever.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing, the doctor who is summoned to help Mina. He also overacts and is campy. Coppola, in a commentary that is part of the DVD, says he wanted to be as close to the original tale as possible, but he chose to put lots of the surreal in his version, and admits that he may have gone to an extreme. Readers of this review may be interested in reading my review of Bela Lugosi's Dracula, a collection of several Dracula films.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is one of the best dramas on television.  The writing is absolutely top notch!  While not all episodes are equally engrossing, the best of them are comparable to the best stuff ever written for the tube.  The HALF MEASURES episode in Season 3 is without question one of the most powerful dramatic hours I have ever seen on TV!  I found myself actually sitting there holding my breath throughout most of this hour.      While Cranston and Paul together are flawless, I believe the real strength of this series is its terrific supporting cast!  Anna Gunn is one of the most interesting and convincing actresses (sorry, I mean actors) I had never seen before.  Dean Norris is simply marvelous as the driven, yet vulnerable, DEA agent, Hank Schrader.  Betsy Brandt is so convincing as Hank's supportive wife, Marie.  RJ Mitte is great as Walter's son, Walter Jr.; their relationship seeming so tender and genuine.  The very funny Bob Odenkirk here does a wonderful turn as Saul Goodman, one of the sleaziest lawyers you'd never want to meet.  But one of my favorite actors of all, whom I discovered while watching another great series many years ago, Homicide:Life On The Street, is the great Giancarlo Esposito, playing Gus Fring, a seemingly simple and quiet man, whom you soon learn you had best never make unhappy, in any way.  He plays his part with a quiet menace that won't let you take your eyes off him. Jonathan Banks plays Gus' right-hand man, Mike, an assistant who does Gus' bidding almost serenely, no matter what mayhem might be involved.      But I would be badly remiss without mentioning some of the greatest cast choices ever, playing the various villains Walter and Jesse are forced to deal with at various times throughout this series.  Deserving of special mention, in my opinion, are from Season 1, Raymond Cruz as Tuco Salamanca, one of the most scarily insane criminal minds ever depicted on television! Right behind him would be the two silent but deadly killers from Season 3 known simply as \\"The Cousins\\", played by Luis and Daniel Moncada.  Their murder weapon of choice is a chrome plated fireman's ax.  Real sweethearts! Many of the smaller parts in this series are filled by some of the most convincing Hispanic actors working anywhere today.  And, lastly, I have to mention a real unsung star of this series and that is the city of Albuquerque itself.  None of the episodes in this series would be nearly as convincing had they been depicted in any other part of the country. Needless to say, I am eagerly awaiting July 17, the beginning of Season 4 for Breaking Bad.  Don't miss it!!!      My only gripe, which I feel strongly I must mention, is a technical one, involving only the DVD production, itself.  How in the world can you put out a DVD in this day and age without including: ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONING FOR THE HARD OF HEARING!!??  Just inexcusable!  There is some dialogue in many of these episodes I still haven't been able to understand no matter how high I crank up the volume. Very, very disappointing!!! Please, please don't let that happen again with the Season 4 DVD.

This book is chock full of these and other minute details.  It thoroughly documents Marilyn's life, to the point of exhaustion for the reader.  But I never got the sense that I knew or understood the real Marilyn.
B004T0XYM8|3.0|This is supposed to be a great western.  Sergio Leone liberally borrows (plagiarizes would be too harsh a term) material from other westerns, such as High Noon, Johnny Guitar, and others. Henry Fonda plays a heartless gunfighter, whom we meet early in the film, gunning down a defenseless family on the prairie. We soon meet Claudia Cardinale, soon-to-be wife of the man who was gunned down. The real star of this film is Harmonica (Charles Bronson) who looks mean but is cool, a deadly shot, and has a big heart. He's a Clint Eastwood prototype. Instead of spitting like Clint does in Leone's westerns, Harmonica plays thematic chords on his harmonica. Casting in the film is fine, except for Henry Fonda, who should have played the sheriff, but instead is miscast as a gentleman gunfighter. The most pathetic character is a wealthy cripple who lives in his own pullman car. Some of your may remember Lionel Barrymore in a wheelchair in a different western.<br /><br />Sergio Leone likes to employ long pauses, where actors move their heads slowly. Each scene is a depiction of desperation. Everyone is unhappy. Sergio Leone is telling us the west was one horrible sink hole of misery. Any humor is minimal. If you're reading this review before deciding whether to buy the DVD, don't let me stop you. I am a Clint Eastwood fan, and I think his Dirty Harry films are classics. Sergio Leone teaches you to have patience in watching this film.
0451191153|5.0|I had heard a lot about this book, but it took me a while to read it because the mere length and size of the book intimidated me. I eventually came across the audiobook version, so I quickly got and began listening to it. This book eloquently described Ayn Rand's philosophy, which is what I was mostly after. After finishing the book, I can definitely tell that this book is one of those books I will keep referring back to in terms of my outlook on life. The main thing to take away from this is that man can only be truly happy when he is pursuing his own self-interest, an interest that is selfish by nature.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I really wish that I would have read the reviews of this book before buying the Kindle edition.  I heard such great buzz in the media about the book and the movie, so I took a break from my usual reads for what I thought was going to be something of literary value.  Boy was I wrong!    At no point while reading this book did I ever come to like the author or view her as anymore than a petulant child.  Everyone struggles with finding themselves or at the very least figuring out how to deal with the cards that life has dealt them.  Gilbert is essentially a \\"poor little rich girl,\\" and I realize everyone suffers differently from their demons, but her difficulties are laughable.  I'm sorry that you have little to no self-esteem and depend on men to complete you.  You really needed to go to Italy, India and Indonesia to discover this?  Yet do you ever truly discover this?  The author basically fell back into her old habits anyway, but while laughing the whole way to the bank.  It must be nice to have a publisher pay you such a significant advance to do the research to write a book.      As someone who loves to travel, while constantly trying to figure out religions, spirituality and how the whole world interconnects (while on an extremely tight budget) this book disgusts me.  It is a perfect example of what is wrong with today's society: everything is about me.  Me, me, me.  If the author honestly learned something about herself and made change or if she truly had a hardship that she needed to overcome, this book would have been worth reading.    I wish that I would have purchased this book in paperback rather than for Kindle so that I could have either torn it apart or burned it...and I love books.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I recently opened a PC repair shop.  Since space is limited (and to avoid knocking the monitor off the repair bench when moving PCs), I bought this.    * The price on this model is a steal.  A similar model at F*y's was almost twice the price.    * The fit and finish are excellent.  I have it mounted to an IKEA Galant series workstation (3/4\\" laminate particle board).  The base is rock solid; I doubt an F5 tornado could knock it loose.      * Adjusting the monitor swivel is a snap with one hand.  Once set, it stays in place unless you decide to move it.    * My only minor nit-picks are that the assembly instructions are a bit vauge on mounting the monitor (however, it's easy to figure out) and the built-in cable management system could be a bit better (no worries; a $5 package of cord wrap works and looks nicer).    A WORD OF WARNING WHEN PURCHASING ANY MONITOR MOUNT:  Be sure the monitor you own or plan to buy is mountable AND the base/stand can be removed on it.      * If shopping on-line, the monitor specs should mention \\"Wall Mountable\\" and/or \\"VESA 100\\"/\\"VESA 75\\".      * If looking at a monitor (one you own or at a store), there should be 4 holes or rubber plugs on the back center of the monitor that form a rectangle pattern (I have a high-end HP monitor at home that doesn't have these holes and isn't wall mountable).    * Is the monitor shipped with the stand (base) unattached or can you remove it without damaging the monitor?  (I purchased an entry level ASUS monitor for my point-of-sale system that shipped with the base attached - nice monitor, has the VESA mounting holes; however the base was permanently attached.  As an experienced PC Tech, I had to get creative and void the warranty removing it.)

B004P9FAK2|4.0|[[ASIN:B004P9FAK2 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />Yes, I love the Potter-films and the 'Creating the World of Harry Potter'-documentaries - but there is some really annoying and quite intrusive 80's-like background-music/transfer-between-subjects-music on this documentary - I had to turn of my subwoofer to stand it. That's a bit of at shame on an otherwise interessting experience. Of course this might not bother everybody, and the 'year in the life of Rowling'-documentary is also very engaging, so I would still recommend this product to Potter-fans!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|For anyone who thought great music was dead this album will prove them  wrong. This album has the soul of the early 70's with the rock spirit of today.  Susan Tedeschi's vocal are flawless and Derek Trucks guitar playing is at it's best.  Buy this album. You won't be disappointed.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and Paris \\"fell\\" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming \\"movable feast,\\" the new movie \\"Midnight in Paris \\".<br /><br />I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long times and seen all his movies, those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the screenplay for.  I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in Paris, but I had no idea how good it was.  From the first frame, following the  Darius Khondji's camera  on such familiar but uniquely beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light, it was hard not to fell in love with Paris  and with the film of Allen, his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians as to whom Paris  gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle &Eacute;poque 1890s, the Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen), light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light, night time, bright sun, and rainy hours.  Oscar nominee, the  master cinematographer  of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with  Allen on three films: Anything Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and  the next film, the Roman project Bop Decameron (2012).<br /><br />Soundtrack consists of Allen's favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz guitarist Stephane Wrembel \\"Bistro Fada\\". Wrembel's influence and source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris. I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the  film's charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings to the viewers.<br /><br />As always, in Woody Allen's movies, the actors give uniformly good performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil, Hollywood's successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel,  a protagonist, a  much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright, outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez, Gil's not so romantic fianc&eacute;e), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez's parents on the business trip in Paris who don't seem to approve their daughter's choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez's pedantic and arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very likable Americans.  The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a small role of a museum guide.<br /><br />The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and scenes as well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled  happily during the whole film. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I expected to love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece, used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen's fans, Midnight in Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled  happily during the whole film.

B004A8ZX2S|1.0|If you would like to know my take on \\"The Tree of Life,\\" please continue reading. If you consider comments to be \\"spoilers,\\" please stop reading right now....     In the National Catholic Register (6/10/11), Steven Greydanus rhetorically asked: \\"Is Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life a pretentious mess or a profound masterpiece?\\"      Greydanus is absolutely correct in saying that this \\"is a film that not only asks, with unusual insistence, why God allows suffering, but contemplates God's own answer to that question in the Book of Job, amplified by the sweeping vistas of the natural world available to modern science, the Hubble telescope and Hollywood special effects: God did all this; who are we to think we can judge or question him?\\"  Tragically, this film falls far short of magnificent replies (See [[ASIN:0819814849 Salvifici Doloris]], [[ASIN:0892832193 Peter Kreeft]]).  I believe that this films leaves its audience with the impression that God is indeed all powerful - but aloof and distant.    This past year has brought us several outstanding, spiritual films (e.g., [[ASIN:B004LWZVWU \\"Of Gods and Men,\\"]] [[ASIN:B004X2JJ44 \\"There Be Dragons\\"]]).  Don't for a moment believe that \\"The Tree of Life\\" is in the same league.
0385523394|3.0|Piper's story seemed lacking.  As interested as I was in the overall subject and enjoyed her writing style(although she used the word \\"materialized\\" far too much, a  thesaurus would have been useful here), her story was surprisingly dull.  After about half way through, things started to get pretty predictable....everyone she met was pretty much going to like her, she didn't really get challenged beyond the basics of what every other prisoner had to go through.  In fact I'd say she had a pretty nice ride while in prison, which I know cannot be the case for most who go through the prison system.  Her story also ended rather abruptly, with all her talk about how prisoners have a hard time adjusting once their on the outside, you'd think she might have shared with her readers about how she dealt with adjusting what life was like after prison. And unless I missed it, I don't believe she thanked anyone of her fellow prisoners in the Acknowledgments section which I find to be in poor taste.  I read a lot of memoirs, this is not one I would recommend to others.
0451134265|5.0|In the early stages of Stephen King's career, he wanted to put his own twist on some of the hallmarks of the horror genre, including vampires with Salem's Lot and the haunted house story, or in this case haunted hotel, with The Shining. This horrific tale of ghosts, possession, and murder ranks as one of King's all-time scariest, and spawned the Stanley Kubrick film that most regard as a classic in its own right. Most fans are aware that King was disappointed by some aspects of that film, including its failure to establish that Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel as a good father, a dedicated family man who would never think of bringing harm to his wife or son. In many ways, Torrance reflects the pressures and frustration King himself experienced as a young husband and father, a character prone to the same occasional impatience or anger as any normal person. However, when those frailties are placed in the hands of the malevolent forces at work in the Overlook, they become warped and distorted. Jack's descent into insanity is a gradual process initiated and controlled by external influences, a point left ambiguous in Kubrick's film. The film even hints at an inherent madness in the character before ever reaching the Overlook, so the differences from King's story are significant. Kubrick also excludes King's central metaphor of the boiler, which Jack has to release the pressure from periodically to avoid a powerful explosion. It's used in the novel to represent Jack's escalating rage as his mental instability progresses and is key to the book's plot, particularly the climax. I'm not knocking the filmmaking of Kubrick, but like most King fans, I prefer the novel. If you're looking for a scare and haven't already read The Shining, imagine the possibilities of Stephen King, an enormous hotel filled with malicious ghosts, and a small, young family snowed in and isolated from all civilization. One of King's top five novels.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Mr. Cook's skills as a singer/songwriter shine on this second album post-Idol.  Serletic's touches bring it all together in a cohesive, theme-based album which is rare today.  I love how Circadian opens with the last few measures of REM, the last track (before bonus tracks).  It brings the album full circle.  Hard to choose favorite tracks, they change for me.  Right now I would say Fade Into Me, Goodbye to the Girl, and Circadian.  Well worth the money, and if you get a chance to see David perform live, he gives an amazing performance and interacts with the audience better than anyone I have seen in concert.  His band is tight, cohesive and they are all excellent musicians in their own right.

0425241505|5.0|I read alot of paranormal romances. I bought this one on my kindle from a \\"if you liked this one how about...\\" suggestion from Amazon.   Wow!!  The characters were mysterious and yet compelling.  Pia is a half breed...but nobody seems to know what kind besides human.  He is a dragon, old and set in his ways.  She steals something from him and leaves a note to say \\"I'm sorry!\\"  To say he is curious and yet angry is a mild statement.  She is just trying to keep from being killed by Dragos and he isn't quite sure why he hasn't yet.  The rest of the book unfolds as we see other Wyrfolk and of course a bad Elder thrown in the mix....we have to have some conflict.  Twists and turns and discoveries abound and of course some hot love scenes.  Upon finishing this book, I immediately went looking for another by this author only to find it wasn't out yet.  I enjoyed this read as much as JR Ward's \\"Lover\\" series and Laurel K Hamilton's \\"Anita\\" series.  Can't wait for the next one!!!
1599218011|2.0|I figured this book has lots of great information about nutrition, something I am always trying to learn more about.  While you can certainly glean useful information, you have to first get past the language.  Really, who is Kris Carr appealing to?  She writes like a 20 year old street-walking party girl. I certainly don't mind reading entertaining information if the author wants to lighten up the material, but phrases like \\"I'm not blowing smoke up your a**\\"  the f-bomb, the juvenile \\"titties\\", to name a few?  I just couldn't stomach the book and had to skim the majority of it.  It is really ashame, too, because I know within the pages of this book, there is information that I missed.  Please, Ms. Carr, if you write another book, grow up and write for real adults.
1250004349|3.0|This book was such a disappointment. As mentioned in the other reviews, it started out great - kept up steam for approx. 80% of the book and then nosedived into a piece of utter nonsense.  Where were the editors?  Does this woman have an editor?  How could she have been allowed to write such drivel?  The ending was so preposterous. I kept reading the pages wondering how much worse it could get and she went over the cliff and burst into flames.  It was such a shame - what could have been a very good, informative book was turned into a \\"Barbara Cartland  at her very worst\\" chic lit piece of nonsense.  I hear they are making it into a movie; I pray someone with an ounce of sense changes that ridiculous ending.
B00447G2MK|5.0|Basically, it's the the same increase in brightness from Homesick as Homesick was from For Those Who Have Heart. It seems a lot of people are putting this album in the same category as the same \\"pop crap\\" that it seems a lot of bands slowly progress towards the longer they are around; radio junk. This is simply not the case. Listen to the preview of \\"2nd Sucks\\" and you'll see that this album is plenty dark enough for those of you who are fans of ADTR's old material. At the time of this review, the album had a rating of 4 stars overall -- in my mind it deserves at least a 4.5.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Over the past 40 years, I've owned two other Seiko watches just like this.  They are practically indestructable.  The crystal set below the bezel so it's very hard to scratch or damage.  I'm not easy on watches.  Mine keeps perfect time right out of the box.  The only complaint I have with these watches is the winding/charging  mechanism seem to wear out after about 15 to 16 years and they start to lose time.  Oh, by the way I still have the other two watch and they still work but don't keep good time. I wear this watch doing everything, diving, land scaping, car repair, work, etc.  This watch is well worth the money.  Another note, I paid about the same now as I did 16 years ago for my 2nd watch.  Seiko has kept the price on this watch reasonable.  In another 15 years or so I'll buy another if I need to.
B003R0MF1W|1.0|I watched some of the Mentalist.  It is clever, and is based on the perceptions of its main character of which there is a sparse smattering of clues to as how he does this.  Clever writing. Being something of a deep perceptionist myself I see the holes of the story and it is bothersome.  But again isn't all television a cult of personality?  Just not my cup of tea I guess because of exploitations of perception inherent in the show's premise.<br /><br />Tighter writing exists in other shows such as Fringe and The Closer (with some good sub plots.)
B0055FR5PS|2.0|That's what it should have been called.  Did you know this movie actually had a writer.  I'm not sure why, there aren't but more than ten lines of dialogue.  Every character has exactly one dimension and most serve as \\"red shirts\\" or target practice for the aliens that are stealing our water or using our water as fuel or doing something related to our water.  Who really cares why the aliens came 200 gazillion trillion miles, maybe they were just mighty thirsty.  It was fun mindless (MINDLESS must be emphasized) explosion after crazy explosion.  Blowing Up Los Angeles!
0439023521|5.0|I am typically a pretty casual reader.  Suzanne Collins changed that with the first installment of this trilogy, though!  I usually only read at night right before bed, but I ended up reading this book in just two days.  It's nearly 400 pages, but I simply couldn't put it down.  A lot of fiction/sci-fi novels will focus on one aspect of the story too much -- either focusing on character building to the point that it's a bore or filling the plot with so much action that it is difficult to keep straight which characters are important.    With Collins, however, you find the perfect balance.  She draws you into a world that is entirely different and yet disturbingly similar to our own.  Each character is genuinely relatable while maintaining a unique persona, which makes each character incredibly interesting to read about and incredibly difficult to figure out.  The plot isn't entirely filled with action in the typical sense of the word, yet Collins' writing somehow manages to keep you up to the wee hours of the morning, unable to put the book down.      I had read a series of more 'serious' novels prior to this one, and it provided me an excellent break.  Not to say that The Hunger Games doesn't produce intricate themes all its own, but it is simply a fun read.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a refreshingly original story, exciting and fun and -- best of all -- part of a trilogy which means that once you're done with this you can pick up two more installments!
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|This is a great game and it works perfectly on my phone (HTC Inspire).  My boyfriend and I spent hours this weekend trying to out do each others completion time.  Although I got the app when it was free, it's definitely worth the price if you have to pay.
0937381888|5.0|I recently picked up home-brewing as a new hobby.  There is a home-brewing store a half hour drive from my house so I went there to get all the necessary equipment and found that they offered monthly brewing classes so that you could see how to actually do it first-hand.  I had already ordered this book upon the recommendation of a friend, but the class was free if you bought a kit from the store so I decided to attend anyway.      After attending the class and having read the book, I was amazed to see well the two matched up.  Often when you read something in a text and then experience it first-hand the two are radically different, but not so in this case!  It was as though the expert home-brewers who taught the class had written the book themselves.  Palmer absolutely got it right with this book.  Just like the title says, he tells you everything you need to know to brew beer right the first time.  He goes through all of the bare-bones knowledge in an easy-to-follow way, ensuring that you don't accidentally boil your flavoring hops too long or your bitters too quickly.  If you read only the first chapter or two carefully, you will be able to successfully brew you first batch of beer with minimal difficulty.    Highly recommend it to any newcomers to the home-brewing craft!

B0034G4P80|1.0|When it became clear that Hollywood was going to try to make a movie out of every major Marvel comic character, my opinion was that they would all be mediocre to bad.  I always thought that the best adaptation would have to be Thor, because the visuals necessary to create Asgard would have to be spectacular.  In 2011's Thor, starring some guy who doesn't do a good job playing Thor as Thor, Asgard is pretty cool looking, but nothing special.  Everything else about this film is stupid crap marketed towards the stupidest of the stupid, aka, the general movie-going public.<br /><br />Pretty much everything about this movie is terrible, but here are my key points:<br /><br />(1) LOKI - Loki, whether the Norse myth Loki or the Marvel villain Loki, is supposed to be MISCHIEVOUS.  He shape shifts, disappears, plays both sides, plays pranks, hides and steals things.  Primarily he is the shallow foil to Thor's heroics.  In the movie, he is brooding and whiny.  He quietly contemplates and is jealous of Thor.  The comic book has always shown him to be quite flamboyant and flippant, almost resembling the Joker.  Here he is like a despondent teenager.  This movie got Loki completely wrong.<br /><br />(2) THOR - Thor should be slightly stupid, the type of hero so committed to being a hero that he comes across as a simpleton.  Above all, he should possess medieval chivalry that seems out of place in modern times.  Here he is like a supermodel whose come to be cool, look good, and save the planet or something.<br /><br />(3).  VILLAINS - Villains are as important as the superhero in comic book movies; who are the villains in Thor?  Is it Loki? I hope not because half the time they are getting along, and Loki is really really bad at being Loki, so that doesn't work.  Is it the ice giants?  Well, they are gone after the first battle, so it ain't them.  What about the Destroyer? Well, that is really just a mindless weapon of the Asgardians used against Thor in a brief and bland battle.  NO VILLAIN IN A COMIC BOOK MOVIE?!?!?! Yep, you heard that.<br /><br />(4) THE ROMANCE - Natalie Portman really just serves as a prop in this movie. These movies, because of the formula to sell tickets and not hurt the brains of the morons seeing them, NEED a love interest.  Portman serves as a piece of meat to make sure that Thor doesn't end without Thor kind of falling in love.  Everything out of her mouth is some sort of sassy comment that Thor, whose been on the planet for a few hours, really shouldn't be able to understand.  Also, Thor's transition from fallen-from-the-skies god to sensitive human is way to brief and undeveloped.<br /><br />I could go on forever, but I'll end saying this.  I left the theater surrounded by a large crowd of people who clearly thought this movie was awesome.  I do not think that was their own opinion.  I think what has occurred is they've been trained like dogs to like just about anything that is waved in front of their face in a familiar fashion.  \\"Ohhh, we are at a comic book movie.  Comics are familiar, I like comics.  Boy, this is good. I can't wait to see Captain America.  I like comics.\\"<br /><br />But then again, people listen to Coldplay and voted for the Nazis.MOVIE?!?!?! Yep, you heard that.

B004XXIHS2|4.0|Ira Levin's `A Kiss Before Dying' is a taught, suspenseful thriller about a self-absorbed sociopath intent on marrying into money.  The novel is divided into three parts, each focusing on one of three heirs to the Kingship Copper fortune.  The sociopath, who we meet on the first page, is beautifully drawn and impeccably believable as he plots and plans to marry youngest daughter, Dorothy Kingship, and then sees his hard work fall apart as things fly out of control.  But you just can't keep a good sociopath down, and what won't work with one sister might work well enough with another.<br /><br />The novel is written in Levin's signature detached prose, which works perfectly for this noir-influenced, Hitchcock-like story - we find ourselves inside the heads of multiple characters, providing motive and believability to a plotline that comes dangerously close to being a potboiler.  There's plenty of suspense and tension, the characters are likable and identifiable, and the twist (yes, there's a twist) is actually surprising (at least for readers who haven't seen one of the film versions of the novel!).  Best of all, everything comes together satisfactorily in the end - and endings are the most difficult for books like this one.<br /><br />Highly recommended - the 1956 movie version (with Robert Wagner and Joanne Woodward) isn't bad, either; it's just not as good as the book. It was an easy read on Kindle - if you like it, try Levin's other novels (`This Perfect Day,' `Rosemary's Baby,' `The Stepford Wives,' or `Boys from Brazil').
B002ZG980U|2.0|It's a bad sign when every piece of dialogue is exposition, but that's what we've got here. The adolescent \\"dream within a dream\\" concept is so obtuse and in such discord with the action, that the film, through dialogue, finds the need to perpetually explain and clarify itself. The actors, including DiCaprio, read improbable strings of dialogue, supposedly to each other, but transparently meant to clear things up for us, the confused and bored audience. The cinematography is awful, toggling between blown-out backlit shots and DSLR-type \\"HD\\" footage. The indoor scenes have a yellow cast, as if taken under tungsten lighting that wasn't corrected for. Many of the shots are out of focus. The actors' base makeup shows in close-ups. The music is as bad as it was in \\"The Dark Knight\\" -- pulsing fake bass with choppy fake violins slowly building to long fake climaxes. The audio is smeary and flatulent. Some explosions set off the subwoofer; others sound like an AM radio.  Finally, there's the matter of the actors. Sorry, but Leonardo DiCaprio is a boy-man with a heart-shaped face, like a teenaged version of James Cagney. The girl seems like she's at most 15 years old. Why does this matter, you ask?  Because, combined with the \\"dreams are deep!\\" premise, the lack of grown-ups reduces this to a film version of a high-school play. The exception is Tom Berenger, who, while we were watching Steven Seagal movies, somehow aged into an imitation of the John Forsythe character in \\"Dynasty.\\" I keep hearing this Nolan guy is great but I have yet to see anything resembling proof.
1582701709|4.0|I'm really excited to read this book after seeing the film they made from it, especially after I saw one of the teachers is Michael Bernard Beckwith. The film was amazing and uplifting so I can't wait to read the book and have the teachings on hand. With Beckwith in it I hope it has some of the same teachings he talked about in Discover the Gift (another book/movie that enlightens readers with uplifting thoughts and finding a purpose). Can't wait and I'll prob be back to talk about the book more after I read it! lol
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Born This Way is an excellent third album from Lady Gaga. While the songs on the CD sound extremely similar to Madonna (an artist she is often compared to), they are still unique, original, and very enjoyable to listen to. If you enjoyed Lady Gaga's first two albums, this one is definitely for you.    The Special Edition comes with a few additional tracks as well as a second CD of remixes, which I would consider worth the extra money. Also, in my opinion, the album art for the Special Edition is much better-- the motorcycle cover of the regular album looks awful.
B001HN6922|1.0|This movie is a dog's breakfast.  I think the audience spoke for itself as half-way through all the kids under say 9 years of age were beginning to wine and talk from the sheer boredom of the movie's thin and unengaging plots.  All the innocence from the original movie is lost to violence, mindless explosives and repetitive use of the word \\"kill.\\"  Such scenes would be a thrill if your expecting the Bourne Identity, but the mix of genres is just a mess.  I miss the character development from the first movie. Gone is the grand supporting cast of Red, Ramone, Sally, Sheriff, Philmore and Sarge who are relegated to short cameo appearances.  It's obvious the writers tried to do too much with this movie and ended up with a sloppy amateurish mix of parts and pieces.  Verdict: It's a heap.
B00008RWBF|5.0|Got this for my daughter, who loved the Sopranos and loves to cook.  She has already used several of the recipes and likes the commentary.
B0058ZWRVC|3.0|Movie was more of a romance than a comedy, if that. The couple had no on-screen chemistry and the plot line was ambiguous and predictable. Guess you could call this movie a good \\"chick flick\\"
B0000024SN|4.0|Another great look into the past.  When you don't listen to this for awhile, you forget how amazing it is.
0061537934|5.0|I loved this book.  I read it about two weeks before I had to put my beloved 13+ year old English Springer Spaniel, Piper, down.  She and I had the same simpatico that Enzo and Denny had, and on our way to the vet, SHE comforted ME.  I reread it shortly after losing her and again, it wasn't comforting, but it spoke to me almost the way Piper did.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I was apprehensive about this show cause I was afraid it would be geared toward the Twilight fan-base but after watching the first few episodes, I absolutely loved it!  It's not as \\"innocent\\" as Twilight, but of course, it isn't True Blood either.  It's a good medium between the two considering it's on primetime TV.    Just give a chance. ;-)
1439102813|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is an intriguing look at a disease experienced by many but yet so few.  It provides us a chance to experience the journey with Alice and what it's like to be \\"diagnosed with Alzheimer's.\\"  I recently lost my grandmother 5 months ago and she suffered from dementia.  Alice's frustrations and reactions to her family reminds me of things I've seen in my grandmother toward the end.  I definitely related to her children especially when it was apparent that Alice did not recognize them.  Lydia, especially because of her distant relationship with her mother until the diagnosis.  I didn't have a distant relationship with my grandmother but like Lydia, it's like I didn't realize the seriousness of her condition until she was unable to recognize me.  That's when it hit me.  I think the author did a superb job with her descriptions and the emotional connection between the characters.  I would recommend this book to everybody.  It helps you to better appreciate the blessings in your life.
B0001Z5YW8|3.0|I am terribly disappointed to know that these aren't with all the languages I am looking for!<br />I've gotten tired of looking for one set that includes English,French and Spanish(Latin America) audios with their subtitles of course!<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw Tintin was in Spanish,as it is my native language. Later I got the chance to watch it in English and in French. So far, I can't find a place where I can buy Tintin's episodes like people in Latin America have heard them! :S It's absolutely frustrating! The majority of people that speak Spanish don't can't hv the option to buy it with the audio they're acccustomed to... Only Spain has the privilege. I guess there should be an edition for America. After all, our continent has people speaking English,French and Spanish (not with the Spaniard accent thx u)
0345529057|2.0|I bought this book set on this same store through an intermediary. Picked it up last night and while I still have to check that its not missing pages the box itself fell apart the second I took off the wrapping plastic. Some quality right? I have to suck it up since returning it would cost me more money that this set is worth, but I am terribly disappointed. I hoped the box would be a nice collectible item where I could safely store and keep the books. Seems its not. I will go now to check the pages but if I am another unfortunate buyer, I rather return this and get a refund. Have anyone got a refund?    I´ll report back regarding the books contents. Wish me luck.
B00197POXG|5.0|I remember watching this show with my mom when it was airing.  I was able to get the set for a steal of a price and could not be more happier with my purchase.  I have watched the first three seasons already and have not had one issue with picture or sound quality.  I just started watching the fourth season last night and look forward to the rest of the series.  This show will never get old in my eyes and it a great show to watch with your family :)
B0017KIBAI|1.0|I can't believe this piece of junk is satisfying customers. First off, I got it and it was clearly used. It had dirt and spots all over it, plus the analog stick was very loose due to being broken in. Second, I play Super Smash Brothers competitivley and I am always looking for new controllers so when I discovered this you could imagine how excited I was. I have purchased several different brands of controllers for gamecube and all of them either didn't respond approprietly, stopped working mid game, or just didn't work at all. When I got this one, although I was dissatisfied with the fact that it wasn't brand new, It worked well and I was doing great in tornaments and by myself, but in a month or so it all of a sudden it stopped working for no reason. This is just one of many controllers I have purchased that ended up being junk. I guess this contrloller like all the others is destined to be out dated because Nintendo is too busy you know whatting themselves with the stupid Wiimote that nobody likes. Now back to what I was saying, this controller also has an issue where if you try to input a second command right after another, the second input tends to be unresponsive. Also the Z and Y button has major issues. In some games that require moving from side to side, moving foward and pressing Z often responds inaccuratly by going the opposite direction. For example, in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, if you try to run up and grab someone, as soon as you press Z or Y you will turn around and go the other way. I had similar mishaps in games I bought from the Wii shop such as Street Fighter 2, StarFox, Super Mario 64 and many others. Although the controller worked well for a while, it broke fairly quickly and is most likley due to the fact that it is used (wether it looks like its brand new in the package or not) or poor design due to the fact that Nintendo doesn't care for the impact the discontinuing of Gamecube controllers has on gamers like myself. However seeing as how this product somehow has pleased many customers, it may still be useful to casual gamers who aren't looking for near perfection but, for competitive purposes this controller is unreliable.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. I think angry birds better watch out!  The graphics are clean and crisp and I haven't had a single issue with the game on my droid Charge. Magic hats rock!!
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Just got my Mobee Magic Charger less than 24hrs now it is work like a charm. It had some charge right out the box so it is ready to use right away. For now I can say If you have a Magic Mouse this would be a great....wait...must have add-on to get for it. Great purchase. I recommend this product.
0767817664|5.0|In my opinion, Fright Night is one of the best vampire movies out there.   Chris Sarandan makes one heck of a sexy vampire.   He can bite my neck anytime.      The movie is exciting, funny, and yes, cheesy.   But very entertaining.  I recommend it.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Great remix of old Beatle classics. Orchestrations have been added to the original Beatle vocal track on several songs and on all tracks, the Beatle vocals have never been clearer.  Wonderful 90 minutes of classic rock.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|I loved the \\"...mindless action\\".  I was enthralled by the writers who were \\"...ham sandwiches\\".  Lastly I was amazed by how \\"...they figured out how to traverse the laws of physics and travel many hundreds of thousand of light years to reach us\\"!  Maybe \\"...PBS\\" will create a series with the same theme.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This album with Images and Words + Awake are their best till now. This is the heaviest album they have ever released and it has 2 unique amazing songs : Endless Sacrifice + In the name of god. What can we say about these songs just amazing - very heavy , the adrenaline is super high and the solos are really fast and melodically. The rest tracks are very good and its generally an album you know you will hear the best progressive metal ever. A must for fans.
B001HN6922|5.0|Loved it TOO:<br />From the reviews I read here, seems a lot of people expected more, or better. I see it different. I watched it with the family, and we all loved it. It might not be the greatest or best animation out there, but we thought it was really good. It did not disappoint (not to us).<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect of it. I always liked movies by Pixar. To me, from the 1st, with Toy Story, Pixar just set a complete new bar for animation movies. I was long awaiting Cars2 to come out, but I was wondering how they could make a sequel on Cars a hit. In my mind, it must be so hard, to come up with another good storyline, with the same characters. So I was cautious going to watch this movie, expecting it to just not be as good as the first Cars was.<br /><br />Wonder, wonder, they pulled it off again! It was really good, with lots of action (well, .. at least we liked it). It is a very fast, action packed movie, which I have to admit, got me by surprise. I certainly wasn't expecting that, but then again,... I hadn't seen the trailers either. But more important, the whole family loved the movie. Especially our 6 yol son. I think he's just at the right age to enjoy this movie. Any younger, and I think he would not have enjoyed it as much. Simply, because I think it would have been too fast, and too action packed for him at a younger age. I'm guessing the writers were thinking CARS x JAMES BOND x FAST AND FURIOS. I thought it turned out pretty cool!<br /><br />Perhaps I liked it because I did not know what to expect from it,... and just sat back, relaxed, and enjoyed the movie with family,... At no point did I get the need of (deeply) analyzing the movie, story, characters, etc.... it was entertaining enough to me/us.
1423389387|5.0|I was going on a cross-country road trip and saved this audiobook for that drive.  I quickly discovered that I wanted to back up and start with the first book in the series, which I was able to purchase from Audible from my iPad.  So part one of the story got me acruss the country, and part two got me back home.  I can't wait to read part three.    This second book in the series is more of a story continuation than a sequel, but don't take that as a downside.  Book one is fabulous.  The characters are so real, the world so well-built, that I was drawn into the story immediately.    I love the way that the folk stories told about the legendary main character are told as he relates his own version of events.  There are songs, poetry, and tales about Kvothe that are grounded in 'real' events but as folk tales are wont to do, they are stretched to add drama and amazement in the telling.  But the truth is in most cases every bit as amazing as the exaggeration.    The reader of this audiobook does a great job of switching between characters, providing different accents and inflections to people from different areas of the world.  I finished listening to part one and my first thought was, I hope this same reader does part two.  He did, and it was every bit as well done as the first part.     This is a fantasy that will grab you and not let go.  I loved it!!!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|This is an excellent movie. It has a lot of action and suspense. I wanted the movie to end differently.  It left me wanting more.

B004BCT2HU|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing a song done on the Today Show one morning. I was in love!  I really do not like classical music but David brings it to a new dimension for me. The CD is great and I will probable have to get another before I wear out this one.  David, you rock!
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have been in the auduence at the Ft. Lauderdale show.  Although I thought I was buying front row seats ( close to $ 3,000  ,  turns out I was in the 3rd section back from the stage, not in the front row of that particular section.  The whole evening was SURREAL,  and now have this epic DVD to watch on my big screen TV,  and can  FINALLLY be front row, in my PJ's.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I love this CD of David Garrett's crossover music. He is a brilliant composer and violinist and I will buy every Cd he releases.
B000000WFZ|4.0|I had seen the film (\\"The Mission\\") some years ago and was more engrossed with the scenary and the message of the film than the background music.  When there was a review of the Monaco Grand Prix this year, it used a haunting piece of music to set the scene of Monaco itself with it's ambience.    I did some research and found it was a particular track from the Sound Track album.  Whilst the whole album is essentially different versions of the same theme - the one track of 'Gabriels Oboe' is brilliant and worth it on it's own.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|No two series have done more to create weary disgust with the werewolf genre' than the Twilight and Underworld franchises. Sadly, it can now be said that the timeless fairytale of Red Riding Hood has become a casualty of this lycanthropic inundation thanks to a movie of the identical title, directed by Catherine Hardwicke who (surprise!) directed Twilight.  RRH is not the worst movie you will ever see.  The village our heroine lives in is indeed fairytale-like, albeit somewhat weird in its construction.  There werewolf itself is pretty fierce, but regrettably only appears a couple of times in the movie, as anymore would probably spoil the not-so-big reveal at the end of the film.  It is a shame the director/writer didn't dwell more on the actual mythology of the werewolf as some really interesting and tense moments could have been mined.  As far as portraying Red Riding Hood, aka a horny and not-so-innocent Valerie, Amanda Seyfried wouldn't even give grass a run for its money in the interesting to watch category.  Acting?  Forget about it.  Most of the stars pretty much have a by-the-numbers approach.  Although Gary Oldman is the big selling name, don't expect a nuanced performance.  So goes the movie as a whole.  What you get is a typical 20-something story with the typical pathos of these young kids (nobody understands me, you're not safe around me, I don't care what anyone else says, blah-blah-blah).  My own personal peeve about this film was all the wrong people died.  Not sure if this should be blamed on the moon or the bad story in general.
B0054DFIIM|4.0|After all the fuss of make your own Kaiser Chiefs album in which you picked 10 songs from 20 and you had your very own album, now comes the real release, which has sensibly been whittled down to 13 tracks, the best 13? Well not everyone is gonna agree on that. The one thing that can be said is that the Kaiser Chiefs are still as catchy as ever and still know how to laden a song with a few hooks.     Beginning with lead single \\"Little Shocks\\" which has a great funky groove beat running through it and even surprises us with a guitar solo near the end, it's the kinda song The kaiser Chiefs do so well. Second song \\"Things Change\\" even sounds a bit like David Bowies \\"Fame\\" with some infectious beats. One of the stand out tracks is \\"Coming Up For air\\" which has a great chorus and recalls memories of \\"You can Have It All\\" from debut album \\"Employment\\". The track \\"Long Way From Celebrating\\" has a great bass line running through it as it changes from mid tempo to fast and back to mid again.     \\"Starts With Nothing\\" has a nice piano sound and a bit of rhythm that carries the song to a big middle section. \\"Out of Focus\\" has an electronic feel to it and has some big sounding beats. \\"Child of the Jago\\" has the feel of a lazy summers day about it. \\"Heard it Break\\" sounds like it's straight out of the 1980's with it's electronic synthesizer sound, it even has elements of Kraftwerk or The Human league about it! Album closer \\"If You Will Have Me\\" which is sung by Drummer and chief songwriter Nick Hodgson finishes the album on a quiet note as he sings quietly over an acoustic guitar.     With \\"The Future Is Medieval\\" the Kaiser Chiefs have shown they still know how to deliver a catchy tune and have some fun and while some people might not be happy that one of the other songs that they liked or picked wasn't included on the final album they can't complain too much as the 13 songs that did certainly catch the spirit of what the Kaiser Chiefs are all about.
B0051OZ564|3.0|The story was a bit hard to follow.  It starts out with Baby Doll being comited to an insane asylum by her stepfather.  From there it switches to Baby Doll, an orphan being send to a brothel, were all the girls have to dance to be chosen.  She recruits several girls to escape and needs to steal 4 items.  For the other girls to steal the items she distracts by dancing.  To be able to get into her dancing \\"zone\\" she falls into a fantasy world were she and the other girls are a bad a@@ team tasked with retrieving items representing those same 4 items in the \\"real\\" world.  The movie ends back in the asylum and the viewer trying to figure out what happened.  Half the movie is \\"drama\\" with forgetable acting, but the visuals are great and the fight scences (the other half of the movie) entertaining.
B0046E825G|5.0|Twilight is addictive in its nature.  It touches the basic emotions and transports us to a deeper self behind the acquired knowledge of our years.  Breaking Dawn provides for much surprise in the development of different characters and turns in the story line.  It brings life to new people and situations.  I really enjoyed it.   The difference between this book and the original book (Twilight) is that she does not let her characters suffer, which makes Breaking Dawn more fantasy and less identifiable than what I was used to.  It felt like reading a comic book instead of a Twilight Series book.  It was good, nonetheless, but I would've rather experienced the raw emotion of the previous books.  I can see Stephanie Meyer going forward into a 20 book series after the introduction of so many characters in this book.  I would read them all and watch all of their movies too!  She managed to get me hooked on Bella, Edward, and Jacob!
B002ZG993Q|5.0|This movie is damn near perfect. The mood is one of constant and increasing paranoia. George Clooney is perfect as a man who is as cold and precise as the weapons he crafts. Some have described it as a modern western and I tend to concur. Roger Ebert likened his character to that of Alain Delon's 'Le Samourai.' I tend to agree with this assessment as well. He's a spring wound too tight for too long.<br /><br />Clooney's character is reminiscent of Charles Bronson in 'The Mechanic.' (another film you should watch0 Cool, methodical and detached yet aching for connection to others. Indeed, the scene where Clooney asks his client about the distance to target, caliber is reminiscent of a scene in 'The Mechanic.'<br /><br />The setting is perfect. Picture perfect actually. The narrow streets of the Italian, mountain village add to the feeling of claustrophobia. Shadows abound. Lots of corners for assailants to hide in. There isn't a wasted shot in the entire movie. Many could be used for post cards.<br /><br />The casting is first rate. The Priest, who 'sees everything.' Clara, the local prostitute, Mathilda his contact and Pavel, his employer are all cast to perfection. Even the local mechanic. The cast is surprisingly small. There probably isn't but ten characters in this movie.<br /><br />Anybody expecting Jason Bourne will be disappointed. Too bad. This is grown up movie for grown ups.<br /><br />By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B000JMKO3C|4.0|I came to this book with my own prejudices.  Coelho was himself in a mental hospital and he ventures (or ventured) deep into dark practices: occultism.  However, his books sell good and this book is now a movie.  So I put my prejudism aside and decided to buy the book and support an the author.  His writing style might not translate good from Portuguese (native) to English, but the plot is rich in character discovery.  Each person dwells on their own insanity and present a picture a priori.  This is the best portion of the book.  One imagines each life, each suffering, each turning point, and that moment when the mind opens the door to that sweet escape.  Sometimes the book seems to be more character development than plot, but the detail in the character is well worth the sacrifice.    It's an upper!  one feels good after finish reading.  Very refreshing!  I think it's worth reading on a snowy afternoon. I do not think that the author deserves  5 stars because the shortness of the book translated in a diminished plot that lacks detail in comparison to the characters.  This book might be challenging to radical Christians.  The book heavily disqualifies God and glorifies occultist practices.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|Yes, this is another vampire movie, but it proves to be so much more.  The film is shot in a lovely dark color that lends remarkably to the overall theme of the move.  The movie was very well cast.  There were no unnecessary characters, and the villian was just as beautiful as the hero.  If you like this sort of thing, the movie won't disappoint you!
B00338QENI|5.0|This was our book of the month in the book club but I gained much more than I bargained for.  This story has a detailed research project as well as the human factor  that enriches this discussion.  To finish it off, Skloot provides an interesting discussion on the ethics behind tissue ownership.  I was surprised, no!  HORRORIZED, to find out that the little 'paper' I signed when donating blood were actualy releases of my blood to be used in research for as long as my cells are alive.  If they achieve inmortality, they might clone me indefinetely.  Each of those cells contains my DNA yet I'm not able to PROFIT from ANY discovery that's done by using MY cells, according to the Supreme Court.  Yet companies are able to claim all the credit and get all th money for MY cells.  It's easy to identify oneself with Deborah and even Zakkariah.  This was a great read!!
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Movie Soundtracks & Film Scores have played an integral role during cinematic moments in film history by transforming a great movie into an award winning motion picture. Time after time, the music chosen provides the effective chemistry to accomplish the director's objective of bringing out the full emotion and depth of an actor's character identity.<br /><br />The 3 CD Blade Runner Trilogy is another innovative and popular movie soundtrack by Greek composer Vangelis Papathanassiou. Directed by Ridley Scott and produced by Michael Deeley, Blade Runner the movie remains a classic film with a long list of popular actors including Harrison Ford, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos.<br /><br />Vangelis is an award winning musician with a long list of movie soundtracks to his credit. The Chariots of Fire movie score is one of high acclaim of course, but Vangelis also composed the entire music score for the epic science fiction thriller Blade Runner. For those who have watched the movie you know the film score by Vangelis is a vital component to the full drama viewers experience while watching this movie.<br /><br />Over the years New Age music has been the perfect music genre for great movie soundtracks, so we can expect this to continue in the future. I feature many musicians who have produced film scores over the years so I wonder which artist will be the next to compose an Academy Award winning movie soundtrack for the film industry.<br /><br />The Blade Runner YouTube song video from the motion picture features a pivotal moment during the movie storyline by using the song Love Theme by Vangelis. The 3 CD Trilogy Series by Vangelis is a timeless classic.
B002VUFKG6|4.0|Contrary to her previous book, this book reaches out to two specific groups of people: commitmentphoebes and women who do not wish to have children.  I used to find myself in the first category by choice and the second category by destiny and can relate to her writing.  The fear and love for the same person is overwhelming.  As for the second category, I found it difficult to read because my personal experience had been so painful.  Sometimes reading her life experience and choices was apalling and it was easy to categorize her as self-serving.  However, people who have not experienced the feelings of fear of commitment probably feel the same resistance when reading the first portion of the book.  Understanding that ohers are experiencing different fears as women, brought me to a deeper understanding of her book.  The value for me was being able to read about my fears represented and a good historical review of marriage: shocking!    Reader beware: some ideas presented about Christianity are not only wrong but show what can happen when there is not a god understanding of the Bible and the beginnings of the church.
B000A2IPP0|4.0|Even though this is the infamous 2002 re-release version of Spielbergs E.T.(released originally June/82) which has had some CGI tweaking done to it and some footage taken and added,I still found it enjoyable.The said tweaking of E.T. is chiefly of him up close at various points from when we first meet him and inside Elliot's house,otherwise its all the same.Like Lucas with Star Wars,Spielberg took the \\"it's mine and I can do what I want with it\\" path,which it is and he has every right to do so.I am usually the first person to deride such cavalier attitudes when it comes to changing the original artistic intent and integrity of a movie.You just do NOT,period,and if you do you at least make available the original along side the newer version for comparison ,like Lucas finally did with Star Wars and Spielberg did after many years with Close Encounters.At one point both version were available(in Canada)but as of this writing that set is long gone to the Yukon;that's out of print for those in Newark.So what we have to work with is this version and I must grudgingly admit it is good.The CGI tweaking and insertion of newer footage is kept to a minimum and if you didn't know where to look you might not even notice it.<br />The story is well known.In California,in a typical suburban environment,out in the local woods one evening aliens are about.They are on a gathering expedition when one wanders off too far from its ship.When government agents come onto the scene in their pick ups the little E.T. flees to his spacecraft but he is too late and becomes stranded.The alien wanders into a backyard and into a shed just as Elliot is bringing in a pizza.He runs in the house but no one believes him.The next night he camps out and encounters his worst fear;a squat,funny shaped alien,or something, from who knows where.Elliot lures it into the house and into his room.One by one his brother,then sister are introduced to E.T.Right away it is apparent this strange creature has bonded deeply with Elliot who becomes his sworn protector and feels everything the alien does.<br />Through many cloak and dagger moments and just plain luck,little E.T. just missesbythismuch,getting seen by the mother.When she does finally see the creature it is terribly sick.E.T. with Elliots help has already fashioned a crude electronic device to contact his fellow aliens but being out of his natural element for so long has finally taken its toll.<br />The government people at the beginning of the film have been searching the area high and low and they finally pin E.T.'s location down and \\"invade\\" Elliot's home.They attempt to save the creatures life but to no avail.As Elliot spends some last moments with his dear friend now in a cryo-tube,E.T. suddenly pops to life.With the help of his brother he smuggles E.T. out but is pursued by local and government authorities.Elliot,his brother and three other friends on bicycles out outmaneuver them all and get the alien back to the original landing area just in time.E.T.bids Elliot and his family a tearful farewell.<br />E.T.is just a delight to watch,and really talks to the kid inside all of us.Even the head government agent admits that he was like Elliot when he was young and has been searching for answers all of his life;an atypical response but a nice one which fits the mood beautifully.E.T. himself was certainly one heck of a creation and Spielberg and company did a masterful job of bringing him to life on the big screen.Henry Thomas as Elliot and little Drew Barrymore as sister Gertie are stand outs.Spielberg had a certain vision of suburbia back in the 70s and 80s that while was refreshing to see was still a little tainted.His portrayal of tweens and teens as wisecracking Abbot and Costello`s,in front of and interacting with,parents was a little beyond believable.<br />Technically the DVD has been transferred into a 1:85:1 a/r and is clear and crisp.Extras include an audio track of the score,the trailer,a cast reunion,photosand a space tour.<br />All in all an enjoyable Spielberg film.The 2002 version includes minimal tweaks of E.T.with some CGI and some added and subtracted footage.It's not the original but it's the next best thing.I hope Universal re-releases E.T. in both versions again soon.Recommended.All in all an enjoyable Spielberg film.The 2002 version includes minimal tweaks of E.T.with some CGI and some added and subtracted footage.It's not the original but it's the next best thing.I hope Universal re-releases E.T. in both versions again soon.Recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks and this book did not disappoint.  When you thought it was predictable, the book twists and turns on different directions.  I specially enjoyed the way he gets in the character's heads.  The mad man and the almost mad woman come up very strong in the emotional side.  You can almost feel the anxiety in the mad man and feel the fear in her.  You can smell the sunset and sweat while she rides a bike.  His descriptions are detailed and thought provoking.  The story feels like an episode of Law & Order sometimes yet other times, Sparks takes you to a world of anxious fears and love and romance.  It touches raw emotions that are contradictory and hidden.  I enjoyed how he captured them: very close to reaity when it comes to these types of relationships.  The shame makes you imagine a weak woman yet she shines with energy.  Very well captured!
0316236535|1.0|I give this book 0 stars.  This is the most horrible, mean-spirited book I have ever read.  Do not let children read it.   Remove it from your libraries.      E. Lund, Ph. D.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a ride!  I picked up the book reluctantly as my friend bought her first Kindle and I volunteered to read a book together.  The description was misleading about \\"sci-fi\\" and wording that did not appeal to me at all, BUT the book is just AWESOME!!  This is a book directed to generation NOW: the reality of reality shows along with adventure, commitment fears, obligation, family dynamics, first loves.  This book has it all.    The plot flows so easily and the characters are relatable.  The bread guy might seem geeky but he turns out to be quite a character! even enemies are admirable on their strengths and weaknesses.  She, of course, is AMAZING!  Girl Power yet Naive.  Who cannot love this sweet character!      If you're in doubt, let me tell you: I read 200 pages the first time I touched this one && I'm afraid of opening book 2 because I might not stop until I'm done.  Go for it!
B003YP0BI4|5.0|I bought the album as soon as it was released without hearing a song....one of only a few groups I will do this....well I was not disappointed in the least bit.  The album starts with a different sound of \\"Satellite 15....The Final Frontier\\".  Not too hot on the first section of the song, but as it starts into \\"The Final Frontier\\" the album starts a great trip through some of the best songs they have put out in a while.  The CD has some of the best songs since, well \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\", which was great as well.  \\"Coming Home\\" had a very special feeling to me, as I am now retired military and the lyrics really touched me.  I love the rest of the album.  The lyrics and music are great and Bruce is as great as ever!!!  UP THE IRONS!!!!  Saw two of the their shows on the first leg of their tour...Dallas (in the pit) and San Antonio (Lower level second row).  Wish they would of done more off this album on the first leg, as they did on the second leg.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Everybody with a 401K needs to read this book and decide if their faith is still in the hands of organized market funds with little to NO regulatory oversight.  It's an eye-opener on how traders and CEOs have no incentive to make good decisions for Joe-Consumer.  No matter how much money they loose, they still had a bonus.  If they jump ship from a firm and manage a fund, they go from hundreds of thousands dollar salaries to millions a year with NO consequences.  Hmmm yeah.... I do not personally believe in unlimited freedom when it comes to another individual handling my hard earned money.    The book is written in Michael Lewis fashion that readers that love him, like me, enjoy.  He knows how Wall Street works and explores in an almost doctoral way the actions of big players in this disaster.  Lewis presents a case for how little oversight the markets have and how much speculative trading is happening with OUR money.  I didn't give him a 5 star because the book leaves you with an epilogue that was a bit removed from the book.
0143119419|5.0|Excellent read in my opinion. very enlightening on certain trades, methods, companies and individuals down through the years. Liked it a lot.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|John Hughes's \\"The Breakfast Club\\" may be the defining teen movie of the 80s. The way Hughes culminates representatives of different high school cliques -- including the way they dress, the way they talk, the way they eat, and the surprising way they all eventually connect -- and makes something meaningful and entertaining out of it provides one of the best-written film scripts, along with an impeccable cast and soundtrack. Note: The R-rating comes from occassional language and sex-related comments, which shouldn't be taken lightly. The film also emphasizes (as seen in other Hughes films) teen angst, yet paints an honest portrait of what it must have been like to be a teenager in the 80s.     The DVD came out great, with crisp picture quality and sound.
0061733199|3.0|This book has some great chapters, but encompassing \\"all survival techniques for all situations\\" is just too ambitious and the book suffers in several chapters because of the scope that is being attempted.    the chapters on trapping and snares, knots, and some others are perhaps sufficient. but the other chapters are just too vague to be of service. I would have preferred more detail in a narrower list of topics.
B00003CWTI|4.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"Magnolia\\" is one of the most powerful, intersecting, and profane movies I've ever seen. I had mixed feeling about it the first time I saw it, considering it's back-and-forth emphasis on various characters, as well as its language and occassional startling elements. Eventually, though, the film started to grow on me. To me, it's not only a film about the notions of coincidence versus destiny, but about the effects of past sins on a future generation, and about the choices each of us makes in our lives. Again, it's a powerful portrayal, yet it paints a fascinating and compelling picture of peoples' rises and falls, redemption, despair, and the Biblical-related theme of intersection. Well-crafted and brilliantly-acted, along with a terrific score by Jon Brion (\\"Punch-Drunk Love,\\" \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\") and songs by Aimee Mann.
B0037471TE|3.0|The Bourne Identity, by Robert Ludlum, was one of my longtime-wishlisted, finally-a-bargain-price read on my Kindle when I purchased it, and I really, really wanted to like it. But, I found it slow and tedious, and a struggle to finish. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for reading it? Maybe I was expecting more Matt Damon? I'm not sure. But this was one book I'd rate only 'okay', and not as enjoyable as the movie was, for me. In the movie, I really liked how Damon created a vulnerable, yet necessarily strong character, which I kind of got in the book, just not as clearly. For the zillions of Ludlum fans, sorry... this one just wasn't my cup of tea.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|This is an exceptional feel-good movie, as well as a beyond-sports movie. Great performances, an intelligent script, and a good balance of pathos and entertainment.

B002ZG99A4|1.0|I enjoy butt-kicking, testosterone laden films as any girl does, but I just couldn't handle the thin plot and horrible acting of, what should have been the greatest bad ass movie to date. A majority of the acting was as wooden as Stallone's and Rourke's face-jobs. You could tell that the younger generation of actors like Statham and Li were respecting their elders by not out doing them, but come on! Zayas's Latin American accent was so bad he was bleeding the Bronx all over the place, and the Stallone and Rourke have had so much cosmetic surgery they couldn't enunciate their lines clearly. And what the hell was The Arnold doing in that cameo when he should have been fixing the California State budget or at least doing his house keeper(s)? The standouts: amazingly, not only can Lundgren build a bridge with his engineering brain, but his performance was edgy, subtle and three dimensional; Crew's wasn't given enough screen time to develop his character but here's hoping they let him in II; after all these years in the US, Li's American accent still sucks, but I love the little guy regardless; and Statham rocks my world in any film, I just hope Stallone let him off of the leash in II. Lastly, Stallone...well of course he's still The Man, but he must have mainline steroids straight into his biceps and brain. Doesn't Stallone know that we love him and that not every picture and scene has to be his own private love letter to himself? He's a great director, Rocky showed us that, but his need to pose never gets elevated to camp (which would have at least redeemed the film), and instead left me wanting the 103 minutes of my life back.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Yet again Moning delivers a truly unexpected but great ending to a series as she has done with the Highlander series. Mac and Barrons will both ensure that you can't put this book down to see how it all plays out. With Dani and Mac's family to keep her grounded, Mac tries to keep up with all the new info and stay ahead of the Book, which seems to have it out for her. With V'lane, the Unseelie King, and the Concubine all telling her different ways to go, who will she trust? A no-holds-barred read guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.
078322947X|5.0|This has been a favorite of mine for many years. I am thrilled to learn that it may be released in Blu Ray. The musical score is superb. The gritty no nonsense plot and screen play reminds me of the great Bogart movies.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I enjoyed the director's previous works (300, Watchmen). The trailers for Sucker Punch looked interesting.     Popped the Blu Ray in last night. The movie got off to an interesting start, but once it went into the fantasy world, I lost interest. By about half way through (1 hour in), I stopped watching. Not sure if I will ever finish it.     I couldn't buy into the premise, and especially in the fantasy world, I couldn't care less about the heroine. Some of the action scenes were very nice (some were lame too, especially when Baby Doll first goes into the fantasy world and meets Scott Glenn's character).     Now the rest of the movie could be great. I just couldn't make it that far. In hindsight, I should have rented this movie instead of buying it. Wanted to like it.    I was hoping the critics were wrong on this one (pretty bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes). In my opinion, they weren't too unfair.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|This has been my favorite show since Season 1. If you're new to Lost, this is (in my opinion) one of the most creative, well written, and well thought out shows ever made. It's worth watching from the beginning, as a lot of themes won't mean much to you unless you watched from the beginning.     This blu ray set is great. I have not dabbled at all with the extras (blacklight flashlight, game board, etc.). I couldn't care less for them.      The blu ray discs are in fold out pamphlets. These pamphlets are stored in a thin, tall, cardboard case. They are not in your typical blu ray cases, and the size is awkward for storage. I actually like how the discs are stored, it is easy to take out a season, open the pamphlet, and take the disc you need. Keep in mind, if you have a blu ray or DVD collection at home, the cardboard box will not likely fit in with your collection.     I bought it so I could own the best TV show ever. With this purchase, I have now been able to rewatch this show in stunning HD. It really makes a difference in terms of the picture and sound of the show. The quality is great. I couldnt be happier with it.
0375842209|5.0|I had to read this book as a school assignment. So starting to read it, I was hardly excited. Once I started reading though, I was astonished by how much I loved it. I think the author is an amazing writer. His style is unlike anything I've ever read before. The book gives you information in flashes- much like the movie inception. Though it's not a mystery, it keeps you guessing about what will really happen, as what it shows you in a flashback or flashforward is a twisted view. Narrated by Death, I excpeted it to be a little weird and morbid. It was anything but. The author's amazing use of symbolism, understanding of the time period, and downright understanding of human nature was very eye opening. I think this has to be the best book I've ever read.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Plenty of extra features and ease of use, the DVDs are very well done, and should serve as an example for how TV shows should be presented. There are behind the scenes interviews, commentaries, and even a special feature on the extra disc that shows all of the openings on all of the shows.  My only problem was that one of the discs doesn't play as though it were blank, and one show on another disc is also missing, even though it's listed in the menu.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|I understand why they ended it the way they did, but it still doesn't make it any less annoying.    Stargate Universe was a great series, nothing like the original action scifi that was SG1 and Atlantis. It was a deep character driven scifi drama, I'll admit it wasn't what I expected when I watched the first episode but I soon came around.    Definatly worth watching even with the sucky ending.
0857680986|5.0|This is a wonderful new edition of Loomis's classic work.  It's a very high quality book and it seems (as far as I can tell) to exactly match the original.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a really good, well written book.  The setting is WWII, the story is narrated by \\"death\\".  It is told from the perspective of the German people which is interesting.  I really liked the character development.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Note: there is a petition on the internet asking Netflix to continue the series.  Find it, sign it.<br /><br />GREAT CHARACTERS--ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW THEM<br />I was under-whelmed with the first year, as it was broadcasted.  In part, nothing ever got resolved within an episode, instead each episode ended with a cliff-hanger.  The show just seemed dreary.  Moreover, I did not immediately &#34;take&#34; to the characters.  In most series characters develop over several seasons.  When viewers have become invested in the characters, then the character-heavy episodes begin to become frequent, usually in the third season of a series.  SGU was character-heavy from episode 1---which is simply not interesting if you don't like the characters, and don't care about what happens to them.  Initially, I found none of the major characters likable.<br /><br />BEST WATCHED IN BINGES<br />Viewing the first year on DVD , 3 or 4 episodes at a time, is an entirely different experience.  Events develop and become satisfyingly resolved.  After having seen the entire season (or series) several times, I become invested with the characters, so they mattered to me, so the story becomes a much richer experience.  Now, I really like all of the characters.  Still, it is a tad disappointing that even in Stargate Universe, there's more &#34;romance&#34; than science fiction.<br /><br />RUSHED SECOND SEASON--I WANTED MORE DEPTH<br />The second year is much more fast-paced, and more exciting.  There are cliff-hangers which detract from some individual episodes.  But instead of annoyance that nothing was ever resolved within an episode, my impression was that the story felt &#34;rushed&#34; in the second year.  I would have appreciated another episode with the seed ship, perhaps several episodes about the &#34;simulated reality&#34; to develop the story better, and several more episodes with the &#34;Destiny-survivor descendant colonies&#34;.<br /><br />ADEQUATE ENDING<br />As to the ending, in my opinion it was as good as it could be.  No ending which allowed for the possibility of the story being continued, with or without the same cast, would have been really satisfying.  In a continuation, any or all of the old crew could &#34;wake up&#34;, and/or an entirely new cast could &#34;gate-in&#34;, to replace the old crew.  Maybe SGU will be continued, in a year, or 5 years, or 10 years---the well designed ending allows for almost any possibility.  Of course, I really hope for a continuation soon, with the same cast.<br /><br />THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION SERIES EVER MADE<br />Even with these caveats, I'd rate Stargate Universe as THE best science fiction series ever made, given that it lasted only 2 years.  Sure, there are dozens at least equally good individual SG1, SGA, and Startrek episodes, but most of those are exceptions among the drek.  In most historical sci-fi series (SGU, SGA, Startrek), a 33% rate (1 in 3) of &#34;really good&#34; episodes is about as good as it gets, indeed some whole seasons of previous sci-fi series (such as Startrek Voyager) were duds (ST-V remains one of my favorites regardless of the high rate of duds).  SGU ran 75--80% &#34;really good&#34; episodes.  I count only three &#34;duds&#34; among the 40 episodes, and even those aren't really bad, but rather are &#34;fillers&#34; which fit no particular place in the overall story.<br /><br />GROWS ON YOU<br />I still prefer the imaginative sci-fi of SG1 and SGA.  Yet SGU stands up to re-viewing better.  Although I love the weird aliens, strange worlds, bizarre astro-physical phenonmena, and battles in space---once you've seen an SG1 or SGA episode several times, it begins to get a bit thin.  In contrast, SGU grows on you.  In a third season, SGU might have evolved into the perfect combination of &#34;real characters&#34;, great acting, and real sci-fi.  Indeed, the premise of exploring galaxies not seeded (with humans) by the Ancients, together with less expensive computer graphic, couldhave allowed for option of introducing non-human aliens on a scale not previously seen in a TV series.  The &#34;descendant colonies&#34; could have provided a bridge in many ways, even for a spin off (SGD).<br /><br />THE SYFYLITIC NETWORK<br />I assume that I am not the first to note that the Sci-Fi Network has become the SyFylitic Network, there's hardly any Sci-Fi left.<br /><br />&#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.have allowed for option of introducing non-human aliens on a scale not previously seen in a TV series.

B004X75RK4|5.0|This is the first movie I rented on Amazon, and I was very excited to find it at a great price.  I was watching several Sandra Bullock movies one day and realized that I didn't have this one in my collection.  I found it here and enjoyed it several times during the 48 hour rental.  Wonderful experience!
B004CIIXC8|1.0|I suppose if you just looked at the acting, this movie would be worthy of being in the Criterion Collection of films but I don't watch a movie merely for the acting. I watch it for a cohesive story and plot line, which this film sorely lacks. You keep watching because you hope something is going to happen but nothing really does. You're just following around this troubled girl around in her daily (albeit screwed up) English life. I got to the end like, \\"That's it?\\" No real ending, no real point to the story itself. Not sure what people saw in this movie. If this were a book, I would never have finished it out of frustration.
B004EC5IUW|3.0|I wont rate this blu ray based on the movie itself. I won't explain what Evangelion is or what the movie is about. If you want that info, then a review of a BD on Amazon is not the right place. That's only my opinion.    First of all, I bought the first movie last year and it was amazing. However when I got this new BD a few days ago, my first impression was completely different, kind of disappointed. I was expecting something better but it was worst.     The extra content was average, nothing memorable. The package was poor, the orange outer box is a weak attempt to make something nice. It does not even close !    It is bad? No. But compared with the first movie, it is a 3 starts. Anyway, if you buy this, you will get a decent BD of an excellent movie for a good price.

014241722X|2.0|I was in a hurry to catch a plane when I saw a new title by Grisham. Reflexively I picked it up and paid for it. I do not think my flight was off the tarmac before I finished it. Really? That's it? You are kidding right? Where is part two?   The book ends just about where the plot should start to develop. The book ends with sinister characters hanging in the wind with no discernible effect on the plot, or for that matter any reason why they existed in the first place.   If Grisham had a 13 year old son who found his father's word processor and sat down to pay homage to dad one weekend, this is what I would expect. And it would not take him much longer than a weekend.  I have considered John Grisham's talent on the wane the last few novels, now I think it has been eclipsed by lack of effort. This book is an insult to those of us who have filled his coffers with coppers ever since The Firm.   I will now go down the aisle, and skip the G section in the airport bookstore. If I see one of his new novels abandoned on a seat at the gate, I'll read it, but I am not giving him any more of my hard earned money.  What really made me mad was a long flight with nothing to read. Really, its over?

They were sadly disappointed and said they did not like it at all. It was hard for them to follow. There were cars killed off. They were trying to kill Mcqueen and Towmater, my kids favorite characters. Which saddened both my kids and induced anxiety in them. The main characters from the last movie had very brief parts this time. They could have done so much more here! I am not sure what they were thinking. They lost more fans here than gained. The politcal issue of alternate fuel is lost on the little kiddo's as it should be! VERY DIAPPOINTED to say the least! Wish I could give it zero stars!
0670022411|1.0|This has got to be one of the most boring and unbeliveable stories I've read in a long time.  I cannot believe this ended up on Amazon's 2011 best books of the year.  I'll be looking at that category with reservation next time.  The ONLY reason I finished the book was because I listened to it on Audible.com and the Narrator was good and handled the accents nicely and because I didn't have to waste my time sitting down to read it....I was driving places instead.  But I did want to finish it quickly if only to rip the bandaid off quickly and get it over with.  I need not of bothered.  I could have stopped anytime as the ending was just as unfulfilling.<br /><br />Boring has been established well by other reviewers, but the story is also just soooo unbelievable.  I know its Sci Fi, but I just could not suspend my disbelief, and I can usually do that pretty easily (I am not hard nosed, I liked Twilight after all).  A decent Sci Fi story makes you believe, if only for a moment, that you are immersed in a world where, for example, rabbits can talk, aliens desend to take over the Earth, or Vampires and Witches exist.  This author did not accomplish that.  I found it very difficult to believe that \\"The Humans\\" didn't catch wind of the existence of Vampire, Witches, and Demons in their world.  I mean blue sparks coming out of Diana's fingertips that she is unaware of...... Vampire predatory instincts that cannot be controlled around Humans.....a house that talks, moans and groans when it has visitors.  Their is very little explanation as to how \\"The Humans\\" are shielded from the blatant magic going on.  Secondly, everything just comes soooo easily to Diana.  She resists using her powerful magic for over 30 years and has no control over it when she does use it, yet magic and theories just come so easily.  Things appear out of thin air, ideas pop in her head with little thought, and after little trying, she can time travel with her lover without fully understanding what she is doing.<br /><br />I also smell a trilogy coming on.  The ending was abrupt and ended with a cliff hanger.  At least I think it ended with a cliff hanger, as I was in such a rush to just finish the darn story I didn't fully pay attention, not did I want to.  I think I'd rather fall off the cliff than read the 2nd installment.  No thanks.I also smell a trilogy coming on.  The ending was abrupt and ended with a cliff hanger.

0307474275|5.0|Hello. I am a 14 year old kid who had heard great things about this book. So, I decided to pick it up and read it. I figured it was a relatively long book and being a teenager I have a busy schedule. I thought that it would be a good summer read that would take me a couple weeks to read. I was wrong.<br /><br />I could not put this book down. The history was so interesting that I forced myself to pursue further research on the topic to ensure it was not fictional. I was stunned to find out that most, if not all, of the historical references were factual. It makes me sad to read some of the reviews that commented on how the history was false. Some of the history may be altered or inaccurate, but this book is FICTION. After reading it though, I look at things differently.<br /><br />Church isn't something I enjoy and this book didn't make me eager to go to church at the end. However, I now take a different perspective on religion. The characters in this book who are pious mostly have had hard lives or are in need of something new. I realize that, even though Jesus may not be the man who walked on water or was virgin born, he has changed and inspired many lives. The thought of faith to me can come in many different forms and this book showed that to me.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone!
9063692560|5.0|The book is very easy to read and can teach you the basics of service design very easily in the first third. Then, even if you are a more advanced Service Designer, you will still learn a lot of cool things in the second third with 25 practical tools to help you design services.

The characters were easy to like or dislike or even despise, which, of course, means a really well developed character.  The stories were really interesting and gritty.  It figures that this was cancelled way too soon.  But then I really loved Firefly and that got the early axe as well.  Get this video and the first season too - they're worth owning.
B0041YI4ZO|5.0|Hi, i enjoy the movie intitled Ip 3 very much because it is funny.IT IS FUNNY TO SEE BRUCE LEE'S MASTER IN THE SAME AGES.
0062060554|2.0|This is the first time I have done a review here on Amazon. I just finished this book, which I was eager to get into. I made myself finish a book I was previously reading (\\"Day After Tomorrow\\"), hardly waiting to get into \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\". I won't go into a summary of the story as it is well documented here. But I felt the ending was rushed and there wasn't a lot of depth to the book. My first reaction to the book upon finishing it, was it was a story that you would see on a Lifetime channel movie. Although I didn't guess at the complete ending, some things were easily guessed long before the ending. If you want a book for summer light reading, this would be a good choice to take to the beach.
0140277447|2.0|This is really not a book. It's more of an oddly presented description, in general, of the terrible events in Nanking in late 1937/early 1938. It is a difficult read, there is no flow, and the narrative style is quite stilted. I would not recommend it.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|When i first encountered this book I quickly thought that it would be another Twilight book with the whole mysteriousness and Bella ranting. I am a Twilight fan, however, this book was far from it. I could not putit down. I read it in about two days and then I found myself buying the sequel and now I am waiting for for the next oneto come out. I really liked that the author kept both Sam and Graces' point of view. I am Also a sucker for a forbidden love story with a backstory. All of the charcters tied in well together and you will fall in love with Grace and Sam. Please read this book if you are a YA fan. It will not dissappoint. Great job Maggie Stiefvater. Your books kept me fascinated and hungry for more. (:
630587493X|5.0|I ordered this movie from Amazon because my experience with Amazon has always been great. It showed up exactly when it said it would, it was way cheap, and the DVD was in perfect condition. To top it all off, the movie was great too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although I don't fully agree with the whole \\"Reaping and Hunger games\\" Thing. This book was great . People who whine about cruelty and not understanding why no one did anything.. Its a book. Its what gets you involved and want to continue to keep reading. I just bought the second book and cant wait to begin reading it. Author was very detail and had a great imagination.  The ending and the True/ fake  romance was just what it needed for you wanting more. Thanks
067144901X|5.0|This is the most adorable book! It has a silly rhyme - \\"the cow says moo, the sheep says baa, three singing pigs say la la la, no that's not right, three singing pigs say oink day and night\\". It introduces the baby to animal sounds in a lyrical manner. My 6 month old adores this book. Thank you Sandra Boynton!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The game starts and looks great, it even plays fine for thirty seconds on my eLocity A7.  But it locks up, becomes unresponsive, and a force quit is required.  Afterwards it won't even start up unless you clear user data.  When you have software incompatibility issues, it's possible the problem is machine specific, but my A7 runs everything else just fine.  Given the other lockup reports I think this app is buggy.  I really hope PopCap gets it together for future Android releases.    Amazon displayed their great customer service (as always) and re-funded purchase price.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|Truly a brilliant album. I would go as far to say it may hold the spot as this generation's \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" Excellent in production, technically brilliant, and showcasing true song writing talent. It wouldn't be a stretch to call this a concept album, except the concept is a truly original sound: a synthesis of all Animal Collectives previous efforts and a smattering of styles, genre elements, and musical ideas. You've never heard anything like \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" before. A record that really stands out of the pack.     Animal Collective have encapsulated a new generation's hopes and fears, and it sounds amazing.
B004SBX112|5.0|Don't know why the rating is so low. Yes the updates normally take a bit longer than the android market but this game is just amazing.
B004WPYNY8|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I love Symphony X.  Their blend of distorted guitars, keyboards, slower songs, and melodic interludes made them a staple of progressive metal fans everywhere.  However, Paradise Lost saw them almost completely ditch the symphony aspect of their songs.  This trend continues with Iconoclast.    The problem with Iconoclast is that all the songs sound the same.  Like that one reviewer said, the musicianship by itself is great and the songs are technically proficient but they lack a charm to them.  I've listened to the whole album three times and if you were to play me a part of 'The End of Innocence', 'Dehumanized', 'The lord of Chaos', 'Iconoclast', 'Children of a Faceless God', or 'Electric Messiah' I wouldn't be able to tell you which is which (you son of a bitch).  The keyboards have definitely taken a backseat and the melodic sections are all but gone.  Songs like The Accolade, Communion and the Oracle, Pharaoh, or Egypt are replaced with different variations of Inferno (unleash the fire).     Did I mention the lyrics are pretty bad? Example: hit the switch, you son of a bitch *facepalm* (and why are they stealing Elton John lyrics?)    I'm being pretty harsh but there is still a lot to like with this album.  Clocking in at almost 90 minutes long it was almost inevitable to feel overcooked and lacking variation.  It's a little disappointing that Michael Romeo and gang have resorted to heavier stuff that sounds more like Testament than anything else.  Listening to this album is like eating a box of chocolates that all taste the same.  The first few ones will taste good and each piece by itself might be fine but after a while you'll get a stomach ache.  It's best taken in small doses.    EDIT: I decided to bump the rating up to a 4/5.  I did this because in all consciousness, this album is still better than 90% of the crap that gets put out there.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|Product arrived on time.  The quality of the DVD was excellent.  I've always enjoyed this film, but seldom does it show on TV.  I'm glad I purchased this DVD
B002LESNES|1.0|This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  Now that Amazon is offering 5,000 streaming titles to Amazon Prime members for free, I've been thinking about buying a wireless router and a new Blu-ray player so I can stream to my television.  But I'm reconsidering based on the way Amazon has handled this title.  They're making a poor-quality, blurry pan-and-scan version available for free streaming.  You also have the option of watching a decent-quality print in widescreen, but you have to pay for the privilege.  What a scam.  If this is Amazon's strategy to entice customers into using their streaming service, then I'll stick with buying the titles I want on DVD when they go on sale.
0307272702|5.0|So what if you wake up one morning and find that everything you thought you know about nutrition might be wrong?  That's what reading this book and Gary's previous book Good Calories, Bad Calories was like.  I read this one first, then went back and read the former.  That was six weeks and 30 pounds ago.  Gary is a master of reviewing all of the literature available and making sense out of it.  He explains in detail why the old adage calories in, calories does not make sense.  It is no wonder that we have an obesity epidemic in the US.  Highly recommend this book to anyone struggling with weight issues, or medical professionals trying to make sense out of why their patient's can't lose the weight the so desperately need.  Truly a breakthrough book.
B004WJREMW|4.0|I'm not a fan of Sir Paul McCartney's solo works (never understood what's so great about \\"Pipes of Peace\\", for instance), but \\"Coming Up\\" has always been the most exciting and cool song he ever released as a solo artist to me. It's cool that this new release includes the complete live version of \\"Coming Up\\" at Glasgow but, as the owner of the original maxi single, I really miss the final audience chant (\\"Paul McCartney!\\") which Macca turns into \\"Kenny Dalglish!\\". It added a lot of excitement to the recording and it has been removed in this new remaster.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I received these items in less than a week from the day of purchase. Thank you for sending them so promptly!! Purchased them for a gift so, did not open and review them but am confident in the quailty of them.

B004SEUJK0|5.0|Great experience with this purchase. I am collecting movies that I've loved throughout the years and I am very happy.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I wanted to go wireless at the heath center while I workout and listen to audiobooks.  I first got a 6th generation ipod nano and then the iOS bluetooth adapter and the Motorola  S-10 HD bluetooth headset.  I have absolutely no complaints.  The combo is great.
B002ZG9968|5.0|I think this was a sleeper when it came out but it is cute and funny. Alex O'Loughlin holds his own with Jennifer and has good comedic timing. This is well worth seeing.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I think this is, by far, one of the most underrated films in a long time.  Not only are the special effects awesome, and the casting brilliant, but also, the storyline is really very interesting.  It was very crafty, how they interwove sci-fi and dragon lore from Viking history into this!  Yes, the plot is complicated, but not so much that people can't follow it; have a little faith in us, Tom Keogh.  We're not ignorant.      Then again, I always DO like the movies that the critic hate.     Rock on, cast and creators of Outlander.  You really outdid yourself with this one!
B004FOA84A|4.0|great game. some puzzles are too difficult, (I needed to look up some of the answers.)  FYI, I just updated my version,  Warning!!!  it no longer launches. HTC EVO
0439023521|5.0|I cant remember the last time I read a book so captivating. I read nearly nonstop for 3 1/2 days, finishing all 3 books. As soon as I finished one I purchased the next.
0062060554|4.0|If there's ever a novel that should be read in one, frantic sitting, this is it. Watson's thriller about a woman struggling with reterograde amnesia is peppered with shocking twists and revelations. The only drawbacks are that some of the revelations seem too abrupt and over-dramatic, and the characters (even the narrator) seem flat and unpersonable while taken out of the action. The end in particular seems somewhat unsatisifying. Overall, an engrossing psychological thriller.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|One of the best animes i have ever seen I saw online and when i saw it was coming out on dvd i had to own it ever since i bought it i can't stop watching it awesome anime
B001XJEKGC|4.0|I bought this shortly after getting the Cream reunion concert DVD recorded at the Royal Albert Hall. I like that one better, the sound quality is better. But this one is still enjoyable. With the larger number of musicians on this one and the mix, sometimes Eric's guitar playing is not as clearly discernible and sounds a bit muddled and overpowered by the organ. Still, there are some great moments here and plenty of good songs to listen to.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I just watched this again after getting it on DVD - had it on videotape but we don't have a VCR any more.  Still finding new things to laugh at!  The plot is entirely classic - cabal of archvillans, assassination plot, rising star rivals established favorite, returning to roots to find you don't fit in, keen young investigative reported trying to save the hero, etc., all superimposed on the (inherently somewhat humorous) world of male modeling.  It's not gripping drama but a great choice when you want an undemanding movie to laugh at.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|although i wasnt sure at first this is an amazing series of books. i m  not ususally keen on these kind of books but since i have recently read the maximum ride series i love books that are action packed with adventure this series is a must read along with the maximum ride series!

0142410705|4.0|This is my first John Green book (after viewing all of his and his brother's videos on YouTube). I loved it. I totally identified with the characters and found it both heartwarming and halarious. I'm 38, for the record, but found it far too easy to relate to teenager Colin, the \\"hero\\" of this story. I loved the non-sequiturs of Colin's brain and the tremendous amount of work that, no doubt, went into crafting his awkward thinking patterns. It's a love story too, but far from typical.    Great characters... great story... great read for all ages.    My only fault would be in the language that was used, albeit sparingly, throughout the book. While it might be \\"realistic\\", it is also troubling and I don't believe adds anything to the stories or the characters -- it just seems to be the way to make a story \\"hip\\" and appeal to younger readers who fancy themselves more grown up by reading a book with foul language (and yes, I read \\"fug\\" as an obscenity).
B0012GMVVW|4.0|Continuing the creative resurgence David Bowie began with 1995's \\"Outside,\\" \\"Heathen\\" found David Bowie creating interesting and soulful music after the more chilling \\"Hours.\\" Teaming up with producer Tony Visconti, \\"Heathen\\" seemed as if Bowie decided he no longer had to keep trying to outdo anything from his past. While the album is moody and haunting, Bowie and Visconti seemed to be settled on making an album that played to Bowie's greatest elements.<br /><br />If listened to in that respect, \\"Heathen\\" delivers plenty of payoffs. Bowie seems more of an alien than ever on \\"Heathen,\\" staring with the electronic squiggles and snaps of \\"Sunday,\\" which ultimately builds to Bowie chanting \\"Seek only peace\\" under the main lyric. The melancholy, if warmer \\"Everyone Says Hi\\" calls out to a lost love to come home to the boring little town she long ran away from. \\"Slow Burn\\" recalls a slowed down \\"Starman,\\" and is the most haunting of the songs here (as well as my favorite from the CD). Close behind is \\"Slip Away,\\" which - to me - indictaed the purpose of \\"Heathen\\" as Bowie and Visconti created it.<br /><br />\\"Some of us will always stay behind<br />Down in space it's always 1982<br />The joke we always knew...\\"<br /><br />Seems to be directed at everyone still expecting another \\"Space Oddity\\" or awaiting another chapter in the chronicles Major Tom. It's more than a sly humor. Even more humorous and intriguing are the three choices of outside songs. Bowie takes a run at Neil Young's \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" (featuring Dave Grohl on guitar). This is probably the most conventional of the three choices, and without knowing the source, it would be easy to think it came off of Bowie's pen. Then there's The Pixies' \\"Cactus,\\" which is sort of fun. If you listen carefully, you'll hear Bowie spelling out D-A-V-I-D the same what The Pixies spelled out their own name on the original.<br /><br />But the absolute topper comes in the form of \\"I Took a Trip On a Gemini Spacecraft,\\" originally by the Legendary Stardust Cowboy. Stardust issues aside, the Texas psycho-billy artist (and one time T-Bone Burnette collaborator) is a hardcore cult artist that Bowie has always admired. But picking this song is almost like an inside joke, because it fits into the album so seamlessly while kind of pricking the Bowie legend. It's the most fun to be had on \\"Heathen.\\"<br /><br />It also kind of vindicates the album's title. The slip-sleeve's images include pictures of damaged art, and including a song like \\"Gemini Spacecraft\\" is a sort of blaspheme. It's hard not to imagine Bowie having a good laugh at all the critics who'd be poring over the album when it was first issued and trying to figure the relevance. \\"Heathen,\\" dark and moody as it often is, is still David Bowie at his strongest, as well as a hearty call of \\"I'm still here\\" from the artist.ginally by the Legendary Stardust Cowboy.

B001R0XNSI|3.0|This thing can stab dinosaurs and not be harmed ! Its awesome.. heavy, tough, hard as nails and looks pretty good.. However the ink in it was a bit of a let down. Whilst not using it to colour in a mural the size of the Sistine Chapel, I did use if for marking lines, annotating lumber etc etc.. but not too heavy a use.. I found that it did run dry and was beginning to fade so I was dissppointed. However I'll keep it just to use occasionally. I havent had to use it as a defensive weapon ... yet... so I cant comment on that.. however I did punch my arm with it and it hurt like hell for a while after..
B004WPYNY8|4.0|For me this disc took a few spins before I really appreciated how good it is.  I liked the first track, Iconoclast right from the start.  Children Of A Faceless God is also a great song.  When All Is Lost is a nice song.  I like the entire second disc a great deal.  All the musicians are at the top of their game.  Especially the drumming.  Best yet for him.  Get the Deluxe Edition.  The extra tracks are all worth it.   My only complaint is that it seems too over produced to me.  It's too perfect.  Next time out a little garage band rawness might be nice...
B004X4QW42|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and the ending, introducing Bruce Lee is the Icing on the Cake.  I read many of the reviews and I'm amazed most people only gave it 4 stars. I believe part 2 has a slight edge over part 1.  While part 1 Is beautifully done.  I found my self even more involved in part 2 as the Boxer made you really get into it.    Can any one punch faster then Ip Man?    Respect12
B0051OZ564|5.0|I don't know what genre to call this movie but I'll give it a shot.  This is an action/sci-fi/horror/fantasy movie.  There, that should cover some of it.  This to me was a very immersing movie.  It starts out at ground zero with the character Baby Doll and just takes off from there.  Also, if you're into computer gaming you will find this movie quite interesting as well.  The movie has a very novel twist in that all the fantasy, action, and sci-fi take place only when Baby Doll is dancing and she transports herself in her mind to these places and events and thereby taking the other four female characters with her.  Very satisfying movie to watch.  I felt like I got my money's worth.
0307946711|1.0|Having never read one of this author's book before, I wasn't sure what to expect. After skimming half of the book I determined that the cessation of reading this pathetic novel was inevitable. Continual sexualtiy and sorry and sick characters left me with a monotonous and repulsive feeling.  Skip it and save your money!
159420229X|5.0|I love this book.  Great book for pretty much anybody, any age.  An intriguing read about the human memory and how to improve your own!
1423101499|5.0|This book was a great book in the Olympians books. I loved this book and I'm so glad I bought the fourth one. I couldn't put the book down, I was so into the it.
030758660X|5.0|I had to buy this book, I love to knit and I have a friend who loves true blood and we are both reading the books. I found so many great projects for her and also some for myself!! Beautiful pictures, well written patterns, like I said, a must for the vampire lover (or fang-banger, if you read the sookie stackhouse novels) in your life or if you are one yourself!!
B00336G7HI|5.0|Fits perfect, charges fast.  Never have to stop filming because of a low battery.  Always have a spare.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I was reluctant to buy this with all the reviews about the packaging but one reviewer said that was fixed and he was right. (nuts, as I just checked and it's on sale for $87 and I thought I got a great deal for $101....and I still did). Incredible series...The Wire, Sopranos, Deadwood and Boardwalk Empire all rolled into one. Great action and segues into following episodes. May be my all-time favorite.  You can't lose with this one if you enjoy good drama and acting.
1416583432|4.0|I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but what I got was an anthropological perspective into how dogs think, play, and the reasoning behind such actions as marking. My husband and I are first time dog owners and have raised our dog from a nipping, wondrous puppy into a happy and obedient dog. Reading 'Inside of a Dog' was beneficial because I learned even more about our little guy. The author's love of dogs and extensive research into their world is evident based on her findings and ability to quote other research from a vast field of animals including monkeys, ticks, and even bats. The best findings come (of course) from the endless hours of research that the author spent analyzing every detail of dogs and their interactions with other dogs and their owners. Some of her findings are fascinating, however there are definitely some every day behaviors and interactions that remain overlooked or unexplained. Overall this non-fiction work is a good insightful and educational exploratory look at dogs and is definitely worth reading!
0811879542|5.0|My almost-three-year-old twins cannot get enough of this book. They laugh with triumph and delight as each page shows the \\"result\\" of their action. This is a wonderful, unique addition to a children's book collection.
1856697061|5.0|Intrigued by the reviews on sewing blogs and here at amazon, I bought the book. when it arrived by post I could not wait to start browsing. I've read the reviews posted here beforehand, so I was looking for hidden flaws. Somehow it tainted my pleasure. Book is like nothing you've seen before. Disregard the remarks on how unwearable the items presented in it are or how skilled you have to be to actually sew them. Any hobby schneiderin with 3-4 years of Burda patterns experience can do it. Anyway, the aim of any serious crafting and clothes making aficionado should be to master the modelling  and start making his/her own ideas a reality, not just copy gimmicks from shop window trips and be stuck in shortcuts to great fitting clothes. I don't believe this book was ever intended to be a sewing manual or a pattern book, so it does not matter the instructions are not to detailed. It's art!,  presented in a way to satisfy our curiosity \\"how did they do it\\". worth every penny and a great book to browse in bed before going to sleep, looks good on coffee table, great conversation piece, but most of all this is the closest look of haute couture modelling you'll ever come across.<br />Highly recommended!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|fun, smart, funny.  in 20 words, great. definately worth 2 USD. twenty words makes no sense. ok forget it.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonc&eacute; Giselle Knowles is one of my top 5 favorite Female entertainers of all time! I hold much love and admiration for her, while remaining a true fan throughout her years in Destiny's Child, and as a solo artist. I have been anxiously awaiting her new 2011 album. And finally, my copy arrived today, and has been playing in heavy rotation since, respectably!. &quot;4&quot; has blends of '80s and '90s Old School Hip-Hop and R&amp;B, also including pure Pop excellence! The soothing, newly settled mood of this material provides total satisfaction, and offers a mature insight into several genere's of feel-good music. Part ballad-heavy and partly dominated by mid-tempo tracks, &quot;4&quot; shines through the window of perfection with a surprisingly, confident turn into the future of Ms. Knowles. &quot;4&quot; is, without a doubt, her greatest work to date! I am confidant that true music lovers will appreciate her new touch and, without hesitation, will begin strutting toward the new direction of which this 2011 debut will surely take you in!<br /><br />Track listing for 4:<br /><br />Track 1) 1+1 - 4:33. Let me get right down to business. &quot;1+1&quot; is such an exquisite piece of perfection! And I must say, vocally, Beyonc&eacute; has never sound better, as she lifts high above, and casually descends in pure delight. There is a bit of everything on this track, including the calm touch of the rock-guitar, the piano, the cymbals and more.<br /><br />Track 2) I Care - 3:59. With all seriousness, this is one of my absolute favorite songs featured! &quot;I Care&quot; serves a generous share of drums and percussion, all tied together with a nostalgic tempo. I especially adore the ending, in which the song rides out with Beyonc&eacute; repeating &quot;I still care,&quot;..followed with an &quot;owww&quot; at which point, crashes simultaneously with the flaring rock-guitar.<br /><br />Track 3) I Miss You - 2:58. I am completely spellbound by Ms. Knowles' vocals here. I get chills from start to finish! Her tone stirs emotions deep from within me, due to her raw, radiant and mature vocals. Edging on haunting, her tone gives off vibrations of a cold and lonely echo drifting through the Universe, soaring around full circle, straight to your mind, body and soul. For those of you who have ever loved someone, whether that might be family, a lover, a close friends, a confidant...trust me, you will wear this song as if it were an honor badge. Beyonc&eacute; said it best - &quot;it don't matter who you are, it is sooo simple.&quot; &quot;No matter who you love, it is sooo simple.&quot;<br /><br />Track 4) Best Thing I Never Had - 4:13. With this song, you get an important message of empowerment, presented with the tickling of the classic piano. Beyonc&eacute; takes the listener through the trials and tribulations of a one-sided relationship, and does a wonderfully convincing job of making vulnerability seem like a form of bravery, with class and sophistication! Beyonc&eacute; never fails to bring the truth to the table; as evident with past successors such as &quot;Me, Myself &amp; I,&quot; and &quot;Irreplaceable.&quot; &quot;Best Thing I Ever Had&quot; provides you with the same level of security and comfort, with a unique song-title and an uplifting rhythm to soften the blow. Afterall, this is her 4th album, with a minor return of past love issues on the surface, only this time, in the form of new timeless material.<br /><br />Track 5) Party feat. Andre 3000 (contains samples from &quot;La Di Da Di&quot; performed by Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew feat. MC Ricky D, written by Douglas Davis) - 4:04. I always BuMp-bA-BuMp this track every time I play this album. &quot;Party&quot; will go down as one of her most distinguished songs, ever! Andre 3000 provides the Hip-Hop aspect, and does his thing quite well, as usual! There is a faint essence of '90s girl-group SWV, held down by Ms. Knowles, as she turns it out in her own right. The return of '80s synth and puttering percussion makes for a...well...a party!<br /><br />Track 6) Rather Die Young - 3:42. Starts off - &quot;Boy you'll be the death of me, you're my James Dean, you make me feel like I'm 17,&quot; and soon after &quot;You drive to fast, smoke to much, but that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush.&quot; What follows after is an in-your-face chorus, intertwined with an explosion of retro instruments. Again, songs like this make you think about your significant other, and even stirs up past memories of that special someone, leaving you with personal intimate feelings once shared together.<br /><br />Track 7) Start Over - 3:18. Once again, Beyonc&eacute; comes with all (vocal) barrels blazing, as she points out the possible reasons for a fading relationship. On this track, Beyonc&eacute; delivers heartbreak with purpose: to remind us just how overwhelming love can be. There is everlasting strength in her vocals, pushing out feelings of anger, despair, and regret, with a hint of optimism all melted into one.<br /><br />Track 8) Love On Top - 4:27. This song is heavily doused with early '90s Old-School flavor, and gives an instant refreshing sigh of relief for all whom, like me, remember those genuine days of R&amp;B! The trumpet and percussion blast out with early '90s pride and continue down that path to completion. Material such as this proves exactly why Ms. Knowles is positioned alongside greatness as an amazing Legend! It's very pleasant to hear her sing overtop a smooth retro rhythm, all while taking (you) the listener back to the good ol' days when music stood for something..when music had true meaning. Again, this type of laid-back dated material is greatly appreciated, and personally, wholeheartedly, I Thank you very much Beyonc&eacute;!<br /><br />Track 9) Countdown (contains samples from &quot;Uhh Ahh&quot; performed by Boyz II Men, written by Michael Bivins) - 3:31. Yet another favorite of mine, and I am in love with the instruments used throughout. The beat is contagious, and rides along with blends of caribbean heat. Beyonc&eacute; starts out this fun-filled countdown with a moment of harmonizing, then quickly, the song morphs into a trumpet blirting, drum-marching celebration. The verse: &quot;damn I think I love that boy, do anything for that boy&quot; automatically makes me think of my guy, as is true about the song itself.<br /><br />Track 10) End Of Time - 3:43. A GOLDEN entry on &quot;4&quot; indeed! With vocals as flawless as a cut diamond, &quot;End Of Time&quot; proves to be yet another classic. The marching drums re-emerge, and the bass pushes along with such venturesome rhythm. You simply can't help but to move your entire body, from your neck, down your spine, straight to your feet! This is easily my favorite summer song of 2011!<br /><br />Track 11) I Was Here - 3:58. Only one word I can use to sum up this song - Real! Ms. Knowles' words are deep and from her heart. You can feel the agony and conviction with every note. I can't say it enough, there is so much power in her vocals here...so mighty...so serious...so precise! Ms. Knowles expresses how much of an impact she hopes she has made throughout her early career to the present. The hope that she has made her mark throughout her career is really non-arguable, as I truly believe that she has accomplished that and then some! Her longevity expands with every breath she takes!<br /><br />Track 12) Run The World (Girls) - 3:56. The very 1st song and video that were both released as the album's front runners. You will feel and hear total instant maximum energy on this track, all laid about with a hyperactive beat, and wrapped together with female empowerment. &quot;Who Run The World&quot; condones you the freedom to dance your butt off with zero regret.<br /><br />&quot;4&quot; is a plethora of mid-tempo cuts, rich with echoes of late-'70s/early-'80s Pop, cascading with powerhouse-balladry and early '90s soul. The listener will get a bit of everything, from personal slow jams, to grinding drill-beats, as well as a few marching two-step anthems, all of which keep you fixated. A bundle of instruments are in play and give a gigantic boost to each track, instruments such as the bass guitar, the rhythm guitar, the snare drum, the saxophone, keyboards, the trumpet, the synth...even the cello, as well as many more. While never allowing herself to repeat the same formula, Beyonc&eacute; has, once again, proven to the world that she is here to give us (her fans) nothing but the best. And as a perfectionist myself, I know the feeling of wanting nothing but the best, for the best! Rather than becoming a duplicate of today's music scene, Beyonc&eacute; has taken a left turn head on into the future of music!

B0050CQY1W|3.0|To be honest, I'm not a Beyonce fan and I've always thought she was overrated.  Don't get me wrong, I think she's a great entertainer and she has a passion for what she does, but I didn't like the fact that most female artist in the industry today are compared to her.  For example, if a female artist is trying to do her thing, the first thing you hear is \\"Oh, she's trying to be like Beyonce\\".  As stated before, Beyonce is great, but she's not the best... she's isn't the first and she won't be the last.    I've listed to the whole album and I was a bit impressed.  I can hear the growth and maturity in her sound and lyrics.  It's more of a pop album than R&B though.  The album doesn't have tracks like GET ME BODIED, CRAZY IN LOVE, SINGLE LADIES or DEJA VU; which are songs the younger generation would quickly adapt to and songs that I think people were expecting to hear.  The only predictable song on the album is RUN THE WORLD (GIRLS); which I thought was just okay.      I think the album's overall sound is more for a mature audience and I give it 3 ½ stars.  As stated before, I'm not a Beyonce fan, but I would surely give this album another listen.
B004LROMSO|4.0|I happened to like the show.  I agree that some characters are played out better than others, but I am hoping that the weaker characters are still in the \\"developing\\" process.  =)  I watched the entire season and can't wait for the next one.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|I have used this to connect my iPad to my Samsung HD TV.  Worked beautifully.  It was fun to show pictures from a trip on the big screen.  No problems encountered.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonce has been growing ever since she debuted as leader of Destiny's Child and went into her solo career with the solid \\"[[ASIN:B000099T2L Dangerously in Love]]\\". She went above and beyond my expectation when she released one of the most important Contemporary R&B/Pop albums of all time, \\"[[ASIN:B000H0MKGA B'Day]]\\" (her most critically acclaimed work up until that point) in 2006 covering a relationship from the dazzling beginning to the miserable end. It also documents the growth of a(young)woman. 2008's \\"[[ASIN:B002QY9RMA I Am...Sasha Fierce]]\\" saw Beyonce covering several different genres effortlessly and effectively. It was a transitional album leading up to the arrival of \\"4\\".     \\"4\\" is a gumbo of different sounds, emotions, and tempos on one album by one woman. It's an album a pop star of Beyoncé's caliber makes when she is ready to give you her complete self without the pressures of commercial performance. The set finds Beyonce, the best rhythmic singer since Aretha Franklin, diving into several heartfelt ballads about love, lost, and longing. It also has its fair share of uptempos one being the swagged out \\"Countdown\\", the Afrocentric (my absolute favorite track) \\"End of Time\\" and the amazingly aggressive \\"Run The World (Girls)\\" (her most aggressive and unique single to date). \\"Party\\" is a throwback track that seems to be written from Beyonce-of-the-90's point of view which happens to be one of my favorites. \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" which is a Babyface/Beyonce penned midtempo lies perfectly in the middle for the \\"fresh out of a relationship\\" crowd. One of the stand out ballads, \\"I Care\\", is blatant homage to Prince with high staccato adlibs over an intense, almost emotional guitar break. Preceding \\"I Care\\" is the heartfelt \\"1+1\\" which hears Beyonce giving one of the best vocal performances of her career. \\"Rather Die Young\\" is a throwback 70's track where Beyonce belts out her devotion for the one she loves. The set also contains the haunting \\"I Was Here\\"which sums up what Beyonce hopes to achieve with her career outside of amazing music.    \\"4\\" is easily the best album of 2011 as well as one of the best ones in her discography. The main reason being that it is so different from her others. Some other reviewers are blatantly whining about how queens reinvent themselves (and misquoting Beyonce herself). Beyonce has done just that unless they are referring Beyonce's hair and clothes which are irrelevant to the music itself. The main rule in Beyonce's discography is not to expect another \\"Single Ladies\\" or \\"Crazy in Love\\" but do expect the first \\"End of Time\\" and \\"Run The World (Girls)\\" which are just as great.    Let's be honest though, no matter what kind of album Beyonce created out of her musically unique mind, she was never going to please some reviewers that review an album citing chart positions and a false sense of \\"maturity\\" as a basis for their underhanded compliments and outright lies. \\"4\\" is Beyonce at her strongest boldly telling her audience that she is here and she has IT. What she offers with \\"4\\" is an honest, diverse, and unique set of tracks that will be remembered as the best in 2011 pop music.
1416563156|5.0|This is a neat little book that has the \\"look\\" of Indiana's journal from the movies.  All the other reviews are a good indication as to the quality of the book.  I would like to add, the adhesive sticker on the back is easy to remove.  Some people had expressed concern that it might not be removable.  I took the label off, with no residue left behind.  It helped that the book was warm from being on the porch after the delivery for a while.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I was pretty excited about the movie from the trailers and interviews, but when I started seeing all the negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to stay away.  Now that I've finally seen the movie on Blu-ray, I have to admit that it really is not nearly as bad as all the critics are saying.  (Also, I really would have given it a 3.5 instead of 4, but since there are no half stars in the rating, I will round up.)    I'll start with the things that did not work: the music was much too central in several parts of the movie.  It really did feel like a music video as some have commented.  The choice of songs are fine, but it really should have been more subtle and used more in the background, rather than dominating the movie.  The dialogue is definitely not the strongest element; it may not be unbelievably cheesy (ala Batman and Robin) but there are some lines (especially from the Wiseman character) that are cringeworthy.  The use of slow motion does get excessive in some scenes, most notably the scene on the train with the robots.  The action is also very CGI heavy and thus does suffer from the heft and weight that more grounded, live action shooting could have brought.      I think that sense of unreality was what many people took offense to; but in the end, it is perfectly suited for the story being told in Sucker Punch.  This is the story of how women who had no power in their society, imagined themselves to be powerful in their minds.  If you are willing to accept this lack of reality in their imaginary world, you will likely enjoy the wildly exotic imagery Snyder orchestrated.  The story is actually engaging in several moments as you come to care for Babydoll. I disagree with the criticism that the story is completely shallow and devoid of meaning; the theme of claiming the power to choose your destiny came through clearly by the end.  Don't let the critics scare you off, there is a lot that can be enjoyed in this movie; Sucker Punch is worth experiencing.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|I read John Locke's book - kindle version over two nights. I haven't read any of his other novels, so can't comment on whether they are great enough to generate the sales they do, or if it's the technique he employs and reveals in this book that propels the sales of the collection of novels he's published into the statosphere. The fact is though, his books are selling by the bucket load.    The techniques revealed are pretty obvious, but its the subtle way Mr Locke has employed them that appear to be the key to success. His novels must be pretty good and they clearly have a huge following, which has been harnessed through the techniques used.    The main weapons...Blogging, Twitter, Website and his successful secret.    I have written two books with a third on the way, and i'll be adjusting my marketing based on the contents of John's book. Whether it works or not remains to be seen! Anyone interested can check on the Amazon sales rank of my books by clicking the links below. Better give it a few months though...!!

B004DMIIOG|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing!    Every time you think the movie can't be better, he does, what made me want more and more of this movie.  This is what I think that the future will be, with every people connected to the same App in many ways! People sharing information and doing friends and translating languages in real time. A brilliant movie, that I risk to say it's one of the best movies I ever seen so far!    No movie caused me so much excitement like Summer Wars. Unfortunately (or not), there is no series or another movie. It's just perfect like it is!    I couldn't expected a better movie =)
0765326353|5.0|The book is written in the form where various chapters are written from the perspective of various characters. I'm not a big fan of that style, but regardless, the story and the characters are hugely entertaining.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I'm gonna make this short and sweet, I'm in Afghanistan right now and I needed something for my 600 ohm headphones. I was skeptical about this where it was only 20 bucks but I got it and far as quality you get 50 dollars worth of quality i'd say.As for its design like the clip a little flimsy and doesn't seems to be molded perfect but again 20 dollars. So if you needed something with awesome quality this is not your product but is a definately a good stand in, if your in a pinch. So, there's no reason not to give  a 5 stars cause you get what you paid for and i feel like i got more.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Most of the times I always read the 1 star reviews before buying a movie or item but I did not on this one. Big mistake, this movie was terrible and the sound effects and blue ray quality   was even worse.   Fake fighting parts was terrible and the girls dancing that they never showed was mindless. What kind of writor would put dancing all the way through a movie but you never see the person dance.  And what does dancing have to do with fighting??? When the girls dance they fall in a deep dream and believe that they are fighting in the army, flying a plain, or big fighting a monsters. Crazy!!   Terrible!! Do not be a Sucker
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I have used my android phone to read a couple books.  I read mostly non-fiction.  It is difficult to see some of the tables because they don't line up line for line but this is a phone, what do you expect.  It works great for regular text and I find myself getting my book out and reading a couple pages more often now that it is more convenient.  At first your books are hard to find but don't worry, they are archived for some reason.  The phone and the kindle don't  always sync so sometimes I have to find my place again when I switch between the two.  All in all is a great application.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Recently, Battlestar Galactica has started to show on the cable channels.  Problem is it will take four to five years to \\"relive\\" the series, getting only one new episode a week.  You also have to sit through commercials, this is what happened previously, and this is what will be happening next week kind of things.  The quality of the picture is superior to what is being aired on TV, and though it still has a  brief \\"previously on Battlestar Galactica\\" and an intro with credits, it sure is nice to get full episodes, uncut, uninterrupted, and the ability to watch three or four in a row.  Excellently packaged, with a number of \\"extras\\" discs, I love it.      The only negative there is, is quite common among movie DVD's or collections.  There is an \\"imbalance\\" between the conversations of the characters and the background noises.  First time I ran into this, I thought something was wrong with my DVD or the TV, like the channels got switched.  The background noise drowns out the voices.  After some research, I found this is really common.  The studies boost the background for \\"realism\\" and theater-like effects.  If you have a home theater, boost the \\"center\\" channel to fix.  If you do not, you'll have to play with the TV and DVD settings to find something to rebalance the sound.  For me, I use remote, powered speakers running from the audio-out plug of the TV.  BY increasing the volume of the TV's actual speakers, I get the voices much better and still have the blast of explosions.
B001YV502C|4.0|Children of Men (sci-fi, drama)<br />Directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n<br />Starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Chiwetel Ejiofor<br /><br />Universal Studios   2006   110 min   Rated R   Released May 26, 2009<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: VC-1<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: DTS 5.1<br />German: DTS 5.1<br />Italian: DTS 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Korean, Mandarin (Traditional), Portuguese, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />If you have ever seen The Road, or 28 Days Later, you'll recognize the look of Children of Men. It's set in the future in a world that looks familiar, but it's dirtier, grittier and less safe than the world you're used to seeing.<br /><br />The movie is set in Britain in 2027 and Theo Faron (Owen) learns through a newscast that the world's youngest person has died at the age of 18. Doesn't that sound odd? Have you ever heard a report that sounds anything like that? It immediately alerts us to the fact that something is wrong. We find out that all humans are infertile and no child has been produced for more than 18 years.<br /><br />If people are no longer born, how long would it take for the world's existing population to die? What would happen to those already here, knowing that they will be among the last of their species?<br /><br />Theo visits his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), who hides away in a house in the woods. Illegal immigrants are everywhere and government messages urge people to report them. Theo is abducted early in the story by Julian (Moore) who is his former lover. Movement within the country is restricted and she wants Theo to obtain transfer papers so that her group can take a young woman, Kee, to the coast and safety.<br /><br />It's a brutal existence and Theo eventually finds himself as Kee's only hope. She's one of the most important people on the planet, but only a small group of people know why. Theo guards her to the best of his ability and attempts to get her to safety using a contact of Jasper's to help them. He accepts help whenever it's offered.<br /><br />Some of the street scenes would be more at home in a war movie. It seems that the military regularly clashes with civilians and every group has an agenda. It's a crazy existence where law and order is virtually non-existent, and it would be frightening to experience. Do the people have any goals at all that don't involve killing and stealing what they can from others? The military prefers to shoot first and ask questions later.<br /><br />It impresses me that even though the world is a chaotic place and full of danger, the plot remains coherent. The audience is never in doubt about Theo's intentions; just his ability to succeed. The resolution won't make everyone happy. It's not clear what will happen in the future. This is a snapshot showing one key event in a seemingly hopeless situation. When it's all over, we are left with hope, and that's enough.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />Although the setting is grimy, the presentation is clean and detailed. The desolate world is often presented in shades of gray, but that's no fault of the transfer. Blacks are clearly defined and colors are accurate. Scenes shot in the forest look vivid and full of detail. I didn't detect any noise or print damage and the overall look is very pleasing.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />There aren't many scenes in which the action dominates, but the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix rises to the occasion when it has to. An early explosion is startling, while the sound of bullets zipping past in the final act is effective. The mix is a little front-heavy, but everything works and it sounds effective. There are quite a few songs included in the mix and that's where the presentation really shines.<br /><br />Special Features 3/5<br /><br />The additional features all appear in standard definition:<br /><br />Deleted Scenes (2:22) - Three additional scenes that add very little to the story.<br /><br />The Possibility of Hope (27:16) - Philosophers talking about the future and what will happen if we pursue our present course.<br /><br />Children of Men Comments by Slavoj Zizek (5:44) - Explaining the background scenes and themes in greater depth.<br /><br />Under Attack (7:36) - Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and some of the cast and crew talk about how one of the best action scenes was shot using a single take.<br /><br />Theo & Julian (4:40) - Owen and Moore talk about their characters.

B00127RAJY|3.0|This is an amazing work-out, but be careful not to over-work yourself.  It is very easy to go too far and become exhausted.  Even though Jillian says things like 'see you tomorrow,' I wouldn't do this work-out daily, unless you really feel you can handle it.  I think skipping a day or two between work-outs is best, especially so you can help your muscles develop, too, since the majority of the work-out is strength training.  But Jillian is very motivating and her two helpers are great, too.  It just might be a little too much to do every day.
0553579908|5.0|There is so much that can be said about this book and the series as a whole. Most of it probably already done so in the hundreds of reviews here  on Amazon. I can't believe that I hadn't even heard of these books 'til I saw that HBO was developing them into a series. ( most faithful adaption of a book that I have seen ). What it comes down to for me is,  while George RR Martin is a pretty good writer (understatement) he is also in my opinion one of the greatest storytellers who ever put pen to paper, and I've only read the first two books in his Song of Ice and Fire series so far. I can now see why this series in placed in the fantasy genre. It is set in a different world, kind of medieval England I suppose, and even though there isn't much magic in it yet, there is a little and I sense more looming on the horizon.   I have found them to be ridiculously immersive and suspenseful. The writer has an unusual propensity for destroying main characters, good or bad or more likely a bit of both with no warning. Which can be unsettling and cause a person to cry out in disbelief and pound her fist on a cushion. I both admire and hate the authors total ruthlessness in service to his story. No matter what is say I really can't do justice to this series. Just read it for yourself. (less) [edit]

And who doesn't like just looking at Joshua Jackson???  Anna Torv is so believable as both Olivia and Faux-livia.  Catch up on Season Three and keep the next season episodes coming!
0446560073|5.0|This is an excellent follow-up to the first Simon's Cat book.  As noted by other reviewers, this time the book tells an entire story from start to finish, and it is charming!  Afterwards there are bunch of random drawings noted on the cover as 'exclusive cartoons for American fans'.  They're cute, and they appear to be outtakes from the story, perhaps?  I look forward to the next Simon's Cat book, and more cartoons on You Tube.  Definitely recommended!  btw, there are lots of fun things to buy on the Simon's Cat web site!
0545128285|4.0|the tales of beedle the bard was a very cute read.  it is quick and easy.  if you are looking for something comparable to harry potter, however, this is not it.  it is a small book containing a few children's tales, not an epic fantasy saga.  it provides nice insight and the notes on the tales from dumbledore are almost better than some of the stories.  if you are a harry potter/jk rowling fanatic, it will be a nice addition to your collection.
B002SG8A56|5.0|Come on FOC purists! Time to get this right. There is no 'Jermaine Clement,' in FOC, the actor's name is actually 'Jemaine' Clement.
055357342X|5.0|The quality, pace, tension, suspense and overall brilliant storytelling is maintained and continued through this third book in the Game of Thrones series.   Im starting to think a great alternative title for this series could be, And Then There Were None! Will anyone be left standing to claim the Iron throne I wonder? I've never known any series of books like this where no characters safety can be taken for granted. It adds to the tension for sure. As I finished this book a mental slideshow played in my mind. It was like one of those Oscar, \\" in memoriam\\" reels. The background music was Queen's, Another One Bites the Dust. The applause ebbed and flowed according to each picture...Who will win The Game of Thrones? (less) [edit]
1599218011|5.0|Another easy read from Kris Carr.  This book takes the mystery out of transitioning into a raw, vegetarian/vegan lifestyle...or how to simply modify your eating habits, whether for a lifestyle change or fighting disease.  The book is full of information that supports her ideas, along with suggestions of finding balance in all that you do.  Her approach is about mind, body and soul and it's something she practices.  Nicely done!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Just get the whole Toy Story series. You don't need to even think about it. If you want your little kids to be entertained while giving you some free time for yourself, get these dvd's.     My 2 sons could watch these intently for 1/2 the day and not just for 1 day, but for weeks.    Toy Story 2 seems to be their favorite, but [[ASIN:B0030IIZ4M Toy Story]] and [[ASIN:B00275EHJG Toy Story 3]] are hugely popular with them also.    Another dvd you may want to try out if you have sons is [[ASIN:B000065U37 Jimmy Neutron - Boy Genius]] which isn't quite as popular as the Toy Story movies for my boys, but still keeps their attention.
0060936223|4.0|Where to begin. First the book had me sitting around an 90 degree house on July 4th with every intention of doing something, but instead I kept reading. I don't get the people find the book boring, to be it was a great insight on making it as an artist, to the changing of the 60's into the 70's at one America's hot beds of creativity, and on love itself.<br /><br />At time it does edge on the self importance, or name dropping, that kills many such books. Smith's self declaration of being an \\"artist\\" made me wince more than once. I am big believer we are are all artists at heart, and some bring art to lives of others by a song or a joke or touch that makes their day as special as any Patti Smith poem can do. Her repeated assertion of her being an artist did at times give the impression she was above some of us and that doesn't taint what other wise is a great read.  On the other hand, she did let us see what experiences, choices and offering she got as she worked at becoming who she envisioned herself to be.<br /><br />It's love that make this book a winner, for it is in essence a long love letter.  Smith's writing has us experience her love, even feeling the pain she felt at times that comes from loving a sexually repressed drug user, and for sure the pain she felt at the lost of her friend. The love Patti has to this day for Robert comes across as the type of pure love parents hope their children find. For Smith's ability to share that love,  to make us feel that love with the back drop of the unique artist world that was New York City circa 1970 I recommend this book for any romantic.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I've watched all 3 seasons and I can't wait for the 4th. Bryan Cranston is amazing. The break up of his marriage to Skylar has brought new tensions but it evolves in an interesting way as he continues to cook and provide for his family. I began to feel sorry for Jesse as he begins to realise that he is alone without family or real friends. Walt jnr is great as he struggles to understand why his mother is so against his dad.  There is a build up of tension as Walt starts to realise his boss's intentions and the final scene makes me wonder how I'm going to wait for number four.  This is a wonderful show, you couldn't help but get involved.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is absolutely the best book I have read in the past year.  I spent an entire Sunday morning on my back deck, chain-smoking through the last third of it.  I simply could not put it down.  I am hoping this will not be the last we hear of Jacob.  EXCELLENT story telling.
0061537969|5.0|Very good book a must read, I love how the dog tells the story from his point of view its so cute and heart breaking at the same time I love it!! I'm a dog lover and would love to know how my dog thinks about things that are goin on in our lives. I would strongly suggest this book to dog lovers but it is sad....
0061339202|2.0|Flow was originally published in 1990. Not reading it until 2011, I missed the original hype and exuberance associated with it. It is like many books that draw from large area of research and draw a common, larger theme out of the material-lots of interesting data but easy to lose \\"flow\\" while reading. For this book, I found the mountain of material to be higher than Everest and Mihaly says as much when he talks about having written the book for the \\"general reader.\\" His span of experience is broad covering many scientific disciplines, religions, cultures, etc. and I believe that much of the research on human behavior resonates. However, I can't help but sense that something is missing in this book. The nature of the mind and the research in the first third of the book provide a solid background of the concept of \\"flow\\" and \\"optimal experience\\". The remainder of the book was a struggle to finish. Perhaps someone like me, who considers themselves very happy, struggles to find substantial application with what is written. For me to follow one of his suggestion, which is to cast off certain belief systems in search of a new \\"system\\" is a contradiction with no value.
B003O3EKTC|1.0|I purchased the movie with the impression I would get the 3 bonus MP3's, otherwise I would have purchased from another source.  Only to find out that this offer expired 6 months ago.  Buy this movie from someone else at a cheaper price.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|This is probably going to get lost in all the other reviews but I'll put my two cents in. First of all I'd only rent it. I would have felt ripped off if I paid full price for it. It seems to have been designed with the notion of turning it into a video game. You get the gist of the plot at the start of the movie, but no real detail. You never find out why the other girls are there except in the fantasy land dance hall or what happens in the real world of the mental institution while all the fantasy is going on. All in all, it has the feel of a comic book that was turned into a movie, but had to be cut and edited like Lord of the Rings to be able to adapt it to a movie.
1416583432|3.0|I got this thinking it would tell me how the dogs mind works but a lot of it was just opinion (I know most of the stuff like that is opinion). But some of the stuff she talks about sounds about right....
B001U6YI92|5.0|Got the blu-ray in just over a week.  Thanks to Amazon, again for a job well done.  One of my favourite Clint East movies of all-time
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I had this game on PC a few years ago.  I got the free PvZ for Android when Amazon had a promotion.  It was still just as fun to beat all over again.  I got all but four or five of the achievements, and will probably work on the others again in a few weeks.  It's hard to describe how cathartic it is to plant flowers and destroy zombies.  Be sure to watch the music video again and again.  If you don't want to beat the game to do so, it's on YouTube. :)
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Super 8 is admittedly not a perfect film, but I enjoyed it so much, and was so taken by the characters and the actors playing them, that I didn't really mind the occasional inconsistency or lingering \\"awed expressions\\" scene.<br /><br />Set in a small town in Ohio in 1979, the basic plot centers around Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a 13-year-old boy whose mother recently died in a factory accident, leaving him with only his father, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), a sheriff's deputy who's a more than decent man but who has never known how to really be a father. Jackson's escape is burying himself in his work, while Joe's is helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make an amateur zombie movie with the help of their other friends Preston (Zach Mills), Martin (Gabriel Basso) and Cary (Ryan Lee). But Joe's involvement becomes truly committed when Charles persuades Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), a girl he secretly has a crush on, to join the project.<br /><br />Things taken a sudden turn when, in the midst of shooting a midnight scene at the local railroad depot, Joe sees a pickup truck suddenly drive onto the tracks, directly in the path of an oncoming freight train, resulting in a spectacular crash that sends freight cars derailing everywhere and the shocked kids running for cover. The plot quickly thickens when Joe gets a glimpse of something bursting out of one of the freight cars, and when they find the driver of the pickup, badly injured, is Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), their biology teacher, who warns them to get away and to never speak of what they've seen to anyone or they - and their parents - will be killed. And then there's the knocked over Super 8 camera that has been continuing to roll throughout everything, capturing something that no one else saw while they were busy tried not to get crushed by flying debris. Something that will become important later as strange things begin to happen:  dogs fleeing the town for no apparent reason, car engines and other pieces of machinery being stolen, people suddenly disappearing. And of course the massive influx of military personnel who are crawling all over everything while their commander, Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich) blandly insists that there's _nothing_ going on.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn, fleshed out with real personalities, quirks and flaws, and you very quickly come to care about them.  And the actors, most of them either fairly unknown or newcomers, are marvelous, the kids in particular as they're at the heart of the film, but also the adults, particularly Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard as the two fathers linked - and separated - by tragedy, each not doing so well at dealing with it. Joel Courtney as Joe has one of those faces that projects everything he's feeling, from the distance he's experiencing with his dad to the secret yet painfully obvious crush he has on Alice. Riley Griffiths as his best friend Charles is a perfect counterpoint, pursuing his film with single-minded determination but holding other things in. Ryan Lee's pint-sized braces-laden (and explosives-crazy) Cary is a riot, as is Gabriel Basso's Martin as the zombie film's leading man who has an unfortunate tendency to puke a lot, while Zach Mills' Preston has the healthiest fear-instinct of the crowd. And last but not least, Elle Fanning's Alice is a wonder, a sensitive girl with her own father issues whose unexpected natural talent at acting leaves the boys with their jaws hanging.<br /><br />Super 8 is highly derivative, but in a good way. It draws on the best parts of any number of movies from the past, most notably E.T. (1982) and The Goonies (1985) but also films like Joe Dante's Explorers (1985) , The Bad News Bears (1976) and, more recently, Son of Rambow (2007), a little seen but marvelous independent British film about a couple of boys with family issues who bond over making an amateur movie.<br /><br />Note:  in one scene, there's a definite tip-of-the-hat prop taken right out of Spielberg's E.T.  Just keep your eyes peeled when the camera closes in on the water tower near the climax of the movie and see if anything looks strikingly familiar.<br /><br />There are admittedly weak points in the film, mainly where it seems uncertain of just which direction it wants to take or where inconsistencies tend to be glaring. Is the alien dangerous and deadly... or just misunderstood? Is the alien killing people... or just holding on to them for a while?  The trouble is that in different parts of the film it's definitely one, but in other parts of the film it's the other.  And the climactic lingering \\"awed expressions\\" scene does feel at odds with the the life-threatening dangers the characters were experiencing earlier (not to mention the burning shambles half the town has been reduced to). Another weak point is the villain, Col. Nelec (I suspect the name Nelec is an in-joke of some kind), who is never anything but a cliched military bad guy.  But as I said, while these things do keep it from being a perfect film, they don't in the end get in the way from it being an engaging and enjoyable one.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes an engaging film that sucks you in and keeps you involved all the way through, and that values story and character over special effects and stars.when the camera closes in on the water tower near the climax of the movie and see if anything looks strikingly familiar.

B0050CQY1W|1.0|Every Artist has an album that flops and I think this is Beyonce's.It sounds like she got lazy and just threw something together and called it a day. I can't stand \\"Who run the world\\" it sounds like a song The Cheetah Girls or someone from the Disney Channel would make,very immature. The whole album sounds like garbage regardless of what genres she's trying to cross over to. No this doesn't make me a hater, it means that she's such a great singer,she should have known better than to put this crap out when her real fans know she's capable of doing so much better.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|If you're an EVA fan you're going to love this one. The new content is great. Excellent work on the visuals as well.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|I really liked the cartoon style of this game, and a couple of times the story made me laugh.  Gameplay was challenging and some levels I had to repeat over and over to beat.  Hex tiles have different hitpoints, attack powers, and attack directions.  Most tiles have an additional special ability.  When you beat another tile, it changes color to join your side.  I really had to think about my strategy for tile-placement.
0470901071|4.0|At times its annoying to read as if someone were having a conversation with you on the street. BUT, the content is great. Excellent examples and explanation that are clear and very well elaborated and explained.
B0009K7ESW|1.0|Obviously the reason I bought the DVDs is to listen to Ma's cello performance. It is very annoying that the video is always a few seconds lagging behind the sound. I need to reverse/forward and then pause for a while to get it synchronised, only to find that the video starts to misbehave again after a few minutes.
0307946711|2.0|I had high hopes for this book but it did not deliver. I understand that not all stories should be happy and perfect but this book honestly depressed me. I was not only sad and frustrated with the story, but also sad that I wasted my money! Keep searching... there are many other books out there that are 100x better than this one!
B00007KWHG|5.0|This album is great all of his generations and some after Frankie Valli will enjoy his music and sing along with all of his  great songs.
B002E01LLG|3.0|There is no real superb acting from anyone, and there is no real over the top storyline, so that makes this a just slightly above average movie. The way the movie ends leaves it open for a sequel?...but why?   Unrealistic ending, left me feeling that both Channing Tatum & Terence Howard must have had contractual obligations, or owed someone a favor, because this is most definitely not a good acting job by either one...overall I would say that it would make a good middle of the week rental, but that's it!!!
