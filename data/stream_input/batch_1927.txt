B007F7QG0Y|5.0|He was the quiet one on stage who left the antics to front-man Jagger. Yet he proves to everyone in his book that he is as colorful a person and a musician as anyone. Reckless at times it was the fine line that he walked all his life that gave him and the Stones the rainbow-like quality and their music was the pot of gold at the end of that rainbow. Music is about tension and release in a certain overall sense. Keith mastered that dichotomy in his music and playing so well. And being the great weaver of notes and melodies certainly carried over in the weaving of the tale of his life as an artist and man.

B0094M2O7C|3.0|I didn't really expect much from this film. Being that it is a fourth entry in a series that has gone through constant director/writer changes in the past and was in the hands of first time or relatively new directors, I was prepared for something like the terrible resident evil movies. But having enjoyed the last 3 I figured I would give this a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised. No it's nothing special or mindblowing but it is a decent way to kill a couple of hours.
B008ZDC7M8|1.0|I was unable to watch more than one episode because of Mark Cousin's narration. I don't know why he was allowed by his producers to be the narrator. This seems to be a very interesting documentary RUINED by the most aggravating voice since Diane Rehm. UNWATCHABLE
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King has taken a seminal event in US history and all of the conspiracy theories that go with it and made an exciting read out of it. It doesn't dive too deeply into the explanations around time travel, rather focusing on the characters of which King is known for. If you are one of the 'Constant Readers' often referred to, you'll enjoy the nods to Christine and It in this book as well. A well paced book that keeps you guessing all the way until the end. Highly recommended.

0062127241|5.0|I am a fan of The Who. Have been for years. Although, I will say that in recent years, my enthusiasm has waned mostly due to the realization that either I don't understand a lot of their lyrics or that their lyrics just don't make much sense. I'm half-way thru the audio book and am understanding more and more some of the lyrical references that have perplexed me for years. That said, however, I'm beginning to tire of Townsend's bravado and self-aggrandizement. So far, he has taken credit for feedback, \\"rock,\\" and the rock and roll lifestyle. I'm bored with his talk of Meher Baba. I'm also getting tired of hearing how he eschewed drugs and adultery while taking acid trips, smoking \\"a little grass,\\" having sex with the occasional groupie (but only because she was smart, liked Meher Baba, was pretty and may or may not have had the clap), dabbling with bi-sexuality and arrogantly mouthing off to the press, fans, promoters, Abbie Hoffman, and the police.<br />Where's Roger? To hear Pete tell it, he owns The Who and everyone else works for him and contributes their little parts to the whole but, make no mistake, it's mostly him.<br />I understand that this isn't Roger's book and he's free to write his own. This is definitely Pete's story.<br />And it's fairly interesting. I will probably keep listening. His tragic childhood contributed to his poor choices in life and helped make him the artist we have loved for decades. Occasionally he is remorseful and that is when he is most refreshing and human. To hear an old man look back and express regret for bad decisions caused by anger, stupidity, drugs, selfishness and greed draws one in and builds relationship between the author and the reader.<br />I hope there are more of those moments to come. I also hope he uses this vehicle to laud those who have contributed to his success, however if he claims he invented mp3's, I'm done.<br /><br />Just finished Who I Am and I must say...it got better and answered all my questions. Right after I wrote the previous comments about Roger, Pete spent a significant amount of time talking about his relationship with Roger and I was pleased with how he described their relationship especially as a Who fan.<br />All in all, perhaps I was too harsh 1/2 way through but I'm glad I finished. I would recommend this to any Who fan...others might not get some of the references. Some of the lines in the songs I know now make sense (\\"I'm not into your passport picture, I just like your nose\\") as you understand who or what they are talking about.<br />One final thought...get the audiobook. I can't imagine reading this without hearing Pete's laugh, asides, accent and how he says Twickenham.
0670026603|4.0|Me Before You by Jojo Moyes is another book Penguin sent me to review this month, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The prologue, a whole four pages, originally really turned me off. The story seemed shallow, the dialogue lame, and the genre bordering on chic-lit. Fortunately, I was wrong- this sort of start was purposefully done to serve as a sort of contrast to the remaining 365 pages. Me Before You is an atypical love story that also delves into the controversial world of suicide and disabilities.<br /><br />Louisa Clark loses her job at a cafe and ends up being placed through England's equivalent to unemployment as a caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic named Will Traynor. Understandably, he's angry with the world and misses his old adventurous lifestyle and successful career. Louisa, desperate for money, agrees to a six month contract, meanwhile living with her family and existing in a pretty mundane relationship with her triathlete boyfriend, Patrick. Louisa accidentally learns that Will has planned to go to Dignitas, a facility in Switzerland that helps ill people kill themselves painlessly. Louisa decides to make it her mission, with the help of Nathan, who is Will's medical assistant, to show Will that life is in fact worth living for.<br /><br />There are plenty of things to like about this book. Louisa's character is endearing, as is Will's, Nathan's, and even Louisa's parents. As a reader I wanted these characters to be happy and to find ways to overcome their obstacles. I also thought the relationships between the characters were well-done, particularly between Louisa and her younger sister Treena. They'd fight one day and then a few days later be at the pub drinking again. The book deals with some really heavy issues, but with humor and often with glimpses of happiness. The setting of a quaint little castle town is also appealing, as is the vacation they take to Mauritius (which, by the way, looks amazing). The \\"love story\\" aspect of the book didn't turn into an over-the-top romance gag fest, which I of course appreciated. The story was paced well and I never had that \\"when is it going to end?\\" feeling.<br /><br />Not to say that the book was perfect. I thought the end was incredibly predictable, which was a little disappointing. The writing itself wasn't amazing, but it was nowhere near poor or generic, either. I also thought using the boyfriend, Patrick, as a foil for Will was a bit too obvious for my liking.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend Me Before You, and I think it's the type of book that would appeal to a variety of readers. It's not a horribly challenging book, but it will make you think about your views on assisted suicide, and love and life in general.he book didn't turn into an over-the-top romance gag fest, which I of course appreciated.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|This is a delightful and exhilarating film that combines all of the pathos and excitement and over-the-top emotional resonance of classical Hollywood-style romances with a dark and gritty portrayal of life on the streets of India, all filmed in an excitingly kinetic style that combines different kinds of footage to create a hyperreal Mumbai.<br /><br />Danny Boyle ([[ASIN:B000AYW8N8 Trainspotting]], [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]], [[ASIN:B00003CWM3 The Beach]]) has really outdone himself with this one.  It is endlessly diverting, constantly surprising and yet consistent. The inventive camera movements don't so much call attention to the director as they capture a complex and confusing reality into which impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik has been thrown.<br /><br />The telling of the story is both remarkably simple and highly effective: Jamal Malik has gone further than anyone on the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\\"  Since he is a \\"slumdog\\" from Mumbai, the authorities assume he must be cheating and interrogate him harshly in order to extract a confession.  Instead, he begins to relate incidents from his harrowing life that explain exactly how he came to know each answer.  His real interest in being on the show, it turns out, is not to become wealthy but to reconnect with a lost childhood friend Latika.<br /><br />One very refreshing element of this film is that instead of making coincidence a liability -- all romantic dramas employ coincidence in order to increase the tension and excitement -- the filmmakers build the entire premise around the possibility that fate can determine a life and can bring lost loves together.  I was also impressed by the way the film paid homage to numerous traditions of filmmaking, but mostly to Bollywood cinema -- even including an exhuberant musical number.  One thing I hope for this film, in fact, is that it may serve to introduce more Western audiences to Bollywood film (many of the actors here are popular in Bollywood) and prepare them for the many delights that can be found there.Bollywood) and prepare them for the many delights that can be found there.

B008VO3PA4|2.0|I was disappointed in this little book, even for the price. There are clever poems to be written about cats and their predilections, but these are not they. The author uses a lot of asterisks in place of scatological terms. Those, and \\"pee\\" are about the extent of the wit. I guess the title should have tipped me off.Hold off on this one,and wait for something better. Given the abundance of cat videos on YouTube,I gotta believe its coming eventually.

B005GYY40W|1.0|Sorry. Stick this version back in the box. With all the time they had to explore Hugo's fabulous story, they managed only a shallow expression of the characters. Accents were all over the place and some of the scenes seemed quite unrehearsed or even unwritten with actors throwing in quaint idioms from mid-20th century.

B005LAII8K|3.0|The problem with time-travel movies is that no matter what happens, the plot holes are always there. They just don't work all that well. And because there is no actual proof that it can be done, this leaves alot of room for creative freedom. Looper takes place in the year 2044 where they don't quite have flying cars yet, but they're on the way. Joe (young Joe) is a Looper, kind of like a hired gun. Time travel has been invented(we never find out how) but it is illegal and apparently only the mob is capable of it. They hire these Loopers to \\"take care of\\" people that they send back from 30 years into the future. These Loopers make a lot of money (silver and gold) doing this gig but sometimes, they are forced to \\"close the loop\\". That pretty much entails killing off their future selves after they get sent back to the past. Yep, plot holes commence... So the drama here starts when Joe, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has to kill his future Joe, played by Bruce Willis. He hesitates, action and chaos ensues. If the Looper can't close the loop, the mob gets pretty pissed off, and they have severe means of fixing this problem.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, I'd say that this ranks as one of the better time-travel films out there, but it's pretty predictable and makes your head hurt from thinking about all the scenarios that can play out from all the time travel issues. JGL plays young Joe very convincingly and mimicks Willis' mannerisms quite well. Freakishly well in some scenes. He prevents this film from being boring or tired. Bruce Willis is, well, Bruce Willis. He pretty much plays the same role in every movie he's in so no difference here. Emily Blunt does a fine job, sans British accent as a single mom raising an interesting boy, who certainly can create further holes in this movie.<br /><br />The movie looks wonderful in Blu-ray and the soundtrack is enjoyable as well.<br />Looper is a decent film, but a frustrating one. Maybe I am thinking too much into it,but there are so many possibilities when it comes to time travel, so many theories out there, that I can't help but nitpick when something sounds or looks off. The ending just offered more questions, and nothing conclusive really happened. Still, it's worth a look.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book had just about everything I want in a good novel--a nice blend of history, mystery, good writing, interesting characters, a little romance (not steamy or sappy),  and a plot full of twists and turns.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|Is the third of a series a sequel or a threequel? And does a threequel have to be bad, especially if the sequel disappointed?<br /><br />In this time line and reality (you have to see MIB III to get the joke I just made), MIB III is definitely a hit and does not disappoint. It exceeded all my expectations and that's my favorite reality of all. (again, you have to see MIB III to get my joke). We need some history to understand why.<br /><br />My History with MIB:<br /><br />I was captivated by the original Men In Black. The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jone as K and Will Smith as J was remarkable, and the story line was tremendous fun. Here was a sci-fi adventure with lots of fancy looking gadgets, insanely complex aliens, a nasty yet hysterical villain, a ton of comedy and a happy ending -- proving that a sci-fi movie doesn't have to be all doom and gloom, horror, gore, and filled with pessimistic technobabble about the hopelessness of the future, or endless wars with evil slimy aliens intent on destroying humanity, with the humans only winning at a tremendous cost.  Here, humanity was the good guys and we won. It was brilliant.<br /><br />I wasn't so excited by the sequel, MIB II. The chemistry between Jones and Smith was still there, the aliens were there, as were the fancy gadgets and sets, but it just didn't quite come off for me. It seemed, well, tired. The ending wasn't so happy, and though there were jokes a plenty, it had a much darker mood than the original. It was the lightness of the original that made it for me. The sequel seemed too forced and was just not that great.<br /><br />Happily, along comes the threequel, MIB III, and it has it all again. In some ways, it's the best of the lot.<br /><br />Why I enjoyed it so much:<br /><br />Will Smith is again brilliant as J. He had kept in-character throughout the series and delivers his lines spot on. The jokes are fast and furious, and his expressions and body language are wonderful to watch. He makes the character fun.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones reprises his role as K, and like Smith is very consistent. He's also a delight, and as sour as K ever was, but in this film, we find out why. He's not on screen that much, but when he is, he's great. Now he has some serious competition!<br /><br />A few \\"newcomers\\" appear who are definitely worth mentioning.<br /><br />Emma Thompson as O, the new leader after Z has passed on (we don't know why he died) is excellent as a leader of the MIB. She's always just plain fun to watch. Her character is quick, and just a bit silly.<br /><br />Josh Brolin appears as the younger K (yes, this film is all about time travel and paradoxes, it can make your head spin) and carries the role off by making it his own. To be honest, I didn't know the full cast when I started watching and was partly convinced that Brolin was actually Pierce Brosnan (they look a little alike and some of Brolin's mannerisms reminded me of him). Brolin's K is a much more approachable agent of the MIB, just as funny and wise as Jone's K, but in a more human way. He's also just plain fun to watch. It looks like he's enjoying the part he plays.<br /><br />Michael Stuhlbarg almost steals the show as Griffin, the friendly alien who can see all possible futures and works with K and J to stop the villain and save the day (and the Earth from invasion). He is so animated, his eyes are so bright and his facial expressions are so open... he's an easy candidate for my favorite alien. Great actor.<br /><br />While it's easy to like the \\"good guys\\", they won't stand out much as characters unless they are up against a read baddie. And this MIB has a villain even more amazing than the original MIB I (remember the cockroach guy, hysterical but also menacing)?<br /><br />Hats off to Jemaine Clement as Boris, The Animal (actually a sort of hybrid of several alien animals in one body). He's really scary and dangerous, bent on destruction - not a complex villain with angst, he just wants tochange history so his race can invade and eat the Earth - and he's pretty much unstoppable.<br /><br />So here we have a great cast (there are others to mention, I didn't see any performance I didn't like). Do we have a great story?<br /><br />The Story:<br /><br />I can't put in any spoilers here, it would not be fair. Suffice it to say that while the story uses a number of tried and true sci-fi cliche's, it does it with a freshness that is brilliant. They put in just the right twists on the tried and true, spin it in a different direction that it kept me on my toes while watching the film, guessing, but never correctly, what was going on or what would happen next. The script and writing on this movie is top notch.<br /><br />There are jokes a plenty as one would expect, and they come fast and furious. I had to rewind and watch several segments repeatedly to savor them all.<br /><br />A few things about the story really stand out. They manage to get suspense not only because of the plot twists, but also from some extremely uncomfortable (for me anyway) visual effects.<br /><br />If you get an adrenalin rush from very high places without a net, you'll love some of the scenes in this movie. How they filmed it has me wondering! This makes not only are some of the alien bits \\"edge of your seat\\" stuff, but also some of the action sequences -- just what you'd want in an action adventure. And they don't look faked, at least, not to me! Using height to excite the audience is nothing new, but this movie does it with more of a roller coaster effect.<br /><br />The script is also very strong on heart.<br /><br />As one character says to J (I paraphrase here) \\"You must really love the guy to go through this for him\\". And that's what we get a lot of in this movie - heart. J is devoted to K as his partner. He's got his back and will do anything for him. More than that, the younger K is open to J's devotion and accepts it without curmudgeon (as we expect from the older K). But he also is a hero and must do what he must do, in spite of the risks. He can't let J's devotion stop him from fulfilling his destiny. The relationship is very touching.<br /><br />Griffin, the alien, brings a sense of wisdom to all the adventure. He delivers some very wonderful lines, memorable and touching.<br /><br />There is nothing particularly shocking in the film, just great suspense and action, plenty of surprises and the greatest surprise comes at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The writers set us up for one \\"reality\\", but what plays out is something completely different, totally unexpected, and so amazingly well done that it ties up the entire K-J relationship together in a single, poignant scene. Everything makes sense, but it comes at a surprising cost for the characters, and our emotions.<br /><br />Sets and Scenery:<br /><br />MIB III delivers here as well, with some oddities.<br /><br />The set for the MIB HQ in our present day has been upgraded. Unfortunately, the HQ now looks like it was designed by APPLE engineers. Everything is white, silver and glass with very little color anywhere. Yes, this contrasts with the \\"black\\" of Men In Black, but I would have enjoyed the HQ being less \\"Applish\\". Apple is a great company, but why does it have to be imitated in so many sci-fi movies (i.e. Star Trek, the alternate Enterprise bridge)?<br /><br />Nevertheless there are a few sight gags in the sets. For example, look closely at O's office. I don't want to give the joke away, but most of the time, we see it in parts, an edge here, an interior shot there, bits and pieces of it. However, when J leaves it to start on his rescue of K, the camera backs off enough that we see the entire office and its shape. That shape will look very familiar. Hint: This is a movie about aliens in more ways than one!<br /><br />The MIB HQ in the past (1969) is a great homage to architect Frank Lloyd Wright. To get that, you have to look at images of the interior layout of the JohnsonWax building that Wright designed.<br /><br />That's an interesting view, but there is a huge joke in the HQ as well. To get it, you have to have seen MIB I and remember where the cockroach's escape spaceship comes from. In a very quick pan of the MIB HQ of 1969, you'll see it again as the camera makes a pan across the room.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />MIB III is an unexpected delight. It has everything I want in a lighthearted and entertaining sci-fi movie. The acting is brilliant, the writing and sets... well, let's just say I thought the whole thing was brilliant. Entertaining, engrossing, kept me guessing, and it has just the right touch of heart to make it a \\"I'm really glad I saw it.\\" movie.<br /><br />And a note about Amazon.<br /><br />I watched this on Amazon Instant Video as a 24 hour rental based on a Christmas gift certificate I received.<br /><br />Once again, Amazon comes through with an easy purchase.

B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Sometimes you get what you pay for.  It is impossible to use this as anything more than a clock without a constant barrage of requests to upgrade. The alarm function is confusing. Having set one alarm I found I could not be sure if it was on or off. When I set another one, I could not get rid of the first one. Then I realized that the clock was off. Perhaps it was a battery problem or my Internet connection, but after the first day, I knew I could not rely on the accuracy of the clock. Some kind of warning would helped, but there was none. I ended up removing this from my Kindle Fire HD.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Really liked the music.  Mostly bought this for my son since it was his idea but I listen to it also.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|A good watch. In the near, dark future a man must close his loop (kill a future version of himself). The problem is that his future self is darn hard to kill. Drugs, violence, and telekinetics are all a part of the future. It was a good story from start to finish and the acting was well done. I recommend this movie to all Sci Fi and Action movie watchers.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This app really blew my mind I mean this is so freaking awesome  I love this app. I love this app
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Got the app for my grandson but he cannot read yet so when he plays I have to turn off wifi so he will not make purchases. Then I do the visit friends which often freezes the Kindle or the connection times out. This app has some issues but my grandson still really enjoys playing so we try and work around the issues.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An excellent read....does not get mired down in theological references (as does &#34;Heaven Is For Real&#34;). A genuine, intriguing, well written story.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|We ran out of things to do over the holidays and took a chance on downloading Pitch Perfect.  What a great surprise.  One of those sleepers that draw you in and have you laughing before you know it.  Funny, human, just enough comedic drama to be entertaining.  Wasn't sure my husband or mom would enjoy, but they laughed throughout.  (though my husband wanted the boys to win--of course).  Well done casting, writing and producing.  First movie with younger actors we've seen in awhile that was worth while.  Thanks.
030758836X|5.0|I'm not quite done with this book (on page 340) but I can't put it down! Some good twists and turns. Can't wait to see how it ends!
159420411X|5.0|With humor and brilliantly enlightening, but understandable analogies...Mr FiveThirtyEight has written a elegant book on maths uses. Though dense and full of information, Silver makes the information both understandable and, egad-amusing even. If I'd known math was so fun I might have gone further than algebra.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it kept me interested with the twists and turns. It has a few different plots going on at once since it is a girl telling about the life of mrs. Winter but that only made it Better in my opinion. The only bad thing I have to say about this book is that at times the author was a little verbose during her descriptions of places.
B003UBTX72|4.0|If you like history of music the book is a great read.  It tells the stories behind the songs and Richard's life as well.
B0088O11NU|1.0|I got this game on my kindle fire but when I got to the forth level it restarted itselfe I was so mad<br />if I spelled  some words wrong I'm not a good speller
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed the other two books in The Hunger Games trilogy and thus was extremely disappointed with this one.  Katniss was not the hero she had become in the other books.  In this book she was selfish, whiney and redundant.  I read more than half the book still waiting for her redeeming qualities to emerge, but they didn't.  I waited the whole book for a better story line between her, Peeta and Gale but that never happened.  Overall, very, very disappointing.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Children,adults,WWII,the future,monsters and love...very good read. I really enjoyed this book,because it was different...<br /> recommend this book. A good read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  Lots of fun to play and customizable. I have not had any of the typical force closing problems other games are plagued with.  Great game.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Beautifully illustrateda, story line very well done and unique, easy to navigate, hints were unlimited. Only rated 4 because advertised as a free app but once i downloaded &amp; played required 2.99 to complete the game. Not terribly expensive for a game of this quality yet missleading to the customer.  Overall a good game. They did offer the sequel if you rated it @ the end.<br />I guess I'll find out if that was a missleading statement as well. Don't dissapoint your customers G5 &amp; stand by your word. Your customers will appreciate that more than you know!.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great.  I loved the backstory, I loved the characters, and I loved the overall plot.  I quickly got involved with the story and I couldn't put it down.  There is many things that could be said about the story, such as it is a classic tale of the underdog facing down the oppressing forces of the establishment, that it is a tale of innosence
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I got this item for free from Amazon, because it was not included in my Kindle purchase, thought because I bought the recharger that it was not given to me, this review is more a reflection of Amazon's customer service rather than a product review, not only did Amazon send me this for free but also gave me a $30.00 voucher to use as I pleased, that is why I am slowly becoming an Amazon regular. Thanks Amazon, and may your business get bigger and more profitable...
B003O86FMW|5.0|The continuance of the Hunger Games series of books, and as I said with my review of the first book – what more can I say.  This story is a great follow up to the first book and I again became enthralled with the life of Katness Everdeen and her friends.  As sequels go this book is just as good as the first one and just as powerful in pulling emotional responses from the reader.  Read it and enjoy it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read most of the Mitch Rapp series from Vince Flynn, and I am never disappointed. A friend of mine had given me Consent to Kill a few years ago and I was hooked. Thank you Mr. Flynn for sharing your talents with the world. I am looking forward to the next Rapp book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|First off, this is a great book and a superb finale to the Hunger Games series of books.  The author has done a wonderful job of continuing her tale through until its end.  It is a story that should be read.  This said, Mockingjay is not your traditional ending to a classic tale.  Oh the hero wins at the end but the price shocked me.  I will say that the author definitely understands PTDS and has portrayed it well within the pages of this final installment of the Hunger Games.  To anyone just about to read this book, be warned - this is not a happy tale where right wins out over wrong and the good triumphs in the end.  It is however a fantastic look at the trauma of war and the impact it has on people, both the participants and those caught up in chaos that accompanies 'total war'.  It is a dark, emotional tale that could rattle your enjoyment of the tale.  Still it is a excellent story and you should read it.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This was a very good story, entertaining and also teaching lessons-  something for all ages. I enjoyed this and would recommend to any audience.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I agree with the previous person. I was annoyed as well.<br />The category says Customer Review not Movie Review. We now have a ship date (March 26th)so I have changed my feedback. This is an excellent series. Worth the time to watch.
1419705849|5.0|While the book was late, and did not get here for my grandson's birthday, when he got and read the book, he did love it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Good until the last 100 pages! The author could have condensed the ending. I also don't buy Salander's transformation at the end.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read The Book Thief for an upcoming book club meeting.  When I learned it was classified as young adult fiction, I wasn't sure I wanted to read it; however, I found it totally engrossing and emotionally affecting. The book certainly did not shy away from the horrors of the war, it made it more horrifying by drawing the characters so fully and describing daily life in exquisite detail. Using Death as an impartial narrator made the sadness and loss stand out even more. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this author.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What is it about Colleen Hoover that gets me to cry every time? First with Slammed and Point of Retreat and now Hopeless? This book was amazing. How she can make two people so perfect for each other and come alive on paper is incredible, you are right there with them. I lived it ;) I love all her neat combinations of words and things she comes up with like in Slammed my favorite was \\"I choose the Lake\\" from his poetry and in Hopeless it's the word between like and love, Colleen is gifted with words that's all I can say.<br /><br />The further the story got the more I started to think this book might not come back around and be ok but she has a way to make a story come full circle full of love and healing, that's why you cry from heartache and also the healing and putting things back together. This was an amazing story hard at times to read but one that will effect you and you will fall in love with Holder and Sky and be glad that they have each other.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Christmas gift for my son.  I had never seen this movie before, but it was very good. My son loves it.
0345522303|5.0|I am in love with the characters. I  can't wait for their next adventure! Lynn always keeps the story interesting and<br />exiting.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I have been looking for the complete set for quite some time.  My husband is a huge fan.  The price was reasonable, so I did not hesitate.  We have been married for almost 23 years and he told me that this was by far the biggest surprise and one of the best gifts I ever gave him.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Love this book. First book I have read in a while and I couldn't put it down, definite page turner.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved the book because of the adventures and excitement and can't wait to rear the next book of the series
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Mother in law just loves the celtic woman.  Was a really great choice for her gift.  Would order any time again
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless<br />Writing a review that will do this book justice is truly hopeless.  I am finding that the books I love the most are sometimes the hardest for me to review.  How do I put into words the feelings that an amazing book brings on?  I finished Hopeless last night, slept on it, thought about it all day and still, I am not sure how to express my feelings about this story.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Colleen Hoover, you're probably a fan.  After reading Slammed and Point of Return I was.  After reading Hopeless, I am a Colleen Hoover junkie.  This author seriously knows how to hypnotize the reader into worshiping the characters she has created; they will weave themselves into your brain and more importantly your heart...every time.  But, out of all three of her books, Dean Holder & Sky Davis take the cake.  Their story is more than the average bear...it has seared a mark on my heart.<br /><br />I wish I could tell you more about why this book touched me, but to do so would honestly ruin the intense discovery of their story.  Taking this journey was like putting together a puzzle; it kept me guessing until that last piece was put into place.  I had suspicions, fears and hopes of what might happen but it didn't prepare me for how I FELT about the final unveiling of what really did happen.  In a word it was: intense.<br /><br />This book made me:  smile, extremely sad, angry, giddy, swoon, gave me butterflies, feel scared about what I was witnessing but most of all it made me hopeful.  I kept thinking to myself do Dean Holder & Sky Davis exist in the real world?  Could two people honestly be this brave and strong?  Could two people be this resilient?  Could two people find such beauty in the face of profound ugliness and sadness?  I have decided yes.  I HAVE to believe that because it was so beautiful and moving that I can't bear the thought of them not truly existing somewhere out there. To not believe, would be simply devastating.  I took strength from their story that I will hold onto and try not to ever forget.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very nice quality. For some reason the 2nd movie won't work on the Blu ray. Think it might be the player tho and not the movie.
B005F82X48|5.0|We saw them at Creation Fest 2012.  We only caught the last half of their act but we decided to buy the CD.  Every song is good and that is rare.  They're supposed to release their second CD in 2013 and I can't wait
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Overal, I was looking forward to a better, more believeable story line. Tthis one realy got way out of hand and for the most part was Not believable. Looks to me like they had a tough time concluding this book. Not their best by a long shot!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|great classic and great to have in e-reader form to take with me on trips or anywere i may go by far one of my favorite books
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Great plot and better action all tied together in a tight plot. The old tom C. Is back with great action and great technical writing. Too bad about Jack Jr. And his girlfriend---i personally would have liked that story line to continue.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|great classic and great to have in e-reader form to take with me on trips or anywere i may go
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|While not Peter Jackson quality, this is definitely a very well done movie.  Hopefully Microsoft will follow up on this line of stories - perhaps go back to the Fall of Reach or even the beginning of the Spartan program.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved Flynn's first 2 novels and this book was even better. I was guessing all the way to the end.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Great music to read by, sew by or just plain listening. It's a great mix of the music mentioned in the books.  Thomas Tallis music and BDSM that might be a stretch.
B00122HPDU|5.0|I can't get enough of this album! I listen to it all the time. Michael Buble does a great job with old classic songs.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Truly makes you believe in the magic of love. Always a great author, never disappointed. This book has you in suspense, yet leaves you in tears.
030758836X|4.0|A friend of mine recommended this with the words \\"You have to read this book, it is insane!\\" and I am struggling to find a better word than insane (in a good way) to review this book.<br /><br />An author I had never heard of until I heard of the phenomenon sweeping the nation that was the must read book of Gone Girl.  To me, this was enough to put me off reading it.  I hate books that are so hyped up that every bloody person is reading them but I trusted my friend and put my name down on the library hold list to read this book whenever it became free.  I was number 297 on the hold list so I left it there didn't hold my breath and got on with my life.<br /><br />Anyway, just before Christmas I dully got the email from the library saying it was waiting to be picked up.  I very nearly didn't read it as I had a number of other books lined up waiting to be read (not in the usual way general way but in a more specific plan for various groups and series).  Obviously, I did end up reading this or I would be reviewing fresh air!<br /><br />It is insane.  The story keeps you sucked in throughout and wanting to read just one more chapter, which was very easy as the chapters were varying lengths but all quite short.  To'ing and Fro'ing between Amy and Nick in each chapter it sets out a story of a whodunnit where you alternate between liking and hating each of the two main characters in equal amounts as you read another chapter.  At first I had no idea where it was going so the first twist was quite a surprise.  The second twist a bit predictable but I thought that was the point to keep you wondering how it was all going to end.<br /><br />The ending was the weakest part as it felt slightly unfinished to me, although I get that was probably the authors point.  It just somehow was missing something for me.  Definitely a good book but not the best in the world. 4 out of 5 for the sheer uniqueness of it.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Cute movie. Good music score. Fun two hours for a few bucks. The only glitch was the movie streaming due to insufficient bandwidth.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Likes it,I didn't really like them making her weak in this book. The first one will always be the best of course
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|If you're expecting an action movie full of action, you won't be totally disappointed. Like Arnie's movie, it's based on the short story &#34;We can remember it for you wholesale&#34; but the overall problem is that it's a remake and other than the fact that this version isn't based on - or connect to - Mars, it's very predictable. Both leading women are pretty, Colin ain't ugly and you can mostly believe in their characters. Unfortunately, if you have also seen I Robot.... you can't tell where the book begins and other Science Fiction movies end. Also felt like Minority Report was another favorite of the director. Overall, give it 3 stars because it's an action movie, not a thoughtful film. :-)
0307388921|3.0|I'm half way though and I'm just not feeling this Palahnuik guy yet.<br />He's supposed to be freaking epic and amazing, but I'm just... Not seeing it yet.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Usually when you mix drugs and school the two don't go together, but the way that this show is done is extremely intriguing. It has kept my attention and I really enjoy watching!
B007THA4FI|4.0|This ain't no Harry Potter. Rowling has developed interesting characters grounded in reality and created unexpected social interactions. This is worth reading
B006OAB432|5.0|This is definetly the album of 2012.  The music is great, also I purchased the album on vinyl for my new turntable and it is the only new record that I purchased that didn't have even the slightest edge warp, right out of the package.  I was quite happy and impressed by that, as my other slightly warped albums don't spin or play as well as this one.  There really isn't any other music like Some Nights out right now, and I definetly recommend it to everyone who hasn't heard it!<br /><br />Also, if you are into playing vinyls, purchasing the vinyl of this is a great deal because it comes with a CD of the album as well, and both for just about $25, so it is a great purchase!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Slow going at first and then bam you're hooked!<br />Very suspenseful and unexpected ending.  Read it and love it too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|IT TOK ME A WHILE TO GET TO IT AS I WAS INVOLVED IN OTHER BOOKS, AND IT IS SEASON DOWN IN FLORIDA, SO WAS VERY BUSY, BUT OMG DID  ILOVE THIS BOOK. GOT SO INTO IT I WOULD READ IT EVERY WHERE AND LSITEND WHILE I DROVE... AMAZING BOOK.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great graphics, easy and fun gameplay, and free. What else do you need? Get it now,you have nothing to lose.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I was rather impressed by it, it was a little hard to vet use to it at first but after a while I found it very enjoyable a great game.e for people wanting weapon drops, the control is a little weird to use but not bad enough to hate it, the graphics were cool too, very well designed weapons and demons, I think I'm close to the word minimum soon, nope not yet, I really think it's  been twenty words by now I'm sure about it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have maybe written 3 reviews on the many many books I have read.  When I take the time to write a review that means that the book has to be over the top good...well let me just say that this author is AMAZING!  She was able to capture you from the beginning all the way to literally the last word of the book.  I have never been so taken back by a storyline like this one.  It was a true page turner at every chapter.  I even had to stop at one point and re-read something so shocking that I could not even believe was true.  The connection between Sky and Holder was unbelievably beautiful!<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone that wants to be captivated by an amazing storyline.  I hope that Colleen continues writing these amazing books because I will definitely be downloading them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was one of the best stories I have read in a long time.  WOW - I really am speechless.  I felt giddy, happy, scared, sad, afraid and every other feeling under the sun!  Now that is what I call a good book!  Execellent - A+++++++++++++++++++
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Wonderful actors, beautifully written.  I'm on my second viewing of all the episodes.  I can't wait for season 3 to start!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Came as expected, enjoyed the set. quality was great and family enjoyed it. Have books and videos. Great for those days stuck inside
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My 3 year old Granddaughter just loves this Movie.  Having a female heroine is perfect for her.  the first time she watched it she turned to Grandma and said, &#34;Grandma, can I go their and play too&#34; .
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Amazon is a good source to watch streaming videos. The movie itself could of been a whole lot better if Ted the &#34;toy bear&#34; was the main focal point of the movie, instead of Mark Wahlberg.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I am always fascinated when a book is written in first person. I think this was a very clever format, using the letters to the anonymous \\"friend\\" as a conduit for the story. All in all it was pretty good and I enjoyed it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the trilogy.  It was a great read.  I liked the characters and storylines.  I would recommend it to those who love romantic fiction.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent story.  Very engaging.  I would recommend this to all who enjoy these stories.  Would have liked a slightly better ending.
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|I should have purchased this movie instead of renting it because I already would like to watch it again. Great blend of history and love story.
B002UPQ1P6|5.0|This is good stuff.  Classic from the time of real hard core rock and roll from the long haired dudes.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Very Creative CD. This is what Hip Hop is about Wacka Flocka, Lil Wayne, & Meek Millz! Pay attention the rappers I just named u might learn somethning!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This is a very good app to control laptop from kindle as well as from iPod in home network with free version. Very easy to setup and control the lappy.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|And they still are the best band in the world. The sound quality is amazing and the band sounds as good as ever.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I felt every emotion that the characters were feeling. I couldn't put the book down!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Hard to believe this happened nearly 30 years ago.  It's a classic with great performances, a dual-venue concert organized by Bob Geldof to raise funds for relief of the ongoing Ethiopian famine. Billed as the &#34;global jukebox&#34;, the event was held simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read this book and book one and I really hated them both. I wish I could get the time back I spent on these books but I can't. There is a lot of repetitive phrases, lip biting, sardonic smiles, and silly irrational worrying and mood swings. I don't even know why I spent the time reading book 2 when the 1st one was so terrible. I think I was just really curious as to why these books were so popular I still don't know.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie a long time.<br />Batman showed very good and i am thankful for it.<br />i will be ordering more movies when i get a chance.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|It was in perfect condition.  Brand new, nothing had been opened. It came just as it was listed. And was a big hit for my son's Christmas!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I could hardly put this down. It had just the right amount of new people and situations mixed in with the &#34;usuals&#34;. I don't know how he keeps coming up with new plots and keeps each book so fresh but this is another example of Flynn's masterful writing skills. Highly recommend!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Dark Arcana was a fun game to play.  The games were challenging enough to hold my attention.  The story was intriguing enough to get me to pay the extra $2.99 for the full version.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|This movie is a great \\"Cinderella\\" story. It reminds us all that we need to follow our heart. The characters are over the top, the dancing is great in light of Dancing with the Stars and the ending could not have been better. The back story on how the movie was finally made was fascinating as well.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Loved this game. Challenging yet fun. Almost couldn't figure out level 81. Definitely would recommend. Sorry I beat all 100 levels. Wish there were more to play.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I just had a bit of trouble at the beginning getting to know all the characters and keeping them straight in my head and as a result my interest wavered a bit, but by the time I finished the book I was highly invested in the lives of these characters and the outcome of their actions and words. Several moments in the Harry Potter series made me cry but I cried longer and harder for some of the people in this book. Trust me, stick with this book, it's reinforced my belief that I'll always read Rowling books
B0048P7BAU|5.0|This recording was made in the late 60's and has never been outdone  It must be as perfect as Wagner himself heard it in his head. Awesome performances from everyone and stellar orchestral playing!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|The app does what it is supposed to do, which is download YouTube videos. It did lock up on me once, but I was able to clear the cache and restart it. The mp3 download function does not actually convert video to mp3 format it just saves video with an mp3 extension. This still allows it to play in the music player but the file size is rather large and it may not work on other devices. I'm overall pleased with the app.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book. First one on my new kindle. I would recommend it for some good quick reading.  I would choose this author again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I don't want it to be over. It is impossible to put this book down I could read all night and I do!
B005VPRF0M|4.0|This set included a great set of lego mini figures for any collector. I'm a huge fan of legos as well as Batman, so if you add them together you automatically get something awesome. This set is not a complicated build but offers great details with both the Bat Wing as well as the Joker copter. One thing I was impressed with was the ladder that joker hangs from. It was such a simple addition but added something a little extra to the set. To recreate the end of the first Batman movie by Tim Burton this is a perfect set for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like all the different types of games. The variety was unexpected from a free app. Definitely worth the download. Most of the games great a few not so much.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Riviting, timely, a page turner for sure!! Could hardly wait for this book to be published.  I have read all of Vince Flynn's books.<br />When I sit down with one of his books, its like sitting down with an old friend.  I can hardly wait to see what Mitch Rapp is up to next.  I highly recommend this latest effort from Flynn.  I was in no way disappointed.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Bought because fiancé loved the move and couldn't find it in the store and she loves it will recommend it to others
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all of the new food and drink recipes that I can pin!  So fun and easy!  It's the Best and it's free!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|its a good time killer when your bored.I loved it.I am 9 years old and I am not sick of Hello Kitty or Sanrio.I also want to say to those people who are having problems I hope the problem gets better. :)
B001C4CI8U|5.0|There are only 3 shows that I have really gotten into over the last year or so. The walking Dead, Dr. Who and Fringe. This show is amazing. It sort of reminds me of the X-Files. Some people I have talked to said that it got too weird and they stopped watching it. Personally, I like it when it gets weird (e.g. Werecupine, what an awesome scene). It can stay grounded and stray into the extraordinary and still be a fantastic watch. Highly recommended.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like that you can play on your mobile device and still link with Facebook!  Good storyline and hidden objects, too bad they made that part a little more challenging.  Only 3 items to find.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie. It's so great to see a disney movie that is not about romantics. Instead it's a very unique and sweet story about a mother and daughter. The detail and graphics were excellent and the cast really drew me into the story. I really enjoyed watching this over and over again with my four year old niece who like to act like the little bear brothers, while I personally and secretly wish that I had Merida's archery skill, (and her beautiful Shire horse.:)) Definitely full of giggles, thrills, suspense and even a touching tear jerker moment.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|You hear comparisons to 50 Shades, but to me this book is so much better. The characters had a much better connection.
0385536828|4.0|this spy story is a sort of reflection on the spy genre since each time you think you've got ahead of the writer, that is that you know where he's going, he manages to pull you back to just where he wants you to be: He's figured out who his readers are and really does stay one step ahead.
B009E3EY4M|1.0|Blue ray would not play. Tried it in 2 different players !  Regular CD is working fine and sounds great
B00009P1MP|5.0|I've been playing this album for 40 years since it came out in the 70's<br />first as a vinyl (which I still have) then as a tape (which I still have)<br />and now on the cd support I play it in my car, studio, kitchen... any place. When I recently mentioned to my 32 year old son that I'd finally purchased a cd he told me that I had given him a cd of American Pie when he was 21. So, I guess that means I even give it as a gift! And Don McLean came to the Jazz Festival here in Montreal this summer but he didn't sing &#34;Vincent&#34; so it's a good thing I have the recording!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed ready this . I am truly a believer of things happen for a reason, good or bad, but at the end it all works out for the best
B0091QSNEE|4.0|Tried the free download and my kid loved it.  Now he thinks he's a real chef.  He'd ask me, \\"what do you want me to make?  Smoothie or Soup?\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, I bought the full version.  My son played it for a few days, but now he doesn't play it that much.  But I figured I would've gladly payed $2 at the arcade; so $2 is no big deal.  Good game!<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Nice graphics.<br />+ Easy for kids to play.<br />+ Captures and retains their imagination.<br />+ Cute.<br />+ Boys and Girls can enjoy it.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- No true educational value.<br />- Needs more recipes.
B004KKX80A|1.0|A well marketed toy that is a new spin on an old toy from yester years.  It is nothing more than a spinning top.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The game is beautifully. Is simple to play, I love play it. Buy it and you see what I mean.
B009NTNHJU|3.0|GREAT songs. Everything was awesome, but the DVD included is supposed to play 18 songs, instead its just a camera following NM everywhere on tour. No concert footage or anything! Just her and Lil Wayne talking. Wheres the 18 songs???? The DVD is a joke. Why even bother? I expected for double price, 16$ That the DVD should have the 18 songs on the back like it says. Now the price is cut in half? Thanks!
030758836X|2.0|The book had a good plot idea but just fizzled and had a non-ending - the author just stopped without any real closer.<br />I know some will disagree with me, but it also seemed the author threw in a hundred &#34;f*** words just to have word count they weren't really necessary for the story line.
0240815807|5.0|This book has left no stone untouched from the small pebbles to the massive rocks that studio mixing is based upon. GREAT!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my first review! Woohoo! I felt so up and about after finishing 1-5. I didn't want it to end, while also desperately needed to know how Hugh's oddly-wired brain would decide to leave his readers. I'm so happy that I stumbled upon this book, and wonder how long after I would find another gem like it. Thanks Howard Hugh for this gift!

B00A2GQIHG|5.0|while still alive, Whitney Houston produced a double album set of her greatest hits. The first disc contained the original versions that appeared as they were on the radio single. The second disc was a horribly overwrought collection of remixes and alternate arrangements. A travesty. Now comes this gem! All original versions splendidly presented as they were meant to be. Songs are presented in basically chronological order. The only misstep was making this a one disc rather than two collection. As a result, many of her hits have been left off. What I did to remedy this was to combine the two different collections into one incredible playlist! The extra work is well worth it and this will be one of my favorites for this new year.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This deserves a five out of five because this tragically romantic novel will make  you laugh, gasp, smile, frown,cry throughout the book. You will not want to put this book down whatsoever. I recommend this wonderful Novel to anybody who is into romance and understands the hardships of life.
B008KW43TE|2.0|his mixture of straight singing combined with a bit screechy falsetto and along with a weird fascination with the final sound caused me to buy this disc. I'm still trying to decide if it was a good deal or a total waste of money. I bought the album because of the single Thinkin Bout You, the best song on the disc. Unfortunately I was tired of that one in less than a week.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Yet another truly tough heroine. I have been grinding my way through dystopia novels, meeting the tough babes who populate this environment. If you want to read about ultra-tough, try Kameron Hurley's take on the subject. OMG I don't think that the fully articulated tough babe has appeared yet. I'm waiting.
B0063B2BNE|3.0|Of all the seasons of this show (and we've seen every one), we fans of Bones were least impressed with this one. Booth especially gets annoying and things don't add up.
B007MHVVCU|4.0|Sound familiar. More witches and magic. One part of the formula is missing though, the part where it's better if the kid carrying  the weight of a story is likable. I think that there are four other kids and books to get the job done. I might or might not find out.
0307596885|5.0|I am biased about this writer. I think she's magnificent. This is a masterpiece of characterization and fascinating subtlety. I recommend it highly.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I simply loved the kids in this book. I liked the problem at the center of the story. I enjoyed the ups and downs on the road to the solution. I liked the ending. It was all good
B005HJWWW8|4.0|This thing works just as it's supposed to for me. No problems like some of the other recent reviews.<br /><br />It's not going to make crappy headphones sound great and not going to power super-high impedance headphones that well by itself.<br /><br />I'm using them to power my cans at work, where the soundcard just wasn't quite loud enough and seemed to clip at higher volumes. I can't say they sound incredibly better, as it's kind of a pain to A/B, but it's nice knowing I now have the extra power to not clip at higher volumes. This thing is loud! (my headphones are 32ohms, i believe).<br /><br />Before the Fiio, with some tracks at my desk I'd have to go full blast or close to it for a desired listening level. Now I can't get anywhere near that! Volume problem definitely solved.<br /><br />To me, this amp was nearly worth it for the volume control alone. I hate having to go into my tabs or media player to change the volume at my desk when someone comes by or I have to get the phone or something.<br /><br />I think the EQ settings on this thing are all but useless, but they might work if your headphones are really crappy and you have absolutely no other method for controlling your sound.<br /><br />Since I don't need this amp at home (I really don't see a reason to use an amp if you have a stereo receiver or decent media player), I just plug this thing in to charge when I leave work and it's ready to go when I get back! I've used it for the whole work day with no signs of it running out of juice. I wish it had a battery indicator of some kind, but it seems that this won't really be an issue. Also it's nice that the unit seems to stop charging when it's done, so when I come to work the light is off.  I'm not sure if other electronics continue to charge when they're full and the indicator light stays on, but I bet that isn't ideal for the battery. It's nice knowing this one is done charging!<br /><br />So yes, this is a good unit if you have a reason to get one. If you just want your music to sound better and have no issues regarding actual POWER, don't buy one of these.  It's going to sound the same.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Get it if you intend to put your writing on Kindle.  It is a good start as poor design and errors can make a good book hard to read and be the cause of bad reviews.  The odds of success are against you, so at least get the mechanics right.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great application for people who like solving quests. If you don't want to buy the full version, I would not even try the free trial. It is addictive!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was ok, not the best book I've ever read.  & Honestly, some of the erotica was a little over the top.  The character development wasn't the best.  The story was ok, but hardly believable.
B002361MLA|4.0|Great inspirational book.  Really makes you take a look at yourself.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their inner self.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I felt it  followed the book.  It gave my son greater understanding to the book.  It was a great addition to our movie collection
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This gets six stars but they only give me the choice of five. This story was the best I've ever read, up until this point it didn't believe so, but it truly is. If you're looking for something to read I recommend this for you. You'll get sucked in.<br /><br />Dear John Green,<br />Thank you for making me cry, but also thank you for giving me hope that there is an 'Augustus Waters' out there for me,<br />Sincerely, you're fantastic.
B0035JGYZS|4.0|One of the better Next Generation movies.  Love how the franchise finale faced off with the Romulans.  A fine finish to one of my favorite shows.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|I really liked this book because it was completely detailed and the pictures put the story together. This book was so interesting and exciting that I would read it again if I could!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|And totally fascinating!  Couldn't put it down.  I immediately hopped on amazon and bought the next two books.  Can't wait for the end of the stories.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Another good effort, very enjoyable. The villain is just over the top enough, not too much of a lift from the comics. I'd watch this again.<br />You have my permission to die, errr, enjoy this movie.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you Kindle deals!!!  This is excellent science fiction!  The extremely detailed and well-developed world of the silo is fascinating.  I was totally engrossed through all 5 of the books.  Great plot, great characters, great vision of a post-apocalyptic world!
B003UESJEM|5.0|It's a good story and it has an inspiring end.  Not so sure, though, how realistic the end is.  The actors kept me captivated!

B002NQ3AAQ|4.0|Great acting, a good story and picturesque locale make this a movie worth watching.  For kids that have the fire to do something different, it's a must.  Well done.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Having personally experienced a &#34;NDE&#34; while on life support, the descriptions are eerily similar--but the good Doc is a surgeon not an author--really chopped up story line and hard to &#34;get to the end&#34; but worth the read

B009XTF8JM|4.0|There's been a rash of exorcism-style films these last few years.  Some of them have been good, and, naturally, some of them have been bad.  It could be that this trend is little more than an industry going through its creativity cycle, rediscovering some of what produces more authentic scares from yesteryear - that being stories grounded in reality - for audiences who've grown accustomed to and thus dismissive of more special-effects-heavy gore.  I tend to believe that there's something a bit different going on; I think that we - as a society - tend to reach out for a renewal of these spirits-inhabiting-another tales when we're going through some cultural upheavals.  Instead of accepting that Tinseltown drives us, I prefer to think that we tap find these special places all on our own.  Then, some clever scriptwriters trap lightning in a bottle, and viola!  That same ol' exorcism is now back in vogue!<br /><br />(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to my last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)<br /><br />Clyde Brenek (played by the reliable Jeffrey Dean Morgan) recently separated from his wife, Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick).  When their youngest daughter, Emily (Natasha Calis), begins displaying some weirdly erratic behaviors, they and her school are quick to chalk it all up to the inevitable side effect of a marriage in collapse.  However, the girl's creeping obsession with an ornate, antique wooden box she picked up from a yard sale borders on the insane.  As Clyde begins to research more about the item, he realizes he has something very tragic and very unique in his possession: it's known as a Dibbuk box.  It's meant to contain a dislocated spirit.  To his dismay, Em has opened the box, and now the entity is slowly devouring her soul.<br /><br />Director Ole Bornedal manages to squeeze a bit more life out of the traditional exorcism picture by sticking with mostly classical film techniques - inexorably slow pans and eases and tricks with light and shadow - whereas a more contemporary director would've tried to likely incorporate some CGI sequences.  There's nothing big and bold here.  This is traditional filmmaking, and it works.  By sticking with what's tried and true, Bornedal elevates the story to that of legitimacy, letting the script from Juliet Snowden and Stiles White effectively breathe in that atmosphere.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't hurt matters that the tale heavily straddles some common family issues - dad and mom are divorced, the kids are getting used to the separation, mom has another man in the picture whilst dad is considering relocating elsewhere for work - as these all tend to complement the dynamic of not only a family but also a greater society in flux.  That dynamic gives more credibility to an undercurrent that's unsettling, giving these characters some added depth.  It all adds up in creating an environment where a spectral entity could, perhaps, seek out and find residence amongst the weak, so it's clear that all players have done their homework in legitimizing the stresses.<br /><br />In fact, most of THE POSSESSION works precisely because it comes across as heavily grounded in real events.  (Indeed, the script is based on actual occurrences, though the accompanying documentary - a special feature - gives a much different accounting of events.)  The smart script never cheapens the relationships; the production team never resorts to flashy pyrotechnics to get across the frights; and what emerges is a welcome return to the good, old-fashioned, conventional ghost story.  There's evil out there, and it needs one of us in order to be free.  It's all made cohesive through the commitments of a solid cast and crew.<br /><br />THE POSSESSION (Rated PG-13) is produced by Ghost House Pictures and North Box Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.  As for the technical specs, the film looks and sounds remarkable; there are a few moments when I cranked up the center volume to hear some of the ghost's whispery dialogue, but, alas, there's nothing the audience needs to hear specifically.  The disc has two separate commentary tracks - the first is from Bornedal, and the second is from scriptwriters Snowden and White.  Furthermore, there's a brief documentary explored the truth behind the fiction, treating viewers to a look at the real Dibbuk Box.  Also, there's an assortment of trailers.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I didn't see how THE POSSESSION really brought anything all that new, novel, or unique to the `exorcism' genre, but there's something to be said for legitimate creepiness in the age of special effects.  Still, it's better than most films of this sort that have come along in quite some time.  There are some very solid moments grounding the picture between the players - Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Natasha Calis, especially - that elevate the story to another level.  Additionally, there's a lot of solid camera work that helps work up the tension to palpable levels, though some of the trickery falls predictably thin in the climax.  Worth its scares in gold, though.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE POSSESSION for the expressed purposes of completing this review.ION (Rated PG-13) is produced by Ghost House Pictures and North Box Productions.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I love jigsaw puzzles so grabbed this freebie and play when I'm trying to wind down and go to sleep. View of available pieces is very limited, some distortion so pieces fit that don' t look like they would. It's a game. I got it for free, and at that price it's worth it.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|My first time seeing The Phantom of the Opera.  It was totally entertaining!  I'm a tad slow so the end confused me.  I'll watch it again and probably catch on!  :-)
B00A2FSSHK|5.0|Great movie, destined to be listed as one of the great futuristic thrillers of all time. A must see for avid movie watchers!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good follow up novel.  Lots of action and typical Reacher.  Tom Cruise doesn't portray him well in the movie Jack Reacher.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book, I stayed up late and read it through in one sitting! I hope the rest of the series compares favorably.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I had to read it in high school and now 40 years later, I read it again. Very good book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is probably the best app I have ever downloaded.  I got it a few months ago, and I was surprised at how much fun it was.  You can pin all of your favorite things, and organize them onto pretty boards.  Once you get started, it's hard to stop.  After a few weeks, I told my friend about it and she was instantly hooked. Now all my friends and I share our favorite things and we love it so much. I would encourage you to get this app, it's amazing!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from Tycho of Penny-Arcade.  I'm certainly glad I did.  I could hardly stop reading.  The writing is at a very high level, with an expansive vocabulary, including several invented languages.  The plot unfolds at a consistent pace without any appreciable slow spots.  For once, I have no complaint over the cost of the Kindle edition.  This book is worth $10 so that the author can afford to keep writing.  I just hope he gets most of it.
B000W965QW|5.0|This is a good read. I wanted to read this because I loved the movie version starring John Cusak and Jack Black. I was surprised to find the the book's narration takes place in England and not the USA, but the characters are even more entertaining than in the movie.<br />The writing is insightful, and as you read you can feel with the character as he recovers from a lost love and experiences the joy and uncertainty of finding it again. I have always enjoyed books that make me think about my own life because I identify with the characters, and this book does the trick. You will feel joy, uncertainty, a lover's sorrow, and also gain insight into some of life's major events. I have the book on my Kindle Fire, and I have highlighted about 30 passages to reread and think about. This is one of the rare books that you will want to read a second time.<br />If you are a music lover, you will also gain some great musical insights, and quite a few new songs to audition,  just by reading the dialogue.<br />Highly recommended!
B005LAII8K|4.0|This clever exciting and thought provoking science-fiction thriller in one the best of 2012.  The cast and acting are better than we usually find in the genre.
B008Y6ZTKS|5.0|Very good movie for kids and even adults. If you have little girls it is a good lesson for them as well in that they can do anything. Glad we purchased it.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|A few humorous moments, but a pretty lame movie concept overall.  Would not rent again or recommend to anyone I know.
0812992792|4.0|I read this novel because it was a book club selection. I probably would not have picked it up otherwise; however, I'm glad that I did. I was disappointed in the ending but, up to that point, I couldn't put it down. The story is particularly fascinating because of what is currently happening in North Korea. It made for a good book group discussion.
0399160450|5.0|another great Clancy story. this story seemed a little short of Clancy's usual military information and I'd have liked a larger cast of characters and more story threads
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is great. It's so relaxing.  I love those little pudding eyes. They're so expressivei.ng. This game is just a little challenging but not toostressful.
B000OCXI3K|3.0|I liked the fantasy and the magical aspects.  I did not like the anti-church  bias.  Some of the plot lines were not developed well enough for me to be sure what had happened.  Aspects of protagonist's birth, fate of Father Reynaud, etc..).

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works great!  Does everything I need it to do!  I can like, share, chat, comment.  Just everything!  WTG Love it!
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Colorization has come a long way since the films that we colorized in the 70s and 80s.  There are no pastels or washed out colors in this film.  The colors are bright and clean.  Watching this film over again in color was like watching a totally new film. The brief documentary about colorization included in this set was very interesting. I recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of this film.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|just started this on christmas vacation and can't put the book down it's a fantastic read for fans of sherlock holmes. it even includes the case of the basckervilles.
0786860707|5.0|This book is required reading for a class I'm taking, and I often have a little trouble getting on board with required reading in classroom situations (even if its about a topic that I'm interested in). I'm always more enthusiastic about starting books that I've discovered on my own, and this one in particular is intimidating because it's 500 pages long with a large format and filled with plenty of text despite the plentiful illustrations.<br /><br />Well, as I kind of suspected would happen, I have really gotten into it now that I've started. The writers worked at Disney for decades and explain the history and animation techniques of the studio from the inside out with a sensitivity for the art and the individual people making it that I think most students animation can readily relate to. The technical detail it goes into in the early chapters is on par with short books that focus specifically on animation techniques (I recently read &#34;Timing for Animation&#34; - the one with a foreword by Joh Lasseter). All in all it's just exhaustive and so full of detail that you always feel like you have more to learn.
B0053TMP24|5.0|The entire series is wonderful!  My 10 year old son and all of his friends are flying through it and the best part..they have discussion groups after!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Not as good as her other two but I really enjoyed this one. Can't wait for more from this author.
1609611543|5.0|Excellent book.  Answers the question &#34;Why should wheat/gluten be such a problem when it has been around since ancient times?&#34;  It has helped me stick to my gluten free diet which was recommended to me by my naturopath.  I do not have classic celiac disease so I experience no intestinal symptoms.  I do, however, have Hasimoto's disease, an autoimmune disease of the thyroid.  This book explains how wheat could be affecting my disease and possibly be part of the source.  I would recommend &#34;Wheat Belly &#34;  to everyone.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Another action packed movie & having bought the other two had to have this 1 also from previews I saw on it thru TV. Terrific film for me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this, great fun for me while I'm bored at work and on the toilet, anyways, play at this game, it's amazing
B007MAETA8|5.0|love it! Love him! Have seen him in concert several times. He is so gifted. His talent on the guitar<br />is unbelievable.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|This will not work!  It won't allow me to see any videos that require Adobe Reader.  Amazon informed me that the Kindle Fire HD is not compatible with Adobe Reader.  This is a big disappointment!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Reminded me of all her older books. I have read all the Patricia Cornwell books. She always keeps me guessing, gives me lots of red herrings which I like. I try to figure out the true &#34;bad guy&#34;, but can never guess right. This time I thought I had it! Right to the very end....never saw it coming. I liked this book. Good job, Patricia. Waiting on another one.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|I think there are very redeemable elements to this movie.  It was a good message with practical application.  What I wish was different is that Christian films often seem to need to put in awkward dialog in an effort to clearly reiterate the \\"lesson\\" in each scene.  A really great film always shares the story, and then let's the audience come to their own conclusion.  In Courageous, it's as if there's a fear that if they don't tell the audience what the lesson is, they'll miss it.  Christian films need to let stories stand on their own to make a point.  If the story can't do that, then they aren't the right stories, or situations.  Christians will love this movie because everything is scripted in their own language (and I am a Christian so I know the verbiage).  The story in Courageous is compelling on it's own, without the \\"here's what this means\\" parts.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Greta right from the start & kept on going. Held me FULL attention thru the entire movie. You have to love action packed fast moving movies & I totally do so this was worth it's money !!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Great book with some unexpected twists & turns.  The ending is good because all is not a fairy tale life.
B004XJHBCE|1.0|It would be nice to be able to group and organize apps on the fire HD, but this app doesn't do it.
B003VANOFY|4.0|After few hours gaming,i never felt the headset fatigue once, excellent for very long gaming time !!<br />It is very easy to use and you can connect it to your laptop or PC.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|This is a very fun film to watch.  Although at times you do need to suspend reality, who cares? That's what makes movies fun.  The story line is gripping and you find yourself getting very involved in the characters. I was rooting for them to make it out alive.<br /><br />If you like disaster movies, you will absolutely love this film. I have watched it over and over and I always catch something I missed in the other viewings.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I recently saw this movie on TV and I am so sorry that I did not see it in the theatre.  You are taken on a great journey as you follow John Carter to Mars.  He is a hero of epic stature.  The action scenes are spectacular.  Willem DaFoe and Samantha Morton add such grace and humanity to their CG characters in the film.  We have proper villans in Mark Strong and Dominic West.  Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins are superb as John Carter and Dejah Thoris.  Watching them is a delight.  Taylor carries this movie and makes John Carter one of cinema's greatest heros. Get this DVD and join John Carter on his journey!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|A Christmas classic! This movie never ceases to bring smiles to our faces and joy to our hearts!  Love it!

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for someone, and for the price, this is amazing! I thought I was just purchasing a DVD, what a great find.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great fun and challenging. Has kept me entertained for hours. I highly reccomend this game and hope that others will enjoy it as much as I have. Keep the entertainment coming.
B004DP9QFS|5.0|I bought mine for Kindle Fire and I love it.<br />It has many different unique features that I use.<br />I love the moon feature, very cool.<br />Recommended.
B009FXIICK|5.0|I'm not a fan of Tetris, or any of those match-a-color-to-make-the-other-colors-disappear puzzle games, but I'm quite addicted to this one when I have downtime. It gets quite challenging by the fourth round or so, but it's manageable. Maybe I just don't spend enough downtime &#34;practicing.&#34; Never have I been frustrated though. Definitely recommend. Runs perfectly on my Kindle Fire (1st Generation)
0810996596|5.0|Gorgeously crafted book showcasing an immense collection of memorabilia. I bought several copies as gifts, including my mother (she loved it) and all were impressed. Kirk spent a lot of time putting this book together and it shows his passion for collecting and a the torch he carries for all this horror business!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Edgy and well written.  The right ending for a wild ride.  If you are uncomfortable when things are not 'as they should be', then this may not be the book for you.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This is a great movie, according to my son, fiance, & a coworker and his sons! I have yet to see it, but from what I've heard, I can't wait to watch.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie is soooooo wrong and that makes it soooooo funny!  Not for kids so put them to bed and get ready for some adult humor!
1587613379|2.0|If you're already living poly or know that you like the lifestyle, don't purchase this book. If you want something to give to your monogamous partner to inform them about poly (and hope that they see things your way), don't give them this book. It will only irritate them that it praises the lifestyle and somewhat looks down on monogamy (it's only a stepping stone, y'all!).<br /><br />With books like 'Opening Up' on the market now, Ethical Slut need only be purchased if you have someone in your life that hates the idea of poly, and you want to irritate the dickens out of them, and you know that they'll read whatever you hand them. I'm sure it was a great book when it first came out, mostly as support for other poly people out there, but now there are in-depth informational books, websites, etc and this book has outlived its usefulness.<br /><br />There is little to no useful information on starting poly relationships, improving relationships, or statistics of any kind. There's incredibly basic advice like, &#34;Don't yell at each other,&#34; and not much you wouldn't already be doing in any relationship if you're not completely backwards.<br /><br />I feel like I know the two authors pretty well after reading the book, but their lifestyles don't fit at all with what I want, and so this book ends up being a waste of money for people like me that don't want to just flit from partner to partner and have flings on into eternity. I admire their desires to be social gypsies, but their attitude is more &#34;Catch as catch can,&#34; and less &#34;Let's work on staying together,&#34; which is what I'm looking for advice with.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I've loved him since American Idol and he didn't disappoint like most artist from that show do. Great first album!
B00005JO9J|3.0|My friend enjoyed the show on TV and was always wanting to catch episodes they had missed due to work schedules. They enjoy the program.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love the new picture of this app and how easy it is to use. This is a most for people that want a good alarm clock.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! It is so addicting, a challenge for your brain and eyes! I would recommend this game for everyone
0765356139|5.0|I like these books by Brian Sanderson because they are so interesting and keep you spellbound without cursing or sex.
1594487154|5.0|Dan Pink is a thinker.<br /><br />In his latest book, To Sell Is Human, he thinks about the shifting nature of the modern reality of sales.  Putting forth the notion that 9 out of 10 of us are in sales, he reaches out to shift our perception of what that really means.<br /><br />We are, and have been, sales people for quite some time, though it is only now that we expand this idea to include teachers, parents, co-workers, friends, and especially ourselves.  We sell our products, services and ourselves.  We sell ourselves to people all day long: to gather resources, convey ideas in meetings, or convincing others to go to your favorite restaurant.<br /><br />How then do we become better at it?  Mr. Pink has compiled hard data, anecdotes, and random tidbits into an easy to follow breakdown of what moving others really means and does for us.  He takes the old notions of what sales is and turns it over to show us the softer, more focused and persuasive side of convincing others.  Covering the pitch, improvisation, and sales mindfulness this new book goes through all the aspects of the revised sales paradigm.<br /><br />There are, what I see as, fundamental elements which will benefit each of us in our day-to-day lives.  Having been through many different levels of corporate life, I recognize the application of what Mr. Pink has to offer here.  I've also been recently involved in some enlightening discussion on the application of these concepts in the world of education.<br /><br />Whatever your role, it is likely that you have someone to convince of something.  The real question is \\"how can I do better?\\"  To Sell is Human might just help move us to the answer in ourselves.  This book is not the \\"end-all, be-all\\" answer to changing how we influence others, but it is certainly a though-provoking insight to how we might adjust to improve.<br /><br />(Disclosure: I was a participant in the launch team and received a copy of the book from the publisher for review.  I did purchase the book upon release and would have despite my participation in the launch.  These words are my own and have not been edited or approved by the publisher or Mr. Pink.)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great game.  Both my son and I are having a lot of fun playing it.  For once a product really lives up to the hype.
B00AH6CYRO|5.0|I'm a major metallica fan, the whole album runs and plays well with no problems and no hassles what so ever
B008NMT684|5.0|got it for my mom's new Kindle for my grandson.  easy to use, easy to install and he's going to love it!!
B000B5XOSO|5.0|This is a very dark Batman in story and in look.  The set design of Gotham City is gorgeous giving the movie a cold and icy feeling.  Batman as played by Michael Keaton is a billionaire loner and recluse as Bruce Wayne, but dons the Batman costume to fight crime when necessary.  The villains are plentiful in this Batman starting with the biggest one played by Danny DeVito as \\"the Penguin\\".  He is creepy and not someone or something you want to run into a dark alley.  Christopher Walken is another semi-villain who throws his push over secretary, \\"Selina Kyle\\", out a tall building when he discovers she has troublesome information on his company.  She comes back as a semi-villain herself as none other than \\"Catwoman\\" played brilliantly by Michelle Pfeiffer.  The question of Catwoman has always been, \\"Is she a villain or isn't she?\\"  She's a borderline sociopath teetering on that fine line of good and bad which Pfeiffer does naturally making it the more enjoyable performances of all the characters.  She assaults the screen in this and it's no surprise that its still an iconic image in cinema history.  This movie is entertaining and a definite see if you haven't by now.
0060531053|4.0|After buying a very basic kit, lacking in information and explanation, this was a very good companion.  It will only receive 4 stars however, because I do not believe any book on this topic will get 5 stars.  The fact that there are so many different ways of brewing and everyone has their own opinion will always leave a little confusion until you discover your own opinion on the topic.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book hit the best seller list in June and is still on it seven months later. I am not sure why. I personally did not like the format story  style of the book. The story is unique but it didn't capture me. I had no empathy for the characters. I found them unappealing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never been a big fan of reading. Before this book I had only read one other book voluntarily which was the hunger games series and loved it. A good friend of mine recommended this book to me but I never thought much about it because like I said I'm not a huge fan of reading but this was such an amazing story! I couldn't put in down finished it in two days and it was absolutely amazing! Defiantly worth the money I highly recommend it to everyone.

B000002VMD|5.0|been looking for this sound track for long time--so happy ya'll had one more copy---It is wonderful to have in my collection
B0098WWEH8|4.0|This is my first Grizzly Bear album, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  I think this is a great album, one of the best in 2012.  It's unique music, but great tunes at the same time.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|It's a Harry Potter movie... Do I need to say more?  Loved the movie. This movie is as amazing as the book was to read.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|Not a comedy, it was sad. More of a drama. Be prepared to cry, and not of happiness! Was hoping to laugh more.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my daughter cause she has all of these books. I know she's been wanting this book for a long time.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I enjoyed the story and the author's writing.  I took it with me on vacation and enjoyed the escape it had to offer.
B000MV9026|5.0|My daughter strongly wanted to watch this movie at home again, so I bought it. Actually, this movie can provide good music and cute penguins. Loved it as well as did my daughter.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|This is an awesome set.  It has a huge coffee table book that is filled with photos and other tidbits over the career of these incredible talented musicians!  It is a great part of history for my generation.  I was amazed by the set, it was much more than I thought it would be.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Love the amazing graphics for this amazing series by HBO. Can't wait to get the rest of the seasons on bluray.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|looks good easy to use.do not like to be folk how to respond to query  thank you to day amen
0764169742|5.0|Excellent.  I have never done botanical prints and enjoyed this introduction to the drawing of botanical prints.  Enjoy working in colored pencil.
B008N1V11U|5.0|works great on the kindle. can take it with you anywhere. love batman especially this movie. love it a lot.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Every song is beautiful.  This cd has been the best seller for two years in a row and it's no wonderful considering it's superb quality.  Adele's voice cannot be compared, it is in a class by itself..so incredible, so beautiful.  She sometimes trembles as she sings, her emotions are there for the world, she hides nothing back, and she has a wicked playful laugh live after and during some songs.  These are love songs to the maximum, and many will break your heart and bring you to places you have long since thought you left.  She is THAT POWERFUL.  The memories that come back through the emotion of her vocals are the most beautiful sometimes saddest ride through memory lane.  No matter how many cd's I toss aside Adele is the one I keep coming back to time and time again. Live up to and beyond the hype!! Adele's voice is rich and sexy, yet vulnerable and pleading and above all else UNIQUE!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that there's so many different versions of the Bible on this app and some can be downloaded for use when not online. It's super easy to use and had the reading plan for a year I was desiring to follow. Highly recommend.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I was pleased with the content of the movie and found it to be very entertaining.  I look forward to a sequel
B0062NAX1U|4.0|We gave it as a gift. We saw the movie in a theater and wanted our grown children to see it.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have always loved this book. I would love to step back into Jane Austen world and see the families, balls, parties, and courting. It is hard to understand the language at first but if you keep going and get into a rhythm it really is a beautiful thing.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|So nice to be able to watch an action packed animated movie without profanity and explicit violence or sex scenes.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched the movie but felt like there was so much that I was missing.  I wanted to know more about Peeta and Katniss' relationship and her relationship with Gale.  Movies are good for only showing the parts of a book they want to focus on.  I needed to get behind the scenes with these characters and I was able to.  I'm excited and look forward to finding out what happens now when they arrive back to District 12.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Read some of the negative reviews, but this works as described with LifeProof case on iPhone 4S, no issues with converter, case or phone connector. Use it to dock on speakers mostly.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It's all time favourite for Christmas, and I really enjoyed reading it again with my daughter, and of course it is free.
B0096HFOZO|4.0|We read the twits after reading the BFG by Ronald Dahl. Each chapter had some funny thing going on, we laughed and said it was crazy, etc.  Good book for a young reader who reads well, or likes to listen to stories.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So i reacently bought this app . I was expecting an ok game, but when i started playing i loved this easy to use game. The controlls were fantastic.I will save all of the talk but if you are wondering if it is worth $6.99 in my opinion its worth more. If you buy it you are paying for one world then you can have as many as you want. I have only one complaint, there is no redstone dust, and that is really not a complaint because they are trying to add it in the next up date so whatever comes i will be happy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Easy, quick, read. The characters were very interesting, especially Charlie. I really felt the pain and suffering Charlie was going through. I just wanted to be his friend and support him in building self confidence. At first I couldn't relate to him because I am the opposite of a wallflower. I began to understand him but couldn't understand why such an intelligent young man had no self esteem. We need to be more aware of teens out there that could use a few doses of compliments, a hug or a pat on the back. Totally enjoyed the book!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|The batteries say they expire Dec.2012.<br />Now, I did know this when I bought them... because they did put that on the description of the item.<br />So that is a star also...I do hope they last past Dec 2012.<br />As far as I can tell they are.  The two that I am using are still working.
B005LAII08|5.0|Great deal great price, better yet the movie is one of the best out in a long time, the kids love it. Over and over they enjoy the DVD Brave very much.
B008IJT0CE|2.0|I had the free version of this ap and it stopped working so I bought the ap.  My complaint is that the sound files are very short so it's obvious that the sound is repeating over and over.  Also, there's a pause at the end/begining of the file that I find very annoying.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it's great for openinig your thoughts in a relaxing way. After developing patterns, it's engaging to see how many possibilities there are.
B009JZVT70|5.0|When I was first told of this series I was a bit skeptical.  The premise seemed a bit of a stretch... once I began watching it, I was hooked.  It just keeps getting better and season 2 was great.  I highly recommend this series, its good family fun.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack joyride is fun and challenging and my grand kids love it as well as myself. It's addictive. I played it on a 500 mile long trip.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Oh if only this was possible.. well done, kept me entertained for the entire read, once i started I was unable to quit reading
034580404X|1.0|Strip away the porn and you have a sophomoric boring romance novel.  In my opinion, these books are nothing more than a porn handbook, information rated bad to perverted.  What is all the hype? Is the overall reading level of book buyers REALLY this low?
B00004YRQA|4.0|These memory cards allow multi players ame stats to be saved. They allow you to stop and save game points and continue where you left off and not lose the data you worked so hard to acheive. good purchase.
B000A6EXNO|5.0|Wide enough to cut out most of the light from the side, but stays out of the way by folding it back up against the camera body.
B004GJYROG|5.0|We have rented this movie so many times, it was about time we just owned this film. It is a fun film for the whole family.
B00003CXBH|1.0|The DVD seemed to be set up for Canada and USA and did not work for us or for my friend who had it from me as a Christmas present.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|This series has simply continued its downward spiral into irrelevancy.  Also looked obvious that the characters were in front of a green screen the entire movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Over Christmas I read the first book to the trilogy '50 Shades of Grey' and I have to say, as compared to that book..this book is wonderful!<br /><br />Yes there are some repetitive things, and there are still sometimes when you want to just yell at Ana, 'leave him alone!  don't you get what's going on by now??'<br /><br />For the most part I loved it.  There were some parts of the book that were starting to get boring, BUT usually not far beyond reading those parts the story picked up again.<br /><br />I can't wait to finish book 3 of the series!!  I'm so surprised how great the series has ended up...and now I'm hooked on the story.  Very addicting read...
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I build my own computers for fun. I bought a really top notch motherboard.After that I was running low on on money and when I checked out the specs I knew this was a nice fit, which could later be updated if I want. However This has all the speed one could want.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great version.  Really like that it automatically advances cards to where you would play them.  Keep pressing to shuffle to next playable spot.  4 suit is very challenging.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I was very pleased with the order and the way it went.<br /><br />It was on time and they followed up with an email to make sure I got it.<br /><br />No problems on my end.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|the cd is good but the case is cracked so that is pretty much not worth the buy so i'm mad
B00756GRUE|5.0|I love this watch for all the reasons already stated. The solar charge lasts  and lasts even when out of the sun for weeks at a time. Since no one else mentioned this, I will: this watch is extremely accurate. It has stayed within 1 second of the USNO atomic clock for over 6 months straight. I know that many folks don't care about such accuracy in what is mainly a piece of jewelry, but for those that care, it is amazingly accurate! I have never had a watch that was this accurate. I've owned solar atomic watches that self correct every few days, but those were off by several seconds a day. Sometimes, depending on location, those watches would fail to synchronize with the atomic clock in Colorado.<br /><br />I don't know if all of these watches are this accurate, but mine is a gem and a real keeper. What a time piece!
B001U7WUW8|5.0|The mix on the vinyl is great.  Balanced well.  We have a quality record player and needle and have very little distortion getting to the inner grooves (which for punk, isn't it distorted half the time anyway? ;) ).  One of my favorite albums growing up and finally owning it on vinyl let me hear it in a whole new way.
0385006896|5.0|The new Sherlock holmes series from BBC is fun to watch, but you'll enjoy finding out how much the stories were altered by reading the originals, and the original stories are far better.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is so great you will want to play it all the time!and if you go to date and time in your settings,  go up one day and you will get coins from your village again!
B009GESJH2|4.0|Very good<br />Liked the music as always by him, was different from what he<br />Usual does, but still good to listen to
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!!  Sure there's alot of sex scenes but the story had a great plot to it too.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|I have seen each of the three (3) original Bourne films many, many times.  They're so good you can see them over and over and never get bored.  The newest, The Bourne Legacy, was a huge let-down.  After watching it, I felt deflated.  No WOW! factor.  It ended, seemingly in the middle of the movie, without a resolution.  The bad guys don't get theirs, and you you aren't certain if the good guys really got away.  I watched it again, with the closed caption on and got a lot more out of the movie, since much of the dialog was Project Names, Acronyms, etc. and a lot was said under breath, that you couldn't know what was going on until much later in the movie, and too late to bother going back.  Bottom line - A poor movie to have the Bourne name attached.
B00000JQ0E|1.0|First of all, must say that the album is EXCELLENT and one of my faves by the RHCP.  However, the vinyl was incredibly disappointing.  The mix was off and not balanced at all.  I would've expected more from such an incredible group.  If you are looking to add any RCHP to your vinyl collection, I recommend passing on this (unless you want it just for the sake of owning it) and getting Blood Sugar Sex Magik instead.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|The story was believable and kept my family totally engrossed from beginning to end.  Hence, the five stars.  As with most really good movies the story is about various types of people, their motivations, and their relationships.
1609611543|5.0|Very leading edge insights on effects of wheat in our diet and how it causes us to gain weight and create a multitude of medical problems. Has a lot of technical medical and scientific terminology. A very indepth well written book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Heart wrenching an  Heart warming.  Thu  book should be read in every school.  Enjoyed it immensely. Can't wait for my daughter to read it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the first book but this one is even better.  It goes into more detail of Christian's past.<br />The only thing I didn't care for were characters Kate and Mia.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|this is a great game for any person any age, thanks for putting it on the I phone also.great game
B005VPLZ76|5.0|Good mix!  Great album.  A definite if you want any RHCP in your vinyl collection.  Be careful, other RHCP albums aren't as well mixed on vinyl and sound like crap.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Bought this for the MS. after purchasing an HD TV.  She loves this series and was very happy with it.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|First processor for a new computer build. Great that it also includes a GPU for simplicity and can even be cross fired.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is even better than temple run there is more botanicals and you can buy things like better characters in temple run you abnormal weirdos bit in this game you can have a zombie, a robot and so much more!
B008NIS2AG|5.0|Maurice Andre was the greatest classical trumpet player who ever lived, and one of the greatest classical musicians in history.  Andre had an unprecedented 50 year career of performing all over the world, teaching at the Paris Conservatory, and making literally hundreds of wonderful recordings on many different record and CD labels.  His incredible and effortless technique, beautiful and unmistakable sound, and superb musicianship created a new and unique style of trumpet playing that has inspired generations of trumpet players throughout the world.  There is not a professional classical trumpet player anywhere in the world today who has not been influenced by the profound achievements of this man.  Andre greatly expanded the baroque, classical, and modern repertoire of music available for the trumpet, and is single-handedly responsible for making the trumpet a respected solo instrument in the concert halls of the world. His exquisite playing set a standard for all time, for all trumpet players, and all musicians to aspire to.<br /><br />One of the recording companies that issued Andre's recordings was EMI and the Eternel Maurice Andre CD compilation is a tribute to Andre who passed away in 2012.  There are many wonderful examples of Andre's art in this 13 CD collection.  What is particularly evident when you listen to these recordings is the great joy of communicating music that Andre possessed.  From the most difficult bravura passages in the great trumpet concerti to the simplest of melodies, he played every note with care and beauty.  It always sounds like he is enjoying the music and having fun while performing and communicating to his audience!<br /><br />Every classical performance in this compilation is superbly played by Andre. You will find outstanding CDs of trumpet concerti that he recorded with conductors such as Herbert von Karajan, Riccardo Muti, Sir Neville Marriner, Sir Charles Mackerras, etc. as well as some magnificent recordings of trumpet and organ music. A CD of Andre playing opera arias with a symphony orchestra is also included which contains some of the most beautiful trumpet playing you will ever hear.<br /><br />An added treat for long time Maurice Andre fans are some early recordings that he made of pop music in the 1950's on the Odeon label when he was a young and relatively unknown performer trying to establish himself.  The pop pieces are very entertaining and beautifully played.<br /><br />Thank you EMI for honoring this wonderful musician with this excellent 13 CD Collection!
B00843TZJ2|4.0|Hi,<br />I bought this for my brother as a Christmas present, which I gave to him a couple days after his girlfriend had already given him the same gift, so he immediately \\"re-gifted\\" it to me.  No problem with that!<br /><br />I love the whole package except for a couple things:<br />-My musical hero Stills starts out a little bit vocally flat and I'm surprised this wasn't \\"fixed\\".  It only took a few songs for him to hit his stride vocally, so obviously it's not like a couple little, flattering \\"tweaking\\" here and there at the first portion of the show would have been that big a deal artistically, and I like to believe the majority of musical purists wouldn't have been too terribly bugged.<br /><br />-More importantly, overall I found the sound a bit heavy on the mid to low mid range and I have to EQ the crap out of it to get any \\"Oomph\\" in the very low and very high end.  Especially considering the stellar quality of musical talent of all on stage, this is a shame.  Whoever did the sound for Stills Live At Shepherd's Bush did a much better job at the EQ mix and the person who produced the sound on this package would do well to study that previous work.<br /><br />All that whining aside, these late 60-year-olds sound pretty damn good! I very much enjoyed most of their more recent material, the backing band is killer with a very serious nod to rising star Shane Fontayne on back-up guitar, and if you're a CSN fan and don't hear this set I pity you and I wish the Good Lord will have mercy on your soul.<br /><br />Rock on,<br />Ernie
B000MG1YC0|4.0|the first time I heard the music of sirenia was on youtube. I liked them so much that I bought the cd. I now listen to the driving metal while I work out in the gym. the music is hard and driving which is great for the gym.
B004VFK5LO|4.0|Copycat Great acting, great writing. Harry Connick Jr. is superb! Sympatetic characters, excellent plot. I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a good thriller.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|I bought this app on my iphone and loved it so I wanted to try it on a larger screen, only it won't download to my kindle. it keeps saying &quot;error&quot; when I try to download it. its quite annoying that ive paid for this app but cannot access it.
B00A0SLTCU|1.0|A very poor imitation of the original.  I mean sure, the special effects are, of course, better but the acting?  Not even close.  Ad to that the poor story line.  It has been rewritten in such a way that it is difficult to keep up with and, frankly, unrealistic.  England builds a subway tunnel, through the earth, to Australia just to exploit Australian workers whom the English then decide to wipe out with an &#34;invasion&#34; through the subway tunnel????  I liked Mars better.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I really wanted my princess loving  daughter to have a fun Christmas gift that I could tolerate too. Bought her a great pink wooden vanity with no bells and whistles and these decals as well. Now, I admit I had to bite my tongue hard when she wanted the princesses all over upside down and everywhere... We settled on &#34;around the vanity&#34;. So so cute. Gave her the princess theme SHE wanted and he classiness I wanted. Win-win.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I've been a fan since the good old standup days and this book is full of Ellen's fabulously rambling observations. I laughed out loud a lot, as I ALWAYS do at her amazing way with words. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants or needs a good laugh. Thanks, Ellen!!
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I gave it a five because the album is a good listen. the music and the lead female vocal are well balanced and the bad girl lyrics fit the sound. if you like music that is driving and great to listen to while working out or cleaning house this is the one for you. if your into bad girls this really is the album for you.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|I love this movie but I hate having to choose between buying on bluray or through iTunes.  I've had such a horrible experience with ultra violet and iTunes makes it so much easier to share between my devices.<br /><br />Please at least give the option of an iTunes download like dark knight or avengers
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'd really rate this as a heavy four star, although I gave the first book a five.  Why?  That first book was hard to match.  A world that puts young people in an arena to fight to the death makes me ashamed that I live in a society that creates reality shows like \\"Survivor\\"---what's next, throwing Christians to the lions or turning teens into Gladiators for entertainment or political reasons?  Sure, we pay the contestants on \\"Survivor\\", but the victor of the Hunger Games win some perks as well.  Sorry, I digress.  The reason I didn't like this book quite as well as the first was only because the scenario was not new and shocking (since we'd already read the first book)  and the 'Quell' (the additional Hunger Game that occurs every 25 years) was again along the same lines as the first--except that Katniss had other allies besides Peeta in this game.  Besides, I'm getting just a tad more impatient about her inability to make up her mind about whether she likes Peeta or Gale better.  But overall, it's  a great read and I hope they're planning another movie based on this book, because I'd for sure go to see it!
1905236042|5.0|My girls love going on \\"Yoga Adventures\\" with these cards. Any time I try to deviate from using the \\"Yoga Cards\\" meets with great opposition. Love this product.
1416550550|5.0|I bought this as a gift and then I got to read it.  Good read and as usual, good deal.
1607066017|5.0|Every time I read a new chapter of Saga I smile, close the book and give myself a few minutes before inevitably rereading it.<br /><br />This is the comic book that made me put on my chucks on one of the hottest days of the year (last summer) and head to my local comic book shop for the first time. Because I had read a few preview panels on a website and I knew, KNEW, that I was about to read something special. I recently bought copies for my best friend because putting more Saga in the world can only be a good thing.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Alana and Marko, new parents, and inheritors of a war spanning multiple planets between their respective races. The story is so much more than that. From the first page this comic establishes, with sharp dialogue and equally sharp artwork, the personalities at play and the genuine feelings of the characters. Every chapter manages to be rife with surprises and twists without being shocking for shock sake.<br /><br />I could say more, but you ought to just read this book. Seriously.
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|I gave this cd a four out of five stars because simone simons has a beautiful voice and the metal mixed with orchesra music is a unique mix. I would have given it a five star review if the male vocal had been better because it seems that epica does not know how to balance the growling of the male lead with the melodic beauty of simone. if you like symphonic rock you will love the album.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Not sure what to expect, I loved this book. I read it at every opportunity. I was inspired by her courage and honesty. I didn't want this adventure to end.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|the characters are unusual, logical but insightful.  for a book of its genre the characters are brought to life by their thoughts then actions.  It is an excellent read and i recommend it to anyone.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downtown Abbey is really great.  Most of my friends love it too.  I do look forward to future seasons of this.
0385341008|5.0|This book came highly recommended by a friend.  A little unusual to start, but I got into it and it is a delightful read.  I would recommend it.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|This was gift  to a friend who has almost all of Bob Dyland's recordings.  He really surprised, and gave me a list of a few he does not have yet..
B005HSL626|5.0|I had my doubts about this game, but when I started playing it OMG so addicting, challenging, and beyond fun.
B0000636NQ|4.0|Should have been there when Alvin Lee & Co did play live. An amazing live album. This CD is better then the vinyl LP, more tracks, better sound.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I always wait for the next installment of the Kay Scarpetta novels but will wait to buy the next one in the 99 cent bin at the local bargain and trade bookstore. Tiresome Benton semi-drama, superhuman Lucy...just not exciting. Sorry Patricia!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|LOVE this app! It's really nice how you can customize your sounds &amp; overlap the sounds. Also I like that you can adjust each sound, so you can further customize.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|Not for me or anyone who enjoys a good zombie flick.  One is suppose to care about the characters otherwise, what's the point?
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I am a &#34;piler&#34;  If you don't know what that is then I will tell you.  It is a person who has piles of books, magazines and other papers around everywhere.  I love to read and love to learn and I think being a &#34;piler&#34; might just go with that personality!!  This book inspired me to tackle that problem.  I have cleaned out and given away so much since reading this.  I would not say I am a minimalist yet but I have made great progress.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|We weren't sure what to expect but were pleasantly surprised.  This movie had it all-action, love story, intrigue.  We recommended it to our family and they loves it as well.  I'd definitely watch it again.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you love high drama, you'll adore Downton Abbey.  The characters are well rounded and the acting superb.  Love it!
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Only song I like is Diamond=rest is really mediocre.  Usually I listen to a sample of all the songs but didn't this time.  For the price still an ok deal.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|Walking into the readably acclaimed &#34;Ender's Game&#34;, I was preparing myself for disappointment. Not unlike tasting a dish at a restaurant that has rave reviews, one sets themselves up for the expected disappointment. Your imagination and expectations oft times lead yourself to anticipate a greater delight than delivered.<br /><br />I am happy to say that this book did not deliver. It completely failed and I loved it for it. It did not pander to my expectations, did not leave me predicting each new development of the plot. In its places, this story delivered a rich and thorough accounting of Ender and his own internal dilemma's. A fresh (ironically) and rewarding journey.<br /><br />I would, and do, happily recommend this to not only avid science fiction readers, but anyone in need of a break from reality.<br /><br />In short, Ender's Game, while brief, is a rich and rewarding read. 4/5.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Puzzle games are great for smart phones and this is well thought out.  Mostly a building game with squishy physics added in.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|Imagine working in a place with this atmosphere.  I'm sure they have less absenteism and healthier employees.  I would love to visit their workplace.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I guess we just love Matt Damon too much to really get into this Bourne movie.  Jeremy Renner is excellent but it's a little confusing.  You really have to watch it a couple of times to get it.  Not bad.  Good action sequences.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I usually do not go for rock/pop/alternative violin music and such, but this was a big surprise how good this album is.  The violin does not sound out of place at all and dubstep beats go really well together.  One of my favorites now.
B00846REIS|5.0|The book was very similar to the Fifty Shades series although that is the reason I bought it! Couldnt put it down!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|heart warming. would recommend for any age. beautiful lessons in life seen through the eyes of mans best friend. 5 stars!
B0027BVMSY|3.0|Many people complain that QoS veered into the direction of Jason Bourne (funny their initials are the same)... I would be hard pressed to disagree with those people.  However, Craig as Bond is a much darker character and so close to what Fleming originally depicted, that it is hard to say this is a bad film rather than say it is STILL A BOND FILM!<br /><br />Definitely something you need to watch as a Bond fan, and whether you enjoy it or not, it explains some things from Casino Royale that were worth explaining.<br /><br />It isn't one I would pop in the DVD player every day to watch, as I could do with Casino Royale, Goldfinger or Goldeneye, but if it's on TV, I'm not turning it off either.
B004OR199G|5.0|My sister was diagnosed with cancer and read this book among others and totally change her way of eating.  We could see immediate improvement in her.
B008K8U13K|5.0|This game totally rocks! I only get upset when the game freezes up my Kindle Fire. Besides that, I could play the game all day.
B001DHXT20|4.0|We enjoyed this movie. Great action scenes. I love Edward Norton as an actor, however I must say I enjoy Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk better.
B008476HBM|5.0|I was in love with the movie and I am now equally in love with this book.  I enjoy the style of writing, and how easy it is to understand.  What a wonderful story of strong women who are able to rise above their class.  Yet, they do it through love and never sell themselves into it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love . This app allows me to expand my knowledge in different ways that you can not always learn
0307730697|5.0|A story almost beyond belief.  More of us having only a fraction of the character this man demonstrated would make this planet a better place and help carry for those who just don't get it.  One of the most powerful messages delivered was the fragility of man - the opportunities we all have to choose the wrong path, and then by sheer strength from within along with help from outside ourselves (friends and strong spirit) to get back on the right path.  To aim high and push oneself to be a better person for not just oneself but for those around us.<br />A kick-ass motivating story about a blessed man and his amazing family.  Peace.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book makes perfect sense, but makes me sad.  I LOVE wheat and thought I was doing good by eating whole grain products.  I'm so sorry that we have ruined our food supplies in the name of convenience and progress.  My Dad was in the wholesale seed business and we celebrated each of these grain modifications.  IT meant more crops, successful crops and therefore more sales for him.  I'm glad he is not here to find out that those successes actually hurt him.  He died of congestive heart failure at the age of 74.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is great!!!it does have items younger kids might not have heard of but it is great for me.the only downer is that I play it so much that I run out of energy but I didn't even have enough coins to get power ups!!! But this game is really good. If you get off of it you get your energy back!!!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is a super fun app.  We love all the different levels of play. I have it on my phone, Kindle, and iPod. It truly is &#34;the greatest fruit-slicing game in the world!&#34;
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts so easy that it looks like it would quickly be boring.....but be prepared it ramps up quickly and provides continuos challenges. Love that it provides a great way to relax without &quot;vegging&quot; out. Great app!!
1451695195|4.0|to the literature on the subject, as it comes from the point of view of a doctor and scientist and hence is not so easily dismissed.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Superb series.  Great cast. All the emotions.  While anticipation of the next event/scene is a constant, the writers keep you guessing.  Great sets.  Excellent historical context.
0307341550|5.0|Picked it up after reading the review Stephen King wrote for it.<br /><br />Dreaded the last 30 pages like he said I would. Couldn't stop reading like he said I would.<br /><br />Recommended this to more people than any other piece of writing ever.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|this movie picks up where Jason Bourne left off, but it explains the idea behind the creation of the assassin &#34;assets&#34; in more detail<br />great entertainment.....
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|My kids enjoyed this movie and were glad to add it to our collection. I found it a little slow at times, but overall a good family movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I originally downloaded the free portion of this game for my daughter. She loved it and convinced me to play. Well, I got hooked and had to get the full version. Great game!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Interesting turn of events. Just shocked. This last book kept me reading at some points feeling that it was turning into a horror story. Overall, I'm sad about how everything came to an end. (I suppose this is when I'm have to write SPOILERS) I think like other reviewers we expected to be just as entertained by the characters we grew to love but this novel is like reading a whole new story with new characters. I understand the effects of devastating events but this is over kill and makes me feel depressed. I wouldn't recommend, even though you may really want to know what happens.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|I love this movie!  It is so much fun to watch and laugh at all Bill Murray's antics!  Fun to watch and walk down memory lane
B00640Z0RI|5.0|Michael Herr gives a startling accurate portrayal of this war.  I served in Vietnam.  HIs writing is often poetic, shocking but very real.  He and other reporters deserve medals for thier brave service.  And they volunteered, which is crazy.  Most of us were either drafted or joined just before being drafted. If you want the real story of this war, this is the best.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I spent the days preceeding Christmas watching this as I got all my chores done. Nothing gets you 'in the mood' for the Holidays like this movie.
B0034G4P80|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie as a family. Love the dynamic between Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki). Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another amazing book from Stephen King. Makes you really think about time itself. And if this doesn't make you want to read a history book, nothing will.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|just get it this game is fun get it please and rate it 5 stars it needs.it no angry bird game shoul be.4 stars please get it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I highly recommend t his series! It's got everything-suspense, mystery, even a little love story. Can't wait to read the third book in this amazing trilogy!!!
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games has a story. A great story. It has complex characters (real characters). A heroine that actually thinks with her head, has many flaws and makes many mistakes. One that has her priorities set straight. And that is just on the surface. Beneath the story there is a great critique of society today, and the way we are regressing to animal-dome. I could write an essay, but I won't. Let's just say these books are great for people who read to actually learn something. If you want just stupid romance, cartoonish characters and no story, go ahead, read Twilight.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|They don't make movies any better than this one - it's good in black & white, but even better in color.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|What an amazing cast. It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it may just be the best comic book adaption made, period! The actors' performances are captivating and there are many instances where we get a glimpse further into their characters pasts and innermost feelings.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) will have you in stitches. Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) will have you staring in disbelief as she winds her way through sticky situations, and Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/Hulk) will surprise you with his depth and compassion. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.<br /><br />The script is detailed and laced with sharp wit and humor. The special effects are literally mind-blowing and the action scenes are both hard-hitting and beautifully choreographed. It was truly epic!
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Songs sung by angels. Their voices are as beautiful and there is a great deal of passion in each and every number.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|This was a book that was chosen by my book club. I didn't like it, it was too unrealistic for me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Ok this book was awesome I really think you should read this the ending you would not expect and that is my rating
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|She does it again for me! Laugh, cry, yell (inside my head, don't want to scare the kids), and ignore everything around me! I must read!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|... to an epic trilogy. It goes outside the classic stories and leans more on the Miller Gotham universe. Thanks to Nolan and Goyer. Hellacious cast.
0262731541|4.0|GREAT READING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE FIX WHEEL BIKE.. FROM EARLY ITALIAN AND ENGLISH HISTORY OF THE FIX WHEEL BIKE... HISTORY OF THE FIX WHEEL IN NYC ISN'T EXACTLY ACCURATE, BUT THE OVERALL STORY IS HISTORICALLY CORRECT..
B00ANW33CM|1.0|Too fast and not what I wanted --time runs out. I will delete from my Kindle fire and get a different one!
B0014EAN8K|3.0|I sent a review to the amazon instant video dept. re: this. and it seems my new smart tv needs better download speed. The movie itself was ok, in that it seems like you end up in the same place over and over and over. 'Can't wait to see some headway in the series.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book is about educated authors, can't they come up with better language than the &#34;F&#34; word to express themselves?  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone I care about.
B004BSFC46|3.0|. Didn't hold interest for long; baby was not aware it was there after awhile. Probably good for 3-4 month old.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Wow,was very surprised at how many songs I knew. Very good singer and well worth the money,even though I bought it at target for 7 dollars(1/3/13). Sorry amazon,your usually the place to go for music. I say buy it it if your a fan or just looking for something new to listen to.
0375851569|5.0|How can anyone rate Dr. Seuss at anything less than 5 stars?!  Books were delivered quickly and our little reader loves reading them to us.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I have been a fan of all of her music, but I must say that this is the best yet!  LOVE IT!
B005LAII8K|4.0|JGL is great as a young Willis. Plot has some really good twists/turns. Don't skip ahead or you'll regret it.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Good ........what it says on the tin............and they will not let me be monosyllabic and submit so I have to write rubbish before I press the submit button!
B007TXN4TK|2.0|Maybe works well on other devices, but not the Fire.  This would be a great app,  but it is impossible to play 3 notes on Kindle Fire,  making it impossible to be successful on the higher level pieces. The idea is great ; like Guitar Hero for piano,  but unfortunately does not work as it should. My advice would be to get the free app,  enjoy the easier songs that do work, but do not spend any money on it unless the developers can fix the major flaw.
B002ZG9788|4.0|I saw the original and liked it very much. But I like this one much better, a better story with a little more in-depth of the character's. The special effects were very good,mind you nothing to Harry Hausen. This had a story and action to watch. Not Oscar material by no means.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|The disks worked perfectly. This is not a collector's type set but if your a HP fan this set is a must
B00632HWOG|5.0|Was easy to install and help me get into the E-Mails fast so I can keep up with work I do with church.
B008476HBM|5.0|The book was recently read by my mother who recommended it.<br />I loved the movie and knew I would enjoy reading.  I was not disappointed.<br />Her characters were easy for me to visualize.  It kept my attention and can see why it is a classic.
B000YHG72E|5.0|One of the funniest movies out there. Made my entire family laugh and enjoyed a wholesome will Ferrell movie to watch with all my kids.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|once again a thriller mystery. 2 people arrive into Pentergrast's life , a death, a betreal and more. well worth waiting for, I could'nt put  it down.
075669812X|4.0|My son really wanted this and it was what expected.  Has little Lego guy and information about ninjago thing. Likes
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's minecraft, kid happy, nuff said.  This app is just what you would expect and my kid didn't need to 'figure' it out, he just picked it up and starting Steve-ing
B008CPZNL6|5.0|this app lets me cruise all my social media in a single location and easy to use interface. I highly recommend it for someone who, like me, has way too many social media platforms to follow.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game but a little confusing in the beginning. Takes awhile to start accumulating money. Wish therenwerenother ways to earn money faster.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Love having this current issue by Paul McCartney which combines nostalgic songs with some of his newly written songs.  His new songs obviously reflect his past marriage disappointment(Go Find Yourself Another Fool)  and the happiness he has found in his current marriage. I also enjoyed the varied instrumentals throughout recording.<br />A must have for any Beatle collector....
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Excellent action movie based on the comic book series.  Robert Downey Jr. continues to please the audience with his depiction of &#34;Ironman&#34; as the self-centered Stark evolving into a hero with the selfless desire to save the world.  Never a dull moment and the special effects will blow you away.
B000FBJG04|5.0|This book is so descriptive u can't stop reading. The detail of it is so incredible u feel like u r there with the men of E Co 506th PIR
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This game came out for Sega CD in 1993 and is still my favorite Sonic game. My only critique would be they did not update the graphics
B005LAIISA|3.0|This movie was funny, but not nearly as much as the recent ones. Only buy if you get a good deal.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down! Beautifully written! Loved every minute I got to spend with Holder and Sky.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|As other tablet adventure games, this game is filled up with puzzles. It's very nice that I find several new types of puzzles I didn't see before. It's also good to me that it has another option for hidden searching puzzles. Instead of looking for tiny objects in a hge mess, you can choose to play a card canceling game to pass. Since I don't like the hidden searching puzzles, I really like this alternative.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Plot did not really make sense in several places leaving one to wonder whether they &#34;cut out&#34; sections to shorten the movie. No overall redeeming qualities.... save your money and pass this one up.
B001USHRCK|4.0|My 10yrs old daughter is a lego guru.... but I must say she kinda lost interest in this one after a while.  Me and my husband loved it though.  We finished it for her and then she spent long time pretend playing with the village.  Really pretty when finished too.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I thought the movie was funny if you dont mind vulgarity and drug use.  I would not watch this with any children at any age.  I would rent but probably would never buy.
B0051YDTKS|5.0|this is Ozzy and Randy at their best. I've loved this album since I was about twelve years old and to listen to it now , now that I'm forty, it really takes me back.
B004LROMQG|5.0|Fans of season 1 and 2 will like season 3 just as much if not more. The only complaint is that disc #5 (commentary disc) won't play in my dvd player
1250027624|5.0|Lots of detail on the way manor homes were run and the furnishings therein. The descriptions of the fashions of the time are fascinating. This book really enhances the TV program and it's a must have for all fans of Downton Abbey. The only disappointing thing about this book is that I realized it was not new. As I read on I found dirty spots. I should have realized it wasn't new when it opened flat and not stiffly as a new book. I will check to see if I can exchange it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Decent storyline, pretty straightforward progression though. Would have like to see a little more depth in characters and plot development
0385504225|5.0|I read it as soon as I received and didn't accomplish anything else around the house till I finished it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This novel is well written and keeps the reader on his toes. One wants to help defend Jacob and in tne end it appears he shouldn't be defended.  I thouroghly enjoyed this one
B009GX7IRA|4.0|I subtracted one start because Season 9 was just so over the top excitement wise.  This season seems a little slow in comparison. IMHO
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had a hard time getting started but once into the story I loved it,  Can't wait to see the third season start this Sunday!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Loved the action, the car race, loved the tie in with the previous Bourne legacies and want to know where we go from here.  Prefer the other actor - but....can live with this one.
B008G12ERC|4.0|There were definitely more songs on &#34;The 2nd Law&#34; that made the purchase worthwhile rather than regretful.  I'd say 80% of the album is great and there were only a couple of songs that I wasn't a fan of.<br /><br />&#34;Panic Station&#34; has a very &#34;Superstitious&#34; feel to it - maily the riff and &#34;Save Me&#34; is probably one of my least-liked Muse songs in their entire catalogue.  For some reason, it doesn't sound like Bellamy is doing vocals on that song and the music just doens't work.<br /><br />Overall, there were songs with a U2 vibe and a majority of the album is a win!
B008I43DYU|5.0|Used it to balance my checkbook immediately.  The big numbers make it so easy to use.  I will use it often.
0753822210|4.0|Interesting mystery, well laid out and told.  Kind of wonderfully creepy in its exploration of small town life and family dynamics as well.
0345803507|5.0|Some events surprised me in the book but other I knew would fall into place but its still a must read. This really wraps up the other two books and leave you hoping for a fourth and maybe a fifth book (at least I am). The love story continues and is worth reading every single page.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great plot.  Great acting.  Great writing.  Great cinematography.<br /><br />It is nice to have an original story with the old court room drama.
B000056VJ7|5.0|I love this CD. A real sing along.  thanks to Meat Loaf. aaaaa aaaa aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa
B009AZZEU2|3.0|Of course every Soundgarden fan is going to rush out and buy this album and I would assume my sentiments are similar to theirs.  Most fans would agree that this certainly isn't their best work-to-date; however I'm sure no one could argue that they were stoked to hear Soundgarden getting back together and went into King Animal with high expectations.<br /><br />I guess my expectations came down a bit after hearing a few singles from KA - which I think prepared me for the rest of the album.  I was hoping &#34;Live to Rise&#34; single from The Avengers soundtrack would have made it onto the album at least as a b-side as I believe that song gave many fans promise that the new Soundgarden album would be great.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sure these songs will grow on me overtime but for now I have to say the album is just okay.  Good, but not great.
0307341550|1.0|This book is disgusting, (there's no other way to describe it)and left me feeling emotionally drained, spiritually at a low ebb, and more than a little sullied as a reader. Let me compare it to bathing in vomit. In this book, violence is the main commerce of love. To feel loved within her family, the protagonist must submit to being hurt by one she is most supposed to be able to trust.  To resist (as she does)is to face ostracism and various forms of self destruction. In this book all the main characters have been a victim of familial evil (the worst kind), but there is no countering message of hope or any possibility of redemption.  The theme of despair runs unrelentingly through the book, generously laced with disturbing images of drug abuse, gratuitous sex (the heroine, aged 30,  is portrayed having sex with a boy of 18, and masturbating), animal abuse, self mutilation (the protagonist cuts herself), alcohol abuse, and foul language. If the author wants to write about the sordid hopeless human condition she needs to offer some glimmers of light in the darkness. She doesn't, so this work of fiction remains as perverse and twisted as the lives of the characters it portrays. Warning: this book does carry with it a sort of sick compulsion to read it to the end.  Perhaps my own compulsion came at least in part because this was a Christmas gift and I felt I should read it. In the end, although I finished it I relegated it to the trash can where it properly belongs!
030758836X|5.0|This is quite the story.  It is an intriguing mystery novel that turns into a psycological case study of a marriage.  Quite a read!
0345803493|5.0|I expected the events in the book to happen but the author still got me reading and wanting to find out what was going to happen. Their is a lot of sex in the book which did get annoying after a while but in reality it is a typical love story. I would say a must read for  anyone who loves to read love stories.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Was looking forward to the end of the series. Not a great movie, but<br />Completes the series we already own
B008GVSOCQ|5.0|A movie classic that I can watch ( and do watch) over and over.  The characters are all likable -even Mr. Parmer ( who became House!)
B009ERK1T0|3.0|Call me old, but I still prefer the Deftones from the 90's and early 2000's.  I think my last favorite album from the Deftones was their self-titled release in 2003 and everything after that has been okay.  This album follows suit from 2010's \\"Diamond Eyes\\" and the songs aren't bad, just a little hard to really like and get in to.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Probably one of the best books I read in 2012. I recommended it to my friends who love mysteries. I also read Gillian Flynn's other 2 books.
B004159Y98|3.0|There are a few good songs and there are some that are pretty lifeless.  I think if you can get it for the right price ($5 or less) it is worth a listen to.  Pretty slow moving and chill album.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I Liked the animation and story as presented in a more graphic novel way and not kid animated style .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Huge Fan. Never thought i'd like a zombie TV series but the walking dead is great. Stumbled across the first 2 season on Netflix.  I could write a 10 page review about how good of a show the series has been and why, but i am lazy; so i'll just say that i can't wait for new episodes to enjoy.
B009D7CP2M|2.0|I was intrigued by the letter format (the story is told through a series of letters from Eva to her husband). However, I found this book difficult to read and felt as though I was slogging through rather dry writing due to the lack of dialogue. I did like the ending, which made the read worthwhile, but it took a long time for the story to arrive at its conclusion.
030758836X|1.0|I was stunned by how bad this book was considering how popular it was. The two main characters are really twisted. As I kept reading, the book got worse. Don't know why I even finished it, probably because I was hoping for the book to get better. The ending was so totally stupid. Save your money and time by not getting this book.
030758836X|2.0|I kept waiting for this convoluted story to improve, it never did. My experience is if the first half of a book is not good, the second half is no better.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|If you are a fan of Dave Matthews, and especially his solo album, then you will like this album.  Phillips voice sounds alot like dave matthews and the sounds and lyrics harken back to them as well.  I think this is a better album than Dave's solo work as their is a great mixture of song types.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My very guilty pleasure! I wanna know more!! I hope she makes more!! I recommend this book for everyone!!! Love it
B00APUYWYA|4.0|If you like Glee, then this is the movie for you. From start to finish the movie uses an exact copy of Glee's premise. Only difference is that they are using an all female cast and use the Warblers as a means of singing without music. Great show, only it slightly feels pressured to inject a love interest that has little purpose being in the movie. Great Show.
0345803485|4.0|Yes, the writing is poor. I could have done without the bits about Ana's conscience and her \\"inner goddess\\" (all references to these two members of her subconscious could have been omitted entirely and the novel would have been more effective). Yes, the book reminds me of Twilight. Yes, the plot is unrealistic (a savvy millionaire who isn't even 30 yet? Come on). And somehow, despite its flaws, I devoured this book and immediately started reading book #2 after finishing this one (mainly because I am intrigued by Grey's character and I want to know his backstory).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG!! so captivating, I couldn't put the book down!! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Fun - all the sounds & look of the original arcade game, but doesn't respond quickly enough. Tried using a stylus & just my finger & got the same results. I probably won't purchase the full version.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book really kept me guessing to the end.  Quite interesting story and different from other things I have read.  I recommend giving it a try!
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you're looking for a great family film then this movie is a must!!!!!! Its suitable for ALL age groups and is a brilliant film!
1401323820|5.0|This is the dumbest part of your request<br />I buy hat I need!  Why do I have to rate it?
0307592731|3.0|I added this book to my \\"to-read\\" list after it won the 2012 Goodreads award for Best Memoir & Autobiography. While I enjoyed the book, I found the ending to be a bit of a letdown. I felt like the tone of the novel changed in the last couple of pages as the author tried to put her profound experience into words. It felt abrupt and awkward, as if she tried to wrap up the story too quickly.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Bought it for my husband.<br />He says that Clancy has skillfully retired John Clark and raised Jack Ryan Jr status to headliner and go to guy.
B004I654WQ|5.0|I can't believe it is still full price after six years but it's still worth it I suppose.  My son watches it every few days.
B005MYOWUS|2.0|I love the story. I first owned the book when my son was born. I bought this for my kindle, and it will not format to fit the pages correctly for some reason. I am very disappointed.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This was a Christmas Gift for 2 of my 3 kids, they absolutely Loved it, have 4 Grand kids who never saw the movie either and what a beautiful way to share n Blu Ray to top it off & in a Lovely Gift set! Came packaged well & delivered in a timely fashion!
B009VB97EY|3.0|This movie was so boring. The guys looked great but definitely no story line. Ladies if you want to watch a &#34;no brainer&#34; movie this is it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I watch this series regularly and we enjoy it immensely, but there are so many characters and changes in every show that I wanted to watch it again, and again.  The series keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing all the time.  The 2nd season is just as exciting and will buy that one also.
B00867GHS8|3.0|The digital copy was Brave instead of Finding Nemo.  It was a gift so they are trying to get it corrected.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|sehr lustig und unterhaltsam. selbsterklärend auch für die kleinsten. ein guter Zeitvertreib für zwischendurch. fördert taktisches Geschick und geplantes Vorgehen.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I could hardly wait for this sequel to arrive and it lived up to all of the expectations I have had for the Pendergrast series.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This was a cute movie, and I agree with others that it was underrated. It wasn't overly predictable, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|When I first got this I was absolutly pleased with it. Over time when it was brand new there were marks all over the discs. Be very careful who you buy this from!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My wife started watching the series last year so when I seen it was available, she got a set of DVD for Christmas.  She was happy with the gift...
B009KZMFOA|5.0|This recording is excellent--truer to Piaf than to Kaas. I love the expansiveness of Patricia Kaas and the Piaf material just doesn't give her a chance to be herself. But then, that's not what this album is all about. It's about Piaf--an homage to Piaf. And if that's what you seek, this is a fine album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a powerful love story! Read it in one day and ready book 3 though I don't really want to see it come to an end
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series is as good as you hear it is.  The storyline is beautifully developed and enhanced by the scenery and outstanding costumes.  Can't wait to see what awaits in Season 3.  Really loved the fact that this was a show that with a few rare exceptions, most episodes could be completely viewed with my family.  It offered some great historical tidbits also.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great Mahjong game, and it has great music, the background changes and its beautiful. I would recommend this game to anyone that adores Mahjong games.
B004GYY714|4.0|The transition from iPod to Kindle Fire has been  almost pain free.  I am still getting used to a few things, all minor, nothing major.  Wondering why the &#34;SLEEP OPTION&#34; isn't available on this.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies.  Will Ferrell is perfect for the part, and it's a movie that is suitable for the whole family to enjoy, which is uncommon of his roles.  Hilarious.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app is spectacular with all of its devotionals and reading plans.  I use multiple devotions and the 365 day chronological reading plan and have found the ease of use and having God's word at my fingertips is awesome. Downloading the Bible for offline use is also very simple and you have many free choices to download. You can download all or just one, it is very simple. I would recommend this app to anyone!
B00A5052YE|4.0|This was my first purchase of a CD by Alicia Keyes. I found her music soulful and moving. Fantastic job!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This is a favorite author of a relative & they were very pleased with it & will enjoy it a lot
B009VYAVTG|5.0|\\"I'm particulary interested into why all of a sudden Season 4 makes it into Blu Ray format after Seasons 1,2,& 3 have been out for some time on DVD? What am I missing here?\\"
B007N5YIUS|4.0|The transition from iPod to Kindle Fire has been  almost pain free.  I am still getting used to a few things, all minor, nothing major.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.
0545265355|5.0|The boxed set comes in a nice cover to protect your books once read (and re-read).  The quality of the protective box and the books themselves is superb.  A great bargain for the price.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love love love this book! It's amazing and you'll be hooked to the very end! You can't just read one chapter!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The sky is beautiful just like this book. What a great inspirational story on how strong we as humans can be. I loved this story so much. Definitely a must read!!!!
014004891X|5.0|One morning recently, I grew interested while listening to Mike & Mike in the Morning,<br />an early morning sports talk show favored by my husband. On the show, one of the Mikes<br />interviewed a prominent baseball pitcher, an avid reader and fan of fine literature, who<br />spends off-season reading fine books.  He had just finished &#34;Of Mice and Men,&#34; and<br />recommended the work. His recommendation was seconded by the same Mike, who<br />described being so affected by his reading of the book years ago that he cried at the end,<br />and was still moved by thoughts of it that day.  I was embarrassed to realize that I, an<br />English literature major in college,  had never read a book that these sports guys were<br />discussing so sensitively on T.V, and determined to even that score. The book had been<br />checked out of the library, so I ordered it from Amazon.<br />.<br /><br />I'd read several of Steinbeck's works previously, so I was familiar a bit with the soft touch, and the<br />caring-ness in his storytelling, so I enjoyed the book.  I thought I was prepared for the<br />ending, but, in fact, the resolution chosen by the author was not one that my imagination<br />had suggested in advance.  It more than moved me; it blew me away.
0553801503|4.0|At times this book really dragged.  The second half was much better if you can get through the first.  I plan to re-read a few parts after I am done with DWD
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The transition from iPod to Kindle Fire has been  almost pain free.  I am still getting used to a few things, all minor, nothing major.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.
0553801473|5.0|This book was bought as a gift for an avid reader and fan of George R. R. Martin and was very pleased with the gift.  The book was delivered in excellent shape as was of great quality.  Very pleased with this product.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|When compared to Apple the Facebook App for Android is substandard.  The app does not seem to be as up to date for this product.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It gave me a better understanding of the facts regarding the Seals and the raid in particular.  Heroes all of them.
B009CAAQIA|4.0|Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Frankie Said: The Very Best Of Frankie Goes To Hollywood (Salvo / ZZT)<br />The sticker on the front cover proclaims \\"Eight singles, three #1s, classic album tracks and two of the biggest 12\\" singles of all time\\". If there was any uncertainty as to the popularity of Frankie Goes To Hollywood at their poptastic mid-`80s peak, that one sentence will surely dispel any doubts. They were huge, and everywhere; on radio (despite UK BBC DJ Mike Read's best attempts to have them banned, castrated and shot), in clubs and on TV, and if you somehow managed to miss them, it was likely that your sister / mum / metrosexual best friend owned the t-shirt.<br /><br />This particular collection (there have been others) is well worth investigating if you've yet to transfer your FGTH from analogue to digital. It contains all of the hits, though not necessarily in the standard format/mix, and a couple of rarities for the diehard fan. \\"Relax\\" comes twice (see what I did there - forget it), a promo-only 7\\" version and the ever-popular \\"New York\\" 12\\" cut. \\"Two Tribes\\" and \\"The Power Of Love\\" are equally well represented. Of the scarcer material, a previously unreleased version of \\"Watching The Wildlife\\" is a corker, and their cover of Springsteen's \\"Born To Run\\" (recorded live on The Tube) will probably cause much pain and grief to the Brucettes, but for everyone else it sounds a-okay.
B00005B36H|5.0|Nothing like driving home from work with the title track blasting in the car.  I can listen to this album allll day
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The transition from iPod to Kindle Fire has been  almost pain free.  I am still getting used to a few things, all minor, nothing major.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B007H1HQW0|2.0|I bought the g2 Bottle cut because I decided I wanted a hobby that I could do at my leisure and make some cool gifts for friends out of bottles that would only end up in the landfill.  I made a bottle cutter out of some wood and wedged a regular glass cutter at a point and it worked ok... so I was shopping for something that could increase my productivity and make better cut's... research, research, research I decided on the g2.  I was excited to get it and less excited when I opened it up and started reading the directions (complex and unclear).  I have since used it about a dozen times to cut bottles and finish them into small cups and had only one success in a clean, useable product.  The othes shatter or break off jagged.  I will keep trying but I suggest not buying this device based on the level of frustration I encountered with it.
B002UXRH10|4.0|great rihanna....the record is perfect though the case is broken...no problem i've changed it...i love rihanna and her music..thanks for all amazon.
0307895475|5.0|Good to have with the game, my son loves it. wish I didn't have to write so much! It gets old.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|You have fun and end up thinking too-without even realizing it!! Great fun and you can use it on multiple devices.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album just never gets old.  Tool is one of the most innovative hard rock groups in the last 20 years.  I hope they put out something new soon.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The transition from iPod to Kindle Fire has been  almost pain free.  I am still getting used to a few things, all minor, nothing major.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.
1401322336|4.0|I started my culinary mission, to cook better and more healthy food, back in 2001 with Jamie Oliver's &#34;Naked Chef&#34; and it changed my life.  This book is excellent and so well produced it's easily worth twice the cost.  I bought it for my girlfriend as her culinary taste is somewhat fancy and I have always enjoyed Jamie's stripped down approach to cooking.  If you have not read Mr. Olivers other books or watched some of his shows I would buy some of his earlier books first, but this is a welcome edition to his volumes!!!
B005GPFDQK|5.0|great record for one of the best duran duran records...item is perfect. the shipment is faster than light....thanks for all
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Of course this is a great CD, my son loved getting it for Christmas,  wish I didn't have to write so much!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I rated this 5 stars baised on the first two seasons. I am looking forward to season 3, and expect that it will not disapoint. I do not see any weaknesses in this production, writing, cast, everyone associated with it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My three year old grandaughter downloaded this when I wasn't looking, but we both love it.  It's amazing how much she can do, and teaches problem solving.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|This album rocks...been a Hart fan for a long long long time and I think it's one of her best
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I have read the whole series and I love these books. They agree fun to read. Greg is a funny kid.!
034580404X|5.0|The books came earlier than i expected from the retailer and once I got the book I could not put it down. It was so intense that I actually felt like I was one of the characters. Loved it!
B00097A5HW|5.0|Of course this is a great CD, my son loved getting it for Christmas, wish I didn't have to write so much!
030758836X|4.0|It was an interesting read. I liked the way it was written from both a male and a female point of view.  I was unhappy with the ending but overall the book kept my attention.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The same fun I had when the Jewels games came out! I just wish there were were more levels, but then I'd never stop.
B000002UW1|5.0|With its copious amount of great tunes, the band whittles these songs to their barest essentials. They incorporate sociopolitics into Peter Buck's inexhaustible combination of jangly-folk and power-chord guitar. And with Bill Berry's sharp drumming propelling the beat, Mike Stipe's indignant vocals shatter any illusions of a docile world. The lyrics speak more personally because they're the most direct yet. On musical terms, they've had mainstream potential from the start, but the Top Ten single, \\"The One I Love\\", slaps them into it. Yet the song makes no attempt to put out the fire of innocence that never was. The scathing \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" symbolizes current U.S./foreign relations calling forth McCarthyism while also examining the ruling of corporate America. \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" rings out in America's interest with the stubborn trend of a U.S. invasion. The centerpiece of this record, quite literally placed, belongs to \\"It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\". With its images of devastation by fire, storms, starvation, violence and of which leaders agendas will be victorious in a \\"tournament of lies\\", it's the acceptance of saying farewell for catastrophe is always pending near and far. Their hardest rocking album to this point is surrounded by intellect but with the feeling of punk. These alternative rockers are on fire!
1451613512|5.0|Interesting and informative . Its validity and the true history of this great nation. I would recommend this book for informative reading
B00973902K|5.0|How could anyone not love this song? If you like this song then get it, if you don't, then don't.
B009X01C64|4.0|great case, fits the fire well really like the multi-positioning  the only addition i would like is pockets or straps a way to hold charger, stylus, earbuds things like that.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I liked the book for the most part. I'd refrain from comparing it to the hunger games though. This book is nowhere close to being in the same league. The writing is kind of choppy and not very descriptive, but it does move the story along at a fast pace. I gave it four stars but would 've done three and a half if possible. All in all a good story line and I 'll probably read the next book just to see what happens. The best part about the book is it keeps you guessing and makes you want to find out more.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I could not put this book down. If you love dogs and ever wondered about what they think, then this book is for you.
B005HSL626|5.0|We love this game it is fun and cute and the children love to play this game. It is really entertaining and great brain candy.
B008KPDYQY|1.0|More of an Amazon issue.  They let me buy it using digital download from my blueray but it will not let me watch it says it is not avaiable to buy or download.  Go figure.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such a well-done show. If you enjoy historical fiction, you will love this series. Every episode is packed with plot, suspense, and references to real historical events (sinking of the Titanic, WWI, Spanish flu epidemic)
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Although, this movie reminded me of Bring it on except instead of cheerleaders it was singing. It kept me entertained. However, I like Bring it on sooooo I guess that is easily done. I thought this movie was funny and yes, predictable, but I think that is what you would expect. I didn't feel like I wasted $4.00 after watching it. Therefore, I would say if you liked the movie previously referenced, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We have a Roku and very limited cable.  I was so happy to findWatching Dead on Amazon Instant Video.  The quality was great and there are NO commercials!!!  This is definitely the way to go!!  :)  We LOVE this show!!  :)
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I have never seen this movie with such clarity in picture. Sound is quite awesome as well. Very very satisfied with the quality.<br /><br />But, the theatrical version includes some deleted scenes, which felt a little cheesy. The were deleted from the actual movie for a reason. Some scenes are better off deleted.
B003719G40|5.0|I thought it was very insightful.  A quick read with lots of tips on how to change your relationship.  I really enjoyed it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves by Preston & Child<br />Two of the best writers I've read.  Always know their books will be good reading.<br />Highly recommended to anyone.  I read all their books and their individual books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A little like twilight with the love story aspect.  But a great book. I couldn't put it down until I read all three. and while the end does leave you wanting, in its own way had a finality to it that just made you feel deep down.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Definitely not as good as the original. However, I was glad it wasn't a complete mimic of the original. However, sometimes it's better to leave one enough alone. I didn't find this version to be entertaining and in fact it didn't keep my attention. It was filled with a lot of action scenes, so if you like a movie with a lot of action but hardly any story line, then this is the movie to rent. If you are like me and prefer a story line to be followed up with action, well don't waste your time.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|The best way to go when you want to watch a movie and not run out to the redbox.  It was so convenient and INSTANT.  Loved it!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This story grabs you by the eyelids and pulls you in.  The story of an astronaut stranded on Mars and his well thought out fight to remain alive while both Earth and space based teams work to help him is a compelling and fun read.  I would recommend this story to anyone who enjoys reading well written fiction.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Great animation that makes the Christmas Carol a modern must have classic. Fast and easy transaction, makes a classic more enjoyable for the younger generation.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Enjoyed Expendables 1,  2 is just as good.  Lots of action.  Lots of notable stars.  A little violent but this is the movies right.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This is the Swedish version of Forrest Gump.  If you like stories about the everyday man who gets involved in world history and makes an impact then you will love this book.
B000FC11JW|5.0|This book gives clear direction in becoming an effective leader. It shed great insight into the best use of time. This book was helpful in determining what is most important for leaders.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love this show.  this way I get to participate on meetings that take place at same time show airs then come home and enjoy commercial free shows of my favorite program.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. Made me appreciate how much hard work and years of training it takes to make things look &#34;easy&#34;.  Kudos
B000641D2Y|5.0|A must have, the last and true Home Alone. Had to add to my collection would not buy any of the movies made after this one but whats there to say that you probably don't know about it.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love, love, love the Walking Dead, along with millions of other viewers.  If you haven't started watching this series yet, what are you waiting for?!  I will warn you, there is a lot of blood and violence.  I couldn't watch the first season without my boyfriend being present because I had zombie nightmares. :)  The show morphs into a deeper and darker look at human nature, and in Season two it becomes less about fighting zombies and more about the power struggle between men.  This show is a must see, and I warn you - it will be difficult to wait seven days in between episodes and brutal when you have to go months before the next one!!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Great and entertaining book.  It has been several years since I found a book that I couldn't wait to get back to.
B009B4ZEJI|5.0|This CD is great! Really better than I expected, Christina did an excellent job on this one! This could be her best work yet!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is a little hard to navigate to the different pages. It will not play the games. I can read postings from friends and family. So i do use this app.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I hope the screen writer for this series continues to produce more movies like this one.  I enjoyed it for its wit, action, and what I call basically, a clean, decent movie.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|This movie was not as good as the first two but a movie that should have been better had the chance to be great but writers dropped the ball on what could be the last Dark Knight but left it open for what will be a flop the boy wonder unless they keep going with this line up.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I am presently reading and enjoying the book. Delivery to my Kindle fire was quick and easy.  A new approach to an old question.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book really draws you in and I don't want this to be a spoiler alert but when you finish and realize what the book was really about--you will think about it for days.
B00378VGGO|5.0|FMF is my favorite movie for a ton of reasons but objectively the movie is very visually appealing, the voice acting is just superb and the story line is touching.  Truly this is a movie that can be enjoyed by all ages.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play Solitaire. This app works well and is easy to play. I enjoy it at night, I can play while laying in bed and not bother my mate.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|I appreciate that romance can be done well w/o relying on sex scenes. Good values, good action, and horses too.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Though overall, I loved the music, it was missing some great songs.  I hope they come out with a full version.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|If you are a Castle fan and like to read then I need say no more.  Whats not to love?  I find the books even better than the shows!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have been awaiting this release  - and glad to report that I am not disappointed. I shall remain a fan.
B000V6583C|5.0|Do I have to explain how freaking amazing this album is, was, and forever well be. If the only thing that you know about GNR is the current incarnation then step back in time and feel the raw power of the band. Any guitar hungry fiend will need this as part of their collection.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I tried this app to see what Angry Birds was about. I don't play it very much but the app works well. I do not like to pay for games. You can play the original version for free. There are adds before you can play.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game! Om Nom is adorable.<br />There is a good balance between easy &amp; hard puzzles in each level. When it's time to introduce a new concept, directions appear to explain what will happen.  New concepts are introduced enough to keep things challenging, but the puzzles still remain workable.<br />The graphics are great, the music is nice &amp; that little monster is a lot of fun to feed. This game is absolutely worth 99 cents.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This is a great movie and great quality on bluray. A must own. I bought it for the soundtrack which is superb on my 7.1 home theater set up.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|Beautiful vocals in many different languages...not the run of the mill musical accompaniment - a pleasure to listen to and a few unique songs as well.
B00000J2PH|5.0|this is the most beautiful and soulful music you'll ever hear.<br />Carole King brings you into her life and soul with this<br />album.
B007IUFBCM|4.0|I do not like Drake, Drake albums, or Drake as a person. However, this is good album. Catchy hooks, brilliant rhyming, and really polished work. Give it a try.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Purchased this game for my tablet and it works very well.  These are great games for the past time while traveling.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Another great book by John Green.Part of why I love him is that he writes such real characters. Both Hazel grace and Augustus waters have earned a special place in my heart. I won't put any spoilers in but it's a book that really touches you. Bravo John Bravo.<br />Makes me proud to be a Nerdfighter.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I can't believe when people are skeptical to give this show a chance. It's a true drama, but not boring at all, which is I think the misconception. The characters are wonderful and the story is captivating. The quality on blu ray is superb. Season 2 is shaking up to be better than Season 1! Wonderful.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My granddaughter who is 6 1/2 moths old , loves this thing! Especially in the car hanging from her car seat!
B0052GACNM|1.0|AUTIFUL SUNG BUT THIS IS NOT MY STYLE, I CAN NOT EXPLAIN BUT YOU'LL FIND THE PRETTY SURE YOU WILL FIND THIS NOTHING
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This is classic movie that I watched on television when I was a child.  I shared it with my children when they were little and I wanted to share it with my grandchildren.  They loved it and were singing the song all day.  It will never go out of style in my family.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  There's objectivity and clarity.  I feel the author's interpretation of her research data was quite well placed, giving the book credibility, not to mention a well-written, straightforward presentation of her ideas.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Alabama Shakes' sound is a fusion of so many influences, it's hard to discern the exact combinations.  All I know is I LOVE them.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I bought this for the quality of the soundtrack which was supposed to be great on surround sound. So really, came for the sound and video, stayed for the story. Pixar at it's best, in my opinion.
0151001820|5.0|I read this years ago.  It's an excellent read.  I bought a copy for my friend for Christmas and he loved it too.
B0098460O4|5.0|VOICE THAT THE WALLS OF JERICHO COULD FALL AND THIS IN COMBINATION OF A BEAUTIFUL SINGER, AND YET SO HUMBLE
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like this app but I must admit I like the 36 hour forecast like the Weather Channel App does.  Maybe I haven't explored the settings enough, but the closest thing to a &#34;forecast&#34; I found was the hourly forecast.  Can't there just be a 1 or 2 sentence synopsis too?  &#34;Periods of snow throughout the day.  High of 30.  Expected accumulation....&#34;
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|This movie was everything we hoped it would be and more. It has brought many smiles to my child's face.
B00770KR7W|1.0|So it took about a month to be delivered, I open it up and the leg falls off with almost no effort, I've been messing with it for about thirty minutes now and I cant get it back on. overall, not impressed
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have it on my iPhone and love it!! I like how you can personalize your background and cards. The only thing is that on my Kindle Fire HD  the personal background pictures don't work. Other than that I love this app.
B00992CF6W|1.0|sounds good but 4$ is about as much as I'll pay 7$is a little crazy people!!! I mean 3 more $is 10 bucks no matter how good it is that's way to much, at least for me!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|HIS CD IS AGAIN A PLEASURE TO LISTEN TO, the winner TAKES ALL IS SURE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL. AND I'M ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN ABBA
030758836X|3.0|The promise of suspense and mystery were what pulled me in, but the characters were not likable, sympathetic, or credible.
B00000I5Y6|4.0|I only wish they had done more. Kansas is a great sound and a must have for your music collection.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great story and lots of action by my favorite author.  As always, lots of travel and adventure with good overcoming evil.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Really fun and unique game with a hilarious storyline! I would have bought this game had it not been a FAOTD!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've gone through all bu the last disk in just two days. Another fun ride along with our favorite Hunters.
1419705849|5.0|He has been collecting this series.  He had been hinting before Chrismas and was very happy to find it under the tree.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|This stupid app will let you play 6-8 hrs then you have to delete it and reinstall it.  Big major waste of time!!!!!
B0035WTE2U|5.0|It AC/DC. If you love them you got to have it.  Nothing Bout this band can be said here that hasn't been said everywhere else. Either you love them or like them. Either way there are. Great rocking band
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This is a fun cat to play with---love to hear it repeat back everything that is said to it!  Kids love it!
B005OCFGTO|3.0|Not sure if its because my dvd player is old or not but picture and color not as sharp as i would like...love the harry potter series though!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Okay, so by now my nephew who received the whole 4 seasons is anxiously awaiting the 5th and last season this year!!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|the case went on well but as other reviewers said it is hard to hear with it. other than that it has worked so far.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Personally, I think it's one of the best albums from Metallica in awhile (since reload came out)  I think it's more like the black album put together with ...and justice for all.  And I hope Metallica keeps going to the old style cuz they were sellouts for awhile when load and reload came out.  they wanted to go mainstream and get the radio play.  I hope Metallica stays this way forever.  I liked it. My honest opinion, I thought load and reload was good but not that good.  Personally, I like how Metallica fills up their albums where some bands don't.  Some bands will put 8 songs on there, 3 minute songs, and the CD is a waste of space.  What I like about Metallica is how they fill their CDs up with 6-8 minute songs and that's good for me.  But Metallica's cool all the way around.  I'm hoping they come out with another album soon.Metallica needs to make other albums like their first 4 albums even heavier.
B00008WT5J|5.0|It AC/DC. If you love them you got to have it.  Nothing Bout this band can be said here that hasn't been said everywhere else. Either you love them or like them. Either way there are. Great rocking band
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good graphics and easy to play - like that I can connect with my grandkids and send messages - like that the &quot;stars &quot; show the % complete

B004C03TK2|1.0|I had to return this DVD to the sender because it would not play in my player. Kept receiving Region Error which may have been due to the fact the DVD was from the UK. Took a long time for DVD to come in the mail.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|The whole family really enjoy it. We didn't have high expectations and we ended up very really liking it. Same characters from other tinker bell movies .  Well done.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|Led Zep is a staple when it. Ones to the classic rock era. Add this one to your collection and you have the best of e best in classic rock.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is truly a great read. It covers all the bases.... love, trust, friendship, and the confusion between love and hate and the courage to start over.

B000VHMF0A|5.0|Awesome album loves it I highly  recommend it.  It brought me back to the 80's in New York. It's a must buy!
B002YCVX5S|1.0|I rented this movie from Amazon streaming.<br /><br />It was unwatchable. About 20 minutes into watching the movie - I got some kind of 'Buffering' message.<br /><br />Then it just completely timed out.<br /><br />I tried to restart the movie numerous times.<br /><br />After I completely lost faith in Amazon streaming - I switched over to a Netflix movie and it streamed just fine.<br /><br />This happened with another Amazon streaming movie.<br /><br />It will be a while before I stream another movie from Amazon.<br /><br />Also - I could not find a place to get customer support.
B000059QYB|4.0|Love remembering where I was when I'd have the windows down cruising down the road with the Idol cranking. Still doing the same thing today
1891252089|5.0|In a realy good condition no marking at all look brand new with a goog price for a hard cover practice manual

B009JBZH54|5.0|My son has watch the whole trilogy at the movies and loved every single one.  So for Christmas I got him the Blue Ray version of the complete trilogy and he loves it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I enjoyed gifting all 4 of the perplexus puzzles to my daughters boyfriend for christmas.  Epic appears to be on tough puzzle. He was cussing with the rookie, so by the time he gets to the epic i'm sure he'll be ready for the rubber room so he doesnt hurt anything when he throws the balls.<br /><br />great gift ... especially if you like inflicting frustration!  lol
B000JMKTLO|5.0|If you like dark and twisty this is a must read. I am appalled and at the same time thrilled with the brilliance of the writing and the twisted story.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|These 2 discs....the CD and the DVD-A are incredible.  The Beatles never sounded so good.  You have never heard their songs sound like this!!  It is a must buy if you like their music.
1423121708|5.0|Great book awesome illustrations a really great buy and and and and and and and and and and Buy !!!!!!!!
B00001QEE8|4.0|great movie, good price deal, came in no time, good condition, awesome movie recommend anyone to like classical Disney movies
B00632HWOG|5.0|Who doesn't love Yahoo mail??  I don't know of any other email that I would enjoy more.  It is the best!!
B007HGPBRC|4.0|Christopher Hitchens always met life with zest; life for Christopher was a perpetual confrontation.  He steadfastly stood against what he saw as profoundly immoral and malevolent in this life.  His last words demonstrate that he faced death just as intensely as he confronted life.  He does this in his usual confidant, flamboyant literary style.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great weather app, continuos .updates, live video, live radar & 15 day forcast. My family and i  use it daily.
B0000V6SOG|5.0|This CD is the UK import.  Great CD.  I bought it simply to get the three &#34;Love Themes&#34; by Craig Armstrong that aren't available on the US CD.  Highly recommend this CD if you can find it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't put the book down. Read the entire thing in one day. One of the most exciting books I ever read.
B00015HVI8|4.0|excellent tv show to watch, great price, came in no time, full of adventure and action, always  something new going on
B00003INJ6|5.0|I have always been a huge Deep Purple fan and love all of their music.  If you're not familiar with their earlier stuff, give it a try.
B0063IH60K|5.0|classic game. no problems. I like the high score feature. simple outline. perfect quiet game for time wasting at work ;)
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Excellent long story.  I read all of Sylvia Day's books.<br />I think it was better than the 50 Shades of Grey series.
0307346617|5.0|This is a great book if you are a fan of the Zombie genre.  Highly recommended.  You absolutely will not be disappointed.
B00A757EFW|5.0|how do i download things on my tablet i can not figure out how to do it can you please help me out here
B00378VGGO|5.0|Love it. thank you  what a perfect  movie cute funny and id let little kids watch it thank you thank you . :)
B000026KG7|5.0|Of the 3 earliest Deep Purple albums, I had only heard the song, &#34;Hush&#34; (which prompted me to buy these) until I sampled them and never knew them as a psychedelic band before, but as a huge fan, I love it all!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|The agonies of love lost only to be gained again make for a very satisfying read. This is my favourite of Jane Austens books.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|another great Rebus story.  There is little to say other than that this is a book written by a master writer - consistently high standard in all aspects of the crime novel.  I hope there will be more.
630469654X|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Matthew Broderick is very quirky in this tale, but ends up being a hero. Love his sensitivity.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I was shocked to find that this dictionary contains entries for even the most obscure words! This book is what I have relied on throughout The Hobbit!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun game. hard to put down. I keep playing to see what happens next.  bad thing have to pay to continue adventure
B000026KGC|5.0|And this second Deep Purple album is no exception, although I am more more familiar with &#34; Machine Head&#34; and beyond.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book so much it's full of wonders. The wizard of oz is almost the best book I ever read!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Lots of needless information in the book.  Too much explanation of too many characters.  Typical in the series. Very dramatic.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i loved this game, it was scary and exciting! i will recomend this game to all my friends! i give it 5 stars!
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Only played a few levels so far, but seems to work very well and is lots of fun to play.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Great read very easy to get hooked on for many hours on end without putting down. Great plot line easy to follow
B004C0WVP6|1.0|My first drive was a 20 meg Seagate drive which cost more than this one.  Sadly, I bought one less than six months ago, and it failed with less than 3100 hours on it (from SMART).    But what prompted me to write the review was the fact that the warranty-*REPLACEMENT* drive is also junk.  The original was manufactured in China, the replacement (refurbished) in Korea.  Interestingly the refurbished drive shows 0 hours in SMART, so evidently they are able to reset the counters.    So, replacement drive is failing after less than 48 hours.  \\"The device, \Device\Harddisk2\D, has a bad block.\\"    Caveat emptor.  This was supposed to be a RAID-1 companion to a WD drive:  amazon dot com/RE4-Enterprise-Hard-Drive-WD2003FYYS/dp/B002XW44QY    I am extremely impressed w/ the WD drive.  I'm currently doing a robocopy of 1.5 T of data, and the WD is significantly faster than the Seagate (plus, the WD doesn't lock up & throw a bunch of errors).  chkdsk on the wd was an order of magnitude faster than the equivalent Seagate drive.    Over on newegg, I see similar complaints about Seagate's plummet, esp. wrt their \\"rebranding\\" of Samsung.  If you're about to purchase a Samsung drive assuming you'll get the same quality, beware, since Seagate bought them out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's super fun you can find gunpowder, diamonds,  gold,  stone,  and a lot more. I recommend you buying this game. Sincerely,Madison.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I could put this book down.  Can't wait for the next movie to be released to go with this.  Read the book in two days.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I didn't think the story line was that compelling.  I didn't really like the characters, whose development was light.  I didn't like the stories of the author and in general just couldn't buy into it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Another great game from the Angry Birds series. Very fun and you have to think a lil harder. Highly recommend to Angry Birds enthusiasts lol
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it really does wake you up it wakes you up easy and you don't have to yell or get fustredef
B00936A2SM|5.0|This is great example of modern fusion. All three players are in top form, the interplay is great, the song selection is fantastic, and the space each player gets lets them shine throughout the CD. I would like to hear more originals from these guys, but I highly recommend this work to every jazz fusion fan and give this great album 5 stars nonetheless.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though I have seen this movie which was very good it doesn't come close to how good this book is. Suzanne Collins does an amazing job at keeping it exciting, sad, interesting, and just compelling to read. Once I started reading I couldn't put down my kindle. Finished this in two days cannot wait to read the next book in the trilogy. Also this book has a very humbling effect on you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i don't even use this app, but i gave it five stars because my girlfriend loves it so much. she doesn't use the kindle for anything else since she has discovered it.
B0088TG252|4.0|Action packed. Interesting story line. Suspensful. Great actors. Seems realistic. There might have been a few curse words but I can't remember now.
B008G12ERC|2.0|The plus side of this over-hyped dubstep production that should have honestly just been a solo concept album from Bellamy himself (and I think it would have been fine that way!) is that at least Madness made my friend smile once. If this was a concept album from Bellamy I think I'd have been perfectly content. A full-production work from Muse as a band? This is almost as bad as it can ever get for a band. At least it can't get any worse from here...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is right up my alley. the graphics are awesome.  the story line is good without being too wordy. will definately get full version. personally I like having the test run before I buy and realize you cannot get every good game free. I have purchased other G5 games after the trial version and have yet to be disappointed.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|My daughter received for Christmas and loved the movie.  It ariived nicely packaged and quickly!  I will sit and watch soon
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy, as many of you already know, is the ground-breaking superhero trilogy by Christopher Nolan. With a superb cast, great direction, intelligent storytelling, and the best use of a comic book character; these movies are great.<br /><br />Now onto the collection itself. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of content I received, especially at the low-cost. The collection comes with all three movies, special features from each film, and a small book with production design notes and pictures. The collection serves as a great buy for any fan looking to own the series.<br /><br />5/5
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As usual the suspense and story line were top notch.  There was a little too much description for me, but otherwise a great read.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This is a good movie for couples. It was comical. It is somewhat realistic but not enough. It's hard to go along with Steve Carell being a serious therapist. I keep waiting for him to bust out laughing.
B00456PKG4|5.0|Love this movie.  I can watch it over and over again. Very well acted and action is well done.  Great for all.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Would recommend this app. for watching the latest weather conditions. Easy to read & comprehend:  I can check weather anywhere
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I love Cornell but this book is a clunker ! 200 pages in and nothing has occured.Boring and  pointless..nothing like her many exciting past books.
0446547573|5.0|I never once got bored with the book. I kept it open no stop for 2 days and I was finished. It's a good book keeps you guess
1423166302|5.0|I've been a fan for a few years now, and Rick Riordan has always been a great writer. I loved reading The Mark Of Athena! This book deserves five stars because I don't think it can get any better than that. It has everything a book can possibly have. Humor? We have Leo and Percy. Romance? There's Percy and Annabeth, Jason and Piper, and or course, Hazel, Frank and Leo. Depressing moments? :Oh yeah, TONS of that. A lot of save-the-world stuff? DEFINITELY! Reading this book has made me sad enough to cry, it made me happy, and angry, and I enjoyed it a lot. I'm sure anyone else would too.
B0063M22QO|5.0|If you are a Mahjong junkies, you will like this . Most are easy, but that's okay. Wish there were some that were more challenging.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Among most games that are like this, this is the one I like the most. The graphics are just UNBELIEVABLE!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the booked started when they were on there honeymoon and then flashback to the wedding...I almost cried when Ana had to lie to Christian and leaving him....the whole series is fantastic and hope there will be more
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like Solitaire then this is a good game. I enjoy passing the time with games like this that work your mind a little.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, so to now own it makes my life so much easier!  And no, I'm not like 8 years old!
B005VPRG10|5.0|He received both the tie fighter and the x-wing for Christmas and wouldn't go to bed until they were both put together.  He loves them.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|excellent arrangements and vocals. Fun worth the price of admission. Great listening anytime of year. Get it and play it
B008476HBM|5.0|a classic. I love it! I always want to read it iver & over but can never find the book lying around home. Thanks Kindle
B0049GYXDG|5.0|my wife loved the movie she loves these movies and they are hard to find at the store anymore. Great
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|So i downloaded this and played a couple of the easy songs and that was really fun.  But then i moved on and found a song i wanted to play and going into it we came across some 3 key notes and the kindle fire only supports up to 2 touchs at a time making them impossible to play on the fire.
B00A5052YE|5.0|Girl On Fire is such an amazing, empowering cd. Alicia knows how to make soulful music. Definitely a top for 2012!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I am new to converting text to Kindle, and I appreciate every detail I could get.  This broke details down where I could understand.. It was a lot of help for me
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It was very well put together and funny. I can't wait to see the movie!!
1250027624|5.0|Wonderful to read all about Downton Abey epecially just before Season 3 is due to air.  Can't wait to enjoy the new season too.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|This was not my first choice, but it was the less expensive choice. The box set is nice and colorful. All of the dvd's worked as long as I played them right away and didn't choose specific episodes. You get what you pay for I guess.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every Vince Flynn book.  The Mitch Rapp Series is so awesome.It is hard to put the book down. I can't wait until the next book!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Wonderful book. A fast read! You won't put it down. You feel like you really know the characters. Anyone interested in this time period will love it.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Great acting and story, plus colors were beautiful. A timeless classic without all the explosions and CGI of modern films.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie...it's one you can watch multiple times. It's a little hard to understand mask dude but after you watch it a couple times you learn the dialog.
B001LM1456|3.0|I was disappointed.  I've seen all of the recent movies in the Avenger series including Captain America, Thor, the Iron Man movies, and this one just seemed out of step with the others.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very fast and captivating read. Would recommend to anyone! I wish it was a required reading book for any of the schools I attended. I read this 1 year after graduating with my undergrad and still could see how it applies to my life today, in the past and in the future.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I've always loved the book by Dr Seuss of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and Jim Carey has brought it to life in a big way!  We didn't just watch it once this year, we actually watched it three times - and enjoyed it each and every viewing.
B003JVH7XU|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson, and he really liked it, although his parents were concerned that it did contain a lot of swearing it.  For that reason, I would not recommend it for children younger than 14.
B005SDMDRW|3.0|Readable, enjoyable but not up to Michael Connelly's usual standard, I feel. Had I not read any of his other books, I would probably have enjoyed it more.
0802473156|5.0|Opened my eyes to ways to express myself to others.  Great for anyone searching to find different ways of expressing love and caring to someone!  If you're thinking about purchasing, just do it!!  You won't be sorry.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have downloaded a number of Bible apps, and this version is by far, hands, no question, no doubt, The best. The reading plans and devotionals are so timely.
1936608898|5.0|Honestly this is the best book I have read all year. It opened my eyes to nutrition in ways I never thought possible. I thought I ate relatively healthy before, now I know that I was so confused by the media, the government and marketing on what healthy even is! Since reading this book, I have a healthier relationship with food and my body. And I have lost 17 lbs! Definitely worth the purchase!!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I think there should be a law preventing trailers that depict a movie to be better than it really is.  A total waste of money.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I received this order and was very excited.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  The joy stick is extremely difficult to use.  You can not &#34;steer&#34; Pac-Man at all with this very little joy stick.  The picture did not fit on my TV screen, it was blurry and the picture was in black & white with an odd sound.  Not happy with this purchase, at all.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Really have enjoyed reading all of this series.  Watched the movies and have been caught up in it all.  Not so keen on the English version of the movies
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I use Avast on my computers and now on my android tablet.  I have been very happy with it for years now.
0316098515|4.0|I have worked in restaurants before and love the creative process that culinary arts brings to the table (pun intended). This cookbook has great recipes and amazing images, with narrative adequately juxtaposed in between &#34;seasons&#34;. The one thing I will say (and the reason for my four star rating) is that the recipes call for generally expensive equipment. Daniel and Will do preface this in the book and say that not every part of a dish can be easily made at home, but as someone who has cooked numerous times from the Alinea book I had thought things would be a little easier. I am not disappointed in the book at all, just in the fact that I cannot make mozzarella ice-cream due to my lack of a Pacojet.
B009MO5960|2.0|I thought the last entry was bad but this is worse. Visually, it's pretty cool. But there is no plot, which is reinforced by Alice's sidekick having to explain what's going on to her and us throughout. The zombies only makeup at this point consists of red stuff around their mouths, no attempt at skin disfigurement at all. The original concept has been lost in the sequel ether, possibly to return in the finale.<br /><br />Yes, apparently Milla and husband/drector Paul Anderson are planning a finale for Alice. I wondered why until I went to Wikipedia to see what it has grossed so far. They are calling $200 million worldwide a \\"box-office success\\". So once again I'll get my hopes up and wait for an installment that will come close to the first three.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved the twist and turns in it. One of the best out of the series. <3 . On to the next!
6305212112|5.0|This is a very good movie.I like the stories that have a character that has gotten up in years remember things that happened so many years earlier.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great Klondike game, works well on my android tablet.  I would download it again.  I am very pleased with this product.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is, mercifully, the third and final installment of Christopher Nolan's contribution to the Batman franchise. The potential of \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005) has degenerated into thematic and narrative incoherence, sheathed in overlong spectacle. Despairing over the loss of Rachel Dawes in \\"The Dark Knight\\" (2008), having assumed the blame for District Attorney Arthur Dent's crimes, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has spent the last 8 years as a semi-invalid recluse in his family's palatial home. He is spurred into action by his company's financial difficulties and a new menace in Gotham. Bane (Tom Hardy), a big bald villain who speaks through a voice-distorting mask, has shot Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), raided the stock exchange, and seems to have a personal vendetta against Bruce Wayne and Batman.<br /><br />This is just a bad screenplay by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. The movie runs 2 hours and 45 minutes, inexcusably long for an action film, but I have to give Christopher Nolan credit for keeping me watching. He has stretched this thing out with so many useless, nonsensical plot points that it runs an hour longer than it should and makes no sense. To Nolan's credit, the visual incoherence of the action sequences that plagued \\"The Dark Knight\\" has improved. Unfortunately, this may have been at the cost of the action sequences themselves, as there are not as many as the audience will expect, and the numerous hand-to-hand combat scenes are lame. There are many instances of the actors punching air, people falling down without cause, and generally weak choreography.<br /><br />Batman's voice gets deeper and raspier with every new movie. Bane's voice sounds like something pranksters might play at while drunk, and he's sometimes difficult to understand. He doesn't say anything important, so I wasn't bothered by this. But, you know, two superhumans making monster voices does not make for edge-of-your-seat suspense. Bane is a kind of Robespierre character. The film takes more than a little inspiration from the French Revolution. This could be interesting if Bane were more fully developed. He is scary in the inventive opening sequence but seems like decoration for the rest of the film. Anne Hathaway is the new Catwoman, a streetwise cat burglar named Selina Kyle. She is suited to the character but totally unconvincing in the fight scenes. Selina is a bad girl who wants to be a good girl if only she could get a clean record. That's her goal. Ugh.<br /><br />Nolan has chosen to have Bruce Wayne crippled from Batman's many injuries. He can barely walk. Then, unbelievably, with no cartilage in his joints, he gets back in fighting shape, while in an African prison. This makes no sense. Why make him crippled in the first place? It serves no purpose except to elicit disbelief. Similarly, Bruce Wayne loses all of his money through fraud. Not only is that not credible, but it is completely unnecessary in the narrative. The whole movie is like this. It is overplotted and incoherent. Stuff just happens. Thematically, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" suffers from the same problems as its predecessor: It vacillates between advocating freedom or fascism, seemingly with the wind, whenever the screenwriters can't think of anything else to do. It has never occurred to Christopher Nolan to present some kind of coherent world view.<br /><br />As a whole, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" does not work at all. Taken as a bunch of disjointed scenes, it has its moments and, remarkably, manages to entertain often enough to keep the audience on board for nearly 3 hours. Christopher Nolan gets the credit for that, but the Batman franchise could not withstand any more of his contributions.racter.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|That's the great thing about time travel movies that are well thought out, many plot twists become possible, and Rian Johnson has written and directed a great movie here using this device very well. Finally a sci-fi movie that is worth the price of admission after so many big budget diasappointments of late. Goes to show you, sci-fi that requires some thinking will always beat out sci-fi that only requires CGI.
B000I9X7M6|2.0|Don't stream this one.  The audio ruins a fine production.  I don't know where you can get a better version.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I saw the three Swedish movies before reading.  The books provide much more detail and background.  Only downside is that I lost some sleep staying up reading.  I plan to get the American version of the movie to watch soon.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I purchased this yesterday and was able to get it on both my devices for 1 purchase price which is a great deal. I really like playing with this and planning on taking notes at school. The option to text or use handwriting is great and is very sensitive--even on my kindle fire without hd. I ordered a special pen that I hope makes it even better. Maybe in the future it will be able to convert writing to text like 7 note?? Highly recommend!
1451695195|5.0|I always consider Amazon reviews before making a purchase (caveat -- if there are enough of them).  I read the top rated critical review of this book and I disagree with one of its main points.  Dr. Alexander does, indeed, go into specifics about his experience.  Of course, given everything he experienced, I'm sure there's more to \\"unpack.\\" The complexity of some it may make a translation into words/language woefully inadequate.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting this book down.  He writes well, with a compelling clarity.  Today I purchased paperback copies for several friends.  This is a good book to share -- it can spark meaningful dialogue about some of life's big questions.  And for those who don't believe, but are willing to consider the possibility of consciousness originating with the soul -- and not the brain -- it's an ideal story to read.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The latest Pendergast trilogy comes to an end and I thoroughly enjoyed all three books, as Special Agent Pendergast tracks down the murderer on his wife.  The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is the Nazi genetic experiment story line has been done before, although Preston and Child give it their own special twist.  However, I loved the tougher Pendergast.  Now, where does the storyline with Constance go from here?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|AMAZING HEART WARMING STORY!!!!!!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH<br /><br />I REALLY FEEL HAPPY TO FOR AUGUST I  AM IN LOVE WI THIS BOOK
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It shows life as it was in Great Britain during World War I and what the social mores were regarding the higher social classes, and what life was like being a cook or manservant in the lower class.
B009VB97EY|2.0|So Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer (I'm sorry I'm not sure how to spell it) are super hot but seriously this film had absolutely no plot and I got really bored after like... 45 mins but the dancing made up for it.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Saw this on tv years ago. Was glad to find it on my search of some old Albert King. Really cool!
1401307787|5.0|I have read so many meditation books.  This must rank as my personal favorite, one I shall give as gifts to friends.  Every page has a gem-concept.<br /><br />As an aside, I love the rough-cut texture of the pages.  Reminds me of handmade books and a time when books were special.  I love my Kindle, but the feel of a good book...yeah!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bets book in the series to me. This book would leave you in the edge of your seat. A lot of surprises in the book. I would recomend this book to all
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Hits all target areas and set at a pace that is comfortable.  Individual area workouts tough but you have you choice of the length of time of the workout.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I would consider reading more of this author's books.  The storeyline was good and it kept you interested for the most part without being repetitious.  I'd recommed it as an easy bed time read.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Personal situations in 1300's in England tied into real historical events keep you reading - can't put it down..  Highly recommended
B008YRVW0I|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loved this app when she visited.  I can't answer questions as to why as she hasn't been able to visit since she tried it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is brilliant. It is a great story that was filled with action and romance. The ending was sad and I can't wait for the house of Hades!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The best novel ever written.  Even the first 177 pages, which is the story of the Bishop's humility, generosity, and unconditional love, are a story of hope in themselves.  Les Miserables is Victor Hugo's search for hope among the poorest, most vulnerable people of Paris, in the 19th century.  How did the people get in that situation in the first place.  We follow the life of each character, through the quagmire, and with the leadership of some courageous young people, bring these poorest of Parisians to support a common cause.....freedom from the tyranny of the State.  This is the greatest story of HOPE for the common man.<br />Included within the novel is the best description of life in the sewers of Paris, and the most detailed account of the Battle of Waterloo ever written.<br />Les Miserables is a novel you will hold to your heart when you've finished reading it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have not finished the book yet.  I was interesed in it, because several of the WSJ reviewers said it was outstanding and they couldn't put it down.  So far, I am not of that opinion.  But I may change my mind as I continue.  I do not intend to stop reading it; it is on my kindle, and I don't carry it with me at all times.<br /><br />Anne Hebert
B00821OW8K|5.0|I hadn't heard of this show until I saw it on my Amazon prime, and frankly I love it. I think the graphics are very convincing and amazing.  I was very into the story line on the very first episode! Furthermore, this wasn't cheesy at all, and unlike many other shows similar to this genre I didn't find myself constantly questions the actions of the characters. Everything seemed realistic and genuine. In fact, I am on a one month trial for Amazon Prime and this show just in itself has convinced me to buy the annual subscription. I can't wait until they release season three on here!
B008BR3QOQ|4.0|Excellent collection of new rock.  Exceeded my expectations.  A little more relaxed than the Crowes.  Kept me wanting to play it over and over.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|Too hard for me. Might be fine for those more adept with these kinds of games. The cube kept falling off the ramps into outer space. Got discouraged very fast, so deleted it from my Kindle. But it is one of those with amazing graphics and actions, so would probably delight the more dextrous.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I am sixty plus years old...I saw Alabama Shakes on Jimmy Kimmel one night and was hooked!  I love blues, among other kinds of music.  There was just something about Britney's voice and the simplicity of their music that drew me to them.  I listen to this CD all the time.
B004GJYROG|5.0|This brought a lot of nostalgia for me. I adored this movie when I was a kid, and it is even better now that I know the hidden jokes meant for adults. Product work great and shipped on time!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|I have only read 20% of this book but I love it!  My new favorite author.  Great story that keeps you turning pages.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole series...They kept you up late wanting to know what happens next.WILL READ AGAIN AND AGAIN..Thank you
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Al Pacino! Kevin Spacey! Jack Lemmon! Alan Arkin! Ed Harris! Alec Baldwin!<br />How could they afford all these top actors? A marvel of direction, script, acting, every aspect is perfection as these characters stumble through another rainy night of their desperate lives. Sometimes a slate of top names is wasted. Not here. Each star turns in performance worthy of his reputation and worthy of viewing over and over.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Another good free game from GameCircus.  Patience is required to regenerate free coins.  It is an addictive game that allows you to spend real money should you be so obsessed.
B007F5SG22|5.0|Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali<br /><br />What an eye-opener! A wonderful story of human courage, and wonderfully narrated.  It was remarkable to experience this individual's different life journeys. I could not put it down.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|It was a gift for our son. He absolutely loves it. He has watch it over and over. Completed satisfied.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a huge Grisham fan and was not disappointed by this book. Finally an ending where everything works out.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This film continues to amaze me. I saw it several times when it was in theaters, and then I bought the dvd set.<br /><br />Just showed it to my girlfriend's nephews, aged in their mid 20s. They both loved it. Why hadn't they seen it yet? It wasn't on their radar.<br />Maybe they'd heard the name, but they didn't associate it with sci-fi, or action. They were basically unaware that \\"John Carter\\" would be anything they would have an interest in watching. Might as well have been named \\"John Doe.\\"<br /><br />So as the film played, I watched them watch the movie. Because I wanted to see if they were able to stay focused and attentive. Some critics say that the film narrative is too broken up. And I agree there is a lot of story happening in the first 30 minutes. It certainly jumps, in time and place. First Mars, then Earth in 1880s, then 1860s, then Mars again.<br /><br />So I watched the nephews watch the film on my big screen TV. Along with their 85 y/o grandmother, and their 50ish mother. And you know what? EVERYBODY GOT IT. Everybody stayed interested. I know there are critics who nitpick this film to death. But you know, this film holds up well next to any good film in the sci-fi fantasy hero category. You could nitpick Avatar, Thor, Batman (Didn't see the latest one, but appears to be a real downer film), Captain America, James Bond (another downer thematically for the latest one--what is with movies in 2012?), Star Trek, even the original Star Wars.<br /><br />John Carter is practically the original American super hero. Well, I guess that would really be Hawkeye, from Last of the Mohicans, originally written in the early 1800s. Why didn't Disney say that in the advertising, what little there was of it? Why is it that I could come up with a better advertising campaign than Disney? Well, I guess you'd have to read the mind of Disney chief exec Robert Iger to find out why it makes sense to spend $350 million on a film, and then not promote it.<br /><br />Given Disney's track record of promoting this film, you better buy the DVD set. The Therns will soon make sure this film is unavailable otherwise.<br /><br />I would also add that this film provides a great role model for women. The female lead, Dejah Thoris played by Lynn Collins, is wonderful as an intelligent warrior princess.
B006O6F932|5.0|Everything was easy to assemble, my 10 year old was able to do it herself. The house folds up perfectly and makes it easy to store.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Awesome, action packed and funny even, good storyline, hope for the next one but they'll be hard put to equal the first two.<br />Thanks for a great movie!<br />PennyRacine
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Not only was this one of Denzel's most finest acting performances, the movie was just riveting, emotional and just down right great. Really a wonderful movie - be prepared to go on an emotional ride. It's not all about the airplane but the person.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This version was dark and more adult in comparison to previous remakes. The video stream was also very crisp and clear as well. Thanks again Amazon
B000XR4OC0|5.0|They are wonderful shoes! They are great for the house and if your in<br />A rush to get somewhere toms will slip right on when you head out the door!<br />My daughter has a wide foot and I don't but we both got matching ones for<br />X-mas and i would recommend 1/2 foot up! I promise there great!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Saw this movie in theaters and knew I had to own it!!!  This unrated edition is awesome and the movie is great in Blu-Ray.  Definitely recommend this for anybody!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This was a well composed book but it was a little too sad for me to like it. I am surprised that so many people loved it. I am beginning to hate stories that include abuse in any form. I fell in love with how Holder loved Hope and almost never gave up looking for her. Sky should have known why she never felt anything when she kisses boys or girls (classical sign of abuse numbness).
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|I have seen this movie a million times, but I forced my hubby to watch it for the first time. Even he loved it!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|i love this band.  i love this cd.<br />i dont want to rate things, blah blah blah.<br />thank you for being in my ears.<br />chaney
B0087240Z4|4.0|The shiny headed rocker prone to hissy fits has, finally, started his long trek towards redemption with this latest offering. While it doesn't quite match up to the grand days of his 90s output, I have to say it comes close. Really close, in some cases. There are enough sonic surprises to keep you coming back. If you're a Pumpkin Head you should dig it. If not, the. You probably won't be converted.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|This movie was more of a glorified Glee than the comedy is portrayed to be.  Some funny parts but they are hit in the trailer.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This novel is unbelievable. Thought provoking beyond measure. God is good and true. Trusting in God even though things unseen can be tough to believe.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|My entire family really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and heartwarming without being overly cloying or mushy. Also, there are some clever references for adults &#34;Bank of Evil, formerly Lehman Brothers&#34;. Highly recommended.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Excellent aesthetic and style, with simple rewarding gameplay. I know I'll be playing this for a while. The animation is excellent. Ads can be intrusive.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all 3 books. Book 3 is my favorite of them all. It's not just a sweet story but full of suspense. Great story. Fantastic author. Looking very forward to more books by EL James.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I really like this and it was filmed mostly right down the street from me. I enjoy watching this with my wife but it does get graphic at times.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Downloaded it on a whim and now 6:30 in the morning I read the whole thing great love story. Thanks
B005UBNKWO|4.0|A great processor for the price. I would recommend it for anyone who needs to upgrade or replace on a budget.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a great book, full of suspense and playing off real issues and events.  I love Demille's books and he writes with such a great sarcastic, dark humor.  My dad was a NYC cop and I totally get this dark humor.
B004UUKD6W|5.0|This version is the best avalible peroid. The artwork looks great and has some new photos and the sound!!!! Well the sound is so much bigger. The classic Queen harmonies are so much more present and clearer than they used to be. All around the new 2010 Queen releases are a must for any fan. I would have liked somemore outakes or live versions from that period of the band on disc 2 but I am sure we will see them down the road. Love this and loving hearing this new release over and over.
1451695195|5.0|It is very interesting book, it makes me have deep thinking about after life, spiritual lifting etc, it deserves to read again,
B006GG1KOC|5.0|My nieces are the hyperactive types. Can't get them to sit at the doctor's office, waiting in line at the market. I just load them on and give them my phone .. now i got it on my phone and tablet and just give it to them to play to keep them quiet while waiting. A saver !
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Not one of my favorite animations for my kids, but entertaining enough to keep them happy. I usually enjoy these unique types of animation but the plot was kind of lame.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|It's a good game. I thoroughly enjoy wasting time away with it. If you have need of a puzzle game, this could be it.
B005ORVN1Y|5.0|These box set is amazing from a visual and sound standpoint. The box looks great with small LP gatefold sleeve reporductions of each release and the booklet included has some great artwork/pictures not included in original releases. Now the sound. The best sounding versions of any of the releases period. Really amazed at Power Windows and A Show Of Hands. They sound so much bigger and better now. Cymbals brighter, bass bolder, vocals clearer, keyboards fuller, guitar punchier and much more present. I love all Rush but was never huge into Power Windows, however once I put in this new release I found myself just in awe of the sound and really rediscovered it. Signals is a different mix in 5.1 but it still is amazing, I would have paid $40.00 for just this. Overall sell the old releases and upgrade to the Sectors boxes. Rush did a fantastic job on this and this release is for the fans.  So happy to know anytime i want to spin these releases that I will have the best version possible.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|NIce to see a story about the issues us empty nesters face. Great acting by two of our most acccomplished actors.
B004UHSB5A|4.0|Nothing fancy, it does the job well. Decent graphics ... I wish the graphics animation were better. Can't complain much, got it for free.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I liked the plot and the possible ending the movie could have taken. I really enjoyed the idea of making a living like that.
B008KE3960|3.0|The game play is a lot of fun. My only problem with it is it massacres my kindle battery. Probably about two hours of playtime.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Although I've read numerous books on Lincoln and other presidents this book is still suspenseful, informative and very well written.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Understanding Exposure is an essential guide that contains the knowledge that the photographic artist requires to record the image that is seen in their mind.  This updated edition should be considered required reading after the purchase of a digital camera.<br /><br />Even if transitioning from a film camera, this guide contains useful pointers as to why your images may not be turning out as you expect.<br /><br />A highly recommended read for any serious photographic artist.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Not his best work. Seems to be going downhill as a writer. Trite characters, silly ending. Best works seem to be behind him.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie was alright. I liked the 80's Flash Gorgon appearance and the fun watching them get themselves into the typical party too hard trouble.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Love minecraft just wish there was a discount or something for people that own it on another platform already. 4 stars only because its a bit expensive.
B007V65R54|4.0|This book does an excellent job of explaining the limitations of human's abilities to predict future events, and still profit from those limitations. I found the sports-related sections a bit tedious, since I'm not a baseball fan. the lessons to be learned applied to other fields are limited. But once he compared sports to earthquake predictions and the need for past data to make good future predictions, the point was made and the book became clearer.<br /><br />His riff on political predictions made to simply to make people happy are great.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the movie and I especially liked having the Amazon copy included.  The type of digital copy that comes with it must only work with Amazon, but that wasn't an issue for me.  It was nice to be able to watch the movie right when I purchased it and not have to wait for the DVD.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This app gets all it's news from yahoo.  It is nothing like the real news on Google's website.  Very limited.  Not recommended.  Bookmark the website if you want LOTS OF NEWS.  Sorry to shout but I am annoyed!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I enjoyed this move a lot. It had all the vampire kills one could ask for and the typical history between friends from childhood.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Read this book so that I could see the movie. Overall a good book however a little slow at times.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Convenient having it on my Kindle Fire. Having the weather at my finger tips is great.  Plus they are ususally pretty accurate.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Fascinating story for all who enjoy the game. Showed an in depth look into the Oakland a's and the baseball world as a whole. Highly recommend!
B004YXE438|5.0|Get it now if you love puzzling!  So many choices--size, background, difficulty of play.  You can even make puzzles from your own pics.  I love this app!  Very addicting.
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|Movie was a bit pricey but came through in a crunch for a last minute gift.  Arrived on time which was a biggy.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|very funny  reccomend to all who love to laugh home alone 2 is the funniest in the series  will watch again
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used this DVD at the start of 2012. Before I ended up with my diagnosis of RA and Osetoarthritis in my spine. This workout really does work! I lost 14 inches on my body overall. I didn't lose a ton of weight in pounds, but the inches were amazing!! I love Jillian, so don't hesitate to use this workout.
B008HLZUUE|5.0|I love this series, it makes me really excited for the series on HBO. Which is how I originally got started on this whole series. I even got my wife hooked.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It absorbed me like a good novel and I loved watching all the episodes in a row like I did.
B00AKNYBRK|4.0|Like a lot of Pet Shop Boys fans I guess, I was really looking forward to hear what Stuart Price had done with \\"Memory of the future\\" because it is one of the best songs of their last album but although Stuart Price's mix is good, I must admit, it makes me appreciate the album version even more. In this way it reminded me of Very's 3rd single \\"I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing\\" where even though the single version made by the Beatmasters was great, its release made me love the album version even more : because it was more simple, more direct and straight to the point. Well, it's the same thing here.<br /><br />Granted, Stuart have used here some great sounds, some of them are even like a blast from the past because they are like the ones used on I'm not scared (Eighth wonder's version written by the boys), but this new single mix makes this song sound even more pet shop boys-y than the pet shop boys' own version on the album and it kind of lost a bit of the appeal and uniqueness of the original version in the process which is a shame because the album version didn't sounded like anything the pet shop boys had done before but now with this remix and all its echoes, arpeggiator effects and powerful bass, it's like any other pet shop boys single of the past which I think is too bad, in a way. But this song is so great that either version is a real treat, a pleasure to listen to anyway, so it doesn't bothers me that much but I still think it was worth mentionning.<br /><br />The other tracks of this cd are also good songs that could have made it to the album, the better one being One night but Listening and Inside have their own charm too. But in retrospect now, I find that Winner's single patch of new songs were the greatest because no extra-song can beat the quality of A certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\" this year even though In his imagination on Leaving's cd single was a good song too.<br /><br />I had the chance to get my hands on the remixes cd too because I've already ordered it from Amazon in Germany where the remixes cd have already been released as well, so I can comment a little bit about the remixes too. The longest mix of the two made by Stuart Price is called extended version when it's only a dub version really. Too bad. I love original extended versions but even though there are a lot of Neil Tennant's voice samples in this mix, they can't call it a proper extended version if it does not include all the lyrics, can they ? This extended mix starts very nicely with good electronic sounds and thumping beats but the mix gets boring after the 2nd minute, shame. All the mixes are good but the greatest mixes are the ones made by Digital Dog though.<br /><br />What surprised me the most in here is the cover of the single : the picture is odd but awesome and the glossy feel of the cover is amazing when you touch it : it's one of the reasons I always prefer to buy the pet shop boys records than to only download their songs because the pet shop boys are with their friend Mr Farrow as good designers as they are good songwritters.<br /><br />Let's hope now that a 4th single will come out of Elysium in a few months : I would love nothing more than to buy an \\"A face like that\\" cd single, for instance, even though I know they might not do that because if there's one thing the pet shop boys aren't : is being predicable. But I can still dream about it, can I ?
B006O6F932|5.0|My older daughter is almost 8, she really loves this school, mansion, etc, etc. Has many pieces, small and big ones. She spends a lot of time playing with this play set.
0767805712|5.0|The storyline is fantastic, and the acting is just as great! If you are a sci-fi lover, then this is a movie you will enjoy. Even if you aren't, it is still a really great movie!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I hadn't been reading books for awhile. It was a very good read and hard to put down! It's a book I would recommend reading!
B009X011UQ|4.0|I wanted light weight and flexible. It does just that. The price was reasonable, too. I tried one that allowed me to read with the kindle  in either vertical or horizontal position. It was very heavy.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|The Longstrike CS-6 is known as Nerf's \\"Sniper Gun\\".  I must say that there has been much improvement since the Longshot CS-6.  While not as long as I prefer, it i still reliable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was amazing. Couldn't put it down. The connection between characters was great. I wanted to know what happen next. The way she described who the characters where made me feel like I knew them. And the twist at the end really got me.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is BBC at its very best.  I used to watch Upstairs Downstairs decades ago.  This is similar, the lives of the aristocrats upstairs vs the lives of the servants downstairs.  Exceedingly well acted.  I am a little hearing impaired and find it hard to make out all the words because of the British accents, but the DVD has English subtitles.  Rush out and buy it.  I have already pre-ordered the next season, season 3,  which will ship in late Jan, 2013  (Amazon, of course.)  This is the best of the best of the best.  Need I say more?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is awesome. It has amazing graphics and great story line. I have never played such a interesting game like this from a tablet or phone. I highly suggest playing this game!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I really love this CD - Rod's voice and interpretations give a different spin to some songs that have been around for a while without taking away what made them popular in the first place. I also really enjoyed all the guest artists and duets as well. If you looking for a new Christmas CD to add to your collection, you can't go wrong with this one.
034580404X|5.0|I chose this rating account this trilogy was an amazing read.  Great price for used books which were in great condition.

B0028MBKVG|3.0|An expose into the characters of ultrarunning. This not a traininng guide but an entertaining read that gives some lasting thoughts for those long runs.
0345803485|5.0|I had to keep stoping to look up some terminology and my husband says I blushed a lot just reading it but I find it daring and thrilling!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book reminds us of what a great presdent Abraham Lincoln was, but that he had to deal with the same egotistical personalities that we are dealing with today
B005UKI1TW|5.0|Beautiful concert.  First half is opera, some solo, some duets with guest soprano or baritone.  A gem.  Buy it now.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Its a good way to pass an afternoon. Both my husband and I enjoyed it very much. Gave us something to do while tv was nothing but repeats
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game does have an option to turn off the countdown clock!  Look under menu then options.  I also like the fact you don't have to go through the dialog if you don't want!
0345803507|3.0|While the first two books were so enticing (I read all 3 in 4 days) this one seemed to skip around a bit and seemed to edit out some of the more sensitive parts and details.  Let's face it... the sensitive details are why we kept reading 3 of these books isn't it?<br /><br />I felt like the author was rushing to be done with their story with this one.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A lot of thought went into the plot of this book, twist at the end slowly came together all through the story as you would think back on the events that led to the conclusion.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a very fun but challenging game. Some levels are very hard andsome are super easy. Worth the purchase price.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good book shocked how fast I read It.. I recommend this book to ppl who like 50 shades it has a good storyline
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was a great read if you're looking for a better than average erotica book.  Those people who are reading simply because of the hype are disappointed because this obviously isn't the genre for them.  It's not supposed to be some fabulous work of literature.  But it is captivating and I couldn't put it down.  You have to completely suspend disbelief throughout the story, but what's wrong with that.  A great \\"escape\\" read and I'm about to order book #2.  Don't be scared off by the bad reviews.  Read it and enjoy!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cannot wait until February for the rest of the season!  After watching these episodes, we went back and watched a few episodes from season 1.  The improvements in writing and character development are dramatic.  The dialogue is much more meaningful and so much less of those expository monologues that drove us crazy.  Andrew Lincoln is just amazing -I thought the way they showed his grieving process with those phone calls was really moving and intelligent.  But everyone's acting is strong.  Even the characters we don't particularly like are so well acted, I have to still appreciate them.  David Morrisey is phenomenal as the Governor -I love the way they portray him here, likable and beguiling -rather than the obvious black hatted evil villian in the comics.  And plenty of good zombie stuff makes some of the inconsistencies and couldn't really happen that way moments forgivable.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|still learning, but so far is easy to use, may change as I learn more and try to do more with it. Wish I was able to use it more like a camera
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Si, en el momento exacto en que necesitaba leerlo, en el momento en que mejor iba a comprenderlo; hace sólo un par de meses no hubiese sido igual. Había tenido durante mucho tiempo resistencia a leerlo (el popular betseller que todos leen... No me interesaba), pero ahora entiendo que no había llegado antes mi momento para leerlo.    Yéndonos más a lo objetivo como obra literaria, creo que es un excelente desarrollo con la propia visión de Coelho, de una historia que ya había sido escrita antes y que seguro proviene de alguna parábola persa. Vi que Jorge Luis Borges tiene un breve cuento ([...]) que es una forma fortísima de traernos la misma enseñanza.  Pero la forma en que Coelho muestra y desarrolla la historia es preciosa, de esas lecturas que te hacen constantemente reflexionar y que no puedes parar de leer.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought the book was very erotic and captivating. The book left me longing for more and I will most defiantly download the next book of the series.  I do feel that some things that where in the book were a little far fetched and to good to be true.  This is often the reason why I escape to these types of books because it takes the reader away from their mundane lives. I would recommend this book to anyone who may be interested in exploring their inner goddess.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|First off, and this isn't a negative, this case is HUGE!  I expected this little rinky-dink case that could fit in the palm of my hand.  I was very wrong.  It IS smaller than your typical camera case but it allows me to take my DSLR with me without having to drag my entire camera bag (on wheels) when I  know I won't be changing lenses or using my other camera.  I have a Nikon 5100 with a 18-55 lens in it.  With room to spare.  (I also own a larger lens:55-300.  I'm sure it would fit in there as well but NOT with the other lens and camera too.)<br /><br />Along with the section for the camera there are three other zippered pockets.  They're small, but convenient.  One of the pockets has sections for two memory cards.  What I do is put my cards in a holder and put it into the same section as my camera.<br /><br />This bag is very sturdy and is meant to protect your very expensive camera.  Lots of cushion!  The nose of it is made of rubber or plastic and protects the lens very well.  Overall, if the camera gets dropped while in this case, I feel it's very protected.<br />Pricewise I feel this is cheap compared to other holster cases.  I've gotten quite a few AmazonBasics items have nothing but good things to say about them.  They're well made and typically cost less than name-brand items.  (They're generic so they should cost less, right?<br /><br />I highly recommend this case to photographers everywhere.  Enjoy!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The game is a lot of fun and can be a real challenge at higher difficulty.  Great value for only a dollar.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is one of his best - could not put it down. It paints a scary fictional picture of cyber war.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. It is a good brain teaser. My husband and I love playing it. Very addicting too!! Love it!!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I love this book it's so bittersweet....  i cried like 5 times ;( & the ending is hard to deal with .
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wonderful!!!!<br />Now to apply the concept of measuring life in minutes. To slow down and enjoy the blessing of life and the ending of life  God had me read this now with a new diagnosis of breast cancer.
B002VRNR1Y|4.0|I first read the book on a long plane ride across the Pacific when I was a young soldier many years ago. The book was a bit too long for my taste, and therefor I really liked the movie when it came out later. To watch it again recently for the second time brought back many memories. This movie is a classic.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Let me admit right up front that I put the book down after the sixth chapter. I'd had enough. The frightening truth about Grey is that the story is just interesting enough to get readers hooked before the eroticism comes out. By then most readers would be unwilling to put the book down. On the other hand, there seems to be a MUCH larger contingent of readers who want this brand of sexy than I ever thought possible for mainstream audiences. Are we all that desperate? I'm not, and perhaps this was why I could put it down and say, \\"Whatever\\".
B00005JLR2|5.0|I love this movie and have loved it since the first time I saw it. I bought 2! My sister is also a fan so I got it for her as a gift. This movie is funny, sad, and has enough action to entertain a child and older ages as well. My 5 year old niece loves it and after watching it once before bed she asked if we could watch it again first thing in the morning. I would definitly recommend this one!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this game is really fun iwish I could get more coins tho it takes si long to be able to buy more stuff for the game but I like it even tho I cant buy stuff when I want it but all my friends play me so its really cool great for the children!!!!!
B009H442DG|3.0|Disappointed with their voices so many years later. This was the least flattering that I've heard Olivia in the past few years with newer recordings. Her voice has certainly fallen off lately. John's is OK, but just not quite up to what I have heard in the past 10-15 years.
0061900656|5.0|We have both the &#34;I'm a Big Brother&#34; and &#34;Sister&#34; books. Our daughter and son have enjoyed them and they helped them prepare for younger siblings!
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I really liked this one.  As a work-a-holic, I appreciated the feel good message.  Classic bummer to success sequence.  Perfect for a rainy day.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|this is a really good book. i think it would be a good book for people really into navy seals
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Amazing to watch Led Zeppelin in concert! Awesome photography and sound. I listen to the CD's in my car and watch the DVD's at home. Great set!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Each chapter of this book is about a different character.  As soon as I fall in love or hate with one and want to keep reading, the chapter ends.  I could not put this book down and am now almost finished with the 2nd one and cannot wait to read more!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is awesome!  I love this style of music and the &#34;Piano Guys&#34; are really great!  I plan to purchase more of these.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's worth the download.The first levels are super easy but as you go it definitely get more challenging. Give it a try.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I would have rated 5-star, but for one little piece of molding that juts upward on the gray rails (somewhere in the 30s I think), making it impossible to move the steel ball past that point.  I may have to take it apart in order to fix.<br />Initially, I couldn't see how anyone good finish this puzzle, but after some practice and a lot of patience, I am able to whip through most obstacles.<br />Great game for the coffee table at the beach, ski house, or home.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This book really brought together a lot of strands of the Pendergast story. It answered a lot of questions and reviewed a lot of what came before--which I tend to forget after reading a book! It had a good deal of suspense and I loved it!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|THIS IS A COMPLETELY BIASED REVIEW BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As a big fan of his books, I think this is Nicholas Sparks best novel. The story kept me wanting more!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|My first Reacher book, and I got it 2nd hand at the local library for $2.00!<br />I knew there were a lot of these in the series and I was worried about coming in so far down the line, but it did not seem to matter, I still found out about Jack and who he is, not reading any of the others made no difference. Lee goes into incredible detail about certain things that do not always seem very important to the story, but you read on and find yourself totally engrossed in the book. This is not the best book I have ever read but it was enjoyable and I kept coming back every night until it was finished. There is a twist in there that I sort of guessed, but the details about the Russians and Afghan soldiers was really interesting, especially the women. The details about things like the train and the signs of a suicide bomber all made for a great read. He also has a detailed knowledge of NYC, LC obviously does his homework!<br />Overall I would recommend the book, it is not perfect but is still well worth a read, I will definitely be checking out more in the series.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Tells me everything I want to know from hourly to 10 day forecast. Love the features provided too. Very handy
B005LAIIGC|5.0|A Magical Film filled with Fun and Wonder that many films today lack. This film is a breath of fresh air in the way  all of its characters are given more attention to detail and depth. All the Guardians are Brilliant to watch and the villain Pitch too! A Fantastic Film all round!! 10 STARS!!!
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|I love how (with a domino effect or subtle guidance), they stumbled onto the higher levels of spiritual growth despite his own personal history and the oppression of the ancient oppressors that are still here today. I would however read the book first since the movie can be somewhat misleading because you are missing details that are better explained in the book.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is what he wanted so he got it....what more can you say about a controller????? It works great and it makes him happy.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I'm obsessed with Lost and I love everything that comes with the collection. My favorite television series ever. Can't get enough.
B008NMT684|5.0|This is awesome and I don't have anything bad to say about it. Highly recommend to everyone that is out there and reads this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game here but the energy refill is slow as all get out. if not for that its great and fun game
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Watched the color version by mistake.  Will watch the classic black and white next Christmas;  Great movie to add to my collection.
B0096I9UTE|1.0|Like any pop/rock fan, the words \\"Abbey Road\\" hold a special lofty place in music fans' hearts, mainly due to the Beatles and what their namesake LP title did for the history of rock music.  After much curiosity, I listened to the tracks after getting my hands on Kylie's latest offering.  My first reaction was:  \\"What a DUD\\".<br /><br />These sessions add absolutely NOTHING to the original versions Kylie recorded, some going back to the mid to late-1980's.  Hearing tracks like \\"Locomotion\\" and especially her big crossover hit \\"Can't Get You Outta My Head\\" getting the makeover in London's Abbey Road studios to new instrumentation and vocals actually pale in comparison to their original versions.  If anything, Kylie's voice sounds noticeably WEAKER here than her original versions, maybe due to the inevitable onset of age.<br /><br />So, save your wallets, Amazon folks, and skip this trashy money-making scheme from Kylie's recording label.  Maybe it SEEMED like a good idea at the time, but definitely wrong, wrong, and WRONG execution here.  Like some here have commented, a waste of money by Kylie and her handlers and a waste of our hearing time.  If Abbey Road Studios takes on more \\"DUD\\" projects like this, it could easily tarnish their lofty reputation in the music industry.  Perhaps Kylie and her music producers better head back to their drawing boards and cook up something more \\"original\\" than trying to make a quick buck off the name \\"Abbey Road\\".  Surely you CAN do better than this, Kylie!!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This is awesome and I don't have anything bad to say about it. Highly recommend to everyone that is out there and reads this.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|There is much to explore with this set. The quality of the remastered So cd is outstanding and the extra materials are great for the true Peter Gabriel fan. The extra DVD of the live show made this package special. I wish they offered without the Vinyl as I no longer have a record player.
032147404X|5.0|The first book in a series...this book deals with the practical aspects of photography and taking good pictures.  Well done.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Really not sure what Diana Krall was trying to accomplish with this CD.  Half the time she sounds like she's fighting against the material, which is middling at best.  A singer who always needs and commands the best material  and production to go with her distinguishable smokey vocals, Diana Krall didn't climb to the top of the jazz heap in the past 15 years for nothing!  All that seems to have evaporated with this incomprehensible recording.  The SHOCKING cover photo says it all:  \\"Yes, folks, this is Diana Krall in this porn get-up, and if you don't like it.....well, you know where you can go!\\"  It's as though she's flipping the middle finger to her die-hard jazz fans as she heads down a new musical terrain -- whatever that terrain might be.<br /><br />Of the very few decent songs where Diana's \\"Julie London\\" voice comes thru are:  \\"Butterfly That's Caught In the Rain\\" \\"Let It Rain\\" and the title song \\"Glad Rag Doll\\".  Ballads are still where she excels and \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" really gives her a chance to sink her pretty teeth into the material.  But the other song choices here really are puzzling.<br /><br />In 2004, Diana made a nice detour from the jazz scene with her risky but rewarding \\"Girl In the Other Room\\", where the contemporary material (including her Joni Mitchell covers) blended seamlessly with her jazzy interpretation.  But here it's such a mish mash of hackneyed material, it's difficult figuring out where she's heading or what she's trying to say.<br /><br />Krall has probably reached a mid-life crisis career-wise where she's rebelling against the standard, bland jazz stuff that has made her a household name -- and a VERY RICH name at that!!  It happens to almost every artist at some point where they need room to breathe and try different material, but here the songs are simply suffocating Krall, the singer.<br /><br />It's quite shocking to hear how unfocused she sounds here and the \\"all hell goes\\" production values.  To top it all off is that \\"what the hell\\" cover photo that Krall will probably regret in a few years time, especially in trying to explain to her kiddies why Momma decided to pose as a porn stripper for a CD cover.<br /><br />Judging from the mostly negative feedback here from her disappointed fans, \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" was a big gamble that did not pay off.  But I applaud Krall's courage to try new material, even if it ends up alienating her jazz fan base.  Hope this lesson will serve her the next time she tries to record more \\"ground-breaking\\" songs.  I am sure with a singer of Krall's stature that finding decent material isn't a problem.<br /><br />Maybe she'll look back at \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" someday as her \\"mid-life crisis\\" CD, everything from the horrid cover photo to the lousy selection of songs (barring the title song and maybe one or two others mentioned above), the rest can go in the trash heap.  Or better yet, next time get hubby Elvis to contribute some of his genius songwriting.  It certainly can't be worse than what's here.

B009E3EY38|5.0|Led Zeppelin was a great band and even better in concert. I agreed with them not performing after John Bonham died as it was no longer the same band. This concert shows again what an incredible band they were/are. In a single night, with Bonhams son on drums, Page, Plant, and Jones again showed the world what Rock  N Roll is all about. I was so afraid that this would never be released and am overjoyed now that it has. This is one to watch with your kids, grandkids, great grandkids for many generations.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My little sister wanted to see it and I went along, and I am glad I did! A very funny, romantic comedy, but stylishly done well. Great plot, beautiful actresses, cheesy lines, but an overall feel good movie!! Worth every penny!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I love to watch tinkerbell anyway.  I am an middle ages woman but still a kid at heart when it comes to tinkerbell
B005HS00NW|4.0|I like this cd.  I reviewed on Amazon before buying and the snippets were good. I generally only buy the one song I like on MP3, but this was worth buying the whole cd.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I've read this book twice and it never ceases to inspire and astound me! I love every page! By far a new favorite
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Shia laBeouf, is not bad, but Tom Hardy steals the show! Based on a true story of three brothers and their survival during times of prohibition, the movie has it all; rebellious action against a corrupt justice system which closely parallels current events of marajuana legalization.
B000I0QL82|5.0|A great holiday tradition in our house. We gather together, light a fire and watch Bing and Fred at their finest
0553386794|5.0|It's a great set of books although it starts out slow explaining all the various characters which makes little sense until you see it tie together a couple hundred of pages into it, but I was warned so I trekked through it and it was definitely worth it.  I would recommend the Kindle version though because these are some big books to lug around for that long (unlikely you'll whip through these that fast).  Excellent imagery, creative, fantastical, but the story line gets a bit dark with all the violence at times.  Great book series overall.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|got me reading again, and here I thought that wasn't possible! This book was so addicting, I wouldn't be surprised<br />if I find myself rereading it sooner or later!
B000I186FW|5.0|Despite my indifference towards Natalie Portman as an actor, the plot, cinematography, fluidity, and intellectual dialogue, makes this movie a 5 star movie in my book. For being set in England during the future in times of yet another global catastrophe, the socialist parallels to Nazi Germany party contemporarily portray current events in which any country's future may yet endure.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|I was so excited to hear there was a new Mika CD.  I love every song, and enjoy listening to it while on the treadmill.
0553381695|5.0|It's a great set of books although it starts out slow explaining all the various characters which makes little sense until you see it tie together a couple hundred of pages into it, but I was warned so I trekked through it and it was definitely worth it.  I would recommend the Kindle version though because these are some big books to lug around for that long (unlikely you'll whip through these that fast).  Excellent imagery, creative, fantastical, but the story line gets a bit dark with all the violence at times.  Great book series overall.  The second book is significantly darker and at some point the endless gang rapes and murders get to be poor bedtime reading.  The third book must have a lot of new characters because a very large portion of secondary characters die in this book.  It's very well written and a great story plot overall so I'll keep reading on.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|If you like stories of the mobsters this is a great movie i can watch it over and over again
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The Bourne trilogy was not bad but drawn out. Jeremy Renner out performs them all and makes the Bourne trilogy worth watching again. Great action, short, yet predictable plot, but the best one yet.
B0040JHLIG|5.0|Great tennis shoes, and I purchased some time back.  I would purchase from this company again.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love it!  I like falling asleep to the white noise and I can choose my own music to wake to in the a.m.  Great app!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I've loved rewatching the shows.  I've already lent it out to several family members and friends.  Highly recommend both seasons
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Funny, entertaining, and worth it, but a little to long where the plot seemingly portrays a traditional romantic comedy where couple deals with that one friend who is the external bad influence. nevertheless, the crude family guy like comedy makes it a feel good funny movie.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I am surprised I did not see it in theaters.  It helps that it is historically based.  Some parts stretched the imagination a bit, but who's to say?  There was a lot that went on in that region during the 20's and 30's that we probably would not believe today.
B008476HBM|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the classic greats. You cannot help but fall in love with the characters. This novel has humor and romance . . . it's a must read.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Just basically our type of music.  We love his voice and has done a fantastic job of these Xmas songs.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I love the original but if you have never seen it then you needn't worry. For the most part the plot is parallel to the original but stands out in a more futuristic sense within itself.
B0086700CM|5.0|cool, it keeps you wanting more,wanna get to the next level and see where it leads me to keep on running
B00499QUK2|5.0|I can't believe this is a television show. The stories follow the books with modern twists, the acting is great, and I am a fan.
0525952926|5.0|If you like reading books by author Ken Follett.  You will definitely like this book.<br />5 stars for the booki.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Totally, under rated overall but with an open mind, an amazing twist of fantasy intertwined with profound historical events that have shaped this very country. If Lincoln was as this movie portrays him as, a vampire hunter, then American History would be that much more interesting then HIST 101; However, great plot and great action.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining, a clever witty and endlessly imaginative story! I could not put it down and even went for a re- read! Given it to all my family as Christmas presents everyone loved it.
B00466HM28|5.0|I was looking for a portable midi controller to connect to my iPad, and the Akai MPK Mini looked perfect.  After spending some time using it, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The pads are well built and responsive.  They keys have a good weight and spring to them.  They are much easier to play then other mini keys that I've tried.<br /><br />It connects easily to my iPad 4 with the camera connection kit.  My iPad supplies enough power for the MPK, so there's no need for a powered USB hub, like other controllers.  So far, I've been using it with GarageBand to record ideas while on the go.  I've also been using it with Korg's iMS-20 and iPolysix, as well as Yonac's Magellan.  It works great with all of them.<br /><br />I got 25 keys, 8 drum pads, and 8 dials for a great price, all on a piece of equipment that can fit in my laptop bag.  It's the perfect portable midi controller for my purposes.
B00407PNWO|5.0|For all the reasons others here have so eloquently stated, this is the greatest motion picture of all time.  Ten stars.  Perfection.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|Its always good to go back and watch the original that spawned the trilogy and yet the franchise, despite not reading any of the books. Nevertheless, always good to see for action and adventure.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|My wife has been looking forward to watching Dark Shadows at home and I rented it on New Years Day. I enjoyed the movie......She loved it. I would watch it again.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|some good martial arts - arnis - wow bodies and amazing workouts.<br />set up like a dark comic book story. very &#34;dark night&#34;.  It won't change your life, but it's really fun to watch.
B0011E7JBW|5.0|I hate the first line (G-D bugs), but then I start loving it every time.  I would tell you more, but I already looked into the light.
B001AOKA3W|3.0|Good story line; however, much like the blair witch project, the cinematography is a little un-nerving and somewhat frustrating but entertaining.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Beautifully and sensitively written about this era in our history.<br />Kept me captivated until the end. The voices of the characters each were very distinct yet woven beautifully  together to explain the different viewpoints between &#34; brown eyes and blue eyes&#34;.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|doesn't do that much...amusing for the first minute or so.  I will probably delete this app in another week or so.
B000I8G5NA|5.0|Not as good as the first, but that rarely happens anyway.  I loved this movie and the way it threaded number one into it.  These two are a great pair.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl<br />Both characters were sicko's, then they were going to bring a baby into the world.  Not my kind of a theme for a book.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Loved this movie- I watched it on Netflix and ordered it the next week. Well done and a sweet story.  It is your typical Disney story, cheesy and all about finding true love!  Julia did an awesome job as the wicked queen, with her humor it moves the story along quickly.<br />Directed well, and the film was just very well done!  I enjoyed watching it.  It is also kid friendly! If you are a Snow White fan, go ahead and give this one a watch.  I loved it!<br />Ships from Amazon and offered with Prime!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Just like outrun, quick and fun with customizable controls...definintely has the old school challenge level to it as well!!!!! Get
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my son, an avid Minecraft fan. I am the Lego fan in the house, but he did love this gift. The set is small, many small pieces, but put together is a really nice looking display. He pointed out the hidden &#34;gold and water&#34; pieces to me and it really is cool. If you're a minecraft and Lego fan I'd say you'll definitely like this item.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is okay. it's not my favorite of hidden object games, but it's also not the best. im at level 32 and i haven't paid any real money. it is annoying to constantly have to do the same rooms over and over again just so you can get more energy or to be able to advance a level. its also annoying that you just get the same stuff over and over again until you open more rooms up.
B005PXXDP6|5.0|When I first heard this band I loved them and now 20years later my son asked me to buy him this disc. He loves it!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is a movie that adults will like very funny and lots of action for a movie with a stuffed animal for a main character.  The actors all did a great job .
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I'm not going to delve into cinematic critique here - and keep it very simple: this is a terrific movie. E.T was one of my favorite movies when I was a little tyke. Super 8 brought back the same fantastical, whimsical feeling of E.T with a whole new story. The child actors/actresses are awesome. Spielberg films have been hit or miss for the last two decades, but with the direction of J.J Abrams, Super 8 is without a doubt a hit.
0060531053|5.0|I read this book in a day and a half. I have reread it 3 time. There is a ton of information laid out in a very easy to read fashion. If your a beginner or someone who has been at it for a while. I think this book will be there through out all of your home brewing journeys. The beginning of the book lays it out clearly enough that any beginner can jump in and start creating great brew. The book continues with progressively more advanced methods, terms, and all the lovely science involved in making great beer.<br /><br />I would recommend this item.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|Bought this for my 3 year old, and she loves the game. However, I find that this game does crash pretty routinely. Luckily it doesn't freeze up my device, just drops you out of the game, and have to restart it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This stuff works great and always has for me.  I have not had a problem with the application or reliability of this compound.
B0010T0QNQ|5.0|I have very wide feet and high arches. They are a bit tight across the top because of my high arches but am hoping they stretch after use. The only problem so far is that the black on the bottom scuffs the white finish. Haven't tried to clean them yet though-it may come right off with some 409 cleaner. Love the color. Look great with jeans or shorts. Love crocs. These are not as cushy as my first pair but they are acceptable. This is one of two pairs I bought and I love them both. I especially love the pair with the 'sock' type of insert--they are soft on the feet and great to wear without socks. If you are considering those I highly recommend them! I recommend CROCS to anyone that wants a great fit especially if you have wide feet--these are FANTASTIC!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very additive game. Would recommend this for anyone who likes games with movement.hope this helps anyone that is interested.<br />I am a little disappointed that after getting up to level 43 it re- set and put me back to level 1.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|I have the original and this expanded version is even better. I saw the tour back in the day and the live tracks bring back great memories.
B0091ICDHU|4.0|If you're into young and forbidden romance... give it a go! It's definately sweet and endearing! Tugs at your heart strings in points. I shed a tear (or three).
030758836X|4.0|Hated to put this book down....full of surprises.....Never could have anticipated the ending...Lots of fun.  Can't wait for her next book!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love it. All three movies in blu-ray and digital. Plus a little handbook that shows images and has information of some behind the scenes.
B001JRB16U|5.0|What a wonderful movie!<br />I don't think the magic of it will ever die. Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke just put everything they had into this memorable film.<br />I can't tell you how many times it has been played in this house for my children and now for my grandchildren!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a beautiful app that's easy to navigate and very accurate. I use it daily to plan my gardening activities around the weather, and it really helps! :)
B0030MM68O|4.0|With the changes in warfare, this is one look at real stress is. I didn't like the ending, to short!
1250027624|5.0|The book was exactly what I hoped it would be.  Lots of pictures and great details about the cast.  I can't wait for the new season to begin.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|funny show! Rented again on new years eve so i could entertain company and they all laughed pretty hard! ENded up buying this movie
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this book because it was so popular, and talked about by almost everyone.  I thought it was okay, but not a quality piece of literature.
B005PK1G76|4.0|it's a good stuff to put on the handles, but I wish it had a cover attached to it, so that when we don't use it, we can cover it to avoid dust.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I was flipping through the usual netflix shows and came to this. I had never heard of it, but I gave it a go AND thought it was so fun!!! Yep, I'm a fan! Sam and Dean all the way!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is definitely worth your time if you like witty comments and great remixes of popular songs. The characters were extremely likable and the plot was engaging. The love story was definitely not the greatest, but watch it for everything else!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Love the graphics and the fast pace.. reminds me of Sega's Outrun game!<br /><br />Got it as a FAOTD, but would gladly pay 1.99 for it.. great game!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a great sequel to the original game Angry Birds.  The game is much more thought provoking and causes &#34;out of the box&#34; thinking.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ahhh I need the 3rd book, I'm so excited! Took 3 nights to read it, if it weren't for sleep I would have finished faster! I &lt;3 Peeta!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Seriously - read this book. Gillian is such a good writer it's not funny.<br />I don't know anyone who read it and didn't like it!<br />That's all
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I can't imagine the horrors this young lady went through and still come out with a positive attitude. Her story is heartbreaking but amazing. Worth reading!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids LOVE LOVE LOVE this game.  This game has entertained my children for countless hours in the car on the 8 hour trip over Christmas
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|I kept waiting to care about one of these characters, or see them grow, but this movie just kind of 'happened'.  This movie had a great cast which was totally wasted on an unbelievably bad script that took the movie nowhere.  The level of violence is very sudden and ridiculous.  I can tolerate a violent movie if there is a good payout (think inglorious basterds) but this one contained all the disgusing violence without any reward for viewing it.  Guy Pierce (great actor) played the bad guy who was written more like a psychotic comic-book villain than anything believable.  He was clearly trying to channel Christopher Waltz as Captain Landa? from Inglorious Basterds, but it just came off silly in this movie.  Also, Gary Oldman shows up for all of 2 brief scenes, but in the trailer it is implied he plays a big role.  He doesn't.  Wouldn't recommend.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|After reading \\"Gone Girl\\" I read this book and WHOA! I may almost like this one better. I can't get over what an excellent writer she is.<br />This book is so disturbing and messed up in an amazing way. The twists keep coming and the characters are so interesting... Her mind works in mysteriouly wicked ways.<br />Read this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|didn't know much about the whole ebook thing but this book is great and downloaded really quick! I really do love reading Nicholas sparks book
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Of course, the coins never last long enough for you to truly obtain the goals and bonuses you need, so there is always the offer to buy more coins.  However, at least this one replenishes you with coins several times per day.  Overall, great game.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|After watching MIB 2 I had expected another franchise instalment, although I will admit, when you throw in Rosario Dawson franchise installments aren't all bad...<br />Men in Black 3 was another story altogether, number one it actually had a good story, and some imaginative plot twists.  There were a few moments that, were they not handled as well as they were, would have fallen completely flat, but they were handled really well.<br />All in all, great special effects that were not overdone, good plot, imaginative story, solid editing, good pacing that I found nether to slow nor too fast, good acting from good actors, all adds up to a damn good movie that was damn well made. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is cuz I am prejudiced against Hollywood, if you want to see a really excellent (non-Hollywood) sci-fi movie, I recommend &#34;Iron Sky&#34;, but if you don't pay attention to the news, and don't know what polysyllabic means, you'd be happier with MIB 3.
B001E9641K|5.0|It'd probably have even better game play with three people, but it's definitely better than the original &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; when only two people are playing.  As always, details are off (the placement of the Arctic Circle annoys my husband), but the game itself is great.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|When I got my Kindle about 6 months ago I had searched amazon for a case to keep it in and chose this one. I have been pleased with the quality of this product and have kept it on my Kindle ever since I got it. However, there are a few things that I think buyers should be aware of before they make this purchase.<br /><br />- The products \\"kick stand\\" feature that props the Kindle up does not work very well. At times it can be somewhat irritating just setting it up, unlike other products that will click or snap into place; and once you set it up a slight shake of a table will cause it to fall back down. Because of its design it does not make it convenient to use and limits places where you can use it.<br /><br />- This case is not highly durable. The backing does have a sort of hard plastic to it, but the screen has very little protection. The front side protecting the screen is made of a thin sort or rubbery plastic with a fabric lining, which feels weak compared to the backing. Since the screen is the most delicate part of the Kindle and many people buy a case to protect it, this is not for everyone. It will protect from scratches but not smashes.<br /><br />- The price of this seems steep, there is not much to product at all and when I think about it, it's almost like buying a book without pages, only the hardbound cover... for $30.<br /><br />Some may be confused why I am giving this product 4 stars when I have all these negative things to say. The answer is, I like the product. It is exactly what I wanted, I mainly bought this product to add \\"style\\" to my Kindle, while adding a little protection. The cover does protect from scratches and its fabric lining keeps the case from marking up the screen as well. My only complaint is the ridiculous price, otherwise I would give this 5 stars.<br /><br />Personally I love this case, but I do see many shortcomings to some who may buy this product and it is not for everyone. However, if you want to a stylish case that givesprotection from minor scratches, and willing to spend some money, this is a perfect product for you.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|So far, I like what I have seen from this app.  It seems to do exactly what it claims to do.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book and the first one. Everyone should read it I promise you will love it or you don't have a heart. Lol
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This set, first of all was a GREAT price! The quality of the show was excellent as were some of the documentary style snippets included.  Love the show--so happy I was able to get it!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|If you want to laugh, watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. It's one of the best christmas movies I have seen in a long time.  Funny, Funny, Funny!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great novel that is on television.  It has a real vision of people living out their lives in the early 1900's.  Life decisions and consequences are developed with great care and credibilty.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I am sick of ads, so I buy all my shows now.  This is a bit far-fetched, I don't think anyone can process everything they read even if they have a photographic memory.  He'd have to be Autistic for that.  And the Savants that are really impressive, are equally defective socially.  They can never get by in society on their own.<br /><br />Still, it is a fun show about a smart guy, almost a super brainiac hero even, that is just trying to figure out what kind of person he wants to be and helps people along the way.
B001EC3JME|4.0|UPDATE: After 8 months of daily use, the elastic band became too weak to hold my flashlight in place. However, I just ordered a replacement because it is still the best holster I have found to do the job and you can't beat the price.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have been using this everyday on the job for the past 4 months and it is still holding up beautifully. This holster along with my Cree flashlight have become a permanent part of my daily life.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It's hard to stop playing; one of my favorites! I like that the game does not end when there are no matches left on the board; it reshuffles them for u.
6304698798|5.0|Reminds me of watching westerns with my father.  He passed a couple years ago, this movie brings back sweet memories
B003O86FMW|4.0|Another suspenseful look at Katniss` life that will keep you wanting to know what will happen next in her twisted world.
0399160450|5.0|My father loves this book. It is hard to find a gift for an 82 year old. Many many pages to keep him happily lost in this book.
B0000931QA|5.0|When my 14 year old daughter asked me to purchase this along with 2 other Queensryche CD's becasue she loved the music, I was simply floored
B003DT194G|5.0|Reminds me of watching westerns with my father.  He passed a couple years ago, this movie brings back sweet memories
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is fun for all ages.  My 2 year old has so much fun feeding, washing, and playing with the pets.  And my 11 &amp; 9 year old nieces find it challenging and fun for them too.
0761169431|5.0|I got this for my teen that has always loved doing origami.  He is enjoying the book and has done several projects out of it.  It's not your &#34;typical&#34; origami but he claims it is &#34;awesome.&#34;

B005K17RU0|5.0|Very nice interface, easy to use and understand.I like the temperature indicator on the dashboard. My wife installed the same app on her galaxy s2. It works great on both of our phones.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is the funniest Christmas movie ever.  Randy Quaid has the best lines and steals the movie.  A must see for the holidays.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I play on the kindle fire. Great concept. Graphics are excellent. The puzzles are challenging and there is a hint feature for if you get stuck. You can choose difficulty and the game changes slightly when replayed so the puzzle answers are different. I have 1 &amp; 2 and cannot wait for the third to come out on Amazon. Try it. You can't beat the price $0.99 and the quality is excellent.
B005NPBT5M|3.0|This is a very good remaster of the original album. I would definately recommend it for any Pink Floyd fan.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It is well written, has a suspenseful plot with well developed characters.  A must read!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Its a kewl game, well worth the $2.99 awesum challenges, be@utiful graphics,  You can play finish the game, then pass it on to your kids, grandkids, trust me will keep them in suspence & plenty busy of fun, you could probably get sum stuff done urself,while they R totally involved in this puzzle seeker game, Its a game you just don't want to put down, kids suppose to be sleeping, but under the covers playing, I give this game a 5* Oh they even give you a 40% discount on ur next complexible journey on the Dark Side...ok ~°ff to get another journey ...awesum game guys ty well done!
B009NQKXYK|2.0|This is a terrible movie, the &#34;plot&#34; is all over the place, the characters have no reason for their actions.  The special effects are decent, especially at the start, but save your money for a real movie.
B000IDGDPA|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It's very compelling to watch.  I love all the actors in this movie and really enjoyed it..
B0041KVW2K|5.0|WOW, just awesome, quality product, the records are superb, really enjoying the sounds that I grew up listening to. The book outlining the development of these classics is priceless all by itself.  I am sure that most folks ordering this will have quality equipment to play these records on.  The sound from these albums can only be appreciated with top notch turntable, stylus, stereo amplifier and speakers.  Super priced, Amazon has done it again.
B0083GQVOC|4.0|Crikey. It was bleak and disturbing, poignant, socially important and I was riveted.<br />I believe more people may benefit from learning about early detection of psychopathy through this film. Tilda was stellar in this role demonstrating the torturous pain and odd denial of living with a disordered personality. Somehow she was able to realistically witness and demonstrate what happens to people in proximity to it.<br /><br />I feel this film is timely today. A lot of people are asking why, asking questions regarding unspeakably destructive choices made by disordered people. The answer is DSM IV has no rational explanation - it just exists and we should learn about it.
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|Recommend it for anyone who is spiritually inclined and want to hear a great female vocal.  Instruments are great, too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|outstanding final book in the series i couldnt put the book down same as with the others in the series
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great fun ,really love this book. Had a hard time putting it down. Started book three as soon as I was finished with it.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|The a cappella arrangements were shockingly good. Who knew Kendrick and Snow could sing like that? I totally laughed and enjoyed it.
030746363X|5.0|I love this book, is full of information, I lost 20 pounds in a month and never felt hungry, specially I love to eat eggs and vegetables.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|john corey is great very funny at times some of the things are really true to life i love nelson de mille books
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Of all DeMille's characters John Corey is my favorite. Humor, honor, dedication to duty, he embodies the true American hero. I hated reading the last page of this book knowing I will have to wait and hope that he is back in the next book.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Moonshine heroes ;). The character development was great and the actors were very emotive which is difficult considering the setting and subject matter. It kind of moved me like The Quiet Man. A full slice of Great Depression era history with those character reversal story arcs I always enjoy: the 'good guy' is bad and the 'bad guys' are good, an experienced and abused woman finds protection, love and renewed purity, the passive and inexperienced excel, the brave elevate to myth, the impartial accomplices come into the light, the innocent savant suffers as sacrifice and justice works in unexpected ways.<br /><br />Timely to see this story today - once again, we learn 'prohibition never works.'
B002HL3PN4|5.0|My kid loved it! Will rent again and the whole series. My kid really enjoys these movies. I have amazon prime, so I watch through my tv!
B004HD61KE|3.0|Devil Colony is the fourth Rollins book I've read and while I've grown to love his characters, the plots and outcomes have become somewhat hum-drum and the reader pretty much knows what's going to happen before reading the page.  Devil Colony is entertaining and a decent read, but it didn't leave me saying &#34;wow, what a story!&#34;.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this movie.  I actually shouldn't be reviewing it yet because the two times that I tried watching it I fell asleep before it ended.  It may have gotten better.  I will try again to watch it at some point and edit this if I change my mind
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A funny, poignant film centering around two bright, independent and eccentric preteens. Their worlds are seemingly very different and they are being parented by dysfunctional adults who seem to have tunnel vision. These adults are misguided daily by their own baggage and have little energy left for their families. Only the offbeat camp leader seems to have a clue. When these preteens befriend each other and fall in love, we see just how desperate they are for love, understanding, and normalcy. A very funny, feel-good movie!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Very addicdive, entertains while teaching laws of physics in a fun way.<br />Put on my Iphone for my grand daughter to play and found myself using it more than her.<br />She now has it on her parents Ipad so she can play it whenever she wants.<br />Recommend this for almost all ages and genders..
1451695195|1.0|The look at Heaven is the briefest and the rest of the book is about the author's recovery from his brain injury.  He says God is referred to as OM, and there is not a single mention of Jesus in the entire book.  This is a different Heaven than the one that we have heard about before.  I don't buy it.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The second time I read this book I started to enjoy her points.  This movie is pretty true to the book and the story of how they made this movie is interesting.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game brought back memories, I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!! It's just like the real arcade.<br />Now if i would`nt always get caught....
B0012NIF56|3.0|I ordered this on Amazon instant viewing under the Donner cut version and I was given the regular version. I wish Amazon posted that the regular version could only be ordered through this way.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Ok. Community is awesome. Really awesome. So awesome, I want to have sex with it. In fact, I broke the DVDs while attempting to have sex with them.
B009LA1QW6|3.0|I heard her singing Blue Velvet and this is why I bought the album.<br />She certainly has a nice voice, and the album installs a poetic atmosphere in my room.<br />I was disappointed to learn she did not write Blue Velvet. How ignorant of me... It was a popular song in the 50's.<br />I still like her version a lot.<br />American is also very intriguing. I like it a lot.<br />I didn't know afte the 1st listening of the album if Inliked it or not. It came with the additional listening.<br />Lana Del Rey is certainly an artist in the sense that she creates her own universe, which is very pleasant. This is the type of album to listen to at home, when it is quiet, not n your car or in the streets.
030758836X|4.0|Loved majority of the book. I wanted Nick to get his revenge so bad and for it to end, like that?! HUGE disappointment. As I turned the last page to see the acknowledgements, I literally said \\"WHAT! WHAT?! There better be a part 2!\\" and threw the book on the floor. hahaha. I don't regret reading it, because it was so suspenseful and entertaining but spiraled out of control toward the end, and AT the end it was such a unsatisfying, dull, ending.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Intriguing to say the least. If one can bear what Ana can, may the human race survive. A loveless love story and puts hooks deep into a reader's mind, a page turner.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great film!  Excellent acting, loved seeing bits of India, and along with the humor there are some thought provoking events and issues that make one stop and think (especially if you are in the &#34;older&#34; population).
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I got this for my 11 year old daughter.  We have played several times as a family (I have two other girls 5 and 13).  It's a little hard for the five year old (she ends up being on someone's &#34;team&#34; and helps build and guess).  We enjoy it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This processor is amazing. It has similar benchmark scores in games to the i7-3770K, so I knew I was getting a cheaper processor without sacrificing power. I have already overclocked this to 4.0GHz and it has been running silky smooth. If you're looking for a long lasting build, I highly recommend this processor.
B0086700CM|2.0|There is a glitch in the game. When I have to turn to  collect coins it won't turn. This game really stinks!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Interesting period piece.  It IS a bit of a soap opera, but the acting is excellent and the view of the period is very good.
B00992CF6W|4.0|What's not to like, its Minecraft ...portable. I have enjoyed Minecraft on my computer for a while now, so I was excited to find the app for my Kindle Fire. It's obviously more simple than the full game, but still complete enough to be enjoyable.
B008HTQ28K|3.0|It was an easy read with lots of beautiful descriptions. Somehow the mystery was not as gripping as previous books although I still enjoyed it. It was a book I did not have to think almost like an animated movie.  Everything fell into place easily.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|I got this movie for my nieces (both 5 year-old) after they saw and loved both My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service.<br /><br />Although I personally prefer Totoro, both of them liked Ponyo better and were very happy with its ending. As far as I can tell, they had not seen nor have read The Litte Mermaid, so that aspect of the story was rather new to them. It would be interesting to see what they say after they get exposed to The Little Mermaid.<br /><br />Having watched both the subtitled and dubbed versions of all three movies, Ponyo's is definitely the best, while Totoro's is really disappointing, and Kiki's is just average.<br /><br />The adults that were watching the film with the kids have also enjoyed this movie quite a lot. Where they normally leave the kids to the movie, this time they stayed to watch it with them.
B00004YA66|5.0|I love this movie so much I bought it for my brother in law.  He and my sister watched it last night and they loved it, too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just loved this series of stories! I originally downloaded the first, free one, but had to come back to get all of them. They are well written, and an original idea.
0440180295|5.0|Great book. I would highly recommend that anyone who enjoys good literature should read this book. Do not be turned off because it is &#34;science fiction.&#34; It has more literary value and provides a greater insight into the human experience than many other books that I have read.
0439023513|5.0|This book was exactly what i was looking for only cheaper than the stores! I would definately recommend this product.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Everything Nicholas Sparks writes is excellent and heart felt.  Could not put this book down read it in one week!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I am a big fan of the zombie genre, and I also enjoy a good game, and this combines the two for hours of fun!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My book club chose this book and since I work with Alzheimer patients I didn't think I would like it but I read it and I loved it. Looking at the disease from the point of view of an intelligent early-onset victim was fascinating and informative. Genova certainly did her research on this one. It is easy and fun to read as well as sad and devastating. I couldn't put it down.
0439023491|5.0|This book was exactly what i was looking for only cheaper than the stores! I would definately recommend this product.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Thought after season one, nothing new could be added to the table but this series just keeps getting better! The plots are strong, characters are bolder, and the cliffhangers each episode keep you HOOKED!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I am not a big fan of Taylor Swift, but the price of this album was too good to pass up. In fact I like a bunch of the songs.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am still reading this book, but Grisham has me hooked! He is back to his best!  I have loved him from his first books, but he did have a slump when he wrote Playing for Pizza and a few others at that time.  I did like The Painted House, which many don't, but I did &#34;feel&#34; that one.  BUT...he is back!  This new one hooks a reader from the first page.<br /><br />I also recently read The Kid Lawyer.  Grisham wrote that for the young adult market, and hopefully it is the first in a series.  His main character is charming and believable.  It is sort of a modern, upscale, techically correct (as far as the legal angle goes) version of the old Nancy Drew books of my youth.  If he writes more, I will purchase them, read them and regift them to my grandchildren!  Why should they have all the fun?
B004OA6KIS|5.0|Richard Feynman had, not only an almost childlike curiosity (which is a good thing), but also a sense of perspective such that he could see to the heart of the matter at hand ignoring all the superfluous fluff.  This enabled him to enjoy life while trying to understand it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|1st King book I've read and I could not put it down!  Since I live in Maine, the connection was great.  Have recommended this book to everyone I see.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is amazing! Enough said.<br />I recommend it to all who enjoy a good romance.<br />Even our male partners could learn from this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the game. I give it 5 stars it makes you want to keep playing the game more and more. I recommend this game to everyone.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Bought the pro version because it was on sale and I already had the free version installed. Since I use this primarily for a ppt viewer as notes for teaching, any mobile office app will NEVER be able to compare to a desktop version. With that in mind buying the pro version didn't help my productivity at all, in fact, the pro version slowed me down because it kept allowing me to edit slides when I merely wanted to view them. Also, they make you buy the font package in addition???<br /><br />The pro version does allow you to grab files directly from the cloud, but it doesn't provide access to the Amazon cloud drive (which is disappointing given that I bought this for my kindle from the Amazon app store).<br /><br />All in all, probably not worth the money (and definitely not at full price!)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love it! This book perfectly joined a mini romance with violence and some scary parts. Gives me heads up on what's in the movie. But I kind of wish that it would speak more about Katniss` relationship with Gale.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn masters the twists and turns of the genre.  A winner for Mitch Rapp ans his avid followers.  Look forward to the next episode.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This may be one of the best shows I've ever watched or very close to it I am looking forward to season three, which starts on the 6th. If you want many hours of enjoyment and a look at English royalty this purchase will be well worth it. In a word Great!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|After declaring Dr. Panda's Hospital her &#34;favorite game ever&#34;, I bought this one for her.  It's all she wants to do when we drive in the car.  Winner!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a pretty sweet App, although this game seems to be a lot easier to win than the real thing! (grin) But it is a lotta fun, and for free, ya can't beat it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My husband and I love the weather channel.  We like knowing the weather by the hour.  It really helps me each night laying out my clothesclothes for the next day..
B007REV4T8|5.0|When this movie comes out on DVD/BLU RAY I am most definitely immediately buying it.  Absolutely amazing Bond film, the many accolades given to it are most definitely warranted.  Every actor within the film play their part well, and the story from the opening sequence to the final scene are great.  I appreciated the develving into of Bonds past, we finally get to see why Bond does what Bond does.  The only criticism is this, there is no clear Bond girl in this movie but maybe that is best because in this story it wouldnt really make sense to have another characters back story hogging the spotlight.  The movie is focused on the story of Bond and M.  The action sequences are great as well, I recommend seeing it in hi-def however DVD is also efficient.  This is absolutely must have for any Bond fan, even if you havent really enjoyed past Craig movies.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I devoured all the episodes in two days - sucks you in like any popular espionage thriller and spits you out at the end wondering why you were so taken with it. Definitely not John Le Carre but it is interesting in its use of real world current events.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was one of the bestbooks i have ever read i would read it again in  heart beat!! Like most girls i wish i had a mr grey.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This Christmas the whole family was down with colds and didn't feel like going or doing anything.  So we watched all eight of the movies in this set. The thrilling visuals and great surround sound gave us a good movie experience and the DVDs played flawlessly and looked and sounded great. That was 20 hours of great entertainment and we all enjoyed it. For the Harry Potter experience at a reasonable price this was a real bargain.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Ive watched all of them with my son and we enjoyed this as one as much as we did the others!!
B004Q3RDVG|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy by Stieg Larsson.<br /><br />Each of the books were exciting, captivating and a most intriguing read.  This series is worth the time and money.  It is that good.<br /><br />Once you read these books, it will be clear as to the reason why the American version of the movie was developed, although the Swedish version is far better.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love brain teaser games, and this is one of the good ones. Just started playing this game, and I'm hoping there's other games like this.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|Watched it when I was a kid now we picked it up for our older ones. They think it's funny!
B005HSL626|5.0|My 4-year-old son loves to play this game. It's something easy he can use play. And the game is very attractive in itself.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Love the songs and dancing.  There is a good store to it and its pure entertainment. I'll watch it over and over again.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i love this game! it is awsome and time passing. i dont recomend this for ages lower than 3 or 4. this game does have blood and the consuming of people. this game involvs money but jot real mony so parents,  dont delete  this hame because you think it involves real money. see yaa peeps!  mp is out ;)
0679744959|5.0|bought this for 85 year old mom for christmas and was so happy and pleased with the excellent condition and the size of the print.  was 1 of 3 books i ordered for her and the only one i ended up giving to her as it was perfect.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great! It keeps me entertained for a long time. And it's also not a mindless video game, it challenges your brain and makes you think. The easy levels are good for preschoolers too.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|This is one I must see every Holiday Season!  The quality is great. I highly recommend this version of the film.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|I had ordered some LPs on Amazon and wanted to convert the Vinyl to a sound file so I could play the music on my computer.  A search led me to this turntable on Amazon.  I've always had success shopping on Amazon, so I made the order.  The turntable arrived on time, was packaged perfectly, and was easy to setup through the UPB port on my computer.  The first recording came out great.  I now have all my LPs on my computer.  It saves the vinyl LPs from damage and the sound is exceptional.  Thanks again Amazon!
B007V4QLY2|5.0|one can never go wrong with a p!nk music cd!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great story, incredible detail. The whole family enjoyed it! Amazon movies were easy to order and better quality than Netflix.
B0002IQOZA|3.0|This CD is okay, but nothing to write home about.  I do not know what I was expecting, but this was not it.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Product was received promptly. The quality of this adapter is high; its compact, lightweight design makes it nice for using on a laptop.<br /><br />This adapter was easy to install to an older windows XP laptop that did not have wireless network card installed, I found the wired connection to be fast and it streams NETFLIX and does downloads in the back ground with out any hic-up, even on a usb 2.0 dell laptop<br /><br />This adapter would be perfect for someone who has experienced a failure of the internal network card. Or someone who owns a windows tablet and needs a wired network connection for high-speed transfers.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it to anyone needing an affordable, reliable, and easy to install network adapter.<br />Overall I am very impressed with this product.<br /><br />The product I used was provided to me by Anker for this review.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00A0ABQLM Anker® Uspeed USB 3.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Network Adapter [ASIX AX88179 Chipset, USB to RJ45, LED Indicator, 18 Months Warranty]]]
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is pretty fun! There is some interaction with the environment and a lot of creativity. I hope they make a second one.
0756686970|5.0|I wanted to give my nephew a cool gift for Christmas so I decided to give him this. The book itself is very colorful and gave me a lot of neat LEGO Star Wars information that I never would have known. It's a very interesting book. It also comes with a Han Solo Lego toy.
B000OONQ9O|4.0|The new Warriors Director's Cut Blu Ray is an example of addition by subtraction.  They added some scenes that aided the story and others that detracted from the story.  The beginning with the reference to Anabasis is good, but needed to be fleshed out more to help the viewers understand the connection (to anyone who does not know, the Warriors is a modern retelling of the Greek classic, Anabasis).  While the comic panels detract from the story, they do not ruin it as others have said.  There are a few instances where they hurt the story a bit, the Baseball Furies scene and the end of the movie.  Otherwise, they are just an unnecessary addition.<br /><br />While the changes will upset some people, the new transfer more than makes up for it.  Visually, the film has never looked better.  The colors are vibrant, the blacks deep and you will see details that were never present on the older versions.  Also, while the sound has not had a huge upgrade, it has been improved.  Now, you hear more of the conversations, especially during the big meeting and when they are fleeing the Lizzies.<br /><br />The special features are nice as the original DVD version was bare bones.<br /><br />The best case would have been to include both versions of the film on the Blu Ray.  But for the price, you can easily get this and the DVD version of the original film and have both to choose from.
1476704163|5.0|My crazy beautiful life was completely amazing, pictures are really good and if you are a real Kesha fan, you MUST have it. Totally recommended.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Loved it. It was AWESOME. I think it beats the last one. Really really GREAT. again LOVED it. Peace<br /><br />-Chelsea
B0091REZMW|1.0|Very hard to figure out.  Never did.  I had to take it off of my device and download another mystery.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I had a lot of trouble actually getting into this book...it did not seem to be Connelly's style.  Last half got better, thankfully.  I'm not happy with paying the price I did for it on Kindle!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I downloaded this after reading the reviews that after about a week, it does not load more than about a dozen statuses, etc. I have not had this problem. The only &quot;glitch&quot; I habe experienced is that I have to press the back button a couple times to exit from viewing a picture. Other than that, this app works great!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I couldn't put it down once I started! Way to keep the Mitch Rapp series going! Can't wait for the next one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just can't put the book down love it can't wait for the last boo. To see how the story ends.
B00633W614|4.0|I enjoyed the continuing saga, but it only ties the book before and the one to follow together.  I would not have enjoyed it as a stand alone novel.
