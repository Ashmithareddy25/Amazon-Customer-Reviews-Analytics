B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is my all time favorite game.  I play it all the time. my husband also plays this game.  We both enjoy it
B005V20JKI|2.0|This new update makes you pay for stuff that you were able to unlock with regular gameplay! And the stuff I already unlocked is  locked now. Not cool
193700788X|5.0|I've always loved the Sookie books and this one is just as wonderful as the others.  I am sorry that this will be the last in the series.  I will miss reading adventures of Sookie and the vamps.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Just like the others once you pick this up you will keep reading until finished. Good. Story line and you won't figure out who done it until the end.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I love the show and the quirky Asperger-esque personality of Dr. Tempe Brennan - but this aspect of her personality was not so evident in the book.  Once I let go of that expectation, I really enjoyed the story.  Kathy Reichs, whether intentional or not, also opened my eyes up to some shady diamond mining in Alaska that I knew nothing about.  Alaskan diamonds are almost as bad as &#34;blood diamonds!&#34;
B007SGM084|4.0|It was an ok read for porno.. I would like to see if she has written anything other than porn.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS EVER.  ITS 900+ PAGES OF SUPERB STORYTELLING AND VIVID VIVID DESCRIPTIONS.  IVE NEVER READ A BOOK LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|It was a great movie as well as the first one.  The only negative about it is that I as a Prime member had to pay to watch, since I did'nt have to for the first one.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|there's one problem on the zombie uprising unless you have level 50 on everything(which would coat u over $100) its physicaly impossible to beat because there are little ladies with sword who destroy you and ur gate insainly fast and when the allies on the loose thing comes 5-7 of them spawn so there trying to get u to buy stuff to pass that
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This isn't the original star wars.....the ending of the return of the Jedi on these disks that shows the young Anakin Skywalker is not original.....the original showed the mature Anakin....dissapointed.
B00005KISG|1.0|It had some sort of code block on the movie and  I could not get the movie to play. SO it is no good if you cant watch it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I give 5 stars!  The font is easy to read - the cost of the cards doesn't grossly exceed your daily tokens so you can actually play several rounds a day - the payouts are consistent - there are many exciting rooms with collections just difficult enough to complete to provide a fun challenge.  Overall: this is my favorite bingo game on my Kindle Fire and in my top 4 on my laptop. Try it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed every second of this book. I loved the growth that Gideon and Eva go through. I didn't think I could love Gideon anymore than I did before reading ETW but Sylvia out did herself.
1423113462|5.0|The author's writing is phenomenal and it is not without weight that I say that he could be remembered alongside J. K. Rowling; this series is more mature (in its intelligence and plot lines, the kid-friendly content remains) than its predecessor and wildly more entertaining and attention grabbing. The cast of characters is likable and diverse and more real the those introduced at the onset of the first series.<br /> Will be eagerly following this one through til the end.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Eagles fans will love this set. It tells all, warts and all of the band as a beginning and personnel disputes. I love it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book. I honestly just don't even know what to say. I could read this three more times in a row and not grow bored. The next one's even better.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I like the concept of this book, just not sure I can fast twice a week with such a crazy schedule.  If I were retired and not so on the run, it may be better.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian is a captivating writer.  I couldn't put her book down.  Excellent read.  I would recommend the book to read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is so bizarre and unpredictable that you don't know who to believe or what's going to happen next. Definitely worth the read.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian's mind is very interesting.  Her books are interesting.  This book was very interesting.  Thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  Couldn't put the book down.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|THIS IS NOT A REVIEW! I have not read the book yet but basing on the current reviews, I AM CHUCKING DOWN this series:( Like a long list of followers, I was looking forward to this 3rd (AND SUPPOSEDLY FINAL)installment of this series. What a bummer! Seems like Ms. Day is rooting for a money scam. Anyway, I love following series but I can only go for a 3-book series. No more than that. I am hugely disappointed because I loved this story but it is what it is.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|We turned it off because it had no qualities of love or engaging storyline. The &#34;art&#34; quality did not offset the story of hopeless perversion and dysfunctional relationships. Would not recommend it.  So sad, Tom Hanks used to be one of my heroes.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Enjoyed the story, although fiction , enjoyed the fact it was based on true events of the time.  Kept my interest throught the whole book
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My daughter loves this show and loves this movie. Wish they would come out with a DVD with all the episodes on it.
B00BEJ5O6Q|3.0|Gave as a gift, seemed pleased. Did not get any bad feed back from the receiver so I guess she liked it.
B004ELSDZK|1.0|This is the most senseless game ever made.  Do not spend your money on this mess. It not worth a penny.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Great music.  Upbeat.  Bought it because it has a song My kind of Love.<br /><br />Highly recommend to have and to listen.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book was great not my favorite though! I believe because it was the last of the series and I wanted different endings for the characters! Gonna miss reading this series.
1400069289|5.0|This is a exciting book. It gives me some advice to face the rest life with a new way. It's worth reading.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put this one down, just like the two before them.  There still is a lot to Gideon that needs to be elaborated upon.  Glad it didn't end and glad there are two more books to come.  Sylvia Day captures you from the start and doesn't let go!  Love the characters and where their adventures go!  Awesome reading!
B000HZGNEU|5.0|A rare treat seeing Stewart and Shatner together for this homage to William Shatner as Captain Kirk. There's a little bit of everything for the fans in this one.
B008133MDK|5.0|This show is so much fun to watch.  My husband likes to watch it with me, can you believe that?  It is not a college sport, go figure('.')<br /><br />Dallas, Oregon
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I have watched this since the beginning and always loved it. The is some unevenness; you can't always hit it out of the park, of course. But there are enough perfect, hilarious episodes that I can easily gloss over the ones that don't quite hit the nail squarely on the head. Now that I've used a baseball metaphor and a carpentry metaphor, let me be anatomical: this wonderful series has a lot of heart.
B005544V6A|4.0|The main flaw with the show, I thought, was that it rests on the viewer believing that eidetic memory of the kind exhibited by one of the protagonists is not the stuff of science fiction. But after all, it's a TV show, so it's easy to overlook that flaw and enjoy what is otherwise a slick, well acted drama. The icing on the cake, of course, is that it's on amazon prime so I don't have to deal with annoying advertisements that kick in just when the drama is ramping up a notch.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|But this album was too great to pass up. The variety of tracks on the album is astounding, and they are all amazing tracks. I would definitely recommend buying the whole album.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Love this movie. I had seen it before and  I rented it again to share with my family. They liked it but the MANY pauses at the end of the viewing marred the experience.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Gripping and spellbinding.  Corey is as irreverent as ever, but completely rational and sensible.  Why can't there be more of him in this world.  There might be for all I know.  DeMille once again leads us through a foreign land with such clarity that you feel like you are really there.  Let's hope there will be more to come.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I was surprised just how big of a difference these made given the low drive impedance of the SE535 headphones I use. I imagine it would be even more dramatic when used on harder-to-drive headphones. It has greatly reduced listening fatigue when using headphones, and brings out detailed sound quality all across the frequency spectrum; more powerful rich bass, clear (but not piercing or shrill) highs, and detailed midrange.<br /><br />I hit upon this particular amp because I wanted one that could also act as a DAC with toslink (optical) input, which narrowed the field considerably. However this is everything I had hoped it would be. On the go I just pack it with my MP3 player, use it as an amp by feeding it from the auxiliary port. When I get home, I plug it into the optical out of my desktop and use it as a pre-amp for powered speakers. If I want good sound from a laptop, I plug it up via USB and it serves as an excellent external source.<br /><br />Perhaps there are better portable amps around - there are certainly more expensive ones - but the utility and value I have gotten from this one for its price is off the charts. It can fit in almost anywhere: If you have a high quality sound source already, take the optical output and use this to drive your speakers or headphones. Have a laptop or only on-board PC sound? Use this as an external USB sound card and be shocked at the climb in quality. Want to listen on the go? This thing has a built in battery, so just plug it in and use it as an aux amp.<br /><br />It recharges via USB, and so even if you're not using it as a USB source you can plug it up to run it indefinitely while you use the optical or aux ports. If you have half-decent headphones or speakers already, and have audio encoded better than 128kbp/s this is the next worthwhile step to enjoyable listening.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game and am trying to beat all of the cut the rope apps! Its so fun and i recomend it to everybody!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
B00785P2QC|5.0|cool game, i love playing it but the money comes too slow and you need resl money to have a big city.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book changed my life in a way. Suzanne Collins might be the best author yet! But if you see the movie, it just makes it better.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|Seemed a bit of a stretch at times. Probably all true but just seemed like they might have imbleshed the truth. Did make me realize how evil the leaders in the North are and how indifferent the South is.
0316247545|5.0|I just received my copy today. This is a very good-looking book which covers the first three seasons of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, in considerable detail. The old promotional vectors are no more! Instead, see excellent reproductions of the series's actual art in full, rich color.<br /><br />It may not be obvious from the image you see here on Amazon, but the bottom wrapper slips off, leaving you with a book whose cover is a reproduction of The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide. An excellent edition, and an excellent addition to any bookcase.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Felt like I was there from the wonderful descriptions of people and places. Great writer. Look forward to more by her.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME ITS NOT AS CHALLENGING AS THE ORIGINAL BUT STILL JUST AS FUN, well thanks u for reading my review hope you like it to:)
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good game worth the download totally helps pass some time. It was a little funky to get used to at first but only took a second to get the hang of it.
0425263924|2.0|Ok, so we're all pissed off while Sylvia Day has cracked open  a case of Cristal while riding a stretch limo all the way to the bank. Well, she won't have my $$$ anymore. There are very comprehensive reviews out there. While I agree with most points made and disagree with others, I'm only giving this book 2 stars because editing was impeccable. No misspellings, no grammar errors, no formatting flubs, which, I might add, are major pet peeves of mine. So there. That is my review. I won't be preordering the next 2 installments, waiting until midnight to download my purchase and reading through the night. Stick a fork in me, Ms Day, I'm DONE!!!
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Took first to seasons on a weekend trip. OMG I was addicted from the first the first show.Love It Love it
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Very good adaptation of the book.  Fast paced and not too gory so my kids could watch it.  Looking forward to #2 and #3.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great read for upper elementary through adult.  Well-written from the point of view of various characters. Opens the reader's eyes to the feelings of others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! It is so much fun! It is at least as good as temple run! Rock on creators!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter but find myself playing it more often than her. Lol definitely entertaining. Realistic which makes it interesting.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|a writer .who still knows how to use the english language; a thinking persons novel.<br />Hope he can write one more
B000ICXQXI|4.0|The movie was pretty good for a classic movie. My only surprise was that it was in black and white.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Sookie is never allowed to relax, bad for her,  but what fun to read about.<br /><br />I have heard that this is the last Sookie novel...that makes me very sad.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|Straight forward and data driven.  The concepts of level 5 leader and the right people on the bus ring especially true.  Something for anyone who is truly interested in seeing an enterprise or organization succeed.  If you are looking for &#34;get rich quick&#34; ideas, this is not the book for you!  If you are willing to work hard and work smart, you'll probably enjoy it a lot.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson's writing is impeccable.  With a series this long and intricate, with so many different characters, plots and turns, you have to give major kudos to the author.  Jordan's genius also needs to be recognized.  The Wheel of Time is an Epic of the highest magnitude in every sense of the word.  I will miss these characters and the world created by Jordan.  As an aside, if Sanderson finds the time to create a story that involves Mat, Tuon and the Seanchan, I would certainly not complain.  If not, I guess its goodbye.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game has awesome graphics and it's fairly easy to play.Cannot seem to get any friends to play so probably won't be able to play it for long.
B001NAT05W|4.0|Well guys, let's first start off with this before we go on. Catwoman isn't supposed to be high art, a deep movie, or have incredible acting. All it is, plain and simple, is a hero-action movie that's actually pretty fun to watch if you don't take it too seriously. Think of it as a comic book in motion. Once you get the idea, everything is pretty fun. If you can't get past this concept, you need to lighten up, lol.<br /><br />The main gripe I have about this movie is the horrible soundtrack and music. The composer should be shot because he/she doesn't know how to score the music with the scenes. About 90 percent of the music track is cheesy hip-hop/rap that doesn't fit. It's loud, dumb, and a 10-year old music student could have done a lot better. There's no connection with what's going on in the movie and the music. If anything, the composer, if you can call him/her that, just took advantage of the opportunity to try to get his/her tunes onto the big screen.<br /><br />So let me rap you my opinion of the music. (fade in scratch beat....)<br /><br />Hey homey<br />it's baloney<br />the tunes ain't worth a rip.<br />But Berry<br />she's a cherry,<br />and I ain't talking *bleep*<br /><br />The composer<br />he's a loser.<br />He can't write tunes<br />to save his life.<br />His music<br />isn't music<br />It's just noise<br />and big bad hype.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|What I liked best was the way it didn't try to become another animal entirely from the series.  It was a tribute to the series, including its humor.  The cast was wonderful
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is awesome as in Epic you will love it is the awsomeness game ever it is my favorit game is Epic!
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I could not watch more than 10 minutes of it. I hated the cynical uncaring attitude of the police and investigators in response to crime and to victims' families. Also too graphic and just overall unwatchable, including poor acting. If I could give it no stars, I would. Don't waste your time.
B000ID37KO|5.0|I watched this as part of a college film class. I'd seen it many times before, but this is the first time I analyzed it as an assignment.  It holds up over time because it centers on people and what they do in scary circumstances.  Fashions change, but people stay the same, so you don't feel like you are watching an old movie.  One thing I'll point out that is unusual in any film:  there is no music in it.  All of the noise is the birds.  Hitchcock did this on purpose.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|took me way back to before i was born. there are a lot of memories there. this was a truly remarkable movie with excellant graphics.
B00000I0XW|5.0|Ms. Brightman's vocals, as always, are clear, impeccable and with gorgeous tonal quality. This collection allows you take a theatre experience with you wherever you go.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|I enjoyed the show and so did my family, but it should be for early teens and above. For kids 8 and under its too much.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great book which is part of a trilogy. I actually forgot my paperback book and had to download the book because of the suspense.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I hated the whole premise of the movie, glad I missed the book. What kind of book sets up a situation where 24 children have to butcher each other? Just violence for the sake of violence. This movie blows.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|I love this app I looked up amily guy clips and it downloaded it quick I hope you find this helpful.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|A fun album.<br />a Fun. album<br /><br />you choose which punctuation and capital letter.<br /><br />I really like the poppy feel and beat to all the songs.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|except for first 6 min of nudity movie straight is forward drugs and alcohol driven movie<br />adult type movie i say watch with someone u love
B008NW67E0|5.0|Of course this will be good. really, what's not to love about Mumford & Sons. Love this follow up album.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I absolutely love TPG!!! Their music is fun to listen and doesn't distract me with lyrics.  I prefer instrumental music so that I can let my thoughts go where they want.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I was waiting on a US release once i heard their songs on the university radio.<br />It seemed for a while they only had a Euro release...glad to have the album to listen to now.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|Michael Giacchino's most recent Star Trek contribution is a dynamic pulsating score that is far more satisfying than some of the mere clanging and banging that now frequents the action and comic book films that are currently appearing on a regular basis. Given the type of movie that it is, one cannot expect love themes and romantic melodies. Yet, Giacchino is able to insert a melodic line here and there, most noteworthy being the first five notes of the main theme that he builds upon which makes an emphatic statement from beginning to end. (As an aside, I would invite film music fans to listen to Rozsa's \\"Ben Hur\\" music for the \\"miracle/finale scene\\" wherein one will find embedded a cluster of somewhat similar notes - I'm not suggesting any kind of borrowing - perhaps(?); it's mainly my own aural \\"note\\". Likewise, the theme used for the Hobbits \\"marching along\\" in The Lord of the Rings strongly reminded me of the theme for the wandering of Christ and his apostles in Alfred Newman's score for The Greatest Story Ever Told - something that no one else seems to have noticed. But back to MG's score.) Giacchino also inserts what sounds like fragments or variant fragments of music from previous Star Trek movies, particularly the orchestrative quality that one hears in James Horner's earlier two Star Trek efforts.<br /><br />It doesn't have the impact of Jerry Goldsmith's score for the first Star Trek movie. Nor for that of James Horner's The Wrath of Khan. But movies have been transformed thanks to CG effects far beyond anything imagined in the late 70s or early 80s; and the musical demands are different. Giacchino's score is certainly not pedestrian and fits the action and general rhythm of the film excellently with main theme punctuations at appropriate places. The main problem with this CD is that it contains so relatively little of the entire score and there probably will be a later released CD with the complete score (as they did with MG's first ST), something that isbeing done more and more to the detriment of our pocket books. The end credits alone, containing Alexander Courage's original Star Trek theme, should have been included since this would have been the most continuous and longest symphonic thread by far. This is a shortcoming of so many soundtrack releases which I will never understand.  The end credits have it all and yet are omitted in so many CDs. It's like leaving out the 4th movement of a symphony.<br /><br />For anyone to challenge Giacchino's Film credentials is absurd; and many of us can always suggest a different composer that we prefer for any given film over the one who actually did the score. (I wish that Franz Waxman had been able to do the score for Cleopatra as originally intended instead of Alex North, or Rozsa for The Fall of the Roman Empire instead of D. Tiomkin, but c'est la vie.) One has to evaluate what someone has accomplished on its own terms. In the end, I would say that Giacchino did a masterful job, though I just could not give him 5 stars due to my own subjectivity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is a great game that I was able to share with all of my friends, even the ones that don't speak English.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so disappointed in this series. The first two books were great but when I bought them and pre-ordered the 3rd book I had understood that it was a \\"trilogy\\". Like so many other reviewers, I was disgusted to see that this is going to be drug out for another 2 books. I am terribly disappointed in the way the trend is going in releasing books. I want to read a book -- in its entirety -- not read a part and then wait for a year to read another part .... and then another part .... and then another part.<br /><br />I won't be buying another book in this series. I am just going to assume that Eva continues to go out and meets her friends for lunch, coffee, wine, whatever and she continues to call her Dad on Saturdays and she continues to hop into whoever's car service happens to be out front. And that they all will live happily ever after.<br /><br />I returned this book for a refund. And I am mad at myself that I didn't follow my rule not to buy anymore books that are strung out and released in \\"parts\\".
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The easiest way to watch a movie in the comfort of ur home ! No hassle no late fees not leaving the comfort of you're home it's fantastic ! .... Try'it !!!

B00COMLLX2|5.0|I have always loved pin ball type games, wish I had a full size one. When my boys were just boys, they are now grown with families or thier own, we used to go to the arcades and play pin ball games for hours.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|\\"There is no life outside Verona walls!\\" If you get that reference, you'll see immediately how it applies to Warm Bodies. The living have walled themselves up, and everyone outside the wall is dead. 'R' can only remember the first letter of his name (but what's in a name? It is not hand, nor foot, nor arm...) I still can't get over how the writer of this cleverly twisted retelling did it. It is definitely NOT a faithful retelling; it's much smarter than that. I watched this with a classroom full of 14-15 yr olds who had just finished reading Romeo and Juliet, some of whom were sick of it. But I and they had a blast noting the clever parallels, thematic similarities, composites and send-ups of Shakespeare's classic. Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy that plays like a comedy, and my kids enjoyed the humor in reading it, but hated both film versions they watched. This modernized fantasy analog had terrific comedy that won them over though, and happily for me as their teacher, a great deal of their pleasure came from being in on the jokes and twists because they had the Bard's version under their belts. Thank you, Jonathon Levine for this screenplay. You gave a high school English teacher a fantastic gift. When I asked my kids if they thought it was worth it to have read a classic so they could be in on this grand joke, their smiles and applause answered the question for me. What a fun afternoon.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I got this ap. in hopes to help my grandaughter with her homework, I haven't had a chance to really use it yet because the kids r out of school for the summer
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Just what you'd expect. Nice to have a handy sharpener that includes a serrated edge sharpener. The price was right too.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|puts me to sleep in a good way! but I grow bored of it after a few minutes, however it is soothing.
B004EPZ00C|3.0|Not as good as the first one.  It's kind of boring actually. Kids will still enjoy it but don't expect as much laughing as the first one!
B00BKTFABE|4.0|I really enjoy this one, u can do all sorts of stuff with it, I haven't spent much time with it yet, but I will
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Initially it was hard to tell what the writers were shooting for.  I was expecting just a thriller where the details don't always make sense until the very end.  What I really enjoyed was that this is more than a thriller but also a murder mystery with some good drama.  I definitely didn't expect the ending and was totally surprised given how depressing the beginning of the film seemed.  Highly recommended, just keep watching and letting the story build even if the first 30 minutes feels depressing.  Despite how 'depressing' and dull all the actors appear at the beginning of this story, the film has a happy ending, so just keep watching!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Hard to put the game down. Entertaining to say the least. I really enjoy this app. I am addicted already
B0013ND30M|1.0|I was very excited to receive this in the mail today, but was extremely disappointed when I opened it. The DVD wasn't on the button thing that holds it in- because it didn't even have one! The two DVDs that are included had been double stacked on one holder. So the movie dvd had been floating around in the box throughout the mailing process( and no telling how long before that). It is scratched beyond watching! I thought I was buying a real Disney movie but this is just a knock- off. I am really disappointed in Amazon, thought they sold quality items. I will never buy another DVD from them!
B00004TWZF|5.0|Have been looking for a DVD copy of this movie for a while.<br />Enjoyed the extra content from the directors cut, better ending.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It's scary how well this works. I thought of the most obscure athletes, celebrities and functional characters and it did great.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeps me on the edge of my seat....every show!!  Never thought I would like this, but a great show overall!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart is one of the Best singers ever.  I like him because unlike todays artists you can understand his words and his lyrics.  If you have liked him before you will love his latest work.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Before seeing the movie, I told my husband that the book is really heavy on football.  A lot of the football was cut from the movie and the ending was much different than the book.  In the end, I enjoyed the movie more.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We watched this movie on a very stormy night and it made us forget about the tornado sirens going off all around us. Lucky for us the tornado did not touch down in our neighborhood because we were so involved with the movie I'm not sure we would have heard it.  Others were not as lucky I'm sad to say. The movie had humor and excitement plus it was based on real events which brought back many memories of that time. I liked the fact that they used some actual footage at the start of the movie. I wish they had been a little clearer on how the people ended up at the Canadian embassy. Other than that one small gripe I loves the movie.
076115678X|5.0|This was recommended to me by my sister who has thick curly hair.  I was skeptical that it wouldn' t work for my very fine, very frizzy hair. The methods have changed my relationship with my hair.  It is easier to manage, looks better with out the frizz and I am happier with it than I ever have been in my life.  Wish I had started doing this years ago.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I enjoy being better at this game than my 12 y/o. It takes a long time to completely upgrade your vehicles. I recommend using the dirt bike on the moon until you get enough money to buy and upgrade the semi truck. When the semi truck is upgraded fully use it on the highway to rack up huge coin amounts.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is my alarm clock daily. I love that it works even when I turn my kindle to power saving setting. I will probably upgrade eventually so I can save more than 3 alarms and so I can wake up to my own music. But the free version is great for now.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is the BEST weather app I have ever used. Most people get caught up with the well-known branded apps and they miss out on the truly great ones. THIS is a GREAT weather app. You won't be disappointed!
B005LAIIKI|3.0|\\"Django Unchained\\" is not a bad film, nor is it a good one. It's basically the same film Tarantino has regurgitated out ever since he made \\"Jackie Brown\\" when he decided to create films emulating specific past genres. I'm not talking about vague genres such as dramas and comedies, I mean specific ones from the 60s and 70s like the anti-western, revenge martial arts film, and the \\"Dirty Dozen\\" war film, etc. Gone are the original days of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" instead Tarantino wants to show he can make films that extend the genre's at which they are initially created from. \\"Jackie Brown,\\" Kill Bill 1 and 2,\\" \\"Death Proof\\" and \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" are all retreads of past genres, but Tarantino adds a bit of excessive stylization to each film that usually involves cartoonish violence and an extended film length. \\"Django\\" is no different in that Tarantino re-creates an anti-western film with (you guessed it) cartoonish violence and a long, overdrawn film length that could be 30-45 minutes shorter. Like all of Taranitino's films \\"Django\\" is entertaining, but only to a point. The dialogue is well written and the cinematography is nice, but the film still feels like a retread of past films. There are a few small original elements in \\"Django\\", but the film is not wholly original. DiCaprio and Waltz are the acting highlights, while Foxx basically portrays a single mood and emotion throughout most of the film which overstays it's welcome. The ending was drawn out and predictable, it felt a lot like the ending of \\"Kill Bill part 2.\\" I look forward to the day Tarantino decides to make an original film again, and not try to follow in the footsteps created by the fathers of past film genres. Grade: C.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I have read the other reviews. I can only think of one thing to add. Where did the title come from?  There is a \\"druid\\" with some kind of powers. There is also a kid that manages a couple of interesting feats. The kingdom is circular. However the most important object in the book is a sword.  I guess I am asking to much to think the title somehow represents the book.<br />  I agree with most of the other 1 star reviews. I felt a little insulted at the end. I can't believe this is for sale. The story isn't at an end point. It's like the author met her quota for words and quit. Don't buy this book.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Photography, music, & beautiful food..  To watch a master orchestrate his kitchen with such precision and grace is food porn at it's finest.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenneger is back on the big screen.  If you are a fan of Arnold's movies you will enjoy this one too.  Plenty of action, although at times the acting seemed a bit awkward and the script dialogue could have been better.  The storyline is mostly credible.  All in all an okay movie.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|What more can you ask for? It's free, great interface, and adjustable difficulty. This is a Perfect app for any level of chess player.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As with many shows from the UK, Downton Abbey is very well written and acted, and is an engaging story.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Just watched \\"Warm Bodies\\" what an excellent fell good movie there are parts were I laughed out loud this zombie movie has a love story twist.  There is action, comedy and a little romance.  My 10 year old said it was the best zombie love story ever loved it loved it loved it.  Oh those boonies are scary.  Rent it, buy it, watch it and love it.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Love the game plays just like Diablo, but like everyone else feels, the potion system is bad and the games difficulty ramps up quite quickly with little options for solo play after the first couple of dungeons. I believe this is done to force the purchase of upgrades. I would much prefer to just purchase the game than purchase items.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show.  Great characters.  I like that there is a plot that continues through out the season which is woven into each episode's story.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|It was a good movie. If it weren't for Tom I think it may have been so so. Maybe better writers next time.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|I like the continuing character development and the plot twists in this edition. Interesting how you really aren't sure who the bad guys here are. Deserves all five stars in MHO.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love having the Kindle app on my Galaxy S3 - it is just a slide and a tap away whenever I have a just a few minutes to read a page or so, I can just sink right in.  The ease of shuffling through my books is great also.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Should have single coins double coins and triple coins like temple run. Should make mystery boxes 300 coins. Should make the boards with power ups cost like 100,000 coins.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It a brilliant game can't stop playing it very addictive love all parts of the game and it great that it has missions that keeps u going
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Like that we get to learn a little more about Gideon. The book ended really Well. I am looking forward to reading more about Eva and Gideon in the series!
B001J710Y8|4.0|I recently watched this film for the first time, having stumbled upon it while seeking Hammer or Amicus films that I hadn't seen. For the first few minutes, I thought I was the victim of some universal joke, where people claim this is a great movie but it's actually a flaming bag of dog s***e. I realize now that The Wickerman requires some acclimation, like stepping into a cold swimming pool. Within the first 20 minutes   or so, it begins to cast a strange and endearing spell, especially with the introduction of Willow. Britt Eckland is stunning, and her strange dance of seduction is hypnotic. Poor Sgt. Howie! The Wickerman is more suspense than horror, but the tension builds effectively and the climax took me by surprise. The acting   is average, save for Edward Woodward who is   truly effective and reminds me of Richard Burton. Some of the music will drive you batty, but it becomes tolerable in the context of the film. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially fans of British horror.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was the most gripping real-life tragedy turned survuval saga that I've ever read.  It should be a must-read in every high school social studies class.  I'm sharing it with everyone I know.
0743290933|5.0|This book was what I needed for where I am in my writing career. What not to do is what you need in this market today. Manuscripts are judged by detractors not merits.<br />Thank you, Jon
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|love this game.  It is challenging for both of us.  He is 9 and does much better than me!!<br />Lots of different puzzles to solve.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I've waited so long to see a movie version of The Hobbit and was not disappointed. The only downside is the long drawn out story so they can have three movies. It seems to take a long time for them to get anywhere, but they do eventually.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Truth is it was kinda good it wasent your best book but u can make more books and better people
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Makes you think quit a bit once you get up into the higher levels.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|This is great so easy to use and it takes fantastic pictures. I love it. The pictures come out so clear.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Did not feel any chemistry between the lead actors, did not really like any of the secondary actors. Their was some elements of magic in the movie, but it dealt more with the relationship between the boy and girl, but the problem is if you don't really see any chemistry, the movie will fail.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|I played this game way back in the days. This was always one of my favorite games. I hope this game is always available. It is very addictive.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|The story line was not the greatest, but the action and how the slow motion filming catches all the bloody details of bullets going through the enemy made the movie diffently worth the watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great way to take up time an have fun this is great for kids my age ...
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed this game....I didn't find it as easy as some people, don't let that discourage you.. took me longer than an hour. Not a waste of money!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This Temple Run is very interactive, and it is much better than temple run 2. I would recommend this game because it is really fun, and makes you want to play over and over. Each temple run  I've purchased has gotten better and better
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Son read this book & gave it to my husband to read. I had no desire to read it. But, since it's coming out as a movie & I'll have to go to it with my husband, I thought I'd read the book first. Not at all what I expected. Has much more to do with how people live. How we survive. What sort of people we are before & after a catastrophe. It's about our society. Good read. BTW...movie was aweful. Didn't follow the book at all . They could have given the movie a completely different title. Read the book, ignore the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The first book was fantastic reading and did what it set out to do, keep you drooloing and begging for more so you had to get the next Book immediately.<br />Although I was not too much in this Dominant type of pleasure, and the I love you so much. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire Trilogy YES I have finished the entire story
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. I had already read some of the stores and rereading brought  back  memoriese  I enjoyed it very much David
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|For fans of DEXTER, it has always been a lurid pleasure rooting for our favorite spatter analyst despite the grisly things he does.  But the pleasure has been voyeuristic--we've observed from the sidelines.  By starting off with Deborah's witnessing the master in action, suddenly we (the audience) are openly complicit and have to deal with our own enthusiasm--our own thrill (and guilt about that thrill) come into question.  It is interesting that as Dexter has moved towards being &#34;more human,&#34; perhaps we as viewers have moved more and more towards meeting him halfway.  And then there's Hannah, who accepts him as he is--even though her parameters are definitely skewed.  Just when you'd think we might be tired of the game, the emotional stakes have been skillfully ratcheted up.  On a show where no one is pure--the fascination of those wanting to do the right thing and yet falling prey to internal demons--we the audience are no longer left on our own laurels.  A terrific season, well played.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm only rating 1 star so that I can write this note to the author. I actually thought about whether or not I wanted to read all 3 of the books of this trilogy. I committed to that.  To have the last book dragged out for 2 additional books is very irritating and manipulative.  Please understand that I do have a bias ... I hate this current trend of one story spread to multiple books.  I know there have been books written previously in this format, but the ones I read were substantive.  I returned your book 3 and that is unfortunate since I was waiting for the ending of the story.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|If you are a fan of well-executed thrillers or science fiction or both, it's hard to believe you won't love this show.  When I say &#34;well-executed,&#34; I'm talking about the distinction between (i) a cheesy SyFy drama you want to like because the underlying idea is interesting but just can't get past the horrible makeup, low-end productions values and staggeringly bad writing, and (ii) the revamped Battlestar Galactica.  Not that this is anything like Battlestar, but I think you get the point: Orphan Black is beautifully acted, well-written, exciting, funny and BBC America spent a lot of money making it.<br /><br />I'm not giving away too much when I say the show is about a group of clones who were all raised in different places, never knew they were clones and have only recently begun to meet each other and begin putting together the pieces of some kind of conspiracy that involves them. Oh, and someone is killing them off, one by one.  Tatiana Maslany plays all of the clones, and she is incredible.  I'm not going to say how incredible because lots of real television critics have already written about it, and you can look it up. Suffice to say that her performance in at least nine different roles is astonishing.<br /><br />One warning: Orphan Black is not for children.  The first episode in particular contains the most graphic sex I have ever seen on non-subscription television; not much nudity, but nothing left to the imagination.  After that episode, the sexual content is not a big deal, but the themes, the way violence is portrayed and just the whole tone of the show argue against letting children watch.  Think of it as a movie rated &#34;R&#34; for adult content, adult themes, partial nudity, drug use and violence. And then go watch it.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|Pretty awesome. Hilarious, gut wrenching, edge of your seat suspense, action, horrible sadness. This book has it all. READ IT!!!
B00985E3UG|5.0|I found this book fascinating (surprised me!)  Each section shows how the food industry, in tandem with the government, has manipulated our inborn human desires for salt, sugar, and fat, to hook us on processed foods.  The shocking thing is that most of these are hidden.<br />I'll be sure to read all of the labels more carefully and do my best to stick with local, fresh, and unadulterated food.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is an amazing take on the life of Nikola Tesla. It is not too long and does not feel as if it drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history as well as theories about geniuses
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I happened across this series through a recommendation, and I'm really glad to have purchased it! What I really enjoyed about this saga is that the story is quite unique and the setting is a realistic future where there is a struggle between people yearning for knowledge and those who realize that such knowledge could destroy them. The characters are relatable, the story well written and the issues complex. Great book and definitely a value for the price!
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Very fun and addictive game. 2 weeks in and no regret or issues, just a very fun game where you lose track of how long you are playing
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|OMG, I so could not wait for this book to come out.....what a disappointment!!!  I was half way through it and kept waiting and waiting for the thrill and excitement from the first 2 books....afterall this was the 3rd of a trilogy!!!  Then to get to the end and its not the end.....sorry but I wont be reading the rest of this series....as one other read put it so well.....Finished with You!!!!
0802473156|3.0|Overall, I believe his approach is a very useful and honest tool to finding ways to meet each other for marital strength and happiness. Certain parts of his book and overall approach were oversimplified to the point that I could see it harming SOME couples.<br /><br />The first issue that bothered me was reading his recounts with couples all throughout the book that help him drive his point home. They most definitely sound fictitious. These couples always sound exactly the same in attitude, in epiphanies and how they treat one another. Shamefully, the woman is almost always complaining about not getting help around the house and the husband is cluelessly abandoning her, and that scenario somehow fits into every love language in the book. Which brings me to the love language I don't think exists: Acts of Service.<br /><br />Acts of service is something every person in a relationship needs as much as they possibly can get. That's just being a part of society. He lists it primarily as chores, but it can be any service that typically is not very romantic. I am willing to bet that is not really anyone's primary love language yet it is extremely important to everyone. Acts of service are done out of respect for each other, everyone wants them. In my opinion you should be giving and receiving acts of service simply because you're responsible and don't want to overload your spouse.<br /><br />A small, yet somewhat irksome thing I also noted is his description of the female sex drive. We WANT love, it is a greater turn on, but women are frequently aroused throughout the day with visual/physical stimulation or even without any cause and it feels good and is distracting. We have fantasies regularly and desire sex regularly. The author states men have a physical need for sex and women have an emotional need. I am telling you that attitude can cause its own wedge in your marriage. Numerous studies since this book was published have slowly unraveled that truth. Your wife wants, physically needs sex, she may just not want it with you until you patch some things up.<br /><br />A couple of times the author mentions men who are not receiving their love language fantasize of other women (never mind that women fantasize too) until the husband receives his love language. I feel as a marriage counselor he drops the ball by appearing to support vengeance and emotional insecurity through disloyalty, if even in the mind. He needed to point out that needs to be worked on as that tends to be harmful to the other spouse in many different ways and in turn makes the offender's life more difficult too. He also touches on abusive spouses and how you are letting them down by letting yourself be abused by not speaking his/her love language....I guess if you want to stay in the relationship this could speak to you, but much like cheating, once an abuser, always an abuser. It speaks of something inside that person that is not about you. He doesn't bring up that maybe these couples should seek extra help and that his approach will not cure their problems like he claims it typically does.<br /><br />In short, I think he's outdated and he's a little bit clueless -touching on sexist- about women. But the good news is that even so, this book is pretty solid with advice. I would use it as supplement to in depth therapy as it does not accurately depict everything that tests a marriage, only behavior which is subjective here. But,in terms of feeling love there are great suggestions based on how you prefer to receive it and lays out clearly ways that you can help discover the language that speaks to you as well as your spouse. The \\"love tank\\" is a useful idea to practice with. Couples who are struggling to understand each other and find fault with each other's differences could benefit from the tools in this book.hysically needs sex, she may just not want it with you until you patch some things up.<br /><br />A couple of times the author mentions men who are not receiving their love language fantasize of other women (never mind that women fantasize too) until the husband receives his love language.

B002NXOQF2|4.0|An adventure novel about rabbits.  In the spirit of Lord of the Flies, it is a pleasant study on character interaction, and very English. I picked this up because we named our new pupy Hazel, and found out that was the name of the chief rabbit of the book.  This book, which I finished in about a week, is something to consider if you want to read something gritty and fantastical, but not in that &#34;elves, ogres, and trolls&#34; genre.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so very disappointed with this book.  The book had no real basis other than setting up plots for books 4 and 5.  Yes, people this is NOT a trilogy.  It is now a series and one that I am done with.  I feel cheated to have patiently waited for 6 months for this CRAP!  Honestly, I don't get it. Why was the deadline pushed if you weren't going to produce a quality book?!?! I will not purchase the rest of the books in this series.
B009IRVSVQ|2.0|There seems to be two of Bruno Mars, one who sings soulful ballads and one who sings sexually explicit dance music.<br />If you are thinking of buying this because you heard &#34;Locked out of Heaven&#34; and &#34;When I Was Your Man&#34; on the radio or SNL, I would recommend just buying those MP3s. The man has a great voice, but I would feel embarrassed listening to half the songs on this album with my teenaged daughters in the car.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Not a happy movie - no spectacular singing ( too much in fact - would have been bearable if they could sing) - however the scenery was spectacular and the acting as well as could be expected -enjoyable !! No DVD or digital copy .
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great characters, great story.  Didn't think I was going to like this, a friend told me to read it, so I finally did and I really loved the story.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This WAS a movie cleverly done both visually and vocally - the plot was good and it was a pleasure to watch - also humourous in parts in spite of the blood thirsty scenes and the end was fairly pleasing. I would tell everybody to see it.<br />The actors chosen for the part were excellent and it was good to see Tarantino in a small section of the movie.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I liked the show the few times I saw it on tv, but it is so much better watching the entire season!  I laughed so hard and it is now my second favorite show, right after The Big Bang Theory! I can't wait for season two to be released! It has sexually targeted jokes and is hilarious if you aren't offended by that type of humor.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I do not personally like Daniel Craig as a James Bond but he did a lot of physical running around. It was action packed and in general a &#34; good see &#34; as movies go.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I Serious couldn't put this book down.... I'm bummed though I have to wait and see what happens to Eva and Gideon. Sylvia keep up the great story. I know your readers won't be disappointed. Hopefully we won't have to wait long for the next book.
B005LAIII0|4.0|Was a well done movie - some of the dialogues were too long and the end did not justify the movie , but I loved the visual part and the beginning very much.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Not only was this fun and action packed, it included a great cast. Coming out of retirement will never be the same.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|A lovely family movie - a good plot and the Indian side of the actors were extremely good - yes I would recommend it. The hustle and bustle on the Indian streets is typical ( I lived there for 18 years ) and so is the wheeler dealing of the hotel owner( Dev Patel who acted in Slumdog Millionaire) is also typical of the way business is conducted in India. It has everything fun humour family relationships and sadness in the movie well put together into a story and will probably do a lot for the Indian tourist trade.Altogether an enjoyable seeable movie!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Love it. Just have to get used to the rows sliding, more like a rubix cube versus just switching the piece you need.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I like this for my kindle, but the case seems to collect dust easily. Other than that I would recommend the black case.
B00006879E|1.0|I received the correct case but with a different CD in it. was by the same band. Close but no cigar
B000LW7MCG|5.0|I really like this movie, and so did my students. This movie is a good introduction to reading the novel The Giver.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Great movie, arrived quicker than we expected. we have 3 children, different ages and the 3 of them watch it daily.<br />not to mention its one of my faves!!
0753539470|5.0|Well written,entertaining, practical &#34;how to make this work for you&#34; suggestions.<br /><br />Am now reading it with my engineers at work and they are eating it up.
B0056Q7VVE|4.0|I loverd this book 40 years ago when I first read it, and ordered it so my children could enjoy it as well.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book deals with the very serious issues of suicide and sexual assault but manages to maintain a somewhat positive and hopeful tone.  The author has taken material which could have been so depressing as to be a real deterrent to readers and has packaged it in a way to make it an engrossing read.<br /><br />That being said, I had a tough time getting used to the narrative style of this book which alternates between the two main characters every few sentences.  Although I thought that the format was innovative, it did detract from my enjoyment of this book.  Maybe this format will be more accessible to younger readers or to those whose brains are more used to rapid fire multitasking than mine is.  In any case, the narrative style was a little too reminiscent of an IM chat for my taste, and I think that the format prevented the story from having the full emotional impact that it could have had.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a very readable one that highlights important issues.  I think that it is well worth reading.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I am a physician and consider this a must read book for all of us who care for the overweight patient.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I didn't want to even finish this book.  It just dragged on and on.  Just fillers, nothing more.  I loved, loved, loved the 2nd Book by Sylvia Day, but this one is a major disappointment.  Have been so excited about this book for months, and now just bummed.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I would give it zero stars.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|i would like to be able to  print out my schedule at home however, havent found a way to do that
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm tired of being taken for a money ride on these &#34;series&#34;! Really! At $10 per book ENOUGH! Please consider this next time you get ready to play this game with your readers!
B00005LOUQ|4.0|Very funny, The movie is great! This is bought from Amazon. Jim Carrey makes the movie hilarious.  Christmas isñt Christmas without the Grinch.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Beautiful Cinematography. Intriguing, although not entirely profound storyline. I was hoping for a little bit...more.<br />That said, the characters managed to hold my attention through the three hours.
B000ID37KO|4.0|The movie stopped with about 5 minutes left of the show.  I still liked the movie though but, it would have been nice to see it all the way to the end.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|There are TWO versions of this movie!  --and this review shows up for both of them.<br /><br />Make sure you find the COMPLETE version by checking the play time.  It should be 1Hr and 32min.  There's a newer version that is only 91 minutes -- a version that leaves a LOT of the charm of the original movie on the cutting room floor.  The 5 stars I gave this is for the longer version, only.  I would give the shorter version 3 stars.<br /><br />I would call Maude a Zen-Buddhist-Taoist master, the epitome of freedom, who encounters Harold, starving for the love of a mother who places decorum over all else. Maude's light and joy of life, permeates Harold's death fixated darkness, to humorous and often touching and ultimately healing affect.  Many hilarious and touching moments with an ending that is both sad and uplifting.  One of my all time favorite movies (I actually saw it in a theater back in '71) with the power to transform the viewer.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I adore Smash. I wish the show was going for a third season. I just watched season 1 again! Incredible show! I hope some other network picks it up!!!
B009FAQ8IY|4.0|Viewed this several times. Indeed, a great saga. Sometimes I wonder how Brando gets to be perceived as a great actor.., like James Dean.., when there is mostly camera shots of his mug and very little in the way of dialogue.  Is it all in the eyes and facial muscles?  But, he did.., immensely so.  I really enjoyed his comical part in Missouri breaks.
B003DT19F0|5.0|We watched it a day after it came and it is a very good new copy. It didnt have any skips or anything. Delievery was very quick.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book was really great. This was the second Grisham book I have read and I will definitely be getting more.
B004HW7JMY|3.0|Its part of the series. That's all that needs to be said. Great production, and storyline. HBO needs to follow this kind of production.<br /><br />This dvd is a must have and cant wait till the last one comes out on dvd.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|I downloaded this app based on the &quot;5 star&quot; reviews. What no one bothers to mention is the fact that after the initial download, the app has an additional download that makes it a total of 180mb. Along with the ads, I view it as a so so type of game. The fight sequences are confusing and not well thought out. I uninstalled after 5minutes.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Got a little lost in all the politics but the acting was superb.  Not sure how historically accurate as I don't know my history very well.
0823003590|5.0|Very clear.  Good explanations for advice given. Can now draw a portrait and get a likeness!  The best drawing advise I've found!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Most of the reviewers have already summarized the disappointments with this book. It was incomplete, boring, and lacked any panache that I loved from the early books. The big anti-Sookie plot was just dumb and shallow; the resolution of Sookie's romantic life was even more so. Harris spent more time describing Sookie's housekeeping skills than her breakup with Eric. On a personal note, I couldn't shake the feeling that Harris just wanted the series to be over so she didn't have to be bothered with it anymore. Also, the fact that Harris has decided to release a \\"where are they now\\" book in the fall instead of wrapping up her story in a final novel is a bullsh*t move. I won't read anything else by her.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Excellent 3D visual and sound.<br />Good family movie for all to enjoy and show off the 3D system.<br />Buy it.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Highly addicting.  Took me two days to watch the whole season.  Too bad Season 2 isn't free that would be wonderful
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Definately worth the money.  once you get the hang of where and how to look it keeps you going wanting to see whats next.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I wondered if I would enjoy this book when it began. It did not follow the normal grab the attention formulas. However I began to picture each character and saw their development. I was hooked. The narrative on the orphanage is both informative and disturbing. This is a really good story.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon and Eva stole my heart in Bared to you. The anticipation of waiting and the fear of it being what feels like forever was a disappointment in the unanswered questions at the end but, I would love a series of Gideon and Eva. I feel connected to them and I will continue to read these forever! I am so proud of how strong Eva is (woman power) and I cried like a baby. Sylvia I can't wait for the rest. Love you and all these sexy men from your books that I am having an affair with lol... I am crossessed!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am disappointed, there are hundreds of great books you can read, this is not a great book! The beginning, the middle and the ending left nothing to be desired. I feel sorry for Sylvia Day, she had a great story, awesome characters and she messed it up. I hope she redeems herself
B00BEXB18M|4.0|This is Megadeth of recent 10 years at it best, not teenagers anymore, great prodution,<br />the songs are coherent with the best linkage between song parts ( only countdown was better in this term)<br />Mustaine is a genius and I have enjoyed 85-90% of the things he has done,<br />as his mind went stable he has produced solid works with less ups but less downs as well,<br />he has invented his style and 2 notes are suffient to sense it is Megadeth.<br />this album has some territorial pissing (especialy vocals and complexity of song structure) for Megadeth, with nice integration of all previous album since the system has failed.<br /><br />King maker:<br />fits right in the middle of blackmail the universe and kick the chair, fast and furious.<br />good single, lacks variations too standard chorus (kill the king like) solo is OK. from both mustain and Broderick.<br />8.5/10.<br /><br />Super collider.<br />new megadeth radio friendly, nice but not thrilling enough. some say boring some say ignorable. the drumming and rhythm changes are the best in this song.<br />7/10.<br /><br />Burn:<br />Hell of an intro, silly lyrics but a great scorpion like chorus, the rhythm is 2 power chords high school like very boring.<br />could have been much better with better rhythm which remind me a little of \\"when\\". solo is fine. outro is good.<br />7.5/10.<br /><br />Build for war:<br />thrashiest intro, nice rhythm ( The right to go insane like ) interesting build up and singalong part.<br />8/10. +0.5 for the singalong.<br /><br />Off the edge:<br />cool intro, but then falls to mediocre rhythm. chorus is better, c part and solo which sounds like heard before.<br />7/10<br /><br />Dance in the rain:<br />progresses well, complex song with lot of variations, might be the better track in here due to great intro and nice vocals. in the stardards of 44 minuts.<br />9.5/10.<br /><br />Beginning of sorrow:<br />great intro bass line. Starting in chorus some new charmer like Singing style for Mustaine which sound pretty cool.<br />great c part starts at 2:00 with groove drum bass section.<br />9/10<br /><br />The blackest crow:<br />40 seconds of banjo intro (I wounder who players) sound from the world need a hero.<br />megadeth standard solo.

1932100660|5.0|This is probably the most important book I've ever read!  I am very health conscious and thought I had a very healthful diet.  Trouble was, I was consuming animal protein, almost every day!  Dr. Campbell cites numerous studies, many of which he was involved in, showing that animal protein is the cause of a myriad of &#34;affluent diseases.&#34;  In the U.S., we think of a diet containing meat, poultry, fish, dairy, as the norm.  It is not in most countries, all of which have lower levels of these diseases.  I am starting right away on a plant-based diet, and I have even just purchased The China Study Cookbook.  Everyone should read this book.  And then decide for yourself!  A. Thompson

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It reads like she  rushed to wrap it up. Its a shame. It would make a good TV series thou.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Great album! As an old-school AIC fan, I am thrilled to see them out on tour soldiering on in the wake of Layne's death.  This album is excellent, and new sing William Duvall harmonizes very well with Jerry Cantrell to achieve that classic \\"Alice\\" sound.  One can't help but miss the late Layne Staley's \\"stardust\\" that he would have brought to the table, but Jerry Cantrell is and always was the chief songwriter/musical talent and he delivers in spades here.  Not quite the 5 star album of their glory days, but very good in its own right.  If some new band had come along and released this, critics and fans would be hailing it as THE hard rock album of the year ( but apparently it's fashionable to imply that AIC is over, and it's NOT true.) Great riffs, melodies, and harmonies abound.  Production is quite dense (which can be good or bad depending in your taste, I LIKE the way this sounds.) This is somewhat mid-tempo by the band's standards, and I look forward to seeing what new singer William Duvall can do with these live in concert as I feel they will benefit in a live setting. If you have even a casual interest in Alice In Chains buy this album, you'll probably enjoy it if you keep an open mind.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great final chapter to this series!!!  I am so glad it ended the way it did.  They were meant to be together!  Too bad the True Blood show doesn't follow the books more closely.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|There is no end!  WTH???? I fell in love with this series, I gulpled @ the fact that I was paying 9.99 for a freakin EBook!!!! I lived with the fact that the book was delayed - well now I know why - instead of ending it, it is being dragged into chapter book status only @ 9.99 each!  Sadly this is my last crossfire book.<br /><br />I LOVE Gideon and Eva is okay (although her double standards in this book about how Gideon should be with ex's versus her was completely off the rails immature).  I really love Gideon, but not enough to pay 9.99 every 6 months for him.<br /><br />The book was great right up until it never ended, also the storyline they came up with to continue it seems kind of thin.<br /><br />My rating system is this - 4 star I will buy future books but not today.  5 star - I can not wait, must read now, now now - which is where this series was @ with me until this book.<br /><br />This is why it has 3 stars.  I am done being milked for cash.  I liked the story, it was a little too much on the sex scenes and thin on relationship, but well it was Gideon - naked! so I overlooked that.<br /><br />@ the end when all was said and done, the minuses outweigh even the Mighty Gideon Cross for me.  I am severing my relationship, deleting from my phone and will occasionally drink a glass of wine and think longingly of what could have been.<br /><br />My best day would be that they finished this relationship and maybe someday we get Cary's story and visit Eva & Gideon, but right now it feels like some overly soap opera show that doesn't know when it should have been cancelled.<br /><br />If you LOVE Gideon and do not mind shelling out the money to see them, this book is for you.

B0026S93C0|4.0|Its nice to see old movies and see the difference to today's technology.  I really enjoyed because it is genuine and not too much nudity, sex, and profanity.  Would watch it again.
0345803485|5.0|I have heard so many great things about this book that I just had to take the dive and jump into reading it. Fifty Shades of Grey is all that it is said to be and then more. Right off I fell for Ana's character, the way she is shy and unknowing about things. She has entered this world of the unknown with Christian and it is scary for her. I could picture Ana and the way she must feel about what she had stumbled into.<br /><br />I also loved Christian as soon as the author described him it was like I could picture him. He is very cryptic but his world is starting to unfold. Ever since he helped Ana off his office floor when she fumbled into the room for the interview, things have been going down hill for him. His rule system and even his will power are coming undone.<br /><br />Ana has changed so many things about him already, so many firsts for him. Starting with having a girl in his bed up to meeting his mom, who even thought her son, was gay. The world he has lived in since he was fifteen and seduced by one of his mother's friends has started coming undone. He tells Ana he knows what she is going through because he was once a submissive too. That shocked me, I would never have guess `control freak' (as Ana calls him) Christian would have been a submissive.<br /><br />Christian has a way about him that has me captivated me, I am right there with Ana wanting to know what makes Christian the way he is. He does not like to be touched at all, I had wondered if this was due to his birth mother but I still do not know for hundred percent if it was his mother that burned him. I hope to learn more about his past in the next book.<br /><br />He gives Ana gifts and she is not willing to take them at all, but he tells her they are on loan. It helps some with that notion because other wise she wouldn't take them. I was saddened when she returned these at the end.<br /><br />Ana's roommate/friend Kate makes me laugh every time she is around; even though at times she annoys me.She is with Christian's brother Elliot also adopted by their parents. Kate is the reason that Ana ended up interviewing Christian and I at times wonder like Ana what would have happened if it had been her. I cannot see Kate there, but she is very protective of her friend. She asked if she wanted Christian thrown out that one time and I had to wonder how she would manage that.<br /><br />I love the emails that Ana and Christian send back and forth on the `mean machine' as Ana calls it. The subject lines are always refreshing and I am smiling constantly to see what will be the next one. The mentions of what Ana's inner goddess is doing are always pleasant to read. She is another character inside of Ana, even though she is part of her.<br /><br />I loved the scene in the boat house and I had really hoped that Ana would have let him continue at the table during dinner. I had hoped, because I had wanted to see where it would go and if she could be quiet. I also wished they'd going to the bathroom at IHOP, but a girl can imagine.<br /><br />I knew that he'd show up in Georgia because that is just him, Ana has changed Christian in so many ways. She holds all the power in their relationship, as he told her when she returned home from visiting her mother.<br /><br />I was beyond saddened when Ana ended things with Christian, I was yelling at her to stay. She asked him to show her how it could be and he did at her request. I hope that I can read the next book soon because I was heartbroken and begging her like Christian to stay. I want to know so much more about Christian and I hope in the next book we find out why he does not like to be touched. It is driving me just as crazy as Ana.<br /><br />This is more than a five star book it's about hundred. Do give this a read, it was worth the wait even though the ending is heart breaking, the next book fixes that and so does the third. For those who do not like I am sorry, but this is wonderful and the author did a great job. Can'twait for the movie.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|but it's not supposed to be! So far I love it, it's a great companion for quick edits on location, to be refined later! My only concern is you can't save as a Tiff!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I love how this author writes.  The kite runner was the first novel by him that I read and loved every page of that book just like this one!  I have purchased this book twice because it was so good and I wanted to share it!  A very authentic read!  Very well written and thought out!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I don't know where to begin.  I will start with some positives.  Gideon was remorseful for what he did and I was glad.  He struggled with the huge sacrifice he made for Eva.  As a couple they seemed to be going through the same emotions as others that may be in that situation.  Eva really shined in this book.  She began to show the strength she needs to maintain their relationship.  Let's face it they are madly in love, co-dependent, passionate and fiercely protective of each other.  Those types of relationships have to be exhausting.  I found that I was jumping around chapters and skipping pages and I never do that. The negatives for me was just too numerous to mention.<br /><br />It is hard to critique this book without giving anything away. So I will just sum it up to say, I am a big fan of Sylvia Day but she missed the mark on this one. The ending was not necessarily a cliffhanger to make me want to read two more books.  She could have done one more chapter and an epilogue and could have put a great ending to a very popular series.  Gideon and Eva will remain one of my favorite all time romance couples.  I am fine leaving the rest of their lives to my imagination. I am sorry that in the end they did not get the ending they deserved.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This show is unbelievably beautiful.  It perfectly mirrors the beauty of Hannibal’s character.  Someone so fascinating and charming that you just can’t resist.  The whole series has been just like that.  I can’t look away – thank you Mads.  Both Hannibal (Mads Mikkelsen) and Will (Hugh Dancy) are perfect in their respective roles.  There are so many seasoned pros in this show that are fascinating and oh so likable (esp. Scott Thompson and Aaron Abrams, but also Gillian Anderson and Laurence Fishburne.)  I even loved poor Franklin since I could so easily relate to his crush on Dr. Lecter.  (I’m pretty sure I don’t need my spleen Hannibal…)  I would have been the first to say that nobody could do Hannibal after Anthony Hopkins.  I would have been wrong.  I can’t give enough stars to do this show justice.  If rumors are true that David Bowie might have a part in Season 2… well let's just say I didn’t think the show could get any better… looks like I might be wrong again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this work out. If you are a beginner be prepared to get your butt handed to you on a silver platter. If you are an experienced athlete be prepared for a great full body work out. If your beginner, STICK with it, it will get easier each time you do it and you will see results quickly. I am somewhere in the middle. I am not as tone as I would like to be but am in good physical shape and this work out is a work out for me. I love the levels and love switching between them to work different muscles in different ways. If you stick to the work out and dont rest, it is only 20 min after all, you will see results! I love that I can get a good full body work out in only 20 minutes. In 30 days I lost 2 inches on my waist and hips and an inch of my thighs, and I didn't have much to lose in the first place so I am in love!

B00BEXB18M|5.0|This album is awesome and even better than Th1rt3en which I also enjoy very much.  I saw a few at this point unfounded negative reviews of this album and after picking it up myself it was everything I was expecting and hoping for in a new Megadeth album, they did their reviews prior to release so maybe heard like one song and made a jump the gun assessment....or they were jealous Metallica fans with a Lulu cd lol.  Anyways if you enjoyed System, UA, Endgame and Th1rt3en you'll love this release, it fits in perfectly with this line of awesome Megadeth releases and as I stated previously it trumps 13 in my opinion.  This is not Risk II by any stretch of the imagination, a handful of people made that assumption after hearing the \\"Super Collider\\" single which sounds similar to a few songs on Th1rt3en and that was not a Risk II either.  The riffs, lyrics, drums, bass and Dave's vocals are intense on this album and it sounds awesome.  Great release, can't wait for the next one. \m/\m/\m/\m/  AWESOME JOB DAVE \m/\m/

B00633PFQC|4.0|The book does a pretty good job of highlighting some of the weird side effects that monetizing virtually everything has. While some of the things the author points out, are no big deal to me, others make me think, is this how I want things to be. Worth a read, no matter what your political leanings are.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is very interesting. It keeps you going on quest after quest and adds more tasks as you go. You never end up bored but can run out of energy and coins pretty quickly if not careful. You should make as many friends as you can as you will need them. A little confusing but you can learn as you go.
067144901X|5.0|An invitation to a baby shower included bookplate to be filled out with the giver's name and to be placed in a book for the newborn's library...what a clever idea!  Thus, that baby will start out on the right literary foot with dozens of entertaining books.  Obviously, Moo Baa La La La had to be included.  It is a classic...and when no longer read...it is recited.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was looking so forward to the last book in the series to come out that I even preordered it.  Then I get to the end of the book and find out it is not the last book, apparently there are 2 more to come after this one.  Sylvia Day should be embarassed by this book.  There is no story line, it just jumps from one sex scene to the next and all the scenes are pretty much identical to the one before.  There is no transition from one story to the next.  It is very hard to follow and just seems like it was a rushed effort to get the next book out.  She really should have taken more time to release this book.  I will not be buying book 4 or 5.  Very unfortunate that she seems to care more about pumping these books out quickly to make more money than providing a good book for her readers.  Very disappointing!  Save your $10 and move on to a different author or series!
B009MYARIK|5.0|I loved the first few of the shopaholic series and then they got a little redundant.<br />Twenties girl was only ok, but this shows some of her old spark.<br /><br />I liked the characters even though at times I wanted to smack them I could definitely see myself or people I know acting like them as well.<br /><br />All in all a fun and engaging summer read

B008BU75IQ|4.0|It sounds trite to say I disliked the way it ended but none the less its true.  It was so abrupt it was startling. One gets the feeling that there was something left out. I read it on my Kindle and thought  perhaps it hadn't downloaded properly.<br />He just solved one mystery, only to open another and it will be a very long wait to find out if there is, or isn't a conclusion. Over all, while the book was well written and kept one engaged but then made me wish I hadn't read it at all. I found it disappointing.
B001NKI60W|4.0|We love this film, a real chick flick, filled with silly drama, fun music and it's done in a beautiful setting.  - enjoy
B000VGXJ4W|5.0|Catch a Fire was Bob Marley and the Wailers first album. It features Peter Tosh before he left the band after the 'Burnin' album. Catch a Fire, in my opinion, remains The Wailers best work. There are songs here for all occassions, and the instrumentation and vocals are at their best throughout the whole entire album. It's a must have for casual and hardcore fans of reggea and Bob Marley alike!<br /><br />-JBH3

B0082FPIY8|5.0|This is one of the best memoirs I have ever read. Cheryl is such a skillful and talented writer. She weaved between the past and future beautifully.<br /><br />I read part of it on my iphone via the kindle app. I was in town, eating with my boyfriend. I read a specific scene and was so moved that I started crying in public. Books very rarely make me cry, this is the first time I'm aware of it happening.<br /><br />It's one of the best books I have read in my life, and I read prolifically.
B003UESJH4|5.0|When we saw this movie I knew right away it would win the academy award.  It was a wonderful film.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I  wished this book would never end.  The vivid descriptions of the people and events of the time made it so real, it was just like being there.  The detailed narrative of the characters'  thought processes deepened the effect.  This is the best book I've read in a long time!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is the video of the first book of the series and I have enjoyed it very much.  I showed my daughter how good the series is.  I had this on VHS but it doesn't work well so I wanted it on DVD.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am not a huge fan of the Sherlock holmes books but this show really got my attention. The characters really flesh out and the cases they take usually take a nice twist some where along the way. I would recommend this show to everyone.
B003U80I5G|5.0|I have loved this version of Jane Eyre and I am so ohappy to have it for my own finally
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Although people are giving 1 stats because they are mad, I am going to say that I thought this was the last book of the series so my expectations were high to wrap up some stuff. Now that I know there are going to be 2 more books, I am excited for more Eva and Gideon! What can I say I am happy, stunned, frustrated but amazed! Very well written and excellent detailed sex scenes. I am looking forward to the next book just hoping this next one doesn't take as long as this one to release! Great job on another great book.
1603425381|5.0|Doing scrap afghans with my stash of yarns from Stephanie's Studio & Yarn.<br />Needed something to tie together and frame the many colors.<br />This book has been extremely helpful!
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|Very psychedelic cowboyish.  I loved the yipping ! Reminiscent of Chris Isaac only more fun. There is not a song on this CD that I don't like.
B009AP4MGE|5.0|Browsing on Amazon, I saw I could buy season 4 through my membership.  We have watched the first five shows and love the new format they're doing of going back and forth between New York and Lima.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  Nicholas Sparks truly captures your attention with the energy of the main character, the twists and turns the books takes and multiple surprises!  I fell in love with the characters and was so pleased with the direction the story took.  Great read!
B003VB5E2E|5.0|Love the collection of Blue's star that Eric Clapton gathers for his Crossroads concert series, excellent filming & sound  Love it !!!
B004U8VX2M|3.0|I never saw the first series when it was in black and white. The writing wasn't strong... but it did get off to a good start.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Pure entertainment. Some language and content issues, but nothing kids don't already hear. A great movie to help kids appreciate others and the place they might be in or coming from.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|WORST ENDING EVER. with out giving anything away if you read the first and second book the third book is like taking all those problems with the same people only Gideon and Eva handle them rationally  now. I really wish I didn't buy it now because I am still waiting for the same info on Gideon as I was in the first. I honest don't think i will be buying the next just to be left with  another bull crap cliff hanger when its totally unnecessary. It feels like she is just dragging it out for money.  I am so unbelievably disappointed right. i don't even know what to say I'm just disgusted. (-_-) some trilogy. . .
B006LR0XLM|4.0|This has been a good program to share large files without emailing them.  The added storage incentives when you get other people to sign up have been nice.<br /><br />I don't like the fact that all files are also saved on your hard drive.  If you are trying to free up storage space on your hard drive this will not help.  It is handy to get files you need on any computer though.  I am not sure how other cloud storage programs work so I cannot compare.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I recommend this app to anyone who likes puzzles and having fun and liking challenges. I love it I love it I love this app
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book was a wonderful finale for the series. I can't wait for After Dead to come out in October to find out how all the characters make out from all this.
B005URRCUY|5.0|The songs on El Camino are well-written, supremely performed, and too incredible for words. I've had the pleasure of seeing the Black Keys live in Norfolk, Virginia and man, what a powerhouse show.<br /><br />There is nothing else to write as I'm less than subjective when it comes to describing this duo's sound. The more I listen to their tunes the more I have to listen to their tunes. They get under your skin in the best possible way. Get yourself a copy of El Camino, you'll be glad you did. Here's to happy listening.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg shares impactful and simple insights on how women hold ourselvens back based on her experience and hard data. I admire her candidness, openness and guts and am already benefitting from reading her book.  A page-turner and must read for women and men!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game never grows old. It is very relaxing tense moments. I know nothing is going to blow up. lol
0684824906|5.0|Always wanted to read about President Lincoln.  This book provided a very rounded presentation of the man.  A true genius.  Where is he now?  Come back, Mr. Lincoln!  We need you!!!!!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is the best game l have ever played, just make aura less rare and battling on higher levels not so hard
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very good book shows what a true hero he was.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a true American hero.
B00992CF6W|5.0|YOU GUYS THEY'LL ADD ALL THAT STUFF IN THEIR OWN DUE TIME!!!!YOU CAN'T RUSH GREATNESS!!  Other than that, the game is awesome.
B000F8O35U|5.0|i bought this for my grand daughter  needless to say she loves it  till the next princess catches her eye  you cant go wrong of its disney  so my comments will be that the dvd arrived ahead of shipping dates  excelent condition  as discribed by the seller
B0090KZDSK|2.0|A little disappointing after the two previous books, this one was lacking and nothing has really happened!  Has left us hanging in order to buy the next book!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Really this app is exactly what you think it is, with the addition of the weather also being displayed I would recommend this app.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Well written story with plenty of action and a very good ending. All you can ask for in a book.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I returned this because it wouldn't do what I wanted it to do.  It was not a reflection on the product.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A little bit weird but it's actually a good movie. Watched it on Amazon streaming and it was very good
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I find the game addicting and so far it hasn't generated and glitches or hangups and i've played it for hours!  Nice job Imangi Studios!!!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I was introduced to QOTSA with Songs for the Deaf, and have been a fan since.  At this time, my favorite album is Rated R, but I have a feeling that this one will take over with time.<br /><br />Josh Homme has always been the mad genius of the current generation of rockers.  While on the surface the songs may appear to be typical hard rock, one starts to appreciates the subtleties that he adds into his tracks, from non-standard tuning to adding sound effects where you won't expect.  That being said, this album is a long way from the first QOTSA album.  It is not Rated R, nor is it Songs for the Deaf, or like any other QOTSA albums.<br /><br />While Homme still has a rocking swagger on this album, he has taken more risk on some of the tracks.  &#34;The Vampyre of Time and Memory&#34; and the title track are pretty soft by their standard, but show a different side of QOTSA that was hinted at with &#34;Make it Witchu&#34;.  However, there are still good rockers like &#34;If I Had A Tail&#34; and &#34;Smooth Sailing&#34;.  The main thing that makes this album stand out is the musical maturity Homme has decided to take.  It makes even more sense since this was released on an independent label.  Highly recommended to the fans who want to see the band evolve.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|The sonic screwdriver is great. I wasn't sure how it would be but it was surprisingly sturdy. The pen/market falls off often and the pen has to be closed or pulled all the way out to push the sonic button. But the sonic screwdriver is soooo much fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I bought this for my Mom for the coming Christmas.  I know she will love it as much as I loved the series on tv.
B000000OF6|5.0|Enjoyed having all of their hit songs together so I could chose which ones to listen to when I wanted.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Ooooops, I just reviewed this for the wrong game....check out my review for the game &#34;Sketch w/ Friends&#34;.  Haven't tried the other game yet.  Big Ooops.  lol
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It kept you interested all the way through. Hated to BUT it down. The characters became so real you became a part of their life. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The &#34;running man&#34; with similar plot has been there 25 years ago, only main character is changed to a girl.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Very entertaining game. Holds your interest and accumulating points is a challenge. Good for eye-hand coordination and keeps one going!
B002NJUN44|4.0|I like all of the actors in this flick and its a good escape movie. Not great but good stand by to own on bluray.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Have found this series humorous and fun to watch.  Have been talking about it with anyone who asks... and even those who don't.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|It detected the edges well and enhanced the image well for making a quick pdf with my phone's camera and sending it via dropbox, email, etc. I like Camscanner better, as it gives you more than four points to adjust the image and correct for the angle you snapped the pic. I didn't explore this app in depth, but Camscanner seems to have more options for file types and image enhancing manually (although I rarely need to use them as it automatically does a fairly good job, as well). I would not pay for this (I tried as the FAOTD) as I prefer the free app.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was looking forward to this book coming out and wasn't disappointed with it. I understand why others are upset that the book didn't end with the third one, but I am glad it didn't. There was still too much to get through to end it with the third book. It would have been rushed to conclude here. The new twists and turns are good, although some I could do without (Cary and his \\"news\\"). I love the characters and they way you are drawn into the story line. I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the next book or two!
B004EF65QA|5.0|I find myself watching this over and over! I love Richard Armitage as Mr. Thornton. He's gruff but underneath, he's just love struck. \\"Look back. Look back at me.\\" Gah, I die every time I see that part!!
B004WJRF6C|5.0|This is a terrific re-release supervised by Paul himself, it sounds like an SACD!  The packaging and photos are gorgeous.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Looks like Sylvia Day made a mistep with this one. Won't be wasting my money on Entwined with You. Been reading the reviews and seems like readers are pissed off! I'm not a big fan of trilogies, unless they are exceptionally good. I can do series, but I prefer to have my stories to wrap up. Let this be a lesson for all writers.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The story started really well and found that I couldn't put it down until I got to a certain point. Was reading it at the same time as a friend and she finished it a day before me and she willed me to finish it to discuss. The first 80% of the book was riveting but how it finished it really disappointed me. Despite this I might give the author another chance as the majority of the book and the initial plot was very well constructed. One couldn't guess the ending but I certainly found that the ending let down the book. It was almost like she had gotten tired of the intrigue and gave it some sort of an ending just to get rid of the manuscript.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is not complicated.  It is easy to learn and get accustomed to.  And earning coins for the upgrades is not too difficult so you can progress at a reasonable pace.  There is a nice challenge though, when you try to beat your previous distance records.  It can be entertaining for quite a while
B0054W4JQK|4.0|A slightly slower start & the book does lack characters, but the end is frightening & really creeps up on you. Very well written, describes the life of a person with amnesia in incredible detail & at times it's hard to know what is truth or lie in the book. Well worth a read.
B00957T6X6|5.0|One of the best series I have read. I could not put it Down, and fell in love with these amazing characters, even the monsters. Great read!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was recommended to me.<br />Never would have guessed the ending<br />I think I'd like to try some other books by this author
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Former lifelong Logitech trackball user, but their product (especially their bloated software) are pretty terrible, so when my trackball died, I wanted a top notch mouse to do design with.<br /><br />After reading the reviews on Amazon, and the great price, I figured why not?<br /><br />This mouse is fantastic. Fully customizable, macros, etc..<br /><br />Weighted, so you can configure to your liking.<br /><br />Accuracy and response are 10/10, this is a perfect mouse.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|I like the ex Gov as an actor. This film really shows how old he is getting. Aren't we all? LOL This is a movie that's a little corny, and the body count is way up there. That said, it's worth the price if you like the genre, and, or, ahnolt
B008JJM88Q|2.0|Guesses well, but refuses to acknowledge when you stump it. I got it on Leftist of the Recluse Saga and Bink of the Xanth Series; but each time it dumped me into a &quot;tell me who you were thinking of&quot; dialouge with no way to search and when I give it one it can find, says &quot;4 out of 4 guessed correctly&quot;.<br /><br />Pshaw, I say. Fix this broken app and it will be actually fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire begins very slowly as it seemingly tries to formulate a mystery or mirage of sorts in the first 150 pages. However once you get past that the story comes at you at a breakneck pace with action, plotting, and revenge occurring constantly. It's a fun read and am now excited to see the movie.
0345525558|5.0|This was a wonderful book!  I am recommending it to everyone I know that loves to read.  I will read it again as I do any book I love.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put this book ( or Kindle that is) down. As soon as I got three quarters into the book, I knew that Eva and Gideon's story couldn't be ending so soon.  I loved it and I want more....soon!  I love Eva and Gideon and I want them to get their happily ever after and I love all the mystery that surrounds them.  I wish Eva would just slap the s*** out of Corinne Giroux and Elizabeth Vidal!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It must have been cancelled because of 9/11/2001 or maybe because the bad PR for using chinese curses at a time when China requires more respect.<br /><br />Josh Weldon was masterful in combining Science Fiction with Western theme and acoustic fiddle music.  After 14 episodes I was dreaming for more.  It was an awsome series with lots of young nerds becoming new fans.  A cult series. The human race has populated the universe and is still looking for intelligent life.  No vegetable monsters but creepy mutants.  Unlike Star Wars containing archtype good and bad, everyone is a mix of hero and coward, intelligent yet still make stupid mistakes, able to laugh at each other and themselves.  Do NOT watch the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; (based upon the series) until AFTER watching the complete series, otherwise there is a spoiler about the Reavers and main characters die.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I like the premise for the story line and where it takes place.  The CG was done really well and interesting conception of animals and other creatures.  Fun stimulation for the eyes to watch.  I think most people would enjoy this as a casual relaxation.  Leaves with a good feeling that the good guys win over the evil doers.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|this simulation is over all great but there need to be more planes. I think the sr71 blackbird would be fun to fly
0060527986|5.0|This is a book that I can just pick up and flip to any page to find something that I can relate to. The entire novel is inspiring and serves as a reminder that we are each warriors. Life has it's ups and downs, but we can get through them; and even more so, we were meant to! This is a fantastic read and I've recommended it to anyone who has come to me looking for more spiritually related readings!
B00138F8B4|4.0|Had to have these songs. Great high school memories. I forgot about this album till Nearly Lost You popped in my head last week.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|As always, I love each episode of Supernatural.  Just as I thought the couldn't extend the story around angels and demonds any longer, they still managed to make me curious about the next season I can't wait for Season 9.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|First time I played it took 30 questions before it finally guessed John Locke.<br />Second time it took only 9 questions to correctly guess Walter White.<br />Fun game but only if you aren't scared of black magic.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I expected this book to be more historical and dry.  So I was delighted that there was a deeply moving story ; a story of two women- generations apart in age yet sharing a common bond.  I found the story of Vivian, the old woman that teenage rebel Molly comes to work for intriguing.  It is amazing to me that the orphan train was barely 100 years ago.  i really enjoyed this book, it was a quick and satisfying read.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I found the story line - white girl raised with slaves - provided the author an opportunity to examine family relationships (including relationships between owners, slaves, and overseers) during the slavery era from a unique perspective.  This approach afforded the reader a fresh perspective on the human bonds that developed between slaves and the families that owned them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was engrossed in this book almost more by the style of writing than the subject matter.  In fact this isn't a topic I would choose to spend time on.  The author drew me in rapidly.  Then I had to read nonstop, page after page, rushing thru each event, each chapter until the very end.  If only the next book by E.L. James could live up to what we now expect!  Don't count on it.  This is a trilogy that can't be equaled.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Just like a bunch of people I waited for the LAST installment of the TRILOGY, and guess what?  Another cliffhanger, more INSTALLMENTS coming in what another 6-8 months?  Put a fork in it, I'm done.  Maybe if this book would of been written better I'd be willing to pay yet another $9.99 in the future.  But there was NO need to extend the life of this story other than more money.  So sick of these authors leaving people hanging, just write a WHOLE book and publish it.<br /><br />Sylvia Day - You just lost a reader.  This will be the first Kindle book I ever return.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|I have watched this movie many times before, it never gets old. Love and miss Patrick! I am sure I will watch it again in the future.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have 2 boys (three counting their dad) who love playing this game.  It is one of their favorite Angry Birds games.
1439130833|5.0|The item got here in a timely manner and in great shape. I like the fact that I can read a short daily snipet to start my day off on the right foot.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very diffrent from the other two.<br />Often felt like Eva wasn't the same character, or person from the two. Not so much angst in this novel.<br /> Read the reviews before my book arrived in the mail. Based on the review I thought I was gonna hate it. Didn't like some parts. But overall I loved it, they're together and stronger than ever, or getting there.<br />Read the book and form your own opinion.
B004LWZW42|4.0|We all enjoyed the movie and could watch it a second time and stay interested easily . Many fine movies are out !
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I obviously can't speak for anyone, but if you are still comparing every album to QOTSA's SFTD album, I'm guessing that even Josh Homme would recommend that you skip this album.  Check out Anthony's Bourdain's intro to ...Like Clockwork.  He quotes Mr. Homme as saying the only pressure for doing a new album is to make sure it isn't like a previous record.  And this one won't be accused that.  Instead, it combines so much of all past influences and expands to new areas.  Just like Amazon's \\"if you like this\\" suggestions, Like Clockwork has enough of the core elements that you recognize (and love) about QOTSA, but expands your palate beyond what you've heard before.<br /><br />If you want to get some perspective on this album, take some time to see what Mr. Homme has been through over the past 6 years.  Near death experience (on knee surgery!), two kids, depression... A lot of the lyrics are more personal than previous releases.<br /><br />But, they still do rock!  \\"Keep your eyes peeled\\" is robot rock at its darkest.  \\"If I had a tail\\" has the dark swagger and a similar in-your-face message to the misguided.  \\"My God is the sun\\" is as close to old QOTSA but with a bit more production.  \\"I sat by the ocean\\" is more of a classic rock tune.  And the funky licks in \\"Smooth sailing\\" is the offspring of Eagles of Death Metal and Them Crooked Vultures.<br /><br />But the most intriguing stuff on the album is what we haven't seen before by QOTSA.  \\"I appear missing\\" followed by \\"Like Clockwork\\" is Mr. Homme exposing his somewhat fractured soul - something that didn't happen so openly in past records.  In \\"I appear missing,\\" the lyrics are paired with music that is so intricate and layered - you can get lost in its depth.  It's a highlight that also illustrates how talented all the members of the band are. \\"Like Clockwork\\" (the track) is slow ballad and a risky finish, like standing naked in the spotlight.  And unfortunately the SFTD worshipers are likely to get mad about that.  But for those who have matured, the growth in this record represents what is great about this band.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|After reading a lot of material on Michael Jackson, among which I could quote books like:<br /><br />J. Randy Taraborrelli's Michael Jackson The Magic & The Madness;<br /><br />Jermaine Jackson's You Are Not Alone;<br /><br />Frank Cascio's My Friend Michael;<br /><br />Lynton Guest's The Trials of Michael Jackson;<br /><br />Joseph Vogel's Man In The Music;<br /><br />Berry Gordy's To Be Loved<br /><br />Michael's own autobiography Moonwalker<br /><br />I guess I could sort of have a very clear portrait and panorama of Michael's life as a fan like you, who started it all out from being a fan too. I have finally got to your book recently and I confess I have read the initial chapters so far, but I have to tell how much more reliable I can feel your work compared to other authors I mentioned above. You should probably have been hearing this a thousand times a day from some months up to now, since your book came out, and I just felt it would be good to let you know that there is such a tender yet accurate job in what you've written as far as I've gone with my reading that you truly deserve congratulations from me, as your reader. Just as I finish the book would very much like to let you know the final impressions I had on your work!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|this app is good so far! didn't see the movie, but getting this app is great! takes a lot of work of building a kingdom and training soldiers! the graphics are good too and the battles are interesting! this app isn't that bad! keep up the good work! :)
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I live this app we set and try to stump it and just can't do it. Hours of fun with it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very entertaining. Just challenging enough to keep me thinking but not hard enough to need a walkthrough.  Can't wait for a sequel!
0780626494|5.0|Great family flick I've bought twice since its release. A one of a kind I'm glad to have again today.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I too was disappointed in this book.  I really like the story of Eva and Gideon, but this book seemed to be just a lot of fluff and a bunch of unnecessary sex put added in order to drag the story for book 4 & 5.  If 50% of the sex was written out and more concentration was done on the story line the book would have been so much better. And I absolutely HATED where Eva pushed Gideon sexually.  I mean, really???  SMH  If that would have been Gideon pushing Eva, I would hate to see the backlash!<br /><br />It could have been a trilogy with an epilogue and the readers could have been much happier with the finished results. Well with this not being the last book, it will probably be the next year or two before we finish the story.  How fair is that to your readers that have been with you since the beginning.  Makes it look as if Sylvia Day's publishing house just want more money!  So not fair!!!  I won't say that I will not finish the story but I definitely will NOT pre-order since I initially ordered in October 2012!!!  As a fan...I am really disappointed.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Another Danielle Steel special book.  Her books always make me feel good because they are about love and good people and have happy endings.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This tool takes on the worst knives and sizors and makes them like new. When its done with a blade its like new.
0439023491|5.0|This was a great read. I couldn't put it down. I bought it used and it came in new condition. Overall great buy.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I have played several versions of this game over the years and this is the most difficult to get back to the beginning.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|So I got sonic and loved it more than Mario although he is pretty cool. This game was better.Checkout my minecraft sonic map.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|Not a Star Trek fan, but this movie was very impressive.  Great story line, great acting, and even better action sequences.  I would recommend for everyone that likes action, sci-fi, or any other movies that are just plain &#34;good.&#34;<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I reserve 5 stars for my all-time favorites.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|The core topic of this book is the &#34;atheism&#34; - nevertheless R.D. addresses several controversial topics in both science and religion. For those interested in R.D. books, I recomend reading fisrt &#34;The Selfish Gene&#34; then continue with &#34;The God Delusion&#34;.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am very sad that after reading the first two wonderful books the third one was not up to par.  It jumped all over the place and then extending it into another book or two is just Sad!  Up until today I was telling everyone what a great series this was and to read it.  After today I will not spread that word anymore.  The length of time that it took this book to reach the shelves and now to have to wait again is just SAD!  Someone really needs to rethink  the time frame of this series.  You are losing readers.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really loved this game! I was sad when it said I was finished and can't wait for a new one! Wished this one was a little longer, but had lots of fun solving the puzzles.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love this show!!!!!  I love the story and the cast. Even though the story is fake, the actors make it real. They pull you in.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|I had a electronic device that needed two batteries. Popped two of these in and it started working instantly.  Exactly what I needed.
B00AA8LYBQ|5.0|No matter people say. I like high school musical. Movies are not suppose to be real, they are suppose to entertain. This movie does it. I love the music too!!!
B00AG297GK|3.0|This movie was better than expected but not great!  I did watch it the entire way through and a chuckle or two.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|This was really cool movie. The performances was awesome. It was cool to see the main actors find each other in the end.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I got this app to try as a travel alarm, But the advertizing box is bright while the rest of the display is a nice night light. Instead of buying it, I'll just delete it. Some folks will find it okay, I'm sure
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|First of all I would like to say that this was an amazing book. To have two characters so broken and abused find something so beautiful and perfect for them was refreshing. At first I was afraid and didn't know how I was going to feel about the obsessive and possessive traits that were shown in both of them. However by the end it was just so beautifly written. Even the sex scenes were tastefull and real. Not fake or contrived. They each found absolution and freedom within each other and as I read the last page I sighed with a tear in my eye. I have read the Archangel series as well as the Psy Changeling, and love this author! Great job!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Daft Punk successfully fuses digital and analog in Random Access Memories. This time bringing to the table a fusion of retro soul with contemporary electronic music. You can't put a label on a sound this smooth. This album's high production values, up beat grooves and engineering trickery, both subtle and exaggerated, should be enough tempt any music lover and especially the duo's die hard fans. Regardless of technical expertise, the core of this album is comprised of Daft Punks musical evolution from almost 20 years of hard work and passion. The result is a thoroughly thoughtful, fun and sincere album that pays loving homage to many generations, and genres, of music.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My kind  6 like it very much. He saw this movie and saw.... And saw.<br />Good film.<br />Polar express good rate
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I must admit I came to the Megadeth party pretty late in the game. I picked up their greatest hits cd a couple years ago on a whim and ended up loving it.<br /><br />I then started getting back catalog from Rust In Peace back and then ended up getting everything they'd released because it was all good. I read the reviews on here and had to laugh at the one stars. I have listened to this cd since it came out on Tuesday and I think it's really listenable . One thing about Megadeth is that I find all their music very easy to get into which is not the case with some bands. I can pull out any Megadeth cd and get rewarded listening, including Risk and Thirteen.<br /><br />This one is no different. Good riffs, cool songs, and the lyrics aren't as bad as some would have you think. So it's a typically good Megadeth album which I have come to expect from Dave and company.<br /><br />I guess some people just hate Megadeth or want another Rust In Peace or Peace Sells. I just appreciate each album for what it is. Good rock and roll. Enjoy.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|Pi tells a story that one can take at face value, but really under the surface is the lead character's inner workings. A great movie to discuss possible meanings.
1597801585|5.0|This is a scary look at a possible future!<br /><br />I hope there are prequels or sequels coming soon. There is so much potential!
B008R6MI8G|5.0|I really enjoyed learning about the war for independence in Ireland. Michael Collins was quite the rebel even if the outcome wasn't what all expected.
B0073COMKW|4.0|These are fine but remember the base is shielded so there will be a few degrees of shadow.<br />The color temperature and brightness are fine.  If you put them in a hanging fixture and you can only see the bottom of the bulb anyway, these are fine.
B000TKW3E2|5.0|I've only listened through this in its entirety once, so far, but it's hard to miss the instant appeal of Marianelli's excellent work.  The integration of the typewriter into the score gives it an instant uniqueness, a clear signature.  The melodies are bittersweet (in a very musically delicious way); the emotional color wheel stays more on the side of melancholy ranging to heartbreak, so don't expect a peppy pick-me-up from this score.<br /><br />Two things that I didn't care for were:<br /><br />1. I wanted a climax; a suite of some sort that would take the gorgeous melodies and milk them for all they were worth, perhaps.  From a cursory first listen, I didn't feel like I really got that.<br /><br />2. The last track, a performance of &#34;Clair De Lune&#34;, is nice enough to have in the library, I suppose; better too much music than too little; but I wasn't particularly struck by the performance, and I'd love to have been introduced to a *new* piece of classical music instead of one that I have heard a lot and already have recordings of elsewhere.<br /><br />Altogether, though, an excellent score which I would highly recommend to any collector of film music.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Solid storytelling happens here, hats off to the writers and directors. Looking forward to another season, hope that happens. Tatiana Maslany heads a stellar cast.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really love this book, we get to know more of Gideon's sweet side and the love he has for Eva... Eva still need to grow up a little, it would be awesome if we get some Gideon´s POV I think we need it to know him better and to clear some stuffs like his meeting with Nathan. I really hope the 4th book will be released soon!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have followed this series from book one--I expected more from the end. It was rather dull. But after the way True Blood has screwed with all the characters,(worst cast show ever),and story lines I guess Ms Harris was just glad to end it.
B00AM7E4P8|5.0|After reading some other books by M. Pollan I had very high expectations. This book did not disappoint. Looking forward for the next.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I agree so much with the first review on this page. I feel as used by the Author should feel about Eva. She is beyond irritating now and the Author throwing in all of these plot twists in a book that covered just a few weeks is so irritating. I am not at all sure I will be on board for anymore. I don't think I want to see the superficial junk this Author thinks makes up the interesting and readable plot lines of a relationship I was really invested in. This junk with Brett is beyond annoying. To think she loves Gideon so much she will do anything for him BUT cannot tell Brett to take a hike?? She says she HATES the girl she was, basically a tramp, and now she walks through a door with Brett and leaves it wide open for him??? I wanted to slap her over and over throughout this book. I am not an Author, but I can think of a lot of plot lines that would be engrossing and interesting and HAVE Eva and Gideon TOGETHER and honestly working things out TOGETHER! EL James books are not that well written but have a much better plot line and ending. Cary is another one I liked and don't anymore. I want to rip Eva and Cary a part and maybe they would grow up!! How many people are SO important to Eva she cannot live without them? And what in the WORLD is Eva doing texting Brett. I can see it now, she will go out to Calif and hook up in some way with Brett, GAG!! There will be some kind of Blackmail by the person who somehow knows what Gideon did and he has to work through that. And he will do these things without telling poor Eva and she will fall apart, AGAIN. But how can he trust her, she is a baby and not truly faithful as she expects him to be!! She does not seem able to say the easiest word in the World if you love someone like she is supposed to love Gideon. To anyone else you say NO and you don't lead them on unless you are a tramp!! And I didn't like her mother before but now I HATE her!! And another plot line that really ticks me off is that Gideon resents his family but now cannot turn away from his mother, has to care so much about his manipulative EX?? Now his mother is going to push for the EX and hate EVA. It is beyond aggravating!!<br /><br />The more I think about this book the more upset i get that a really good story  that has had me waiting with anticipation let me down so badly. Result is I will not be buying any other books by this Author. i will probably finish out the series or at least give it one more shpt but I will not buy into anymore of this Authors work. It is so obviously about getting the most sales and not about good material. I loved these characters and now I don't like Eva at all and feel sorry for Gideon but am impatient with him being such a schmuck.<br /><br />I wish I could as Sylvia one question especially and it would be if Eva gets so jealous and upset at Gideon for talking to his other ex's how can she justify her wanting any kind of relationship with Brett who blatantly propositioned her and let her know exactly what he wants???<br /><br />SO DISAPPOINTED!now cannot turn away from his mother, has to care so much about his manipulative EX??

B005NPBT5M|5.0|Lost my original CD sometime many years ago, and have been meaning to replace it ever since.  Heard a few Floyd tracks over the weekend and decided it was time, I was not let down in the least.  The sound is great, and you couldn't beat the price.

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Unbelievable-masterful tribute to the loves of his life,some of his best songs ever,he can make a great tour based on this album!
B00BEXB18M|2.0|Even though this has already been buried amongst the numerous reviews I felt the need to re-write this review.  As the months have gone on I've developed a deeper understanding of this album, or at least my feelings towards it.<br /><br />Contrary to some reviews THIS IS NOT RISK 2!!!  Risk was a pop rock album released in 99 to sell records, and all it did was alienate fans.  This is still a Megadeth album, and there's no quesiton of that when you hear it.  They do some experamentations on a few songs, but they're welcome attempts at something new.  Risk didn't have 1 song that sounded like Megadeth.<br /><br />Style-wise this is similar to 90's Megadeth, but a little faster probably.  It's kind of like Cryptic writings made heavier and faster, with not as good songwiting.  Speaking fo songwriting, that's really the draw back for me on here.  It's just not quite as good as a majority of their albums.  There just aren't too many stand out tracks for me.  The problem with this style is Cryptic writings was enough for me.  I like that album ok.  It's not my favorite, but it's pretty good.  I didn't want another one.  I'll admit I wanted a thrash album.  Thrash metal is one of my favorite styles and I've been desperately wanting a good new thrash album ever since Testament dropped the ball with their latest, the fault mostly going to singer Chuck Billy who's racist and anti American lyrics ruined the majority of that album.  I appreciate that bands want to try new things, and it's fine for Dave to do so as well, but as an artist you can't forget about your core fanbase either.  And he has several times throughout his career.  I'd have been happy with 3 solid thrashers to mix in with the rest of this album, but there's not one.  Instead we get what I mentioned before.  It's not terrible but geez was I hoping for more.<br /><br />Kingmaker starts the album off on a high energy note.  I love the drums in the chorus.  It's got a good riff int he verses and solid vocals.  Overall this is a solid opening track. 8/10<br /><br />Super Collider is more of a rock oriented song, and it's a fairly good one.  iIt's got a nice drum beat.  The chorus is a little weird but it grew on me.  7/10<br /><br />Burn is an upper mid tempo song.  I can't stand behind Dave on this one.  The \\"Burn baby burn\\" part is just ridiculous.  2/10<br /><br />Built For War is a faster song, plenty heavy.  Again this is another song that so far hasn't really grown much on me, and still hasn't.  It's better than the last song, but that's not saying much 4/10<br /><br />Off The Edge is another up tempo song.  The chorus is a little simple, but its a listenable song.  Hopefully it'll grow on me.  Honestly I can't remember it now. 5/10 at best.<br /><br />Dance In The Rain is slower more groovy.  This song has talking vocals by Dave with more singing as he builds up to the chorus.  This song changes pace a couple of times here and there.  The bridge is much thrashier and faster and is my favorite part of the song.  Why was the guy from Disturbed in this song?  He adds nothing that Dave Mustaine couldn't do.  The thrashy partt is fairly cool, but ruined by the rest of the song, which actually isn't terrible except for the stupid chorus.  Sorry I just can't get past the dance in the rain part and don't get how this is considered one of the better tracks from this.  2/10<br /><br />Beginning Of Sorrow is more of a mid tempo rocker.  The verses are ok, but the chorus is overly repetitive and the lyrics aren't the greatest. 4/10.<br /><br />The Blackest Crow is really the first experimental track on here.  Banjo on a Megadeth song?  WTF?  This was for a time my favorite song on here and I still enjoy it overall, though the lyrics aren't anything special.  But the banjo in the intro now annoys the crap out of me.  I'm not a fan of the banjo in music anyways, Led Zeppelin being a good example, and the intro irritates me to no end.  I don't mind it through the rest of the song,as it's more background music, but the intro sucks.  The rest of the song is decent enough.  6/10<br /><br />Forget To Remember is a pure hard rock track, and really different from the rest of Megadeth's catalog.  It's up tempo, but with more of an 80's Priest style, kind of.  I'm just going off the top of my head.  I was hoping the chorus would be a little better, but it is growing on me. 6/10<br /><br />Don't Turn Your Back starts with a bluesy guitar intro, which is short lived as it soon turns into a bit of a thrasher.  I like the guitar riff.  The melody is fairly good and the drums do a solid job.  Finally we get a song I actually like  It's been a long while.  8/10. .<br /><br />Cold Sweet I've never heard the original, but this is a decent song.  7/10<br /><br />So there you have it.  For those wanting a new thrashterpiece look to Death Angel, who's 2013 album is fairly good.  For those who can appreciate the more rock side of Megadeth, you'll find something to enjoy, but even for a rock oriented Megadeth album this is below average.  I found 4 songs I like and 2 more ok ones and the sad thing is the songs I don't like over shadow the ones I do.  Seriously when I think of this album I think of the crappy banjo intro to Blackest crow and the stupid chorus to Burn and Dance in the rain.  In fact I should rate some of those songs lower than I did, and I shall change that now.  There are enough songs I like to justify a 3 star rating except the songs I don't enjoy, some of them are so bad they bring the overall enjoyment factor down.<br /><br />This isn't Megadeth's best, but I'm sure all the songs are up on youtube, so if you're a fan definitely check it out.  You can always buy the songs you like and eave the rest, which is what I should have done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Ok-- gorgeous scenery, that HOUSE!, the clothes, etc.make this show worth watching on those merits alone, but add a<br />Gripping storyline, characters who you really come to care about, and that makes it pretty much perfect! Hope it never ends!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|cannot evaluate as my Kindle has not received the book yet. I expect it to be the equal of his other books.
B009MYARIK|2.0|This is not Ms. Kinsella's best. The whole story line is totally preposterous. I was sadly disappointed. I cannot recommend it.
B004W1GCQO|2.0|This show seems to be an attempt to ride the coattails of Downton Abbey fame. The first episode is painfully slow. I understood the need to introduce and develop characters but I could barely force myself to finish the entire episode.
1616550414|5.0|This book is just what any Zelda fan will want to have. It has a lot of beautiful artwork and some information that you can only find in this book. The final touch with a manga at the end makes it just prefect for any follower of the saga that wants to get deeper into the story.

B00015YVD6|5.0|Trying to replace some of our older VHS movies with DVD or Blu-Ray when the price is right.  This was the right price and first quality.  Definitely not a pirated copy.!!!!!!  Still makes you smile after all this time....Tom Hanks....what a hunk he was back then!!

0812992792|1.0|the orphan master's son is an orphan of a novel.  i thought it was one of the worst books i have ever read.  i did not finish<br />reading the book -- it was such a horrible book.  the characters were thankfully most forgettable.  a good to great novel<br />should have both beauty and truth -- and neither were present in this sick book.  as for entertainment or educational value<br />this poor excuse for a novel is a big, fat ZERO.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Sort of leaves you hanging.  Quick read. I'm reading the last book in the series when I go on vacation.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this book. Well-written, and the characters continue to evolve. I only hope we do not have to wait long until the release of the next installation in this series. The ending leaves you wanting MORE!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series! I never re-read books no matter how amazing I think they are.  But this is a series that I have re-read, if for no other reason than to refresh when the next book comes out. And when the 4th book comes out, I'll skim through it again.<br />I find it a bit disappointing that other reviewers are claiming that Day is making the series longer for more money. And then they top off their accusations with a 1 star rating, not based on the quality of the book, but because they are all pissy that they have to buy another book. It's a series! Get over it! She announced a 4th and 5th book awhile ago.<br />You know that the writing is amazing, the characters are intriguing and the story overall is driven and captivating. I will absolutely buy the next in the series and recommend it. And you know what, all this people whining about the ending, they're gonna buy it too. Because its that freaking good and they won't be able to help themselves.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is greatly detailed and its a wonderful book for teens. It made me under stand more about cancer and love. I would highly recommend this book to my friends(: I cried so hard when Augustus died it's amazeballs and awesomesauce and I will definitely reread it(:
B008JJM88Q|4.0|This is great fun. One small bug I noticed on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 - the text of the questions it asks is not properly placed in the \\"text bubble\\" on the screen, making it hard to read. A small quibble though, this is a great and amazing time waster.
B00A0B0KFY|5.0|Enjoyed and learned a lot. Life changing book that should be mandatory reading early in life. Will be teaching my 3 children about this too.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|I have always liked crystal castles so after going to their concert i decided to go ahead and order all of their cds.  It did say that it would be shipped between the 7th and 21st of june but it arrived way way before then.
B005MLP71Y|2.0|The movie Bee Movie was too mature for children to understand. Though  the animation and storyline were good, I just do not think it makes it a movie to buy for kids. Especially the loose idea of a bee having a relationship with a human woman would leave children confuse about it. It's OK to watch though I recommend it for 10 12 year old or adults
B002APU580|4.0|I gave it four stars because of the last five minutes of the film, which was poetic and wonderfully romantic. The soundtrack  outstanding. The rest of the film would have been confusing had I not read the book and watched the BBC six hour mini-series.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I truly enjoyed the first two books and was anxious to read the third, and what was suppose to be the final book in the series. I was let down with this one and started skimming it half-way through. I never give out spoilers and I may be a minority with this review but for me, it was a whole lot of sex and not much of a story line. I'm good with steamy scenes but I expected more.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I saw this movie on itunes.  It was really exciting and dramatic.  Naturally, I had to have my own copy of it, so I purchased it.  No problems with the dvd.  It was in excellent condition.
0385344228|5.0|I just finished reading, Defending Jacob and I am speechless. This book will stick with for a very long time. I am emotionally drained after reading this book but it was absolutely brilliant and if you love a good psychological/legal/thriller/mystery, this book is for you.
B00BAYLQI0|3.0|I write this, as with all of my reviews, in reference to the survival aspects of the movie, not the motives of the movie-makers, the validity of information about the actual event or the fact that the movie was focused on one family when hundreds of thousands of locals had tragically died.  The Boxing Day Tsunami was without a doubt a horrific event and a show of force from Mother Nature.<br /><br />The movie, The Impossible, for me displays the overall understanding of emotions overpowering logic and takes you deep in to how life can suddenly be changed without warning and the comforts of technology and basic necessities removed.  In one scene (I won't spoil) a very silly decision was made due to over-riding emotions which could have possibly lead to more tragedy, it's easy to pick up when it does happen.  Family values, love & being loved are shown and make for an emotional yet frustrating journey as we watch a family struggle through tragedy when everything had seemed to be perfect only moments before.  Overall this movie depicts an inspiring story of family love, tenacity, togetherness and the need to have life values close at heart in order to overcome great adversity.<br /><br />As for the event itself, there really wasn't much that could have been done to avoid this catastrophe from taking so many people's lives, and all that could be done is push on for those who survived.  My thoughts remain with those who lost family members and friends and I hope to never hear of so many people losing their lives in such a short span of time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Crazy, torrid love rocks..  I am downloading the next book now.  This story is such a dynamic thing that I am completely invested...  Not 50 shades but just as good to me
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is really fun but it is kind of inapropreate.<br />In Forest the knocking down trees is kind of dumb.<br />but it is very addicting.<br />And it seems popular.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I can't believe the book ended like that. Although I was happy that the story will continue. After all the drama and everything going on, it just abruptly ended. Hopefully the next book comes out soon and is less expensive.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|One of the Best shows ever created by Starz! Anyone who likes gladiator would love this show. Definitely best graphics too!!!
0553386794|4.0|Let's get this out of the way right now.  No, I haven't watched the show.  A friend of mine loaned this to me and told me that I would like it.  And boy was he right!<br /><br />It's really hard to know where to start with this review because the book was just so long and the story was just so intense and engaging, but I'll do my best here!  Also I normally do a little recap of the storyline but honestly this book is just so long and there are just so many characters that I can't really pull that off with this book.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Okay so the book mainly follows two major families in this world, the Lannisters and the Starks.  (No, not Tony Stark, but trust me, these characters are just as good!).  The Starks are led by Ned Stark and the story follows him and his children, all of whom are very interesting to read about.  Well except for Sansa whom I just wanna punch in the face repeatedly for being so naïve and annoying!  What's interesting is that halfway through the book you think the entire series is going to concentrate on Ned, but he ends up being killed by a usurper to the throne.  So the character that we were all invested in as our main character is suddenly gone and we are left following the exploits of his children and the manipulative power hungry jerkwads of House Lannister.<br /><br />My favorite character has to be Jon Snow, Ned's son that he had out of wedlock while he was off at war or on an adventure, I can't remember which.  Jon is the black sheep of the family and he decides it is best for him to go north and pledge his eternal service to a group called \\"The Night Watch,\\" that guards a wall that is several hundred feet high that keeps something unknown from entering the lands to the south.  This really has me interested!  I want to know what is beyond that wall!  You don't just build a huge wall like that and put towers and fortresses all along it for no reason!  There has to be something huge and evil beyond it and I'm anxious to find out what it is!<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks to the book.  Number one, it's just TOO long!  It's over 800 pages and sometimes it can really drag in places and the dialogue can get a vulgar at times.  Seriously, very often they talk about cutting off men's *ahem* you-know-whats and feeding them to animals.  Also the phrase \\"truth be told,\\" is overused in this book as well.  Once in a while it would be good to change it up just a little bit.<br /><br />Another thing that is a drawback is that there are just too many characters to keep track of sometimes.  But the author made up for this by putting a list of characters and the different houses they belong to and little character descriptions of every character in the back of the book.  So it's a little easier for the reader to keep track of who everyone is.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />Okay this book was great!  It may be long, but it is worth it in the end.  The characters are awesome (Except Sansa), the story is engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat eager to find out what happens next.  I'm sure the show on HBO is good, but I'm gonna stick with the books because I doubt the show can be as good as these books are!and evil beyond it and I'm anxious to find out what it is!<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks to the book.

B00B2DGYQS|5.0|One has to see the first of these two films, Yossi & Jagger, in order to comprehend what is being said in this second film, Yossi. For me, the first film was a real emotional wrenching story.  I do not know how to rationately describe the second film, except to say Yossi is a very beautiful love story.  It proves the love, tru-love, will find its way no matter what the circumstances.  NJMJr!

The reproductions are decent but perhaps a bit soft compared to actual prints which to me seem to have more contrast and depth. Terrific book for the price
B00CL50LEC|4.0|I found this movie original and high quality ,especially for a romcom.It would definitely be recommendable.Teresa Palmer and Nicholas Hoult were outstanding!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|one star (should have been 4) deducted for scary permissions. i know i shouldn't have even downloaded this app because of that. but curiosity got the better of me. and i can't believe it? even though i had to answer &quot;don't know&quot; to three of the questions, it still correctly guessed hugo chavez. it also correctly guessed buffy and willow, both from buffy the vampire slayer. a human could never do so well. it's going to be fun trying to stump this thing. this will be really fun to share with friends, so as long as it doesn't stop working or mess up my kindle, i'm keeping it.
0679805273|5.0|I bought two - one for each child to have so that their teachers can write a sentiment in it at the end of the school year - words of inspiration to guide them and help them see their goals achieved at the end of their schooling - my youngest sons first teacher has already inscribed it for him - great idea to keep up and let them see how many were educators and mentors were an influence in their lives - great keepsake.

B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|I loved all the Sookie Stackhouse books and was shocked and a little excited to hear the last one was out. I found this book very different from the rest of the series. It had a kind of build up like the others but fizzled at the end. It read like the Charlaine Harris got tired of writing the series and just wanted to end it..... regardless of how it ended, which I thought was a bitter disappointment. The book felt rushed, especially more towards the end and left alot of new loose ends. I was shocked considering how much I loved all the other books. The author should have taken the time to write the end book better, or not bothered to end it.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I can not wait for the next  book.  It really holds your interest.  You never are sure which direction the novel will go.

0061692034|1.0|I have read The Odyssey, James Joyce's Ulysses, War and Peace, and Infinite Jest, but this book brought me to my knees crying \\"Uncle.\\" As I started off, the story seemed promising, although slow. The descriptions were evocative and I felt for the main character, Dell, and wanted to see what happened to him. However, as time passed, description began to be all there was. Mercifully, most chapters were brief - possibly this is what kept me going through endless description of landscape and the light in a bedroom and people sleeping. Ford does create a vivid image of a family isolated not just from the community but also from each other. However, as some other reviewers have pointed out, does he need to take this long to tell it? Just when it seemed like something was finally about to happen (SPOILER), we hit \\"Part 2\\" and I emitted an audible groan. The novel enters a new, even more depressing setting with young Dell packed off to nowhere to live among disturbing freaks in squalor. At this point the barely-existent dialogue dropped off to almost nothing, and the description hit overload. When Ford embarked on a pages-long description of what Dell's mysterious uncle has in his closet, I bailed. Let me say that 1) description, especially of landscape, isn't my cup of tea and 2) I like books that focus on social interactions among humans, preferably of both sexes. This book had tons of (1) and nearly none of (2.) Kind of turned into the print equivalent of watching a black-and-white Western in which everyone's creepy and the Sheriff never does anything but scuff his boot on the dirt and walk around town...real.....slow. If you would find that enjoyable, go for it! P.S. I was horribly bothered by the twin sister's lack of caring about her brother. This just didn't ring true as someone who knows more than one set of twins.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was a good game to play if you have lots of time on your hands with your family and friends at home
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was very disappointing considering it is from an established author with a publisher. This is something I would expect to pay $.99 for from a self published author. Not only was the book expensive but it was complete crap! I cannot believe a successful, established and anticipated author would put their name to this garbage. Below are just a few reasons why but I could have gone on for pages!<br /><br />After three books we all get it, E + G have great sex, so why keep dragging it out. Yeah, it's a romance so I expect some sex but really the first half of the book was nothing but sex, there was no story or plot development at all.<br /><br />Then, once you finally get to some plot it was all over the place. She introduced way too many story lines that are completely irrelevant. Not that I don't care about the other characters but the main focus of the novel should be E + G and she really loses sight of that in this book. There wasn't much in this story that added to Eva and Gideon's relationship and what little there was was horribly done. The whole second half of the book was about everyone else's drama. No one cares about Corinne. That was the worst filler possible and shouldn't have been in there at all. SPOILER: Why would they have the whole part of him getting arrested only to have him fly to Cali to save her from a sex tape scandal? SO STUPID!<br /><br />Did anyone else get tired of the constant \\"I love you\\", \\"You're mine\\", \\"I need you crap\\"?? I mean we get it!! He killed for her, I think he has established he loves you, Eva. Sylvia turned her into such a desperate and needy character which she was a little before but it  was way worse in this book.<br /><br />I'm sad to be giving it one star because I was expecting something epic but this was a complete and total fail!
B002JXK5VU|4.0|I like the concept of the show and the introduction of new characters every week with new &#34;specialties&#34;.  It's fun speculating what the writers of the show will come up with next.  I really enjoy it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a great book. I was surprised at the ending and how it all turned out. It kept my attention and clearly had some interesting twists in the story line. I was a little frustrated at the whole triangle of characters, not knowing who I wanted to be the hero. All in all this was a good adventure it and was quite fascinating to explore each of the characters.
B008EKMB82|4.0|Have not finished this.  It is obviously quite good. I have to get back to this book as time allows.
B005ZMUTZ4|4.0|It was my 1st purchase for my 3yr old's kindle. Great movie but I'm used to appl products and I didn't know it doesn't automatically download when you but it. You have to do it after your purchase is complete.... Wish I knew this before our road trip!
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Must have been my daughter who ordered this.  I will ask her what she thought and let you guys know.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Did I wish the story ended with this book? Yep, sure did. Will I buy books 4 and 5? Yep, sure will.<br /><br />Even though we the readers BUY the books, the characters (Gideon and Eva) are not OURS.  They tell their story to Ms. Day and she writes it down to share with us.  Just 'cause you don't like that the story didn't end at 3, doesn't mean you shred her in reviews.<br /><br />Eva hasn't changed!! She's still selfish and dishonest about how she feels (she reminds me a lot of Kiera in Thoughless, Gideon is still tormented and obsessed, Cary (rolls eyes), Corrine is there for the sake of drama and someone still needs to bitch slap both Gideon and Eva'a mothers.

0425263924|1.0|Trilogy no more.  Sylvia Day has sold herself and this once beautiful romance to her new publisher.  The story should have ended with this book, as planned all along. But no, it is now a five book series.<br /><br />Lets face it .... It's a money grab.  Five books at $9.99 sound better than three books at $9.99. Who cares if it ruins the story line.  Clearly Sylvia Day doesn't.  And of course the publisher wouldn't either.  When it becomes about money and not the work of art, a book is not worth reading anymore.<br /><br />I have just returned mine for a refund.<br /><br />I'm disappointed not only in Sylvia Day for unnecessarily stretching out the story line, but also for ruining the characters by doing so.  I loved Eva an Cary from the start. This book has turned them into childish and ungrateful characters.  I also don't want to know any more about Corinne and her husband, Megumi and her sudden illness, and so on...<br /><br />Gideon is the only character holding up.  But given that the fourth book will be a filler too, leading up to book five, Sylvia Day will probably manage to ruin him as well.  I won't be reading book four or five to find out.  I might as well save my hard earned money and disappointment.<br /><br />Shame on you, Sylvia Day, for ruining this once beautiful story solely for financial gain.

0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg's book \\"Lean In\\" is a great read for any woman or man. Seriously, whether you manage a family, a company, both or neither, this book contains many valuable life lessons about how to work with others in ways that benefit everyone.<br /><br />The book contains many poignant anecdotes and quotes, but the prevalent theme I believe can be summed up in an Alice Walker quote early in the book, \\"The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.\\" Despite the fact that Sandberg wrote this book focused towards and about women, this theme is one all of us would do well to take to heart. And not just in the first person but also from a third person perspective. Ask yourself, 'How can I help [name] recognize she/he has the power?'<br /><br />Another primary theme throughout the book is communication. Sandberg's statement of the obvious makes a strong case for open communication, \\"We cannot change what we are unaware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change.\\" In Sandberg's plea for women to \\"lean in\\" and \\"sit at the table\\" referencing the title of the book, she says, \\"We need to talk and listen and debate and refute and instruct and learn and evolve.\\" As a man, the lesson I take away is to always be conscious to invite the right people to the table without letting bias of any sort get in the way and to make sure communication is open and not `too late'.<br /><br />My 93 yr old grandmother gave me one word of advice \\"empathy\\" last weekend when I asked how she has managed to get along with so many different personalities, nationalities, roles and of course both genders over the years. Sandberg echoes the same sentiment throughout her book. She writes, \\"To really care about others, we have to understand them - what they like and dislike, what they feel as well as think.\\" And, \\"Be aware of how you think and treat others and give everyone, especially women who often miss out, the 'benefit of the doubt'\\". Empathy is certainly something I hope I'll be able to recognize when looking back on my life at age 93.<br /><br />On the topic of whether to stay home for family or pursue a corporate career, I love Sandberg's definition of success, \\"success is making the best choices we can...and accepting them.\\" Not only her words, but the life she lives is an example of how it's vitally important to \\"make room for both life and work.\\" She doesn't recommend one way or the other as better, only that you should never feel (or let others make you feel) guilty about the choices you make.<br /><br />Finally, as many critics will have you believe, the most divisive theme of the book is feminism... However, the definition used in a US survey Sandberg quotes is, \\"A feminist is someone who believes in social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.\\" Guess that makes me a feminist.something I hope I'll be able to recognize when looking back on my life at age 93.<br /><br />On the topic of whether to stay home for family or pursue a corporate career, I love Sandberg's definition of success, \\"success is making the best choices we can...and accepting them.\\" Not only her words, but the life she lives is an example of how it's vitally important to \\"make room for both life and work.\\" She doesn't recommend one way or the other as better, only that you should never feel (or let others make you feel) guilty about the choices you make.<br /><br />Finally, as many critics will have you believe, the most divisive theme of the book is feminism...

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book was a let down.  I have waited months for the release of Entwined to you only to be disappointed.  Sylvia Day needs to stop drawing out what was supposed to be a trilogy the ending is very disappointing.  Although I enjoyed the book the ending just left you hanging, who ends a book like that.  I am not sure if Sylvia Day is doing this just to make more money off of this series but she is leaving her readers very disappointed.  Signed one disappointed fan.

It was a blast to see how much technology and movie-making has actually changed, and I still enjoyed it a great deal.  There were many aspects I found very similar to the Terminator series of movies--with the robots having a mind of their own and trying to kill all of the humans.  I pictured James Cameron watching this movie long ago and giving him a lot of ideas for his Terminator movies.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After reading the first two books in this series, I can't believe that SD decided to insult her new fans with her lattest installment. Honestly, most of this book kept the various characters (including the main ones) running in place making little to no progress. Eva still running around with everyone else telling her what's going on after the fact. Cary doing his usual self destruction. Eva's mother still stalking her…with Stanton (the powerful male). unable to help curb/manage her inappropriate behavior. Dropping various characters around the book like Megumi and the rest of the lot of like characters exapanding them with little or no reason to the overall storyline. The character development or lack thereof with the  main couple leaves this book with no storyline movement. The first two books in the series set this book up for the potential and powerful opportunity to make the main characters gel into something special. Instead, the author spent a lot of time muddying the plot unnecessarily.EXTREMELY  DISAPPOINTED that a wrter that could produce such great character in the last two books decided to make them and the book so diminished. I don't think SD deserves the honor of having her poor fans of this series spend their hard erned dollars buying two more books to find out if anything is really going to actually happen. Nothing happened in thisone except the main characters got hitched…and then not on halfwy solid ground. I've never read something where everyone is so cripplingy co-dependent. I've read thousands of book (a lot of them not perfect), but at least they went somewhere in the end. I haven't reviwed a single book until this one. Why? Because Ms. Day is taking advantage of her readers by needlessly dragging out the story of these characters in an obvious attempt to sell more books…when she could come up with a new story with more merit, less insult to our collective intelligence, and we could read those books instead given that they would have deveoped characters and meaningful plot movement. HOPEFULLY! HONESTLY DON'T BOTHER SPENDING YOUR MOBEY ON THIS BOOK… THE NEXT ONE COULD START YOU OFF IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE LAST.

B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|So many actors reach a certain level of success, then make some movie dear to their heart just because they can - not because there's any great merit in the script itself. I think this is one.<br /><br />It starts with all kinds of great pieces - son struggling to meet father's unrealistic expectations, danger-laden trek across unforgiving landscape, great acts of bravery, victory in the end. Somehow, though the two-actor format (the few other humans are really just props) turns a 100km trek into something claustrophobic. Then, Will Smith tries to channel his inner Laurence Fishburne, forgetting that Fishburne already does the job much better. Then there's the family relationship built around chain of command - trust me, this has more weirdness than even this flick can show. Then there's the whole notion of what 'fear' is and what purpose it serves. I've had my share, and find it to be a great way of focusing one's attention just when it's needed most.<br /><br />Oh, it has its moments, like that wing-suited base jump. But a good movie is more than moments. Smith senior is a grownup and can do what he wants with his career. For Jaden: \\"Good judgement comes from experience; experience comes from bad judgement.\\" I hope he can brush this off as a youthful indiscretion and find future success anyway.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0956251579|5.0|It's a captivating, pycho-thriller that's dark and creepy. Into the Darkest Corner is my first Elizabeth Haynes novel and it won't be my last. The story of an abusive relationship takes its time being told. Its page turning, suspenseful and an emotional rollercoaster with a bit of romance. Talk about a Fatal Attraction! Just like the movie with the same name, this story snags you and reels you in.<br /><br />You're wondering how a story of domestic violence can be a good story? Sure it had its gritty horrific parts, both mental and physical but the satisfaction comes with hoping the heroine beats back her demons and finds hope and healing and comes out on the other side. OK sure, then there's the part about the clever villain, one messed up creepy dude. You just can't wait for the clever creepy bastard to get what he deserves. :D<br /><br />When fun, outgoing Cathy Bailey meets Lee Brightman, she can't believe her luck. He's incredibly handsome, built and charming with a bit of a mysterious vibe. Lee's overwhelming instant attraction to Cathy is almost too good to be true. Cathy's ego gets a boost with all the attention and great sex from such a gorgeous guy. Then this casual fun relationship turns suffocating and Lee's behavior turn erratic. The stalking begins and builds until Lee reveals himself to be a manipulative, abusive control freak flying into fits of raging jealousy with violent repercussions. Cathy asks her friends for support but she's shocked to find they don't believe her, after all they claim \\"Lee's so charming and the best looking guy she's ever met\\" (Note to Cathy...lose the friends). They think she's the problem. To make matters worse...there's Lee's occupation. With nowhere to turn, Cathy slowly starts to withdraw and this only helps Lee's plan to isolate Cathy so that he's her world. Fear, worry and desperation lead Cathy to formulate her escape from this nut job.<br /><br />It's now 3 years later, Lee's in prison and Cathy's residual trauma atthe hands of Lee have left its lingering scars. Cathy life is a psychological mess...near debilitating panic attacks, OCD and PSTD. Cathy is trying to start a new life in a new city and heal from the trauma of her past. Fortunately for Cathy, a new upstairs neighbor, Stuart Richardson, a psychologist moves in. Cathy slowly accepts Stuart's friendship and he encourages her to seek the help she so desperate needs to confront her fears. Stuart also sparks an unexpected hope and the possibility of love and a normal life.<br /><br />The story is told with concurrent time lines in alternating chapters in first person POV. One starts at the beginning of Lee and Lee/Cathy's developing relationship (2003-2004). The other (2007-2008) Cathy's current life. Lee's due out of prison soon and the suspense waiting for both stories to slowly evolve then meet and collide was brilliant. I liked the idea of the alternating chapters, just be aware of the dates at the beginning of each chapter.<br /><br />Thought the author portrayed the emotional, mental and physical abuse along with the mind games used to intimidate, scare and punish the victim realistic in my opinion. I wanted to scream \\"RUN\\" the first time Lee pulled a Mr. Bizarro on poor unsuspecting Cathy. Later I couldn't wait for Cathy to find some relief and heal. Talk about what doesn't kill you makes you stronger - literally...it's just a slow process.<br /><br />There was just the briefest of moments when I had a flash of \\"oh please Elizabeth Haynes, don't be messing with me\\". Were Cathy's mounting fears that Lee was back and messing with her mind real or might these fears be imagined? Such a cleaver author...a mind screw of the best kind.<br /><br />Like a rollercoaster ride. ...you know you're gonna be scared but aww the thrill was worth it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love the way the two main characters interact with each other!! Waiting eagerly for the next season, which seems to be delayed...
B0044C5SCU|4.0|good plots, though a little predictable at times always well played. so yeah, I like it so will you. too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. I read each of the books in under two days. I was completely hooked! I can't wait to see what she does with this series next :)
0679805273|5.0|I always write a note in the inside blank page for the graduate.  I'm not sure how many of these books they get but its my standard.  They can return the ones without the writing :-)
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I have watched season 1 and most of season 2 so far.  I really like some of the characters and the way they interplay, especially Tripp and the doctor.  I think it is funny how Tripp and T'Pol are such opposites and T'Pol gets under his skin!  At first I didn't like Scott Bakula as the captain, but he his growing on me.  His simple, almost cowboy responses have a human quality to them that would be very realistic for the first captain of the first warp 5 starship.  I think Enterprise NX-01 is a really cool design.  The sets have a metallic quality to them that seems to be more realistic than the stark white or beige of some of the other starships.  Weapon systems are cool as well.  This series has some excellent special effects shots often reserved for the big screen.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Josh Homme does it again. Another great grunge rock effort to keep the sound alive. A must have for rock fans!!
B002SKDGRE|4.0|Informative and accessible, although not belle lettre, by any means.<br /><br />Beyond the dazzle dazzle of success and controversy, touches on some very fundamental issues at the intersection of international politics and trade - the eternal source of complexity that has plagued traders from the time international borders appeared - but does not quite reach that far back into history and philosophy of the trade (which might have been too preachy anyway).<br /><br />Nicely puts the Marc Rich controversy into larger context, only slightly skirting outside the bounds of neutrality into apologism.<br /><br />The insight into the spot oil market created by Rich is interesting for this novice.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Good action flick, but I like the Jack Reacher character in the books much better.  I personally think they should've chose someone other than Tom Cruise for the main role.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|i love this app! i can play it for hours and the puzzles are so fun to figure out. It gets a little harder each time and new monsters are introduced that do different things (e.g. sleep, they all move the same way, slime, etc.). the trick is to figure out the puzzle using the monsters they give you. sometimes its a challenge!!!! only downside is you have to pay if you want a hint, but if you are persistent and creative you never should have to purchase hints.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Best opening scene ever! I loved this film and the new James Bond; Craig is absolute perfection. It has a great balance between the action and the humanity that is the new 007.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have been waiting to read this book for over 6 months.  I downloaded it and began reading.  Similar to the previous books.  I found myself wanting to get to the ending and have things settle for them.  Much to my disappointment, the author's note at the end leads to more to come.  I hope that this time, the release date does not get pushed back numerous times.  I also hope that an end is in sight for Eva and Gideon.
B004NEY9EW|4.0|I still love Daniel Craig as Bond.This film could have shown a bit more suave with fewer action hero antics.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|its a fun game, the guy runs out of energy way to fast and you have to purchase more. Now it wont even let me open it. Any suggestions? andy.arnold1450@gmail.com
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Great cast and Mr Craig has really hit his stride. 007 and M are more fully fleshed out with this storyline about their pasts. I also love the new Q and Moneypenny.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|Just hated so much,why it is listed under comedy,I have 2 years old,why this junk rated so high?never trust reviews,
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|good show, lots of fun to watch! i think that christopher eccleston is a great doctor and rose is great too
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great... GREAT price, and it has all you (I) could need. Once it is filled up with stuff you are looking at dragging 25+ lb around
0545265355|5.0|Good item! Box looks sturdy and books fit nicely in the set box. Bout this box set as a present!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I would really love it if I could get real people to play  with me. Even so I get 5. New games every week. Yahoo.
B001NA6096|1.0|... in short, I don't know why anyone would like this, much less watch the other two movies in the series.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|Not usually a fan of rock bands with female lead singers, but I saw Halestorm in concert and they put on a great show.  This CD is really good with a good mix of songs.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I'm a huge Staley fan and this was a huge collection of wonderful Mas Season ! I especially loved the video amazing !!!
B0090EIILU|1.0|I couldn't even watch it to the end.  That's how extremely tasteless the movie was.  Banned really should be inforced!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|A friend of mine got me hooked on this series.  At first I thought it was a little too violent for me.  But after really getting into the story lines, and fetting to know the characters, I was hooked.  Each season gets a little better than the last.  Always a twist and turn to keep you coming back for more.  Can't wait to start the next season!!
B000059MEK|5.0|If anyone is new to Daft Punk, I would strongly consider buying this album.  I've been a fan of DP since this came out back in 2001.  Even after buying their first and consecutive ones, I still think that this is their best.  From start to finish, I hear absolutely no imperfections.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am so thankful for the direction Ms Day went for this third book. Eva and Gideon are being mature and not running hot and cold about their relationship. I like that they are thinking like a team. This is a great addition to this series and a must read.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|It is great! I love it! I would recommend this product to everybody to buy! I love the show and it allows me to re-watch the show over and over again!
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Great movie,very inspiring and a true story!! Truly shows how focus and commitment,along with good mentorship,can change your life!! Loved it!!!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I give this movie four stars.<br /><br />It had a good plot and was good on action.<br /><br />heart broken when he smashed the chevy<br /><br />;'(
B00BF123WG|5.0|This is a must see movie.  There wasn't a dull part of this movie, it was very exciting to watch.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|In the long anticipated(at least by me) 3rd installment of the Crossfire series we finally get to see how Eva and Gideon move forward with their relationship and i have to say i have mixed feelings about it; I LOVE these books it has been an emotional rollercoaster seeing how two severely emotionally scarred individuals pour their hearts into being together, I really see this as true love in a kind of twisted way.<br />That being said......Seriously??!!! Another cliffhanger???!!!! This was supossed to be a trilogy!!!! I dont know if i can take more waiting for the next book..That is the reason i did not give a five star rating. Also the last few chapters felt like filler chapters, in some instances they had nothing to do with moving the story forward, what was their point??<br />Of course i will read the next book and I still love Silvya Day`writing style, and i am looking forward to the conclusion of this wonderful story
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The story expands some more in this third book.  It has some shocking sequences and great elements.  With so many story lines though it can sometimes seem a long time to get back to one of your favorite point of view characters.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|Favorite Phoenix album, better than Wolfgang. Chloroform, The Real Thing, Trying to be cool, and Bourgious are the best tracks.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Steal Like an Artist is a short, illustrated, book that serves as a helpful reminder to creatives about what matters most. A check list, if you will, for focus within the world of making art - a world that can often pull us in different directions. The book is riddled with timely quotes that support Kleon's points and will serve as a helpful reference when I'm in need of some encouragement and clarity while in the thick of a project.
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|I am an avid Star Trek fan. I am not sure I would have watched the rest of the series if this was the only movie they had made. Watch the rest of the movie series into the Next Generation. You won't be disappointed.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|It's exactly what I need and it's always handy. There are no problems with the app btw. Well that's pretty much it. 'Nuff said.
B0094K20FK|5.0|This is infinitely better than the first. Good story line. Better acting. Keep watching the movie series. Watch the series Enterprise too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Although this book may have come out a few years before I was born, I believe this book has become a culture keystone that all can benefit from reading.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Let me preface by saying I too was disappointed, irritated, and extremely frustrated when I realized that at 94% NO WAY could this book wrap up all the story lines but after taking a moment, reading the statement released by Ms. Day I have had a chance to calm down and am now able to review the book based on its' merits NOT on the ending. In saying this I believe it was a well-written, sometimes extremely HOT...continuation of Gideon and Eva. As much as I want an ending AND for it to be a HEA I also want ALL the plots COMPLETELY tied up! I don't want any loose ends or any hurried endings. BUT 2 more books does seem like a bit much but I'm invested in not only E & G but also Cary and Victor and I so WANT Monica to get her comeuppance even if she is Eva's mother. She is WAY more than I can tolerate. At this point in the story I'm not even sure how Eva even speaks to her.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book. I didn't feel like it dragged or there was \\"too\\" much filler. I didn't skim even one page (which is saying something for me because I absolutely abhor pages and pages describing a room, house, etc.) I thought the s*x was still very very hot! I liked the foundations of friendship being built between Eva and Megumi; Eva and Shawna as well as her relationship with Steven and Mark. If you'll remember Eva hasn't really \\"had\\" any type of friendships besides Cary so this is a HUGE yet small piece in the story.<br /><br />There are SO MANY people who still deserve  a severe \\"dressing down\\" from Eva in regards to their treatment of Gideon examples, his mother, Christopher Sr and Jr, Deanna, Corinne!!!!, Dr. Lucas, his wife and so on and so forth so book 4 & 5 should give ample opportunity for some big dialogues with these people and a cat fight would totally be in line with my thought process! In ending my review I want to touch on Eva's \\"attraction\\" to Brett... it's completely normal. She used to have this HUGE crush on him and he wasn't seemingly that \\"in\\" to her so now he is...How can she not feel drawn. Keep in mind, she doesn't act on it and Brett is a complete neanderthal for continuing to push the issue. AND the video completely tasteless! But it's a book...who could put up with all this drama IRL! For sure, we would all totally stroke out!<br /><br />4 / 4.5 stars because although I'm not thrilled to purchase 2 more $10 books just to find out what happens, I am thrilled to actually SEE the healing process taking place in Gideon and Eva. Let's just hope that Eva matures a little as the story moves along.<br /><br />So kudos to you Sylvia Day...I have not lost interest!
0345803485|5.0|I was given  the book as a gift and loved it so I decided to purchase it as a gift for someone else.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|This was a great movie - I'm waiting to hear if there will be a Salt two (2) - at least it gave you that impression.
031603441X|5.0|Riveting, must-read for any Stones or rock history fan. Terrific human-interest insights into how it all went down and the players involved. Takes you &#34;inside, up-close and personal&#34; to one of the most complex personalities ever. Has a great seldom-seen photo section.  Don't miss this one, folks.
0811828697|5.0|Great condition. Exactly as described. Fast shipping, excellent seller a pleasure doing business with you! As an avid star wars fan my son was thrilled with this gift.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What can I say Eva and Gideons story is timeless. It gets better and better with each book and find out there's to be a fourth and fifth book I'm just so happy jumping up and down with joy. If you haven't read the crossfire series I recommend you do your missing out if you haven't read them the you should this series gets better and better with each book its sexy as hell and has all the Spice and sizzling you could want in a book.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|A long book, but entertaining , none the less. It was interesting to read about WW1 from this perspective. The characters were well presented.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series keeps you interested in moral issues so diminished in our time. Good to see it, I´ve only watched 10 chapters and is good.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This was originally billed as a trilogy, but after reading Entwined with You discovered that it will now extend over at least another book.  I'm getting very tired of the authors that drag out stories across multiple books with long delays between.
0812550706|5.0|This book is all that I thought it would be...great read and I can't wait to read more from author!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Are you kidding.....it's the original Star Trek...how can it be anything other than a 5!!!!!!!  It will be forever popular for generations to come
B00CHILW64|5.0|Loved it! Great movie.  Well filmed and acted.  See the impossible, but bring your hankey,it is a tear jerker.  A
0142001104|5.0|The Zanders' have written THE definitive book on moving from a mentality of scarcity and constant measurement–mindsets which inevitably lead to disappointment, bitterness, resentfulness, jealousy, depression, etc–and show the reader how to move to the mindset of a world in which infinite possibilities exist! You MUST read this book.... as many times as possible. Yes, it is really that good!
B000OJFV4C|4.0|Looking forward to the next season! Nothing on the TV comes as close to entertaining as this. And no advertisements!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such an unsuspecting surprise close to season finale.  Couldn't stop watching.  Had to keep watching to see what happen next.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is the story we've all been waiting for and it doesn't disappoint.  It's the best of the series so far, hands down.
B004FWPK7M|4.0|I have seen this movie several times over the years.  It is so funny!!  Goldie is perfect for this part.  So sweet and innocent.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed Gideon & Ava's latest installment.  I am happy that their story is going to continue.  I hope that we do not have to wait as long for the next one.  This one took forever to release.  I understand that publishers want to draw out the release to hype the book for more sales, but at some point you lose readers who get tired of waiting.  This one was too long a wait in my opinion.  However, I did enjoy the return of Brett.  I hope to see some more of him in the next book.  I love Cary.  I am not thrilled with the plot twist surrounding him though.  I love angst as much as the next person, but I am not thrilled with this development.  I enjoyed the character development with Angus and Clancy.  I look forward to more of them in the next book.  Mrs. Stanton is as crazy as ever...not sure what I would do with that much crazy! LOL.  I was surprised by the development of Elizabeth Vidal in this book.  She didn't seem as classy as she did in the last couple.  Deanna, the reporter, is a snake.  I am enjoying the angst that she brings to the book, but am a little worried where her character is going and what she will bring to the next book.  I was floored by the Victor Reyes development with Monica.<br /><br />Over all I am impressed with this book.  I won't start again the timing.  I know that my review is all over the place, but I am so jumbled after finishing the book and my emotions are running high from the story.  Can't wait for the next one.  I will be buying it for sure!<br /><br />**** I also want to say that if you haven't read the book, you have no right to review it!  If you decided to return it or not buy it based on what others said...I say to you...THINK FOR YOURSELF!  If you decide you don't like it, that is your deal own it, but if you never read it, keep your opinion to your self because it has no value here as a review!  Whew...I feel better now!****
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game has not ceased to be entertaining. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my parents and they fell in love with it. I first was introduced to this game from a friend and I am glad he did. It is a game that requires strategy and a little bit of luck. It is not hard to pick up at all either. This is a good game.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game! eat everything that seems to annoy real sharks like pellicans. fish. other sharks. &amp; people. I so love ambushing boats!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Did the same author write this book? I think I wanted to throw my Kindle out the window 20 different times. Eva was a completely different person. It got to the point where I wanted Gideon to leave her because he deserves better than how she was treating him. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that I am finished this author. These books were marketed as a trilogy and it comes to the last page and we find out there will be 2 more books. Clearly the publisher and author are trying to get all the money they can. I looked at the author's website and she is claiming that she wouldn't make any more money than if she left it at 3 books. Really?? Fans will be paying an additional $19.98 for two more books and you won't make a cent; yes, I don't believe that either. I hope other authors realize the backlash this is getting, so this doesn't happen again.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Very good story, even believable, so I won't ruin the plot. Excellent casting, directing could have been better. I recommend first-time-viewing in Hi-Def.
B001AFF25W|5.0|Great concepts and definitely with the read!<br /><br />Can immediately put concepts in action and see results quickly.<br /><br />Sometimes just need to hear / read things like this to jump start motivation
B0057F869U|5.0|its an Amazing story !  ! !<br />Respect for the character Jane Eyre !  !  ! bought the dvd so that I will watch it again! :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Made me want to buy the third book and keep reading to see what would happen to characters next, I loved it, true page turner.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Good product, works well, it cut the glass nicely on the first try just a little sanding needed to finish it... Just have to be crafty now!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So tell me when did a trilogy turn into five ?  Book total waste of time,  meaningless ending, dull story line when it need not be.  Felt the book was written to draw out the story to fill the next two.  Well I am done, will not be reading the ending stories.  Fool me once, its OK, fool twice, not a chance.  I review all books now and once I know it's a series, I move onto the next author for exactly this reason.  Shame on the author.
B009KUANWG|5.0|Adele really nailed it with this one. I've been listening to this track on loop for a few days and I get chills every time. Her voice is gorgeous and I love the orchestration.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The plot keeps you guessing and takes your down several roads.  It has a surprise ending that i wouldn't have guessed.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Just got this as FAOTD and have done 2 so far and it got it dead on...no idea how it works but this is an awesome crazy fun app!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Hats off to Sylvia Day!  You did it again...I absolutely LOVED this book! AND TALK ABOUT HOT! You made my favorite couple even more intriguing!! I'm so thrilled to learn there are two more books to follow in this series!  One can never have enough Gideon Cross!! Can Not wait to what's in store for these two.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|My old lady fought me not wanting a Tom cruise movie. I told her his personal life did not matter. I wanted a sniper movie and action. I did not get it there was some twists and turns in the plot and a few action scenes. But it was filled with long boring lulls in the story.
B0053O89JM|5.0|&#34;Amazon has done it again. This is by far, the BEST money can buy. Don't get any other brand if you want quality at a great price. These things are very well packaged, affordable, and look/sound great when used. The build quality is amazing.&#34;
B008C20TDG|5.0|Full of useful and sensible information. I can't put it down...mostly because it teaches so much that I didn't know.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|You think you know...  Thanks to these investigative reporters, the public can see a whole different side of what really goes on with what matters to us most.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|By this point, anyone looking at these reviews probably only wants to know if the transfer and sound are good or not.  My 1080p view was fine.  Watched through a Roku3.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|gotta give this one a 5 star rating kind of game.  its complicated and simple at the same time but it is almost guaranteed to have your attention for awhile.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|The 1080p feed was fine.  Had a good connection, and no dropouts.  Sound quality was good as well.  No complaints, especially if you're Amazon Prime and it cost nothing extra.
B000022TSW|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of the show! Heck I even got my 80 year old grandfather HOOKED on the show! When I told him they made a movie he MADE me get it and I swear I have never seen him laugh harder. We share the same birthday and he is always joshing with me about crashing his 49th birthday party.  After watching this movie he told me he forgives me for doing that...only took 31 years but South Park helped bring a family together....;)
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Octavarium as a song is enough to give this album 4 stars. A fifth star would be awarded if the other songs lived up to its greatness. Panic Attack is great, and The Answer Lies Within is fun, but the rest of the album just sort of fell flat to me. Sort of Like Rush's 2112. While The song itself is fantastic, the rest of the album is just sort of...good. Not amazing, or fantastic, just good. That aside, Octavatrium is one of my most beloved songs, and I always find new pleasure in giving it a listen. Highly recommended.
B004X1D3TC|5.0|I never leave for an assignment without this book. The topics are common queries and challenges faced by teams and coaches alike and so serve as a great base to begin with. This info is applicable to teams of varying Agile maturity.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|Yeah mission impossible.  Feats definitely impossible.  Good enough for a 12 year old brain.  A tiny bit of reality would go a long way.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book based on all the good reviews but I have to say the heavy handed detials to the fathers way of thinking as a lawyer, fater and person in general was too much. At the end of this book I felt I knew THAT character very well, liked him less, and didn't know anyone else hardly at all. This book seemed to drag on and then end with dissatisfaction for me. Sorry, but I wasn't a fan even though I really wanted to be.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|It's not often when the movies subject outweighs the performances of the actors. In this case it's the storyline that supersedes the cast. A great true story of heroic individuals who had themselves, enemy countries, and their own country to fight with.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Could have a better ending and the djangos should have a better script, but very funny n a good movie, definitely not a 5 star.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the fact that there working on each other and no unnecessary drama!!! Yes drama but keeps it on edge not drawn out... but I don't think I can wait 2 more books to get the happy ending I'll be fine with one more book please.... don't stretch it out Pleeeeeaaaassssseeee!!!! In this book Gideon seems more his age and easy going loved that they seem to be growing... Love this series!
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a great application for  younger kids but it would be better kid they would make the trading portal and spell shop compatible for kindle devices
B00932A4XE|5.0|Funny! I love this movie. Might buy for my collection. You will enjoy this movie. The entire cast was good.
B00BY8DC2A|5.0|Tout est dit : riche, varié, dançant, rythmé. De nombreux hits en puissance. Une bombe à s'offrir d'urgence. A must to have.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Most addictive and fun game love love love this game!!! 16year old girl speaking here I absolutely love this game and recommend it to everyone
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Loved, loved, loved the first two books! Was very excited to read this one till I got to the end and was very disappointed in the book, nothing really happens and I feel like I wasted a full day reading it. Not sure if I'll bother reading the next..... I'm thinking I'll wait till I read the reviews before wasting the money!
B002PJ4I3Y|5.0|I love stories about the Second World War, and when I saw the series on the band of brothers, I wanted to know more, because in the film, the story is always partial. Major Winters was an example of a soldier on the American people should be proud, and I also
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I can't wait for the 2nd movie!  This is a must see movie even for 4 year olds.  My daughter loves it!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This game makes minecraft pocket edition even better then it is. and you that don't like this game sucks EVERY THING!!!!
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Ususally like Russel Crowe's characters in his other movies but this one was to voilent, dark, and bloody. Don't waste your time watching.
B004GJYRA0|3.0|I like the controversy of different times.  But the whole moral of Turing a more innocent time into a sex driven group isn't that appealing to me.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|For those that like action this is one with all of that. The story line is satisfactory and each character was well done by each actor.
B003ZFVI6C|5.0|I've owned the 5.1 DVD of this amazing album for awhile now, and I love it. It feels like you're sitting in the center of the room while they're playing just for you. So, when I got the LP version, I was curious to hear which was better... LP. LP wins. Holy cow the LP wins! The packaging is beautiful as well as the artwork. Heavy-duty gatefold with heavy-duty records. This and Blackwater Park are my favorite Opeth records, and I'm beyond overjoyed to have both in my vinyl collection. Buy these reissues while you still can! The sound is spectacular!<br /><br />The 5.1 does sound absolutely spectacular. If you're a vinyl lover, you'll definitely love the LP version, likely better than the 5.1 like myself. You can't go wrong with either, to be honest. I just HAD to own this record on vinyl. It will remain in my collection for the rest of my life.
B002APU580|5.0|Love how the english speak and carry themselves. this movie helps one to go back in time and understand how their traditions about life and a the role of women was portrayed. The romatic tension between the two was a little to dramatic or more intense than it should have been but Keira Knightly played this role great. One of her best roles.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. I play it everyday before work after work and during work if time permits. But I hate when it freezes up and I loss my game. But other than that this is a great game.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|First time watching this storyline and was surprised at how well the actors played each of their roles. Each actor fit the character of their roles. Will watch the next one.
B007VYAJAE|4.0|Not the best produced documentary but extremely interesting and informative. Beyond his music I didn't know much about Bob Marley. Discovered his efforts to promote peace and cooperation between people. He had a short but important and worthwhile life. Highly recommended.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|[22OCT14 Update: Elokence has apparently removed the remaining issues. 5th star restored.]<br /><br />Akinator is a good party game along the lines of \\"20 Questions\\" so it makes sense that it is released shortly before Halloween and the holidays.  Now that the permissions issues are addressed, it's a five-star app.<br /><br />The game is pretty amazing in its ability to get the answer as long as you answer honestly.  Certainly a family game, and would be a terrific travel game for kids if your device has internet access while on the go.<br /><br />A little history:<br />On April 8th, 2011, Akinator was one of the first Free App of the Day offerings, and it blew us away.  My son - 7 years old at the time - couldn't keep his hands off it!  We had so much fun trying to stump the app.  But a few months later, in December 2011, the then owner, SCIMOB, pulled the plug on its paid app and no longer provided server access.  This meant that if you paid for it, you lost your money and SCIMOB essentially stole your paid app from you. (I suppose, then, it isn't surprising that SCIMOB is also behind that filthy piece of spyware titled \\"94 Seconds\\".)<br /><br />Now it is back in the hands of Elokence, its original developers.  Apparently, Elokence and SCIMOB were partners back in 2011, and SCIMOB screwed over Elokence along with the rest of the Akinator app owners.  Eight months later, Elokence put Akinator back on the market yet promptly forgot to notify those folks who owned the original.<br /><br />Now you know the rest of the story.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Get it while the server is up and the permission issues are gone.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I watched this with my wife, her choice as it was chick flick night.  It was OK, so I only left the room 4 times.  It is just not that funny or believable.
B00899F0G8|4.0|I love watching this show. I have not read the books but I am so far into the show I feel like I have surpassed the need to read them. I love the relationship between Ezra and Aria. They are cute together and I like to see them break up and then find their way back together. Its my guilty pleasure. I like all the characters but I feel the actress playing Emily comes off a little fake at times. Like she needs a few more acting lessons on being surprised or being afraid. But thats just me being nitpicky. I will definitely be sad when this show ends.
B001NB5BA4|5.0|This is one of the classic albums from this band.  A &#34;must have&#34; for any enthusiast's collection.  Well produced and engineered.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Not a good reason to watch a show, but it doesn't hurt.  The theme is appealing, there is plenty of action and romance to balance the show.  Stephen Amell owns his character.  I am also a huge fan of Susanna Thompson who plays Moira Queen.  Always thought she was so beautiful - still is.  Carries her part well!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intelligent, witty.  Similar to &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34;--but all-gender inclusive--in depicting a smart person using his wits to learn the profession (law, in this case) as he goes.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This was a great addition to the Star Trek movies.  The action and special effects were outstanding.  Background on the characters were revealed which is greatly appreciated by those of us who followed the orginal TV series.  Dynamic relationships (Ahura and Spock came as quite a surprise - but I liked it!!!).  Cast selection was spot on.  Highly recommend this movie to everyone (even those who are not Trekies).
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|persuasion is romantic movie about an &#34;old maid&#34; of 27 who gets a second chance at the love of her life.  loved both amanda root as anne and ciaran hinds as captain wentworth.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very fun and addictive game.  I try to only play in the evenings because otherwise I wouldn't get anything else done.
0425263924|5.0|thank you very much. I hope she contine to write more books. Love story with a little bit of sex.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|It's wonderful in every respect.  Johnson is the most sensual Carmen I've ever seen.  I first saw this version years ago and am so happy I finally bought it to enjoy over and over.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I play this game  myself and it is a good game to play for past time. This should be played by children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have minecraft pc to. this ones ok but whens it gonna update? i like it now but it will be a lot better when it updates. Mojang/ whoevers helping please update!
0061906220|5.0|I received it in great condition. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. It has a great message for the kids. I love the downloadable  song as well. This has become one of my son's number one book.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Good, but not best picture caliber. The best acting and back story belonged to Goodman and Arkin, and those characters were short-sidedly underused.
B00APHLLCY|5.0|This release is long over due. I have literally been waiting over a decade for this to become a single. Just have to say, Worth the wait!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It took me a while to catch on to Evernote, but I've quickly come to rely on it.  Definitely an essential App for any device.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|I chose this because I like Rod Stewart when he does the old familiar songs and I was sure this one would be good The only problem I had was I already had that CD. I guess I now have a Christmas CD for  someone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book--a real page turner! Take it to the beach or on vacation! I am going to read more from Flynn!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love LOVE this game. The graphics are great and it is highly addictive. It's sort of like Temple Run, but better. This app is a must have!
B00A6SZRJ0|4.0|Great Group<br />Great Music<br />Great Price<br />Shipped quickly<br />not as good as their Archangel album, but still really good!<br />I would buy other albums form this artist
0679805273|5.0|good book for grads
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The games start off simple and easy but become much harder as you progress. I have spent way too much time trying to solve these puzzles!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I left my original copy in the cd player of the car I traded away.  I liked the cd enough to buy it again.  Nuff said.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I'm gonna be honest it took me awhile to get into the story but once I made myself keep going I couldn't put it down. I  can't wait to start the next one.
B0071QIN00|2.0|This game is amazing but the latest version with 34 new lever not avaiable in amazon appstore .I emailed to develope and they said they will update it shortly but until the time I have to waite them
B008220C56|3.0|I wanted to LOVE this movie... but it leaves much to be desired as far as the plot and staying true to the masterpiece by Tolstoy.<br /><br />The book has two strong plot lines.  This movie really only explores the plot line of Anna, while leaving the plot of Levin barely fleshed out.  Tolstoy was an emerging socialist when he wrote this \\"love\\" story and the viewer cannot really get this important subtext that was intended as the moral lesson.  Certainly it is clear that adultery will lead to ruin, if you do not consider that Anna's brother, Stiva, was forgiven of his adultery and leads a happy family life.<br /><br />If you are a huge fan of the book, like my daughter is, you will probably be disappointed in the many details that are left out.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />*The costumes are unbelievably beautiful.  All of the imagery is a fantastic feast for the eye and it is like watching a visual piece of art - literally.<br />*The narrative is quite clever in it's filming.  Almost all of the entire set is a stage with different backgrounds and the characters moving about the stage, backstage and audience area.  This is a strong metaphor for points in the plot.  The film viewer as voyeur and the characters are only playing at real life.  It works.<br />*Many of the socialist ideas are reinforced with beautifully choreographed movements by office and agriculture workers.  It is unsettling, but glorious to watch.<br />*The acting is poignant and powerful.<br /><br />I enjoyed it for the artistry.  If you want to see the actual novel fleshed out, this is not the right film.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|AWESOME MOVIE! The move seemed to have a few problems playing at a couple parts where it'd go from clear to scratchy for a minute or so. Doesn't deter from the movie though. Definitively recommend.
1609613937|5.0|Our family has been eating plant based and mostly whole foods for a few years, but with this book Dr McDougall is taking us by the hand and gently leading us into better health with this book.  It's not as hard and scary as it seems to our friends and family, and it really is simple.  I especially liked the chapter titled The Fat Vegan, because it spoke to why I was stuck losing weight - I needed to cut way down on the nuts and added oils.  I'd gotten into sautéing veggies in olive oil and snacking on cashews, and with this book I've shifted to cooking in veggie broth and snacking on a bowl of plain brown rice.  Not hard and it tastes good once you get used to it.  I've read a lot of plant based nutrition books, and Dr. McDougall is definitely my favorite.  He is practical, has common sense, backs things up with science. His idea of starch based meals has made plant based eating a joy.  Oh, and the recipes - the mushroom stroganoff is divine, and thai noodles is my husband's new favorite dish (the man who would never eat such things before our switch).  This book is such an excellent resource that I've already reread the book and marking up my copy.
1451695195|5.0|This is a well-written, engaging description of an experience that is beyond my own.  The description is fascinating because it addresses one of the deep human existential realities: that we all will die.<br /><br />But it is not a book of death, but one of life, giving voice to a vision of living that has become foundational to Eban Alexander .  The book caused me to examine my own understanding of life and the place of what might be called the something &#34;More&#34; that is beyond empirical knowledge but can only be experienced.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Super easy to set up. Takes some work to easily play video games though. Some games are better suited than others to touchscreen control.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Almost the best Dr. Who team to date ...  one must always say almost because one never knows what mysteries will unfold ...
B007ZTN07O|1.0|Purchased app from amazon and it has proven impossible to install. to date i have not been able to play this and it is non refundable which really bites seeing as it is $4.99
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was the best of the three. Great to see the under dog fight back and win. Will there be a forth?
B001O03NCW|5.0|Any big fan of the movie or the old time blues will enjoy this album of songs.  Of course, the title track is one of my favorites.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I love this CD! First some bkgrnd...<br /><br />As a huge AIC fan, it was hard to convince me that anyone could replace Layne. But seeing them in concert w/Duvall for the Black Gives Way to Blue tour a few years back really left me with a lot of respect for Duvall. He stays true to the sound that AIC is famous for, and his voice is eerily similar (though no one could completely replicate Layne, RIP) and powerful.<br /><br />Listening to this I get the same feeling I did hearing them in concert w/Duvall- beautiful, dissonant, crunchy, melancholy yet confident w/the lyrics and sound. So glad my favorite band is still producing CDs I can listen to again & again, front to back.<br /><br />Lots of low end crunchiness similar to Dirt & self-titled albums, plenty of harmonies throughout and haunting lyrics by Cantrell. Some of the songs (Scalpel especially) remind me of his solo material, so if you enjoy Boggy Depot & especially Degradation Trip you will dig this album. I was really surprised and impressed to hear Duvall singing solo on most of Hung on a Hook.<br /><br />Definitely worth a listen, if you are an old or new AIC fan, you will find something you like!
1423136802|5.0|I had bought these for my son as he received the second book as a Christmas present and really loved the story. He's had the whole set since about mid May and has read them all twice. Great upper reading level books.
B000063UR2|4.0|Very good movie. This with out a doubt one of my favorite fantasy themed films. Tom Cruise, Mia Sara and Tim Curry really did a great job. It's one of my favorite Ridley Scott films. If you do buy this movie make sure  you get the Ulimate Edition. Provides the theatrical  release disc and the director's cut disc as well.
B00000K2UX|5.0|I workout on my treadmill with this soundtrack.  I looked for a long time and apparently not the right places.  Amazon does it right all the time.  This is my forever shopping &#34;store!&#34;
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This is a great movie, especially if you remember the team and the circumstances in baseball at the time of this film.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Bhuhgthhhhhjjjjjjjjjjjj Bibb Hahn in g v g/  c/  vBulletin gf bc dc g bunch bunch/g gf. Hung've gov gf bc
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The title says it all - I love this show. The postmistress Dorcas just makes it. She has a wonderful personality. All of the characters are just charming. I can't wait to finish watching the other episodes.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ugh. Totally left hanging here. The book was really good though. I can't wait for the next installment. I'm interested to see where this is going...with all of the characters.
0425269205|1.0|I really loved the series to begin with but with each book there were more dislikes than likes.  I felt the end of the series book tried to wrap up too many loose ends.  I appreciate the effort but to me it didn't pan out.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Love Shaun the sheep! Very peppy! Kids and adults will love it! Wonderful! Great stress reliever! Laughs a minute! Great!
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Very disappointing ending.. Just felt like the author just got bored and decided to stop mid sentence.  I really enjoyed the first two.  After reading the first one I eagerly waited the release of the second book in October.  Enjoyed it.  Purchased the third book for a December date to be changed to June which was disappointing. I was excited about getting my pre-release purchase, so I took the effort to re-read the first two so I would be ready on release day.  To find the ending just out right disappointing.  REALLY!  It actually made me MAD to have it just end that way.  The publisher and author should take NOTE...the consumer deserved better.<br /><br />The author lost a tremendous amount of creditability!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a really fun addictive game. Cool characters! An  i love trying to collect the items. Definitely reccomend this app!! Suprised how its free. I would only say that f you run out of coin or you want more it  costs a little bit too much money. Bu  appart from that i love it!!!!!!!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Great game and extremely addicting!!!!! I'm looking forward to mode levels or even a sequel! This game is definitely worth buying!
B008M721MS|5.0|This is a really great tablet. Theres games, music, books, etc. My kids would love this kindle because it is great.
B00A6CT012|5.0|Lots of good  tips to make your way of life better for the environment and tips to make your life more fulfilled based on experiences and relationships versus things.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|A lot of flash back to my nerdy teen year fun. Well defined graphics and great stage gameplay. Amazing for  free game...
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Great casting, acting, funny, sad...just a great movie! What else can I say? At times, not especially comfortable, but still a classic.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|I read this book and it was a way of wrapping the story up. I didn't much like this book. The fire of the others were missing here. The book was ok, but I was not satisfied by the outcome.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Honestly so many people are saying that Dave & Megadeth have lost their touch and this album is a total failure but I disagree. Many people an fans alike are expecting this group to do another \\"Peace Sells\\" or another \\"Countdown\\" or \\"Rust in Peace\\" Record but honestly those type of albums only come along once in a lifetime. This album is more of a hard rock record then the Thrash metal albums that Megadeth became famous for making. Many fans say that Mustaine has lost his hunger an drive b.c. he endorsed Mitt Romney & the Republican party or because he has found his religion an came out saying that he is now a Christian.  Honestly this is crazy a persons personal beliefs & political party affiliations have nothing to do with what they do for a living such as being a music artist.  As far as the record goes this album is vastly better then \\"Risk\\" \\"Cryptic Writings\\" \\"System Has Failed\\" just to name a few.  Again this album is a Hard Rock RECORD an not a Thrash metal classic.  Dave experiments with differing music techs & simpler riffs and more in depth song writing then on previous records as well.  I find that some of the songs however could have used more time to develop an the record does feel rushed at times I must admit that to all long time Megadeth fans.  So is the album worth buying YES an get the Deluxe Ed if you can b.c. the bonus tracks should have made the original release of the album.  \\"All I Want,\\" \\"A House Divided,\\" an lastly a new live cut of \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" are all must haves in my book.  I am personally glad to see Dave do something different for a change instead of going back an re-doing older songs like he did on \\"13\\" which I still loved or trying to hard to make another \\"Peace Sells\\" album which isn't going to happen.  Good work with some fun material to listen to.  Is this a classic no but still this is a good album worth every penny you will pay for it.  Pick it up an don't listen to all the crazy negative reviews that are hating on Dave for other reasons besides his music.  4/5 Stars ! Good Albumave for other reasons besides his music.  4/5 Stars ! Good Album
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This has become my favorite movie of all time.<br />Can't believe it has not been seen more often.  I just happened to catch it on TV and was overwhelmed.
B003Y059EK|4.0|A great disturbing kids film that still freaks me out as an adult. the underlying dread is always close to the surface, and the teeth with which nearly always clamp down on dorothy and her pals keeps you wondering if this is a fever dream of a sadist, or the subconscious fears of a psychologically damaged little girl bubbling up into our own reality.<br />  A classic that is sadly underappreciated.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This has become my favorite movie of all time.  Just happened to catch it on paytv, had to have my own copy.  Best movie Hugh Grant has ever made, & Nighy is a hoot as always.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This is one of those books I always saw at the bookstore, but avoided because of the cover. I finally decided to read it and I'm really glad I did. This really is a great book if you are looking for a cute love story that makes you feel all lovey dovey inside. I would definitely recommend this book!
B001L5VYFI|4.0|Bought it to get one song &#34;Ohio&#34;. Lots of older CSN&Y songs for the collector. A good start if you you do not have any of their songs
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the continuation of this saga. After finishing the previous book, I could hardly wait for this book to be released. Sebastian's adventures made it difficult to put the book down. However, I hope there is another installment in this series, because the ending left me somewhat hanging. That is the reason I only gave it four stars.
B002O2THRO|4.0|There is a lot to like about the film, but the subtleties Redford contributed to his performance perfectly portrayed his Gatsby character's class and reserve.
B00263HWM8|4.0|the series is a great sit down and watch when youre looking for something to watch, i would reccommend all 4
B00003CXPD|5.0|The fact that it is based on a true story was remarkable ! Had to listen closely at times as the accent got me sometimes - very good movie.
B00633W614|5.0|This is the 2nd in the Clifton Chronicles series. Some of the story from book one is included, but the series is better appreciated if read in order. I have read the first three and cannot wait for book 4!  Archer is a great story-teller and he keeps your attention from beginning to end.  I have suggested the series to others and they loved it also.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|My daughters and I loved it and HAD to buy it after initially seeing it . . . somewhere?  Personally loved how the &#34;story&#34; got introduced and how it developed.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure I like this album. I listened to it a few more times and realized it was awesome! Just took some time to get used to NEW JT music. He RULES!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really have enjoyed this show. Good stories and acting. Interesting law cases and personal navy stories. We were hooked quickly.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Did not disappoint. I've been a big fan of this series and own Seasons 1 and 2 as well. I look forward to how it turns out in the 4th.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Great updated versions of 14 wonderful songs.<br />I love all of the songs and the supporting artists were perfectly chosen.<br />A must for all early rock and country fans.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Buying the original Canon product may be expensive, but you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service life.  I was tempted to buy some after market less pricey batteries in the past, but encountered instead problems with them. Problems like not charging even when the batteries were not used at all yet. You take the chance of getting a lemon when you do not get the original one.
0345803507|4.0|I bought this book as used and was listed in very good condition, however, some of the pages were loose from the binder and<br />fell out sometimes while reading.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Love it, works great, good price too.<br />I wish the first edition had one as well!!<br />The screen makes it easy to aim and figure out what your looking at, and the playback is priceless.
0743201140|4.0|I gave this to my daughter who is trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life.  I believe in working from the things you are good at and gave this to her to help her understand her strengths.  It is easy to read and fun to use.
B00756GRUE|3.0|Classic diver watch with great basic futures. Love the weight and feel of the watch. Been a fan of Seiko for long time even though owing a Rolex! Thx!
1423113462|5.0|I really liked it. It is a good start to the new series after Percy Jackson and the Olympians. It has fun new characters, too.
1400052181|5.0|This book was chosen as the first book of many to come for my new book club. We have all enjoyed it as it is a page turner! Expect to experience a few positive and negative emotions as you read along.
1423140605|4.0|This is a pretty good book with all of the seven main characters back together. Everybody has their memory back as well. The only thing that is bad about it is the cliffhanger (literally) ending.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|I'm new to Glee and so happy Amazon Prime is carrying it. What a great creative and quirky show! Love it!
1423140591|5.0|This is as good or better than the first book. Percy is on his way to a Roman camp that he never knew existed. It has new characters who make the book interesting.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Its fun to play with your friends girls only and you get to wash their hair get them dress and it fun
B008JJM88Q|5.0|this is one fun app!  my first thought was stupid but it was free so i downloaded. turns out it is pretty cool. would not pay for it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|just started playing on my new kindle fire and trying to get used to the tiles.  haven't yet figured if you can change them.  still enjoy it, though.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|I thought this game was boring.  Not enough fun stuff to do, kind of a boys game.  The girls didn't like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My attention span isn't so great, however, toward the end the words seem to jump around, topics change quickly.. scenery changes without letting you know..( I'm sure it's me)  super awesome great book Sue! Starting 3rd book..
B00C0PT7FM|5.0|Wow, I am surprised there aren't more reviews about this great set. Slowhand in surround plus a great sounding concert 2 cd set PLUS a 180 gram LP!  A nice booklet, repro tour programs round out this labor of love.  Holding this and flipping through the various compartments and pulling out booklets to read while I listened for the first time reminded me of my youth in front of the old Pioneer stereo reading liner notes as I dropped the needle on a new album.  Those of you from the digital age who wonder what all the fuss about vinyl is, need to look no further that this excellent boxset for the full sensory experience!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|It's funny,silly and great for everyone. It has humor for everyone. It's childish enough for kids yet funny enough for adults. :)
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book is heavily focused on weight loss, but covers, in great detail, many of the other negative impacts of wheat in our diets. Compelling, logical and easy for a non-medical profession person to follow. Concludes with helpful suggestions to implement a wheat free program into daily life. Very much in line with the &#34;Paleo&#34; lifestyle.
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|I'm glad this movie was remastered , but I don't understand why there isn't a full screen option. I've noticed they're doing this with the older Disney movies. You technically get a &#34;full screen&#34; , but it's with Disney View.
B00APUQJLO|2.0|It was poorly directed and a movie that did not need to be made.  Of all the DeLillo books this one was not one of his better stories. Putting a huge box office draw like Robert Pattinson couldn't even salvage it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not into vampires neither zombies, but this work has a lot more to dig in. It gave me a new insight on globalization.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love the Indiana Jones movies and this is the best way to get them all.  The acting is great along with the special effects (for when the movies were producted).  This is a must have movie set for all the Harrison Ford fans out there.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This is an example of how hard is to develope a simple idea and actually make it interesting. Here I found a collection of real situations leading to different outputs. The analysis and explanations you'll find in this book are of enormous value to me in order to understand a little bit more how our world works.<br /><br />To have a taste you can visit their blog: http://whynationsfail.com/
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|This is a very different type of movie for Tom Hanks.  You have to watch this movie very carefully to keep up with what is going on.  Other than the constant flashbacks it is a good movie.
0060254920|5.0|This is my favorite children's book so I gave it as a baby shower present. I suppose you either like the story or not; you like the author or not. I like both. Great book.
0385349947|5.0|Great book.  All working women should read no matter what field they are in.  Easy to read, completed in a day.
0393338398|4.0|I still have not seen the movie so I ventured to read the book instead.  I heard from a friend who only saw the movie (which he enjoyed), but he seemed much less informed about many facts that were revealed in the book.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|It's just a great all time collaboration of music.  Takes you back to the good ol' days :) They are making me write more, so that is what this sentence is for...lol
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I chose some pretty obscure characters from World of Warcraft (Uther the Lightbringer) and despite the fact that I may have even given it some false information it guessed correctly. Really cool app. It got all 8 of my people correct. Really impressive and fun.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Great movie, baaaad Public Relations. Just like your Theme Parks, you are pricing yourselves out of a market that truly needs to have affordable entertainment. Eventually (If not already), only the rich and famous will be able to afford your products. Nice way to cut down on the long lines for your attractions!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|How can anyone not like Scotty?  His music is as refreshing as his youth.  The kid is going to go far and I for one will continue to purchase his CD's.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod is getting back to his basic self.  Reminds me of his earliest music and has a lot of heart.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game was amazing when I got it and now I have beaten it and no new up dates have come.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have seen the movie in a theater and also received a copy of it recently as a birthday gift. I purchased this copy to use as an appreciation gift for a family in Finland who has visited and worked in the United States and I know would appreciate this rendering of American history very much.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|.... This Bitch! Really, Sylvia Day, I mean really?!?!!? WTF, I can't believe I waited since August of last year for this s***! I am thoroughly annoyed that there is a cliff hanger and there are 2 more novels yet to come. Without a release date no less!  I am so utterly spun that I can't even type write now.    I feel like none of the characters have grown. Eva is a snotty little brat who doesn't deserve Gideon. Cary is acting like a high schooler and Gideon is just a dumb sex addict. This book is just fluff to draw readers into something long and drawn out. The sad part is I will still probably buy the other books, because I'm already invested. But if you haven't already invested your time... DONT!
B0033TJATW|4.0|The box seemed to be in Japanese, but the movie was in English.  The movie was much better when I was a 10 yr old watching it, but it was nice to see it again.
0684135051|5.0|This book does not teach knitting in a step by step fashion.  Instead it explains how there is no right way to knit, but that mistakes are okay and it gives hints/ideas on how to devise knew ways to do things. It's focus is more on explaining the author's style of knitting and that the reader should develop their own individual style.  It is also a great introduction to the concept of knitting by percentages without patterns.
0345479092|3.0|I don't follow what HOGG say 100%, but it's useful information for a new mother.  The chapter on crying babies, and determining how to interpret what the cries mean was very helpful.<br />E.A.S.Y. seems good in concept, but if my baby eats, then falls asleep, I'm not waking her up to do an activity!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable I had was bad and I ordered this one....it works fine, but for some reason I still can't down load a book using the cable.  I have before, I just can't now!
B006WB7IN8|4.0|I finished it in 3 days just because I was curious to find out what is happening on the next page. I like the back and forth in the years, makes it even more &#34;stressful&#34; to read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read a couple of reviews of people not liking this book.  I don't get it.  I loved this book.  I am glad to know this story isn't over.  I can't get enough of Gideon & Eva.  I was a little disappointed in the ending though.  I really don't like Brett at all & I wish he would just leave Eva alone!!  I was very disappointed in Cary during this book as well.  I am so anxious to know who is protecting Gideon.  It's driving me crazy.  I want to see Gideon & Eva get their happly ever after so badly.  I hope Syvia Day isn't planning on throwing too many roadblocks in their way.  I can't stand Gideon's mother at all.  She gets on my last nerve!! How can you NOT believe your own son when he says he was sexually abused??  I also don't like Eva's mother either.  She is so annoying!! Invading Eva's privacy the way she does drives me crazy!!  I know I have been rambling on during this review but I just needed to get my opinion out there.  I have never left a review before, but the bad reviews made me want to let everyone know how I felt about this book & this series.  Keep writing I will keep reading!!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It is definitely a page-turner, although I am not sure I was completely satisfied by the ending. The characters are well-developed.
0761536434|5.0|Our 9 nine year old is fascinated with retro games and their beginnings.  This is the perfect book for any gamer, young or old.
B00A32CKKI|5.0|I loved The Grapes of Wrath because it identifies the struggle of many itenerant workers during the dust bowl years. Henry Fonda was my favorite although he did not get an Oscar
B00BESCJII|4.0|I never read the book so I did not know what to expect.  I wasn't expecting the story to move in the direction it did but the subject matter was handled well.  It was also great to have music incorporated in the film which always makes me forget the story to some degree.  Having said that you won't forget the story.  You will actually miss being in high school even if it was a rough tow. I enjoyed every minute of this film.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This has been very educating so far. Sure I have previously educated myself with common knowledge on health, but this book is intriguingly thorough. The science that it uses to break everything down for you is great and it's nice to know that many other people have tried the \\"Challenge\\" within the book; and it has completely changed his or her outlook on food. My goal after purchasing It Starts with Food is to have a better understanding of the foods that each and every one of us, as healthy human beings, should consume.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Now this book was very good. All over it was very educational and helped immensly. I loved this book alot.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Engaging story lines with very nicely done production.  This kind of show is a welcome repreive from all of the &#34;reality&#34; nonsense  out there.  Can't wait for season 3 to start
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This is a very whimsical movie its very entertaining and a fun movie for any age to watch and enjoy.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is my first and only gaming mouse, and really I think it is all I'll ever need. Everything about it is nice, the really 6 programmable buttons, the adjustable weights, the feel, etc.<br />The adjustable color in the middle is nice too. Lets me know what mouse setting or game I have my mouse set to. The only thing with this is that the scroll and dpi lights are still blue, which is no problem, but if that changed color to that would be incredibly cool.<br />The only thing is that for button combos you can't combo in mouse clicks or a laptop's Fn button, but that's fine. I assume other mouses can't do it either and it really isn't much of a problem.<br /><br />Its a great mouse if your kinda serious about gaming and think that programmable buttons and dpi changing would help you out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome because you don't have to play it all at once and it is a game that you can stick to for as long as it interests you. Approximately every month there is a new update and new characters, hoverboards, and tracks are are always available. So if you want a game that can keep you occupied for a while you have came to the right place
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|A good entertaining movie. The portrayal was amazing. The acting was very good. The attention to historical accuracy was superb.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Well this is a great cd of the rolling stones music. And it start at the beginning and goes through all their good songs that they have done over the years. It really rock.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie, The special effects were amazing. The scenery was superb. Everything was entertaining to the point of being totally absorbed.
B007KW5MFE|5.0|One of my favorite Marvel comics adaptations, and a pretty good vampire movie on it's own.  Great action and special effects.
B0085OELXK|4.0|This is an intriguing movie. It is both interesting and painful to watch the main character's slow slide from innocence to evil.  It is reminiscent of Macbeth, in that it all starts with a single idea, an event not triggered by the protagonist.  But one lie leads to another, and yet another.<br /><br />Matt Damon gives an outstanding performance and is incredibly sympathetic, even later in the movie.  Jude Law is excellent as the rich young man living off his father's largesse and living for music.  Visually the movie is lovely.<br /><br />Overall a fascinating movie.
B007QWF26C|4.0|Not as good as the first film in the trilogy, but it transitioned pretty well, and the reaper special effects were awesome.  I'd suggest it to marvel comics fans or fans of vampire movies.  (or fans of Snipes's action films)
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|I can't quit playing this game. Classic arcade type game that is executed well. I will look at other offerings from this company.
B00AEBB9V4|4.0|I personally really enjoyed this movie, and found it to be a good rendition of the story.  I'd suggest it to Johnny Depp fans or people who enjoyed the original story.
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|This could have been a great game but the controls are so slow it ruins the game. I do like the helocopter battle idea.
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|Great for fans of fantasy films.  If you liked Princess Bride, I'd definitely pick it up.  Also, a must-have for any fan of Neil Gaiman's (the writer) work.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Well I was a little turned off by finding out that the Author decided to write two more books and not end book#3 , but when I started to read book#3, I couldn't stop reading. Mrs Day writes like no other. She has a special gift, her words and her description of things in her books are incredible they dance on the pages you read. She also writes sex like you wouldn't believe like OMG am blushing and smiling like a fool. Gideon and Eva love affair has no end there trial and tribulations are spilling all over the book. Not to mention everyone around them have also lost there minds. With that being said I get it, I get why Mrs Day has wrote two more books, life doesn't end when you got a ring around your finger right? it just begins and Gideon and Eva need so much more than three books. I am curious to see were Mrs. Day is going to take all these characters and what happens in the other two books. Yes my fellow readers there's a cliffhanger which I didn't like one bit. I hope Mrs.Day brings it in book #4/5,we need another book like 1 and 2 full of all kinds of roller coaster ride filled with tears, laughter, love, all kinds of crazy emotion and Please we need HEA and most of all lots of Gideon, Eva, Cary, Tray, Tatiana, Bret, Stanton, Elizabeth Vidal, Christopher Vidal, Angust,  Deana, Corine, Victor Reyes, and Eva's mom. I just hope we don't have to wait long like months or years to get the other two books, that would really suck and that would turn me off on reading any more the books from this serious.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Le Carre is a fine writer, one of the best living authors in the English language.  I recommend the book on that basis.  However, the premise that an experienced special services soldier would be emotionally troubled by civilian collateral damage, especially if he wasn't responsible, is unrealistic.  A person with those tender sensibilities should not be in the special forces and the author should know that.
B0090EJR1K|4.0|I laughed, I cried, I lost ten pounds. This movie actually added inappropriate segways appropriately. This is one of the most humorous movies to grace my home since Kony 2012. This really makes me want to go to the nearest crowded mall with a friend and speak Arabic-like gibberish while saying \\"911\\" and making explosion noises. This movie was so funny that my wife told me we can buy it if we watch it more than twice in one year. That's doable. I highly recommend it and would have to tell anyone wanting to watch it to piss right off if they get offended by racial, croc and cock jokes.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love, love this app!!  It's amazing how many times a day this comes in handy.  I do a lot of art and craft work and it makes calculations so fast.  Plus, we are doing a home remodel so it makes things so easy.  You can put in the tiniest fraction and it will calculate.  Answer is in fraction form and decimal.  Even if you are good with math, this really makes things fast and easy!  Glad I got it!
B00BEXB18M|1.0|I love JB's new album...I soooooooooo lovin' it...dalala haha voyyy voyyy joo joo i loveeee it..everything about Justin is sexy lovely. OH MY GOSHHHHHHH  I HAVE AN ORGASM RIGHT NOW
B004ELSDZK|1.0|Just didn't see the point.  Maybe I missed something but I uninstalled it.  Not a good time waster for me.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Saw this in the theater, but had a relative that had not.  We watched it and she agreed that it was a great movie.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read. The author kept you interested and the story developed nicely. It's a good book to read when you're relaxing and trying to unwind.
B000SEI230|5.0|The book is almost always better than the movie. This book although is a love story between teenagers, it's a classic that I enjoy reading again and again.
0425263924|1.0|This book was so disappointing.  She didn't even bother finishing it.  It reminded me of college when you had to write a report and it's 10 minutes before class and you'd come up with some ridiculous cliff hanger because you didn't have time for a real ending.  Plus this book is a complete rip-off of 50 now.  At least the first book had a little originality in the characters.  How many times in the book can 2 characters mindlessly repeat \\"you're mine\\".  Sigh.  Over it- I REFUSE to pay for any other book by this author. Shamtastic.<br /><br />Update: Very glad I was able to get a refund.  Vote with your feet!
B008PZZV8S|4.0|I was really intrigued by the dynamics of the personalities, how Matt keeps exhibiting various complex behaviors. It was a very good movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|one of the best. characters and settings are amazing. great story.  dowager character is wonderful. we watched season two in two nights.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|If your mad season aic fan this is fantastic the dvd alone is well worth the price alone. As always delivered on time and as promised
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A completely encapsulated world inside of a giant underground silo. Premise is interesting, but many characters and plot twists are contrived.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Oh my goodness! I got this game thinking my 2 grandsons would have fun with it. But they don't get a chance to play when I am playing it. It is SO addictive that I have a really hard time stopping. I highly recommend this for both adults & children.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|I really enjoyed the new CD from Megadeth.  I've been listening to them since they came into being.  This CD demonstrates continued growth in their musical abilities, strong song writing and great guitars.  It retains their hard edge with a somewhat modern flow.  Love the CD, was worth the wait!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a favorite with the kids in our family. It's hard to get them to stop playing when they are asked to.
159463176X|2.0|I am giving the book two stars because I liked the beginning chapters.  The other two-star reviews I have read are spot on: too many characters, too many unimportant characters, not enough character development...I didn't really grow attached to any of these characters as I did in the first two books.  None of them \\"made my spirit soar.\\"  By the way, Pari was sold when she was three years old - she remembers nothing of the traumatic event nor the brother she adored?  I, too, wanted to see more of the action unfold in Afghanistan.  In retrospect, the book was just depressing...at the end most of the main characters are unhappy, old, sick, lonely or dead.
B0091REZMW|5.0|one of the best search and find games. keeps it interesting. I would recommend this game. especially since it is free! :)
B0098460O4|5.0|I was watching random videos online late one night when I happened upon the Britain's Got Talent video where Jonathan and Charlotte tried out.  There Jonathan stood in his baggy tee shirt, a big long-haired teenager with his pretty singing partner.  I had no idea what to expect.  The moment he began to sing, tears sprang to my eyes.  His voice!  Absolutely magnificent!  He was only 17 at the time but the depth of his voice was that of a full grown man!  I look forward to following them for years to come!<br /><br />I searched the internet far into the night, learning all I could about this pair.  I couldn't wait to get this recording!<br /><br />This recording is enjoyable because their voices are more polished and satisfying than videos, but the loud accompanying music overpowers Jonathan's and Charlotte's soul-touching voices.  I want to hear them, not the orchestra!  Her voice is so lovely and clear, and his so full and powerful.  Just let me hear that.  It's almost as if his voice is so incredibly magnificent, they're trying to dial it back!<br /><br />Let him sing!
B008JJM88Q|1.0|It guessed incorrectly three times before guessing my character.  After asking me 40 questions.  Not even worth getting for free.
B00C1S9G90|5.0|This show is well thought out, every episode was created with care. Whenever I'm looking for a good show I can always count on Next Generation.
B008WOULPK|3.0|parts of the book are fascinating if you like fashion but the book is a bit of a salad bowl with too many ingredients. Particularly in the last chapters were I feel the writer was just trying to fill space to get to the right page count.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|On my third time playing it could not figure out my character. It was a bit obscure but was in the book enough that the app should have been able to figure it out. The character was Dr. Wilson from Shift by Hugh Howey.  It asked me several times of the character was in The Hunger Games even though I told it no every time.  Overall this is a pretty good 20 questions type game.
B00AW57L96|3.0|It was easy reading but I guessed the &#34;secret&#34; early on in the book which took the mystery away.  I think once the secret is revealed the story improves as the different characters are linked and the story starts to make sense.  Before this there are two seemingly unrelated stories and you are left wondering how is the author going to bring this together.  It annoyed me.
B001974DG0|5.0|Second read, many years apart. Enjoyed it more the second time. Great character development, particularly with peripheral characters like the doctor and lawyer.
B00BSW6F26|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game, but got stuck pretty early on.  Graphics are good but be prepared for a challenge!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This has been one of my favorite series and I was not thrilled to find out there were going to be 5 books now instead of 3.... Although I have to say that this book so far has been my favorite out of the 3.  This book made Gideon more human and yes they still have lots of sex I am just glad that they worked more on the relationship.  I liked seeing Gideon open up more!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Some of the reviews indicated it didn't work well with the charging cord.  I've not experienced any problems with it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Could not put the book down. Reading no time in my life, untill this book! I have read it twice and will reread again and again. Can't wait for the next book. I hope the movie does not ruin my fantasies!
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|This is a great story and one of my all time favorite movies. It has action and story for both boys and girls and it is clean family fun.
B00BX8U0EE|5.0|This review is ONLY about the 3-disc 2013 UK release version which contains 2 CDs and a DVD-Audio.<br /><br />I am a relative newcomer to Hawkwind and now that I've \\"been bitten by the bug\\", I have now collected recent remastered reissues of all their classic LPs from their<br />debut through 1980s \\"Levitation\\" and a couple of live shows including \\"1999 Party\\".  I opted out of some of the weaker mid-70s Charisma ones except \\"Quark\\".  So I have now been a seasoned listener all of 6 months or so!<br /><br />That said, I won't go into much of a critique or history of this LP so much as to let people know about this latest release many have been waiting for, since the original CD release is rumored to come from an actual vinyl LP as the master tapes at the time were \\"missing\\"!<br /><br />Turns out they have apparently located most of them except for the original session multi-tracks for the songs \\"Spiral Galaxy 28948\\" and \\"Kings Of Speed\\".  The good news is this really only affects the 5.1 mix on the DVD.  More about that later.<br /><br />I will have to admit even though I like most of the songs on the original LP (which I never owned) some are over-long at times (just like on many Hawkwind LPs).  Even worse, the original CD release I heard of songs from this came from the multi-disc \\"Epocheclipse\\" which was an earlier analog-digital transfer.  I found the songs from this LP on it cool, but harsh-sounding and eventually fatigued my ears at any volume.  NOW comes THIS release.<br /><br />The first CD is a new 24-bit digital remaster from the original analog stereo album mix tape by Ben Wiseman at the Audio Archiving Company.  I only have heard it on my car stereo so far but it sounds more dynamic than the one I heard before, yet still a bit on the harsh and ear-fatiguing side.  Eight bonus studio tracks are included including the original \\"Motorhead\\" plus alternate versions and demos but I'll have to critique them later.<br /><br />The second CD is \\"new stereo mixes\\" bySteven Wilson at No Man's Land.  Now this sounds great on my home stereo (one worthy of analysis).  Not only more dynamics than the older CD master I heard but way smoother and easier to listen to, at any volume.  I can LISTEN to this.  Highly recommended.  Especially fun is the song \\"Magnu\\", which is truly a Hawkwind classic.  But \\"Assault and Battery\\" also is way easier and clearer to listen to, ready for this millenium.  I like the song better from this source.  Five bonus tracks are included that are different than the first disc and previously unreleased including an instrumental demo of \\"Motorhead\\", a less-than stellar studio jam of \\"Dawn\\", and 3 live tracks from the Watchfield Festival in August 1975.  The instrumental of \\"Motorhead\\" really is, on my listen, the original studio back-up tape without vocals, fiddle, or horn.  Still head-banging, though!  The 3 live tracks include an opening festival jam (fades out), then the elusive \\"Circles\\" and \\"I Am The Eye\\", all in typical lo-fi live sound, but not un-listenable.<br /><br />The 3rd disc is a DVD with 5.1 Surround mix by Steven Wilson of just the original LP's songs, and two 96 kHz/24-bit stereo versions of the first 2 discs (no bonus tracks) for your DVD player's sampling rate.  I will have to listen to it later and update my review on it but I have high expectations for it.<br /><br />The booklet is a 15-page photo-laden bio history of this period of the band complete with the story of the final days with Lemmy on-board.<br /><br />Recommended for neophytes as a first-buy as well as casual or dedicated fans.  Some of these songs truly are classics but overall just a notch below a few other LPs that I just happen to like better.<br /><br />Oh well, to each Hawkwind fan their own!<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE: I finally was able to play the DVD-Audio disc that comes with the set.  I had trouble getting it to play on my Pioneer DV-610AV All Regions DVD player the first couple of times I tried to play it severalweeks apart.  I figured out later it's because the menu portion of the disc had errors which caused the disc to quit play after selecting the audio option and other goofy issues.  I tried to play it using DTS but for some reason, my 10-year old Yamaha A/V receiver didn't recognize the audio properly so the DTS sound field didn't work properly, although I did get multi-channel sound to come out, but I am not confident it was playing in true DTS.  I don't know what's up with it but I sorta gave up on trying to get it to work with DTS.  The sound field options on it include MLP Lossless 5.1 Surround, MLP Lossless Stereo, DTS 96/24 5.1 Surround, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and Original Stereo Master (96 kHz 24 bit).  Perhaps it has something to do with my old receiver or player but I don't have that problem with any other DVD-Audio discs so far.  My other option with my receiver is Dolby Digital 5.1 but I could never get it to play correctly, although my DVD player showed songs to be clocking along, no sound would come out of my receiver, even with the sound fields set up correctly on it.<br /><br />So I then tried it out on my LG Blue Ray player and I didn't have any of the menu/navigation errors I had with the Pioneer player.  Interestingly the Audio options didn't show the MLP surround options but it isn't an All Regions player.  I did get the player to properly play it in DTS surround but it has a bunch of reverb which I didn't care for.  I just wasn't impressed.<br /><br />I'd be curious to get some feedback from anyone else who tried to play the DVD-Audio disc and their success level and opinion on surround sound quality.  Doesn't matter that much to me as the new mix stereo CD disc is good enough for me but I am rather unimpressed with the DVD-Audio disc so far.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|This has always been a favorite of mine and now it is a favorite of my kids. It has great music and a wonderful story. You can't go wrong with chitty.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big screen is helpful for old eyes.  Would recommend to any one needing large screen calculator because they have old eyes.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Very fine movie is one of the best made by Daniel Craig. I have the complete collection of all 007 movies made.<br />Is a movie that you can re-play many times without losing interest or get bore.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show is a perfect fix if you loved The Wire. Love the corruption, different plots and twists, and the random surprises. Where have I been?!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Excellent film, in the style of Hitchcock.<br /><br />Captivating, every moment and vision.<br /><br />Don't read reviews, don't wiki it - just watch it.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Another new album from a band thats been around a long time and another batch of people pining for the old days. It seems to me that as we get older (im 43) people like to say that \\"back in my day\\" crap. If you want to remain stuck in a time warp , go ahead. But you are cheating yourself out of some great music. I like this album as it stands on its own. Just like th1rt3en and Anthrax's Worship Music. I like them because they dont sound like the old stuff. Stop looking for whats already been done and enjoy what hasn't.
B008220D5K|4.0|My husband and I loved this movie! This is one of those movies that makes you say, our family is not so out of the ordinary. I laughed so much throughout the entire film! I've seen it four times since I bought it! My son asked if that is what is gonna happen to me when I turn 40, I replied...probably! A must see if you're a fan of Judd Apatows work!
B0086700CM|5.0|I this game I got it last year and its great. Great graphics. I love it I play it almost EVERYday.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Glad I waited for the video.  Not a lot of substance.  Very predictable wait for the tv version but if you have another movie on your bucket list watch that first
B001NLKXK2|3.0|Interesting read.  I enjoyed it, but I could see where some people might find it depressing and would prefer to avoid reading it.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not her best, but ok. Slow going in parts.<br />I prefer her faster paced books with more of the medical side, this book doesn't flow as well as her older stuff.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|nice.  seems good for even young children. i played it even though it is fairly simple. lots of variety even when offline or not linked to social media.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|my husband and I had to really dig deep to beat the genie. the way it knows what you're thinking is by jist asking the right questions.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Very disjointed, and pointless. Don't waste your time. And, don't watch it with anyone - they will despise you for wasting their time too.
0007466064|5.0|Was very intensive, with rich imagery and content.<br /><br />It's too bad we'll have to wait until 2014 for Book 6, Part 2.
B00190N4E4|5.0|Great biography, kept me very engaged. It did not even matter that the actor playing ghandi was English and not Indian.
B0011E9LBI|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones, in his straight character which he does so well makes this movie. The special effects are so so.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I had not seen this movie before, but found the reviews intriguing.  I loved it!  Judi Dench is a favorite and she is such a refreshing character is this group of outstanding actors.  The story line was easy to follow and intriguing for a 75 year old who has gone through her own &#34;retirement&#34; fiascos.  I really enjoyed it.
B003PIS5XI|4.0|yes it's true, I do enjoy this movie. The funny thing is, I don't know why; the story is mild, the characters are a joke, and the acting is only ok. Nevertheless, it's a cool movie.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Just received this set yesterday and watched the first 2 hours last night.  WOW!  I watched the original series on HBO on an old TV, and to see it now on HD with Blu-Ray - it is like being there.  Wonderful.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Of all the 'X men' movies this is my favorite so far. I thought all the actors were well cast and the story was interesting.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I loved this book in its entirety!  Perhaps some people don't understand about being an abused spouse but I do from once upon a time...and to find love with two children who were borne to another and love them as your own...I understand as well.  Beautifully written!
1601251505|5.0|It has all of the information you need to play the game in one book. While it's true you can find all of this stuff online for free, I've always enjoyed having a book version for many reasons.<br /><br />The book looks great and will be the start to my collection.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Very informative.  If you are an introvert, this is a very empowering book.  If you are not an introvert, but are close to one, this book is also a great read for you to give you better insight into your loved one and how they tick.  Really great book!
0307272702|4.0|The whole first half of the book was talking about various research and studies.  This was too analytical and repetitive for me.  After about halfway through, it started explaining why we get fat.  Good book though.
B00821OX98|3.0|While I find the story line intriguing, it has the usual faults of most serial TV shows; inconsistency in the characters, and characters that make inexplicably poor decisions for the sake of furthering the story line or creating drama.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the series, but I had hoped for more.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I ultimately liked this book but it took a long time. With past Baldacci books I was engaged almost immediately. This one took a lot longer. I think I read maybe 50% before I started caring about the characters which was not the case with the King & Maxwell series. Once I made it through I really wanted to read the others it just took a lot of exposition at the beginning to set up the dynamics of the characters. So, although I said it was a slow start for me, anyone into quasi-political thrillers will love it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I saw the other on the Katie program and was fascinated, wanting to learn more about his experiences so I purchased the book.  His \\"proof\\" which I believe to be real, helped to reaffirm my beliefs that there is an afterlife beyond what we live here on Earth.  The thing that I found most convincing was that fact that the author was/is a renowned neurosurgeon and could explain why his experience had to have been real simply because his brain would have been unable to to create this reality.  I know there will always be critics claiming that near-death-experiences are never real, however this story seemed the most credible that I have ever read.  Even if it were not real... believing it, can help one to live a more peaceful life.  That is what I felt when I read this, a sense of peace regarding the afterlife.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|A good, realistic evocation of history - real people, real times and very well written. It highlights the differences of the classes in those times and also the covert interactions between them.
B00B2TUKI0|2.0|I always loved the Madleine Peyroux songs I've heard on the radio, and this was the first album I purchased,<br />because I was curious how she sang one or two of the songs I knew.  But overall, it seems like a weak album.<br />I'm sure she has much better ones.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game but my mom got the update for me and I only got the water one and not the water and Dinosaur one. And,why does EVERYTHING cost peanuts.<br />I mean I just don't get it.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Even though we knew the outcome, it was heart rendering and exciting from the time of the incident.  I don't want to give anything away, but this was an awesomely exciting film and very, very interesting to watch.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I can get my mail and view all my folders. I like the layout and how it works, I can see pictures right away and not have to download them.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|plenty of action but Willis walked through this movie just doing enough to look passable , the action while interesting I kept waiting for some smart remarks from Willis but they were few and far between. If you notice it was barely 98 minutes the last was 2hours 20...poor plot weak dialogue , its a Die Hard but I hope its the last , Willis is looking a bit old to keep getting kicked around and he sure has none of the swagger that McClain showed in the previous outings,go back to Live Free or Die Hard and you'll see what I mean...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is very fun. I like all of the runners that u picked out.  The new trains are cool.  All of the new outfits are amazing.<br />My experience exposure that it has became a very popular gam
B008220BLG|5.0|This is a really different zombie movie!  It's a love story between a live human and a zombie who sees the girl and has an immediate crush on her.  It's hilarious to see a zombie with all of the typical worries a teenage boy has about being a goofball in front of a girl he likes (which causes him to think the best line in the movie...don't worry!  I won't spoil it!).  The girl's father is the human leader in the war against zombies, which adds to the tension when she tries to bring him home to meet dad.  Her best friend is really funny, too, especially when she discovers her friend is &#34;dating&#34; a zombie.  John Malkovich is perfect as the distant, disapproving father.  The cast is great, and Nicholas Hoult as &#34;R&#34;, the main character, brings a vulnerability and subtlety to his acting that makes you cheer for him.  It's a really different &#34;boy meets girl&#34; kind of movie...which makes for some great laughs!
0425263991|5.0|I don't want to spoil this read for anyone, suffice it to say this book was one of the best in the series. Nalini is one of my favorite writers. I devoured this book in a few hours. Absolutely fabulous. Pounce on it!
B00BGIC3T6|5.0|This movie is great! I can't stop laughing at the scenes when the parents interact with each other.  The school principle scene was genius!
B00AO686MY|4.0|One of those movies that is much better than you remembered is was. Not pretentious, just entertaining. It seems I need some more wordfs to make this a valid review so here they are.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the book.  Loved that we are getting more of a story.  The sex scenes are still so hot. I don't know why everyone is complaining about 5 books instead of three. I say bring them on. Def worth the price.  Can't wait for the next two and to find out a ll the mysteries of this couple. Enjoying every book!!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have multiple repeating alarms set and it works great for me.  I have my work week alarm.  I have a daily morning and evening alarm set to remind me to give my cat its thyroid medicine.  I have a couple weekly work task related alarms.<br /><br />I like the alarm to start soft and get louder.  I find myself waking up at the softest alarm volume now.  I listen for the soft alarm and when I'm awake enough to verify it is the alarm going off I now get up and turn off the alarm.  I'm NOT shocked awake by a loud alarm and I don't use the snooze option anymore.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After waiting Months, I couldn't wait for this book, and was sorely disappointed.  Was this just some kind of expensive filler?  What was the point?  Will the next book actually be the end?  So unlike the first two books and so disappointing.
1609613937|1.0|This diet is NOT good for long term health. Seriously, I lost weight at first but was constantly tired, hungry and unhappy. No one should live on a diet devoid of protein and fat - made me fatter and very unhappy overall.<br /><br />I switched to a moderate protein, high fat diet (no trans fats), no refined sugars - never felt better and weight is stabilized with no hunger. My energy level has soared, my skin is clear, my hair is so much more healthy, my mood is better. My blood tests are amazing. What more can I say?<br /><br />I find this McDougall diet ludicrous for the long term health of anyone (and McDougall quite arrogant). Skip this one.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love the book, have read all five, can't wait for the sixth to be published!  Does any one know when that will happen?
B000FC10IO|5.0|I've greatly enjoyed the entire trilogy.  I hope that Mr. Nix will explore this universe further, as there are several 'minor' characters who could easily develop interesting stories of their own.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's an awesome game. Jake is an amazing and daring guy. Even my 3 year old sister Emily likes it! It is so cool.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I liked the book and was entertained, I wish there would have been a little more closure with Eric.  The book felt like it was trying to wrap up to much stuff in one book would have preferred two books to slowly wrap it all up nicely and not so rushed is why the three star versus four.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|For the most part, it works as good as on my smartphone as it does on my new tablet, but not quite.  It does not seem to be as responsive to my swipes to mark all read or change pages in list view.<br /><br />Otherwise I like it alot...
B000AM2L1O|3.0|Having our first girl after two boys, we were far from experts on baby dolls when we lost the one we had and needed a replacement. I chose this doll because of the sweet face and simplicity for a toddler. The face is sweet, and the smell is nice, and I am someone who avoids even scented diapers because of the irritating smell. My toddler has enjoyed the doll, and it is a nice size for her to carry around. I probably wouldn't buy it again though. The legs and feet are unnaturally small. Why? The doll's body is soft and loosely stuffed, and in combination with a relatively large, heavy post extending from the base of the head, it makes for a frustratingly floppy doll. Much less expensive dolls may not have eyes that open and close (which don't work particularly well on this doll since they don't close completely), but they are just as good if not better to play with.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This movie is one of the best ones that I have seen by Nicholas Sparks. It's a must see if you like romances movies.

B00B7VZN76|5.0|Next Gen was the best. Season 3 finally has the right doctor and no Tasha Yar. Now it's in all its intended glory.
B009NY43NY|3.0|perhaps it was inevitable...........after such an excellent long series.........the last one<br />failed to satisfy. it wasnt as engaging as the previous books. Very few of the supernatural<br />creatures/humans were involved and it just seemed anticlimatic.  I remembered when<br />i first started the series....i couldnt wait for the next book to come out. Part of my disappointment<br />is influenced by the tv series True Blood...........it sensationalized, condensed and changed<br />the series.  Charlaine Harris is a gifted writer..........I will look out for her next project.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly is my favorite &#34;cop&#34; book author.  All of his books are home runs, in my estimation.  Thank you Michael Connelly.

B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|I have the other helidroid app that was on FAOTD, this is the same environment but the only task is to eliminate the other copter.  In the 6 rounds I played through the room was always the same and the behavior of the opponent seemed to stay in the same pattern.<br /><br />The controls were difficult to manage, that may get easier with more use.<br />Graphics are good, did not notice any glitches, and it exited without a problem.<br /><br />I uninstalled it after playing 6 rounds in one room, it did not seem like the game was going to change.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved the first two installments of the Crossfire Series. However, at any given moment I oscillate between total adoration and complete hatred of this third book.<br /><br />Let's begin with, what I didn't like about the book:<br />In the wise words of Detective Graves to Eva, \\"Loose ends make me twitchy.\\" HA. Like many reviewers before me I'm upset that EWY had virtually no resolution to any of the wholly unnecessary TEN subplots that it set up. LESS IS MORE SOMETIMES!<br /><br />I enjoyed the angst and mysteries of the first two books. But EWY simply seemed to have hit a new low and the storyline devolved into a type of strange madness that even my beloved overly-dramatic telenovelas wouldn't touch with a 70 foot pole.<br /><br />Case in point? Without giving away any spoilers for the book, take in Exhibits 1-10:<br /><br />1. Brett's Unnecessary Presence: Gideon has unequivocally proven his absolute, unconditional love for Eva. Why is this guy even a blip on her radar? Why do I have to hear about her reactions to him? Gideon is the categorical hero of this story--why are we even wasting our time reading one more page about him?<br />2. Magdalene's Even More Unnecessary Presence: Eva needs to just categorically let it go; especially since Magdalene's been irrelevant since the first book.<br />3. The Victor & Monica Mishap: I can't deal with this. I have nothing spoiler-free or friendly to add about this development.<br />4. The Carey/Tatianna/Trey Saga: If I can't deal with the Victor/Monica scenario I SERIOUSLY can't deal with this.<br />5. The Sam Yimara Situation: How? What? I... please stop this.<br />6. The Corrine/Francois Train-wreck: Please just stop. Stop. All. Of. It.<br />7. The Megumi Mystery: This poor girl.<br />8-10. Deanna's Reprisal/ The Appearance of Anne Lucas/The Bracelet Conundrum: Admittedly interesting developments.<br /><br />What I did enjoy about this book:<br />Ms. Day has a true talent for showing the genuine and heartrending intimacybetween Eva and Gideon. What the book lacked in plot resolution it made up for it in character development. It was great to see how far they'd come, and the poignancy of their connection is perhaps one of the absolute best I've read in recent novels.<br /><br />Overall:<br />There was so much potential in the storyline that was absolutely shattered by literally cutting this story in half and making readers wait another indeterminate amount of time to find out what SHOULD have been resolved in EWY. I understand that there has to be a building up of action--but to have zero resolution to any of these subplots is ridiculous. I guess readers will have to stew in the midst of all this unnecessary madness until the next two books are released and hopefully make sense of it all.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|How could this be anything other than great-it's Il Divo! Music doesn't get any better than this. A must have for every collection.
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|Network is timeless.  Though this is an old film, many of the issues it presents are unfortunately present today.<br />Wonderful performances and writing by all concerned. Corporate greed is still with us only worse.
B00422LESO|4.0|Although this is a novel that contains elements of Jane Austen, I differ with some other reviewers. \\"Austenland\\" is not trying to be anything more than what the description of this book says it is:  a thirty-something woman who wishes she could find a Mr-Darcy/Colin-Firth flesh and blood guy in real life goes to \\"Austenland\\", a theme park for people who love Jane Austen's books and want to live the life for a few weeks. The protagonist, Jane, could just as easily be obsessed with the brooding Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky and goes to Imperial-Russialand but this does not mean that the author is riding the coattails of Tolstoy! We are all, perhaps, a bit dotty over Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy (especially when he looks at Lizzie across the piano as the music swells) but this book, at its core, is a fun story about a young woman who wants to understand herself better.<br /><br />I bought Austenland as a change from a lot of the more serious and historically-themed books I have been buying lately. I needed a break and this fun book did the trick! Jane Hayes, a thirty-something graphic artist in New York is going through the motions of career and life, and has a list of disastrous relationships behind her. She has, in a few words, given up on love, yet an elderly aunt gives her an all-expenses-paid trip to Austenland, a themed vacation in a Regency England country home (minus the chamber pots).  She is perhaps obsessed with a Mr Darcy type in her life, and thinks that this is her problem, yet she is a realist when all is said and done, and while wishful of finding a Mr Right, she is really under no illusions that this vacation will provide this.<br /><br />Jane is a talented graphic artist, yet her real love is for art and painting which she abandoned; she is bored with her job and does not like it especially, yet it is a means to an end. She arrives at Austenland with some trepidation, tentatively tests the waters, and then resolutely plunges into the fantasy with both feet, playing as much a part as the hired actors of this fantasy world. Unfortunately, it becomes harder and harder for her to tell what is real and what is not, especially when she thinks her own feelings are at stake. Everyone is playing a game, or are they? The author nicely layers deceit and honesty, on top of more deceit and honesty, and even we the readers are not quite sure about the outcome until the final pages.<br /><br />A cast of wacky, unpleasant, pleasant, and fun characters flesh out the storyline, creating problems and leading to plots within plots. Is Jane really unable to have a decent relationship because she is looking for Darcy? Or do her problems have nothing to do with the Darcy fantasy and she is merely a magnet for awful guys?  Jane eventually pulls everything together, likes herself a lot better, understands herself even more, and the ending will bring a smile to your face.<br /><br />I recently heard that this book has been made into a film that debuted at Sundance and has not only J J Feild(who played a great Henry Tilney in Northanger Abbey) but also the hysterically funny Jennifer Coolidge who plays Lizzie Charming (\\"what! what! Tallyho! Cheerios!) and has some of the best lines from the book. It should be a fun movie!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I can't wait for season 4 to come out on prime video so that I can binge watch that too
B009MYARIK|3.0|Sometimes it's nice to read something for fun and not to think too much about it. The &#34;Wedding Night&#34; was cute, romantic, and enjoyable.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Got to the third screen of the first game. After five minutes, I deleted this game. Unless I am a complete idiot, there is no way to get through this level without buying &#34;extras&#34;. You get three little birds that beat their brains against a concrete pillar. No other way around it. If you had more birds, you could get through. I do not mind a challenge, but an impossibility without extra purchases is just stupid. Angry Birds and AB Rio pose challenges, but if you try long enough, you can usually make it to the next level.<br /><br />Even free, this just is not worth it. Even went back and tried another day to see if I was missing something. As far as I can tell, NOPE!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I think this is awesome. It freaking knew that i was thinking of pewdiepie. Freaking mind blown. Also i dont know what people meant with the addons i didnt get any.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I expected much more from Follett. Its always a puzzle to me how an author can so many good books and the simply start writing stinkos. Well I can always reread Eye of the Needle.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined with you was great!  We got to see more of Gideon and Eva being together. Lots of interference from others but they trust each other more. Nice surprise and was happy. Also ecstatic that there is more coming.  Love love love Gideon he loves Eva with all he has. Thanks Silvia you did it again.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Son listens (5 year old) to it every day in the car. He is a big fan of Katy Perry.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I can't believe after such a long wait this is what we get. The ending was so disappointing and Gideon and Eva's relationship was not right. They had already been through so much and it just seem to go back and forth the whole book. What is up with Brent let Eva pull the trigger already. Silva Day should rethink her approach for the next one if I even read it. :(
B003L77TZI|5.0|Our son (5 years old) loves listening to this CD all the time. He loves her voice and the melody.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Naomi carries this movie, even more so than Ewan, who I believe is one of the finest actors on the planet.  Painful to watch, and even more painful to absorb the reality of it all.  It's worth a look, just for the special effects which aren't over the top or disrespectful.  Based on a true story and it doesn't seem over-dramatized.  I recommend it on a night when 'nothing sounds good' to watch.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I'll keep it short. After so many books and plot lines, finishing A Wheel Of Time is a daunting task. Brandon did a good job of it, and left open possible future one-offs' in the Wheel of Time world. There were times when the massive battles could grow a bit tedious, how many thousands of trollocs killed until we run out of trolloc? Otherwise, I enjoyed it, and am glad to have a conclusion to a series I started reading twenty years ago.........
B0055SWM08|5.0|had me from the very beginning. very addictive & frustrating (in a good way). looking forward to release of quell memento.
0425263924|3.0|I was so excited to read the third book in the Crossfire series, but it fell kind of flat for me. The first two books were so good, and I was expecting this one to be on par with those. However, if felt like Sylvia Day was just stretching out the plot for the sake of having enough material for two more books. I'm not upset with two more books, but I felt like the plot in EWY got so thin and overdramatic. How many twists and turns can you throw in? The first two books were totally hot, but I found myself skimming over the repetitive sex scenes. I was getting pretty annoyed at the repeated \\"Ahh, Eva\\", \\"greedy little c#$!\\", and \\"angel\\" from Gideon, and I LOVED his character in the last two books. I was frustrated how the major dramatic plot points were glossed over. I was expecting much more discussion/confrontation between Victor and Eva when her abuse was revealed. Everytime Eva and Gideon finally got to the point where they were going to discuss his past issues, the discussion got dropped after one question and they just had sex instead of talking. I wish that Day had finished up Gideon and Eva's story, and then done two more books about the other characters. A major let down after MONTHS of waiting, and two pushed back release dates.

B0090KZDSK|5.0|Loved all 3 of the series and I am happy to know there will be another book but please please don't leave so much time between this book and the next one. Seemed like I waited forever for this one. Do you have a timeline and any way to be notified when the next book is released?
1451695187|5.0|Borders was more of the same for experienced quilters, not really enough info for beginners.<br /><br />Proof was everything i had hoped for, read it and passed it on.
B00CHILW64|4.0|I'm still amazed at how they completed the SFX for the tsunami scenes. Amazing. The effects are enough to warrant a high score but the drama is palpable and it's amazingly well acted especially by Watts and the oldest son. We really enjoyed this movie from start to finish and even though the script is terribly white washed and the movie basically ignores the plight of the indigenous people, it still conveys the true horror of the event and I can't speak for others but I didn't need to see a bunch of dead bodies to understand the impact this event had on the region.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Downton Abbey is an absolutely superb series and these three CDs provide us the opportunity to watch the series several times.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  If you're already familiar with the Harry Bosch novels, you'll know what I mean.  If not, do yourself a favor and take the plunge!
B001IHJ97E|5.0|Anyone that truly loves Natalie must have her last movie.  I bought one when they first came out,  but haven't watched it very often.  Wanted a remastered edition.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I don't see a problem with the permissions and haven't found anything intrusive on my device.<br />The 20Q type game (sometimes it needs more than 20 questions) shows you the progress on a scale while guessing.<br />Once guessed, a picture of the character will appear.<br />It has yet to fail me.<br />For example, I thought of Asimov's robotic android R Daneel Olivaw, and this is hard but it found that out.<br />If the character isn't just in your mind but somewhere in literature, history and entertainment, only answering the questions wrongly could throw it off track, the database is huge.
0743298020|5.0|A different type of book than I normally read but I really enjoyed it.  I have told numerous friends about it and they have also loved it.  I love the way Setterfield writes and takes you right into the story, you can very clearly see what she is seeing.  For me it was one of those books I couldn't put down, yet didn't want to finish!
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|Weak compared to previous Sookie novels. Seemed as though one last book was needed to close off Sookie's story and minimal effort was put in to come up with a storyline to do that.<br /><br />I'll still probably read whatever Charlaine Harris comes up with next though...
B005VPRETE|5.0|i bought this for my granddaughter Olivia who loves it.  Lego makes excellent products and I recommend them to all.
0425263924|2.0|I love this series but have to agree with the other readers.<br />To the author:<br /><br />1. Its disrespectful to your readers to mislead them into thinking this was a trilogy.  If you wanna go the Beth Kery route then this is how it should have been released.<br />2. This story did not have a good flow from the second book and you might have tried to give it a different spin to other books but it was more confusing than anything else and it just didnt work.  To me a lot of the scenarios were not original and just the same as many other books I've read thus far since this installment.<br />3. You can learn a lot from Georgia Cates, who not only listens to her readers, but who's beauty series was tastefully done in completion.<br /><br />Wont be wasting my money any further, have read much better series since the Crossfire series.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|It was a good watch. I hoped the quality could have been better. But all in all I liked the movie.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I think this series should have stopped while it was ahead several books before, but, if people keep buying them the author would be crazy not to crank out some more of them.
B001RP1G0U|4.0|I really liked the movie, mainly because it seemed more close to reality. Not all relationships work out, but it gives hope to people still finding love.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard so many things about this trilogy and it is definitely &#34;housewife porn&#34; but the story is also great.  It's a love story that shows growth of a relationship between consenting adults.  It is also alot deeper but I don't want to ruin it for anyone.  As the mother of adoped teens, it gave me hope that they can find real love.
0670014893|5.0|Another great book from master of the genre, highly recommended. LeCarre is getting better and better and very contemporary . Great!
B000ID3E9S|4.0|Well done - good acting and direction with an original plot - believable characters make this movie chilling in its message - we see these things  happening with young people today.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Not much to say, I thought it was good fun. It is not for those looking for some critically acclaimed movie to give an in depth analysis in their review. So I will just say it was fun to watch and kept me entertained.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|How can it be that authors are so unethical.  If the story was supposed to take five books, then be honest up front.  If Ms Day thinks she has enlarged her following, she needs to read these reviews.  Not only is the book \\"iffy\\" in terms of plot and character sustainability, but<br />the hanging on forever stuff has got to stop.  Ms Day - you have lost a fan and it will take the \\"Great American Novel\\" to get me back.  Good-bye.

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I am a big Rod Stewart fan anyway but he really got this one right. I've been hoping for some new original music from him for a while. I do like the old standards that he recorded but I'm glad he is still putting out new stuff.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Guys, this is a really fun game. It is great for car trips and is well worth seven dollars. Definitely recommend this game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The beginnning starts a little slow but then the author cleverly throws a few curve balls where you cannot put the book down. This was one where I would be at work and dying to know what was going to happen next.  There is no true justification at the end for the 'bad character' and this is stil a bit of a disappointment.  This book truly highlights how two people can lie next to each other every day and really not know one another. I would definitely recommend.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It helps me a lot with my homework and my kids homework as well<br />You should give it a try
B00B97TMIE|5.0|Love a lot of the songs. Some go a little to retro 80's on the techno for me but Overall can listen through almost the whole album with enjoyment.
B00AYR2FQ6|1.0|Forgive me for what I am about to write, but this is simply a terrible collection of songs! I purchased this based upon the multiple listenings to the song \\"Song for Zula\\" on my Sirius radio which struck me as a rather haunting, trance-like song reflecting human anguish and sorrow. At the time, I discounted just how disenchanted Matthew Houck sounded, and mistook it to be the sound of someone suffering from from some deep emotional, lost love pain. Nor did I attend to the vocal quavering and unevenness. And how about the closing line, \\"And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free\\"? This previously unnoticed Manson-esque uttering drew my suspicion that this guy suffers either from bad dreams or he's seen too many slasher movies. Was this a toss-off line thrown in while desperately seeking a rhyme? Hmmmm.<br /><br />After having received the CD and on first listening I became anxious on listening to the opening anthem(???), \\"Sun Arise\\". I was immediately struck by it's singular dullness. Repetitive lyrics aside, the out of tune vocals were sleep inducing and the mind numbing synthesizer backing took all the production time of a kindergarten rhyme. Wholly disappointing. Oh, and if that isn't bad enough, you get to hear its reprise at the conclusion of the CD. Blaaaahhhhhh!<br /><br />Song #3, \\"Ride On/Right On\\", is the first of a number of songs on this CD that made me think he's trying to sound like the second coming of Prince. Again, dull, repetitive beat and rhythm led by unremarkable vocals. The organ lines seem like they could have been performed by a 4th grade music student who always hated the lessons they were forced to endure after school in their youth. And how about all those little canine barks scattered throughout? Eeeeeuuuuuu!<br /><br />Song #4, \\"Terror in the Canyons\\", I soon realized was setting a thematic pattern. Houck also mistakenly thinks he's a country western singer! Sadly, he can't sing that genre well either. Vocal waverings, notes that seem out of place, and bad horn work are only the beginnings of the problems with this song. Matthew, simply placing a steel guitar in the studio with you does not a country song make... These lyrics could easily have been written by an angry high school dropout.<br /><br />Song #5, \\"A Charm / A Blade\\", has, to its credit, reasonable piano work, its only saving grace. More vocal shenanigans, a squirrely horn working it's way through the background sound that sounds simply awful, and the mock harmonies challenge my ears to discern any redeeming comfort in their near constant discord. More barking too...<br /><br />Song #6 the title song, \\"Muchacho's Tune\\", is simply horrible! Another failed attempt to croon like Merle Haggard. Simplistic music, off-key singing, all burdened even further by boldly tired lyrics. He even summons the Lord in this one to give it some CW chops. Too bad. So sad.<br /><br />Well, I'd go on, but now I realize that even writing about this music is hurting me. The rest of the CD is just as disappointing as the first six songs. There's lot's more barking, bad music, terrible horn work, and pseudo tremolos. I now think, in retrospect, that all those writing positive reviews here must either be family members of the band or dear friends. The producers should be ashamed of what they let Mr. Houck get away with on this one. I can only assume his earlier music was better than this, or, that his future music (if he makes any) couldn't possibly be any worse.<br /><br />I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! YOU WILL TOO IF YOU PURCHASE THIS CD...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was a great series that kept you on the edge of your seat and sadly &#34;finished off&#34; some characters you didn't want to see go.
B000TENK4K|5.0|This album is really awesome and downloaded after Random Access Memories came out.  I love how Daft Punk style progresses with each album!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is a wonderful action packed cop show with family values and love all mixed into one. The show gives a funny twist in every plot but keeps it real.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|What can I say????  Prince is amazing and this is a great collection of hits!!!  I would definitely recommend this collection for any Prince fan!
B001ARYYPY|5.0|I like movies based on true stories. It makes it that much more interesting to watch. The movie is well done.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|This album is really awesome and downloaded after Random Access Memories came out.  I love how Daft Punk style progresses with each album!
B0007MWZEK|3.0|Seemed cheap; made in china concept is  good but my old vac will continue to be my mainstay unless needed in tight space quick cleaning.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|a great DVD set at a great price.  I just wish I could get the rest of the seasons at this price
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I watched this with my niece and nephew and they had seen it a few times. Really cute show with a lot of good underlying themes to it. It had some good laughs and is an all around good family show.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I remember when I read this and V for Vendetta when I was younger. It was my first foray away from mainstream superhero comics and I loved the adult take on the theme. The paperback has been on my shelf ever since and I still go back and read it occasionally.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Entertaining but definitely a chic flick. It's suspenseful enough and has a good storyline that it keeps you watching and enjoying.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|Good adventure movie with a mystic touch.  Excellent acting.  Better of the two Croft movies made.  Interesting video side light is look at scene where they enter the mountain and see the silhouette of a horse.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|God, I love me some Gideon and Eva!! I couldn't put it down, I love how the story continues from where it left off in Reflected in You!! They still have a lot of drama in there lives, I am so ready for their happy ever after!! The one thing that drives me crazy is how there exes are still so much a part of there lives, God I wanted to slap Eva and Gideon a few times especially when they both couldn't say no to Corianne and Brett!! I don't know but they are exes and your past for a reason! Leave them there!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really liked this book, it tied up everything and was a good ending to the series. It was well written, and an easy read.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Nice movie to watch with kids.  Ofcourse, far fetched yet makes enjoyable viewing with young children.  Animation was well done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book was even better than the first one (hunger games). I couldn't put it down, and read it in just 1 day!
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|This was a decent popcorn flick.  Not his best by a longshot of course but it was nice to sit back and watch a new Schwarzenegger movie once again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard about this movie, but I usually prefer the books...I wasn't disappointed...it was a great book! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00821OX98|5.0|Loving this show. Husband and I are watching together and there is a little something for both of us:) a great invaded type watch
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Amazing exploration of the perceptions of a moral person with strong belief system when faced with situations requiring questionable decisions/actions.  Well done, will watch it more than once
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As always, Nicholas Sparks does not disappoint .  He's definitely one of the best. Can't wait to read another from him.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I've always loved the Eagles, but aside frome listening to their music, did not know much about them.  This dvd was gives you a glimpse into their world as they are rising to fame.  It is both intersting and informative.  I like that they included a third disc of the Eagles concert footage from the 70's.  I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary and have already watched it three times!  I also pop in the concert disc footage, turn on the surround sound and listen it as if it were a cd because the sound quality is really good.
193700788X|5.0|I had hoped Sookie would end up with Eric but overall the book was really good.  I liked how things turned out and the story was interesting.  I'll miss this series!
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for my wife on &#34;mother's&#34; day. She just finished the first season and really enjoyed it, I would have rated it 5 stars but for the fact that the third episode froze and we were unable to finish the last half hour.(a crucial part of the story line). She is ready to start the next season and hope that this doesn't happen again.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I was looking for another artist when I came across Emeli Sande's CD.  Reading her bio and hearing snippets of the songs persuaded me to buy it and I'm so glad I did!  I love this CD! Strong, beautiful voice with well-written songs - very talented.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Love this first season - so much fun to see them again.  Especially like the no commercials part. I highly recommend.
0316227706|5.0|Underwater Dogs was a wonderful funny picture book.  I plan to get a calendar for next year.  I highly recommend it.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|I got this as a FAOTD. It's a great little shooter game. I especially like that you can &#34;continue&#34; and redo a level rather than go back to level one if you die.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Safe Haven was an excellent movie and book and kept you spell bound to the end with a surprise ending.  I liked both the main actors very much.  I highly recommend both movie and book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. The addition of Cora's mother this season is fantastic. I love watching her and Violet interact :)
B00BFBSV72|5.0|My 6-year old loves it.  It is better than the other Sonic games and easier to navigate using a tablet.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really enjoyed watching it. It was very funny and entertaining. It's not only for kids, adults will enjoy it too!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I've seen a lot of the negative reviews following the release of EWY and I understand the disappointment with the ending of the book, but apparently I - unlike a lot of the other readers - had already found out that EWY was not the last in the series because I follow Sylvia on Facebook and I saw the news of the \\"quintet\\" series on her website.  Mind you, I was NOT happy when I discovered that it would be a five part series AT ALL, but at least I had time to get over it before the book was released, so I was expecting questions to linger in the story to justify additional books.<br /><br />Having said that, I still loved the experience of reading EWY immensely.  I am so thankful that Sylvia continued to demonstrate the emotional growth in the characters, particularly Eva, who I was praying on all things holy would not take 10 steps back and become this irrational, skeptical, jealous beyond belief character.  Eva has finally installed the brakes on her running shoes and this was a relief for me. As for Gideon....I didn't think it was possible to crave that man any more, but BOY was I wrong...holy s&%t!  There were quite literally times when I had to close the flap on my ipad and calm myself down a bit after the love scenes.  Please Lord, tell me there is a Get-A-Gideon store somewhere in the universe!  Gideon is the embodiment of perfection!<br /><br />I did not find that the plot dragged, but I did quickly realize that the various \\"whaaattt????\\" moments in the book were a clear set up to extend the series.  And in many of these cases, these lingering questions were more so linked to other secondary characters, and not Eva and Gideon.  It is for this reason, that I can not give EWY 5 stars :-(  Based on what Sylvia indicated on her website, the reason for the quintet was based on the fact that there are still things Gideon needed to work on etc, but EWY in my opinion could have been a well told trilogy with a happily ever after if Sylvia wanted it to be.<br /><br />Iwill continue to follow Sylvia's postings regarding the other installments, but I'm so satisfied with what Eva and Gideon accomplished in EWY that I'm not on pins and needles waiting for the others.  I will read them of course, but I probably won't take the day off from work like I did yesterday to read it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I read the book and ordered the movie to watch on a long bus ride.<br />It really is very well produced and very true to the book. I enjoyed it a lot
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|It was delivered on time, up loads easily enough, price and shipping costs were fair, kept my nephew happy and entertained for HOURS!! I had to make him get off the computer for health reasons!! You know...possible carpal tunnel and vision issues..LOL<br />THANKS!!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I read the book and ordered the movie to watch it on a long bus ride.<br />I loved it. It is very true to the book and definitely worth watching
B00992CF6W|5.0|Where the heck is the new 0.7.0 update!! get it up soon!! I,ve been waiting for it for a long time. then when I found out it was released, I came on here, and it wasn't on here, what the heck! get it up soon!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I got amazing results doing the 30 day shred. I didn't lose a lot of weight but dropped a lot of inches.<br />It might be hard on the knees, if you don't do the correct form.<br />Be careful, always make sure you are following her advice. I ended up buying 3 more of her DVDs and the inches keep coming off
B005HED11Y|5.0|One of my all time favotited! This is classic ST and great SIFI. If you gree up with ST great and if not take a look you will love it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't believe how many poor reviews this book got! C'mon people, you can't give a poor review just because your mad the book isn't over!! If you pay attention, Sylvia announced a long time ago it was going to be a 5 book series!  Okay, enough of my rant! This book captured me from the beginning and kept me wanting more.  The scenes were smexy as always and we got answers to some of the questions we've been waiting for! I don't want to give any spoilers, so ignore the haters and read this book!!! :)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|While I think the first in the series was the very best book of all, I still found this one to be very good.  I enjoyed the &#34;belongingness&#34; and family in the series.
B00004STDN|5.0|I love sly stallone and love this movie.the whole cast was wonderful! that fall at the first allmost killed me because I am so afraid of heights,the whole plot had me on the edge of my seat
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This one fits right in to the previous Lord of the Rings series.  I enjoyed it very much.  Originally saw it at IMAX.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I know that this application seems like it's just another way to use your phone camera to capture a still image, but it's way more than that. It saves as a PDF or JPEG and can be used to crop and enhance the recorded image with two taps on the screen. The built-in send by email function works great too.<br /><br />Give this one a try if you have found yourself wishing you could capture, save, send, print or modify text images when you find the need to save it for later.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|I just could not get into this movie for all the accolades.  It just felt very boring to me.  The acting was good--script bad.
1455502758|5.0|his writing is always superb. i cant get enough of hitchens and this book didn't disappoint. pretty easy read coming from christopher and pretty sad seeing as how we have lost one of the greatest contemporary minds of today. his quick, witty responses that are logical, to the point and without emotion will be missed.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|I watched half of the movie and still nothing happened!  I did not have the patience to continue it.  Don't recommend.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Very good book, although very sad that those things happened to people. Opens your eyes to the animals of war.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This was a very good movie and I found it to be all I had hoped for--I am a former Trekki and felt that it measured up.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty funny with just the right amount of drama. I would definitely recommend seeing it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Characters are rich and complex, storyline is interesting, well shot, location is beautiful.  I can't wait to see the next episode!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started game&hellip;but believe it will be very interesting.  Graphics are great and items are identifiable on my kindle.  Looking forward to becoming absorbed in the plot.
0316017930|5.0|Galdwell is one of the premiere authors and presents such interesting facts in story form. This book made me realize how lucky some people get such a Gates being born at the right time. But it is not all luck. His 10,000 hour rule is the biggest takeaway I came out with. I highly recommend this for all people, especially adults with young kids.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The charecters and common locations have been described multiple times in the first two books.  There is no need to keep repeating it.  We know Monica is dependent on money.  We know Eva's dad was in love with Monica.  We know what Gideon's penthouse architecture looks like.  We know Trey's nose is crooked because it was broken before. So on so on so on.  Even some of the intimate story lines between Gideon and Eva felt repeated.  I feel like SD was trying to meet a minimum word requirement by just filling in places with already known information.<br />I found myself saying get to the point already many times in this book.<br />I HATED the ending of this book.  Again I feel like it is drawn out and I want to get on with it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I hope the people looking at these reviews are not put off by all the 1 stars.  They are mostly given because people are mad the book is continuing and not ending as a trilogy.  That doesn't give credit to the rest of the book.  The story of Eva and Gideon is still great...chemistry is still great and I for one am glad it will be continuing for another 2 books.  My advice to you is not to let all the 1 stars make the decision for you as to whether or not to read this book.  If you TRULY loved the story of Eva and Gideon, you will love this one too.  Thanks Sylvia for another good read and looking forward to the rest of the books.  Hopefully these two lovers will find happiness somewhere along the way.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|In one word: INTENSE!<br />I waited for its release. I craved its sexy wit and dark danger--and it arrived! For me, this was the BEST yet! EWY definitely had excitement, mystery, and most especially love. Eva and Gideon NEEDED this emotional and physical togetherness--particularly WE as readers needed their growth as a couple. I loved the Crossfire closeness, frustrating interruptions, their pain...their fears and even the annoying people around them as they struggled within their extraordinary love. It's what makes them amazing. It's what keeps me enthralled.<br /><br />I loved the plot and the ending. It was subtle, gut twisting, but fulfilling. Gideon was still his dark, sexy self (I mean definite arm candy!). Eva was still youthful and feisty (Love her kick-a** strength!). I can't wait for the next book. Thank you, Sylvia...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Would definitely recommend.  Wish there was another book coming out but will be happy when the movie makes it to the big screen.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|But I did! Great action, not as much gore as I anticipated. I would recommend to young adults and up.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This Ap is a blast.  He gives you a great variety of catagories and is darling to play.  I suggest this Ap.
193700788X|3.0|Very short, predicable. Poor Sookie  has lost her &#34;groove&#34; ! The television show has<br />surpassed Charlaine in writing about our heroine.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is addictive.  Once you get started it is difficult to put it down so you keep moving from one level to another.
B002SQFZ68|1.0|Terrible acoustic at Madison Square! I was totally let down by sound and vocals. Better off to find another DVD. Does not do Bon Jovi justice.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Love the crowd scenes but after having seen the stage  show and hacing listenined to the 'in concert' CDS I felt let down
B008Y79IUE|2.0|I didn't like the book, I liked the movie even less.  Terribly depressing and disjointed - but that's the intentional style of the author, so if that's what you like, then you may like the movie.  Personally, it's not my cup of tea.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Ordered this for my Kindle Fire to watch while using the treadmill to avoid having to turn the TV up so loud.  Plugged in the earbuds & off I went.  An hour was gone before I knew it, spent most of it laughing!  Ripped all the boredom out of treadmill time!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I love scary movies and it's hard to find one that makes me jump.  I jumped a few times in this one!  Would like to have rewrote the ending but it was good and creepy.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Read the book first and then watch the movie.  It is very close to the book but still worth watching even if it leaves out a few things.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Solid amp for anyone looking to listen to their collection in a better manner than stock. I use it with my iPhone and the L9 LOD. Great improvement over straight from the phone. Clearer, crisper highs. Solid mids. Plenty of low end, even on the standard EQ setting.<br /><br />The perfect portable entry amp.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Wonderful story from beginning to end. Will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very well written and great performances from all.
B002LHTRV8|4.0|Good thriller that keeps you guessing.  I enjoy anything Johnny Depp but this is a good serious role. Worth watching a second time !
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works great.  I would recommend this for anyone who needs a replacement cable for any Kindle Fire.  I use it all the time.
B004UXY5D6|5.0|All around awesome album, I will highly recommend this album to all my friends and family!!! 5 stars for sure!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I just finished the entire series 10 minutes ago.. The whole thing was addicting right from the beginning! I'm not one to watch cop shows AT ALL, but this was excellent! The final episode was so well done that I'm still trying to digest it.. I'm usually more into sci fi shows or comedies, but I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something new to watch. I went into it with just giving one episode a chance and that turned into an addiction. I'm glad I read these reviews on amazon and took people's advice! Thanks Amazon Prime and thanks random Shield fans who posted on here! 2 thumbs wayyyy up
B005WUHAX8|5.0|By far the best case you could get for the iphone. Already paid for it self when she droped it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Right now I'm stuck in the middle... Kind a slow point...  The store needs to move on and get with the court proceedings.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a show I was curious about since I am an alien and sci-fi freak.  Not only does it satisfy my inner sci-fi nerd, but the story and characters are very well developed.  Think think sci-fi nerd or not, you could enjoy this show!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Despite the furor over the plot and the leaked copies, l read this book with interest.  It's true you cannot make everyone happy - especially with a finale to a very popular series.  It's most important that the author is happy with her story and all evidence points to her being happy.  I found it a satisfying adventure for Sookie and could happily imagine these characters I've come to enjoy living out their lives after I've put down the book.  Isn't that all we want as fans? The opportunity to imagine that world continuing on once we leave. Good romp, fun to read.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Got it as a gift for someone and as expected it was absolutely amazing. What can I say, his voice is like chocolate. Addictive.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|Best Recorded live album yet Came in perfect condition.New and recorded i used to have it in album but i do need it i have cds
0312641893|5.0|I cant wait to read the second one. I'm so looking forward to it. Such a huge twist on a classic tale.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I bought the first two books right before Christmas. I wasn't ecstatic about waiting for the third book to come out, but hey what other options did I really have? I thought this was the last book, but as most of us have learned it's not. The author can tell a good story, and I'm not thrilled about waiting for the continuation of this story to be released. However, I wouldn't have wanted her to give us a third and final novel that didn't do this story justice. If your really into this novel then there are parts of this book that will cause you to throw the book down and say not very nice things, but I promise you'll pick the book back up and finish where you left off. I won't give up on this story. For those of you giving critical reviews chill out. As my boyfriend reminded me multiple times while reading this \\"it's only a book\\".
B000002H2H|5.0|Need I say more about this cd? One of the greats produced by the greatest thrash \\"at the time\\" and heavy metal bands of all time at no surprise amazon delivered this cd quickly and efficiently thank you for having such an easy at home shopping experience
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I REALLY don't understand the horrible reviews.......? Seeing as how there's going to be two more books, for sure, for Eva and Gideon I don't see how that ending to the book was not as good as the second? I loved it and it was totally worth wait. It's complete torture having to wait so long for the next book to be released, but I'm just thankful there's going to be more!!!!! I'll always recommend to read Angel and Ace's story :) CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of the greatest metallica albums of all time so naturally at no surprise i was happy to buy it again after all of my CDs got stolen it shipped right on time thank you for your cooperation
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Everytime I hear something intriguing or confusing, I've got to wiki it.  The browser on my kindle fire isn't my favorite part of it, so now I've got this amazing app that makes wiki-ing to prove my husband wrong or to find out where the heck Maldives is.  Just as easy to use as wikipedia.org.  Glad I downloaded it!
B001DF68MA|5.0|Love this seat!  Bought it for my 1.5 year old and he loves it!  Solid construction, and for our bikes (Schwinn GS Comfort Bikes) it was an easy install.  The fact that it allows our child to be in front of us and in case of a fall, offers our arms as additional protection was a big selling point.  Please note on a smaller framed bike, if your seat is too low and the child seat is too far back, it might get in the way of your pedaling.
B0027MJU00|3.0|The author truly takes us to the darkest places, in the heartland of America.<br />Sad, so very sad story, of hopeless, wretched lives.<br /><br />I had read her 'Girl Gone' book and hadn't liked it at all. I do not like this book either, but the writing is fast-paced, good. I mean, this is one of those books that make the reader recoil in disgust but at the same time the writing has to be so powerful to invoke feelings like these. It sucks us into those dark places and messes with our heads! Day after, I woke up with a splitting headache and I suspect it was because of this storyline....<br /><br />Such books clearly show us what is wrong, what is right and the limbo phase where nothing feels right or wrong - that what is truly frightening; when one can find no meaning in one's life.<br /><br />I simply hate animal cruelty and there's graphic details on some such stuff, in this book, but I guess that was necessary to show the darkness in the minds of the characters.<br /><br />4/5 for the writing. Dunno what to think about the story rating.
B00BNR6RH4|5.0|Surprisingly very, very good. Not crazy about Live venues on LPs, but this was well done. On a scale of 1-10, I rate this triple album with a 9.2
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Very nice take on the match game genre. Keeps me playing when I need something to do while on trips and such.
1558908846|5.0|ONE OF MY FAV MOVIES I GOT SO EXCITED WHEN I GOT TO RECEIVE THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY ONE ON MY A'S LIST MOST HAVE
B0068LYEHA|5.0|While not all of Moran's arguments are equally strong, they are thought through and rooted in her personal experience.  She is pretty fearless and a great role model for contemporary feminism.  It is an engaging read that lingers long after.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I had to stop reading this because the more I read it the more I began to dislike Tina Fey.  It is very self-consciously clever. Yuck.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I like Matthew McConaughey and movie has a good story line..... nothing too violent or brutle... I enjoyed watching it .... but may not remember it as &#34;great&#34; ... just amusing to watch.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is amazing. It works just as well as any $100+ mouse. It might fell a little cheap but it is a great mouse with some sweet features<br /><br />I thought i would update the review to tell people that its still going strong about 3 months latr
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Awesome cd! If you like old Rolling Stones and old 70's style Aerosmith, you'll love this cd! This is just a great rock record period. Listen to the samples a few times. The songs are well written and stick in your head. This cd is just hard to stop listening to!<br />One of the best rock cd's that has been released in a long time.<br />Tom hit a home run with this one!!

B000LXV9ME|5.0|So, this course teaches about the same things as other goal setting things out there (plus a few extras), but it teaches how to take what I would call \\"a baby's baby steps\\". I have failed at everything in my life historically, because of always biting off more than I could chew, but this course teaches you to take steps so small, you almost feel guilty doing them! Yet Dr. Mauer says this trains the brain for success! Brilliant! This is one course that will not collect virtual dust with me, or be forgotten about sometime down the road. I'm making a lifestyle out of this. You probably should too.

Get Netflix, Amazon and Masterpiece Theatre to change their ways and I will give the show the 5 stars it deserves.<br /><br />This is, as you can guess from the other reviews, a wonderful show.  But my wife and I watched season 1 on Netflix, and then season 2 isn't available?  Amazon took it away and said, &#34;why not sign up for Amazon Prime so you can watch DA season 2 for &#34;free&#34;?&#34;  Ok, so we did that for $79 per year.  THEN, they said, &#34;whoops, season 3 is NOT available on prime.  Now you can pay extra to see the next season SUCKER!&#34;<br /><br />Big business is in a rush to see who can slap us the hardest these days with gotchas, fees and shell games.  Congratulations Amazon, your at the top of my list of companies I currently HATE.<br /><br />If, by chance, you have not seen DA at all, make sure you can get your hands on all 3 seasons before you commit.  It might be easier to buy all three seasons on DVD rather than bounce around and find Amazon with its hand in your financial cookie jar when you want to watch the next episode.<br /><br />Just do us all a favor and don't buy it on Amazon.com...

B00C1CO0XS|5.0|Several weeks ago while perusing Amazon's \\"Upcoming CD Releases\\" I learned of an exciting new album from the ten-time Grammy Award-winning artist George Benson.  Although I am not much of a jazz buff I have always enjoyed Benson's work.  It seems that George has spent the last four years painstakingly developing a tribute to the legendary Nat King Cole.  I have just sampled this disc a couple of times and I must tell you that the results were well worth the wait.  \\"Inspiration:  A Tribute to Nat King Cole\\" can best be described as 47 minutes of recorded bliss.  The old master is clearly on top of his game as he belts out a dozen of the most memorable tunes from the Nat King Cole catalog.  If you are anything like me you will come away clamoring for more.<br /><br />The disc opens with a cute 0:57 snippet of 8 year old Lil' Georgie Benson performing \\"Mona Lisa\\".  I am sure that Ol'  George would be the first to admit that there was no indication here that he would go on to become such an accomplished vocalist!  Track 2 gets down to business and finds Benson offering up a swinging rendition of \\"Just One of Those Things\\" which includes a bit of scat singing.  Fantastic stuff!  Now if you love the music of Nat King Cole as much as I do then you will be happy to learn that some of his all-time biggest hits are included on \\"Inspiration\\".  You are sure to enjoy George's remarkable renditions of such favorites as \\"Walking My Baby Back Home\\", \\"Route 66\\" and \\"Ballerina\\".  There are also a number of interesting duets featuring Judith Hill (\\"Too Young\\"), Wynton Marselis (\\"Unforgettable\\") and the German trumpet sensation Till Bronner (\\"Smile\\").  Meanwhile, George pays homage to the King Cole Trio with a swingin' rendition of \\"Straighten Up and Fly Right\\" that sounds every bit as good as the original!  The disc closes with George's grown-up version of \\"Mona Lisa\\".  He has never sounded better!<br /><br />Since Nat King Cole made so much fabulous music \\"Inspiration:  A Tribute to Nat King Cole\\" is bound to leave you feeling shortchanged and longing for more.  Forty seven minutes is just not enough.  I  purchased my copy of \\"Inspiration\\" at a leading big box retailer that included a couple of terrific \\"bonus tracks\\" exclusive to that store.  You might want to check it out.  Now given the superb quality of this recording I am quite confident that \\"Inspiration\\" will be a rousing success and that a second volume will ultimately be issued.  Meanwhile, I would like to commend all of the talented young musicians from the Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra who accompanied George Benson on this album.  Great work!  It is quite apparent to me that this was a labor of love for everyone involved.  A well-conceived project beautifully executed!  Very highly recommended!Nat King Cole\\" is bound to leave you feeling shortchanged and longing for more.  Forty seven minutes is just not enough.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Spoilers... beware...<br /><br />Dear Nalini,<br /><br />As you know I'm one of your biggest fans. I've read your Psy-Changeling series since the beginning, starting with Slave to Sensation, which is my all time favorite book in this series, although now Heart of Obsidian may tie for that spot. Sascha and Lucas will always hold a special place in my heart. You also know I'm a big fan girl (if not the biggest) for a specific character introduced in Visions of Heat, the second book. This is Kaleb Krychek, a deadly cardinal Tk and one of the heads of the Psy Council who with a blink of an eye can kill a person where they stand. It wasn't until Mine to Possess, book 4, where I started keeping a very close watch on Kaleb. I knew the moment he started sweating on a balcony in that book after an intense workout, I guess you should say my spidey senses tingled. I knew at one point Kaleb would be \\"reformed\\" and become one of your heroes at one point, although the consensus of your readers thought otherwise. I've waited 5 years for Kaleb to be in the spotlight. Finally his time has come in Heart of Obsidian.<br /><br />The main couple of Heart of Obsidian was kept under lock and key, which now I understand why. Revealing the main couple of this book would have many of your readers, including myself, throwing around speculations, specifically regarding the identity of the Ghost. For me, I was more concerned with how Kaleb would be portrayed than the Ghost (which is revealed in a very satisfactory way and had me guessing right up until the very last moment), and if you could give him and his heroine a worthy HEA like you've given all your prior couples. I'm pleased to say that Heart of Obsidian stopped my heart. You continue to get better with every single book you write. I would say Heart of Obsidian is your masterpiece of this series and quite possibly the best book of your career. My crush on Kaleb has changed into full blown awe and love for this man who has defied everything he is and all he has been taught all because of love. Kaleb's goal and true meaning in life isn't to destroy and kill because he was taught by a true sociopath whose goal was to make Kaleb into a cold blooded, heartless killer that even the Psy community would run away in fear of. Kaleb has spent the majority of his life in his own personal hell, which was shown at a very early age through flashbacks here. At the age of twelve he was learning to become ruthless and psychotic, but was able to remain human and keep those morals and feelings that go against his culture, all because of one little girl at the age of five who he meets and becomes friend with. She is Sahara NightStar, the Psy cousin to Faith (the heroine in Vision of Heat) who disappeared at the age of sixteen and is thought to be dead.<br /><br />The way you begin Heart of Obsidian is very crafty. We don't know the name of the woman Kaleb has taken until around page fifty. All we know is that Kaleb has been searching for her for 7 years. She's been abused, tortured and is near catatonic. Kaleb needs her to heal because he has specific plans for her. As what these plans are, all be revealed with a master stroke of writing. The way Kaleb treats this poor woman, who we come to know as Sahara, is incredibly tender. Kaleb's one purpose in life is to keep Sahara away from all harm. He feels Sahara is his and no one ever again is going to take her from him. He lives and breathes revenge against those who have hurt his Sahara and he will make them pay.<br /><br />Eventually Sahara does heal because of Kaleb's care and as she rebuilds her mind that she purposely shut down and becomes strong again. She has major memory loss and has no idea what Kaleb is to her. What she does know is that Kaleb is her protector and she isn't afraid of him. Kaleb is concerned that when Sahara remembers her past and his part in her pain and suffering, she'll reject him. If she does, he can't go on living, and because of that he maydestroy the Net that keeps his people-the Psy alive. Sahara holds the key to his salvation and his plans to create a harmonious future not just for his people, but for Sahara and himself.<br /><br />I've said it before and I'll say it again, you have a way with words and these characters of yours. Heart of Obsidian hit me deep in the gut and swept through my heart like a steam engine. I soaked up every word, every piece of dialogue. I can't stop thinking about Kaleb's and Sahara's interactions. These two are pretty much the anti-Psy because of how strong they feel for one another. I was worried that a romance with two Psy wouldn't work. We've seen one Psy find happiness with a changeling woman in Judd, but Kaleb here puts Judd to shame in the romance department, I'm afraid to say. The way Kaleb feels for Sahara, his hunger for her, is unlike any of your past heroes. Kaleb's feelings for Sahara are so tangible I could taste it. I choked on it. I wanted to choke on it even more.<br /><br />Sahara might just be your strongest heroine of any you have created. She reminds me somewhat of Sasha in how she recovers from her trauma and wants to live and embrace all that life has to offer. She needs her freedom like the air she breathes and I love how Kaleb gave that to her without any question. I loved how she opened her mind, heart, body and soul to Kaleb because she just knew he was her safety net. Kaleb thinks he isn't worthy of Sahara because of what he had to do to succeed and how he was forced to kill and hurt innocent people because of one sadistic individual, his deceased serial killer caretaker.<br /><br />Love indeed heals all wounds and Heart of Obsidian is an example of this. It's an epic romance. Kaleb and Sahara's love is poetic and breathtaking, including steamy and sexy. The love scenes crackle, and how Kaleb literately made the earth move for Sahara when they were intimate was a nice payoff.<br /><br />I would say Heart of Obsidian completes the main story arc you set for this series. It's very well played, and yet I want more. Kaleb and Sahara's HEA is pure gold. This is one book that I will hold close to my chest and bow down to its creator because it's that good and embodies what a true romance should be. Take a bow, you deserve it.<br /><br />Katiebabsdestroy the Net that keeps his people-the Psy alive.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|After seeing so many adverse reviews to A Feast for Crows, I was surprised to find that the book was much better than I thought it would be. It was a long and sometimes tedious read, especially since the POV's of many of my favorite characters were not present. Most likely I would have felt differently about AFFC if I had to wait five years for the book and another six years for A Dance with Dragons. Fortunately I have both books and able to read and apprieciate the plotline as one tandem andcontinuous story.<br /><br />This far in, there are few characters for me to root for except for my favorites, Jon, Danerys, and Arya, so I could read AFFC with a without much expectation and as the long, winding story that unfolded. I still despise the Lannisters and it was quite satisfying to see Jaime betray Cersei.<br /><br />I just did not take to the Greyjoys or to the Dorne plotline, though it was interesting to learn that her father had planned to marry Arianne and Viserys; that would have been quite a pairing. Overall, I found the slow pace of the plot allowed me sit back and look at the story from a different perspective angle then seque right into the fifth book. Though a bit weaker in pacing and plotting that the first three books, A Feast for Crows was a faily good read.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|The story line was weak and not the page turner as the first two novels.  Not sure I'll read the next in the series..

B004G0DN7W|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time since the 70's and it held up to the test of time pretty good for a science fiction movie.  As with things like Star Trek and the like , you can see some cheesy props but all in all a pretty good script, good acting and a fun movie.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Awful... just awful. I am soo utterly disappointed. I waited and waited for this book... I even knew she was making more than 3 .. but this story is inexcusable..... way to.go.Sylvia... you made me HATE EVA... we r supposed to root for the couple.. not wish the male character would run.away screaming! I.mean brett? REALLY??? Just nonsense filler.to create angst THAT ISNT THERE! And Cary is a.HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING... NO REDEEMING qualities that would make.me.care what the heck he does or what happens.to him. The book.should have focused on Gideon and Eva working thru the fact THAT HE KILLED FOR HER... yet I am.supposed to believe she feels sexual for brett!? Oh but u looooove Gideon... NEVERMIND THE FACT I REPEAT.. HE KILLED FOR U!!!! Wtf!!!! I am.sooo pissed... this could have been.a great ending to.a.beautiful love story... instead we get this GARBAGE! I repeat GARBAGE.<br />. ALL FOR THE PUBLISHER AND MS. DAY to be.more greedy than necessary... NO THANKS... MS DAY CONGRATULATIONS on SELLING OUT TO THE MAN... have respect in your work... this is not acceptable... especially withal the people that loved this series... and couldn't wait for this book... ugh... save your money people... read KRISTEN ASHLEYS NEW BOOK FIRE INSIDE... Ms day could.learn a few things.about how to NOT SELL OUT when signed to.a.publisher.. and how to write a beautiful flawed.romance...ugh SOOO UPSET
B00CWV8X04|4.0|This movie was different than what we thought it was going to be.  The acting was good and we definitely liked the twists in the plot.  If you watch the trailer or read the movie description it doesn't accurately show what it really is about.  Worth watching.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I love Stephen King books and in the usual King tradition this book had all the goodies except for a couple things.  First, why are the kids so foul mouthed?  Is this how he sees kids these days in his mind?  How can I feel any attachment to a kid that I just want to put over my knee and then wash his mouth out with soap?  Maybe the real Stephen King was abducted by the aliens he likes to write about :)
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This story was well portrayed and informative.  Many people are unaware of those events and the people involved. Good job.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|mostly not very predictable, good story line, good acting, enjoyable from beginning to end. one of those films you can see more than once
B002W1UEW4|3.0|If you're looking for action and don't care much about the storyline itself then it would be good.  Didn't really develop the characters enough for me.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Clearly someone has given Ms. Day some bad advice.  Consumers do not like to be lied to.  This series was billed as a trilogy and clearly that has changed.  I liked the first two books and started reading this book thinking it was the end of the series.  I quickly realized that Ms. Day was not building to a climactic ending but another over promised, likely under-delivered book.  Here is the good news:  This is a trilogy to me.  No more Crossfire books and certainly no more Sylvia Day.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Some have said it was just about rich people.  Except for the very end when they left the country I didn't think about that at all.  It was hard to watch because of the destruction.  It really paid honor to the Sri Lankan people who were out there right away helping strangers.<br /><br />I thought it was a really good movie!  Acting was superb.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Fast shipping! Loved the movie as well, it was really good, I recommend seeing it, but pay attention to the movie! got lost on a couple parts with not paying attention, but was a decent movie.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie was so hilarious. It was an enjoyable movie for myself, husband, and kids. It kept all of our attention. It was also a very touching movie I recommend to anyone with or without kids.
B00CSSS2V6|5.0|This is an Amazing triple live album, by my favorite solo band lineup that Paul ever had! It captures what I consider Wings' Classic Lineup, (Paul & Linda, Denny Lane On Rhythm Guitar, The Late, Great Jimmy McCulloch on Lead Guitar & Joe English on Drums) at their peak, on their 1976 Bicentennial tour for Wings At The Speed Of Sound that became the movie Rockshow! The album had just exploded on the charts thanks to Silly Love Songs & Let 'Em In, & Paul & the band did the perfect mixture of Wings' & Beatles' Classics! It has been newly remastered, & like the others in the new Archive Collection the sound is Incredible! It's much more full & clear sonically on both ends! All of that said, DO NOT buy the MP3s, as they are BADLY messed up! 1/2 of the tracks, once the music ends, have a blank spot in the crowd noise for 2-3 seconds! And it's not just that it's not seamless because the crowd noise comes back on for more than a few seconds before the track ends. It's like spots just got erased! I couldn't take it anymore by the end of Disc 1, & I went out & bought the physical CD! I wish there was a way to get a refund in this case!
B004PGAQMW|5.0|This movie was action packed and kept my family's attention. This movie was worth the purchase and my kids enjoyed it.

B003QP2TYQ|4.0|I would give this a five if it worked.  The series is fantastic, pretty faithful to Dickens and well acted. Others can give more detail.<br /><br />Here's the thing. I had it on DVD but gave it to a friend because I liked it well enough to buy the blu ray.  Alas, I did not find any info explaining that it's region 2, UK only, so I can't play it on my American player.  I checked again and the info was not there.  I blame Amazon.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  It is not your typical circus read.  Combines magic, drama, and deception into a love story.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Excellent storyline.  They did a very great interpretation of the book.  They only changed a few things that were not as significant to the story.
B000I9YX06|1.0|This movie has some of the worst writing I've ever seen. Everything Will Smith says is a snarky joke about something, and nothing he does in the film is consistant with his back story and is only to make the movie seem like it's witty. Every character is a 1 Dimension cliche' cop drama character; from the cop with a bad attitude but a heart of gold to the police chief who for some reason wastes all of his time and energy with just ONE cop in an entire city.<br /><br />The CGi doesn't stand the test of time, which is a shame because they center the whole movie around it, putting no effort into character or plot. Bridget Moynahan plays a better robot with her stiff lifeless acting then the terrible robot animation that moves way too fluidly. Also, Shia Labeouf is in this doing the exact same character he does in every movie he's in, but his role is this movie is basically the same as Denny from The Room.<br /><br />The action sequences keep going to bullet time in moments that in no way call for it. There's just a scene of the robot jumping, and they go bullet time only to make it seem cooler but only makes you realize this director has no idea what he's doing. The most annoying thing about this whole movie is that Will Smith is the ONLY person in the WHOLE world who's put off by robots. Not one other character wishes to drive their own cars, do their own chores, and NO one seems to mind that artificial intelligence is taking jobs from humans. Will Smith even mentions this, and no where in the movie is this regarded as an issue. Literally this entire world feels fake because there seem to be to conflicts what so ever, and if Will Smith's character wasn't here, nothing would have ever happened.<br /><br />The three laws of robotics are like something a 12 year old came up with. Why would everyone trust a major corporation so much? These robots run their lives now, and no one is worried that a mirror to Apple has put themselves into every aspect of people's lives. It'slike they could flip a switch to turn off the 3 laws of robots, and then Robot Apple rules the world. Seriously, why is no one else suspicious of this company?<br /><br />The characters make no sense, the action is boring and predictable, and this whole thing feels like Michael Scott wrote it about himself.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very cute movie.  Loved the storyline and the movie progresses quite well.  It's one of those family friendly movies also made for adults.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|I LOVE THIS LIL CPU. AT ITS PRICE POINT ITS A DEAL IF UR PUTTING TOGETHER A BUDGET PC.  THIS CPU ALONG WITH THE MSI AMD A55 MicroATX DDR3 1600 370 Motherboards FM2-A55M-E33  WITH 4GB OF RAM DOES A GREAT JOB. THIS IS GREAT FOR ENTRY LEVEL PC GAMERS WERE AS U DONT NEED A GRAPHICS CARD TO PLAY GAMES ON LOW SETTING!
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|I saw this movie many years ago when it first came out and enjoyed it then.  Very suspenseful and not a lot of needless blood and gore.  I just watched it again recently with my 9 year old son and we both enjoyed it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's a lot of fun. A bit time consuming and addictive but your bored time will be spent doing something.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Loved this movie!  Story was fresh, entertaining and emotional.  Acting by all was superb.  Can definitely understand why Jennifer Lawrence won the best actress Oscar for her performance.
B0031TZ9KS|4.0|I found the book worth reading for those who are interested on understanding a little more of how autism is experienced from those who has it. It is also very entertaining.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|There were several funny moments in this movie, but also lots of annoying whining from the main characters.  It was hard to feel sorry for the main characters in this movie...they don't exactly have a rough lot in life.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|The book is very unique for its account of dementia from the point of view of who suffers from it. Memory is something puzzling and even more so is its loss. The book is very worth reading for those who are interested in the complexities of the brain and how little we understand of it. That said, it is a fiction book, not scientific writing, but based for most part on real research.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|What is everyone complaining about on this album? No it is not Killing is My Business but it is very easy to listen to the entire album and styles range from slow and heavy on tracks like Forget to Remember to fast on Kingmaker. This is another awesome Megadeth album for your collection do not believe the bad reviews, this album is awesome.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|Very cool movie loved it from the beginning to the end. That is New Years Eve is all about wishes do come true at midnight. If you have not seen the movie do you will love it.

B003XQM2YU|5.0|It was a great plot about how Robin Hood came to be who he was and live in the forest.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|For the Christian, you will be disappointed in the direct connection to Jesus.  It is not there.  Although a professed Christian, the author provides no  insight to the relevance of Christianity.  Whether intentional or just honest, I was left with more questions than answers.  The book clearly supports the belief that we will continue to live spiritually after our bodily death.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book even though it might have walked along a darker path. I liked how Ms. Singh illustrated that love for someone can make them strive to be better or at least be better for the person that loves them.
