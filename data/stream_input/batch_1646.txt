B0085MNZ66|4.0|I normally don't review games but wanted to balance the poor reviews of what I found to be an enjoyable puzzle with a twist.  I almost did not download based on the bad reviews - am glad I did.  Mixing colors gives this game adds a different challenge to what is basically a Flow-like game.  No problems on running on Galaxy SII or Fire.  Lack of a back button more of an issue on the Fire than the SII; I'm surprised Amazon didn't ask developer to add to the game screen for Kindle market.  Still this is a minor issue.  Minus 1 star for lack of any instructions.  Just a color  wheel somewhere would help folks who don't remember 4th grade science!<br /><br />If you are stuck on level 6 - only yellow is paired to itself.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I have read the first two books in this trilogy and I am working on finishing the third. I was a little reluctant to see the movie in theaters because of the subject matter. I am a mom, after all. I did eventually go see the movie with my teenager and I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie did have its tense moments but there was nothing gratuitous about it. I felt that everything depicted was very appropriate for the PG-13 rating that the movie received. That said, when the movie came out on blu ray, I was happy to purchase it. The package included a digital copy of the movie, which I always love to have.

B006LSZECO|4.0|To put it simply, I enjoyed this book. I will say that I was disapointed in the ending. I wanted more from the husband, I wanted him to stand up and put an end to this chick.  I need a part two!!
B0058PJ6NE|3.0|I used the free app worked.great. So I bought the Pro version. Thacts pretty much when it started working sometimes . Waiting for fix. Downloadded updates did not fix.:-):-(
B00871C09S|4.0|This thriller takes place almost entirely in one room of a Greenwich Village apartment where photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. The only change of scene is provided by the views that Jefferies has of the apartments opposite. The film was made in 1954 and was directed by Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />Jefferies suspects that one of the tenants opposite, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), has done away with his nagging wife. At first, his girl-friend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and his home-help nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) think he's imagining it - just bored by his inactivity. But soon the pair become convinced that he might be onto something - no doubt looking for a little excitement themselves. The local detective that Jefferies phones, Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), who is a friend of his, takes a great deal more convincing that something is amiss.<br /><br />The excitement in the movie arises from the attempts of the trio (Jefferies, Lisa and Stella) to get more convincing evidence, and Thorwald's response to the confrointation. Despite the monotony of the surroundings, reflecting perfectly Jefferies' boredom, the plot is quite gripping.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had so many twists and turns in it, I could have read it in one sitting. Definitely recommend!
6304907648|4.0|The story involves two serial killers and the detectives Mary Jane Monahan (Holly Hunter) and Reuben Getz (Dermot Mulroney) who bring them to justice with the help of a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver). The problem is that before the first killer Daryll Lee Callum is caught, he torments, terrifies and nearly kills Dr Hudson. As a result, Hudson is agoraphobic and, unsurprisingly, a bit neurotic. This makes her an unreliable expert in the eyes of the police captain. Callum is subsequently caught and torments Hudson further from jail, but now another psychopath has entered the picture using methods of previous serial killers for his own MO. The film is very tense, the plot feasible and the acting, especially of Sigourney Weaver, excellent. The film was directed by Jon Amiel and the incidental music composed by Christopher Young.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have mincraft xbox edition and I have been waiting for minecraft pocket edition to come up on the kindle fire. The game is awesome but the lava is not flowing and their is no buckets to collect milk, water, or lava. But I still love it. Its worth paying $7 for.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is by far a five star game!!! It is challenging just enough to make you stop and think without making you frustrated or bored. The music is enchanting, the game is engaging,  and my mind is perfectly relaxed. I rarely ever buy games and almost never write reviews,  but this game is masterfully designed, and beautifully executed. Really well done. Even the minute details, such as the level names, achievements, sound effects, tips, and in-game animations, are just right...clever but subtle, never intrusive, yet there when you need them. By far the best &quot;zen&quot; type game I've ever played. If I had anything to add,  it would only be that I am so into this game that I'm afraid I will play through approximately all fourty or so levels this afternoon,  so I must pace myself until you come out with another....though it's easy to wait for a game of true quality like this one!! Please keep doing what you do...taking your time to make games that are truly worthy of spending a part of our lives playing. Thanks!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|As I was reading the reviews, one said, \\"stop reading the reviews and just read it. It is great!\\". I second that. You actually don't want to know a thing about the story or it will ruin it. Just read it, it is smart and intriguing.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but I like all these nonfiction style military books.  A good book to read on an airplane.
B0050DZN4K|1.0|Cannot log into Google account from the latest Kindle Fire. Waste of time downloading this app. Disappointing to say the least.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The Time Keeper by Mitch Album was good!! This is all I have to say about this book. A good read.
B007SXB498|5.0|Having a ball reading Jane Austen! I really appreciate the downloads in Kindle form.  I can make up my mind about the book I want to read and one minute later I can start!!
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|Okay. I know how much people have been complaining this wasn't the full version of the game, but that's what had me think \\"Um....What?\\" toward you guys. Yes, it doesn't really label itself as a demo, and I'll take a star off for that, but come ON. It's a FREE trial to see you like it, so you can go GET the full version for a little bit of money! Is a few bucks too much for ask for, especially considering the game is a sequel to Pac-Man World Rally, a game that was on SHELVES for $20-30?<br /><br />Anyway, the game itself is pretty fun. There's a nice little variety of tracks and characters, and the basic gameplay is not unlike that of other mascot kart racers like Mario Kart, which is a good thing, considering there obviously isn't a Mario Kart on Android, now is there? I'm pretty sure it's not wrong for Pac-Man to fill in the gap (Heck, Mario Kart Arcade GP featured Pac-Man characters and tracks to begin with).<br /><br />One problem I have with the game is its item selection. It just doesn't really feel as robust or creative as Mario Kart's. It's rather uninspired.<br /><br />But all in all, definitely get Pac-Man Kart Rally! If you're on the fence about the full game, download this demo version (But don't assume it's the full game like many other people did).
B008AS5UAO|5.0|Whoever masterminded this recording has taken the task seriously. It's been a long time since Don Giovanni was accorded a cast entirely filled by major vocal stars. The most recent Dons have tended to be period performances (e.g., from Gardiner, Harding, and Jacobs), with the emphasis on dramatic vitality over stellar singing, although the three versions I've cited have very good singing. Here there seems to be a conscious effort to return to the era of Giulini's classic EMI set, which assembled the best singers for each part that the great European opera houses could deliver. On this new Don the stars may not be household names, but it would be hard to argue that Europe - and in one case, America - could provide a better cast.<br /><br />The overture acquaints us with the prevailing style, with vibratoless strings and light, period-influenced textures. Nezet-Seguin's strong suit, I think, is opera, and he manages his forces with confidence and energy. He often takes measured tempos in order to support the inner drama of the characters. HIPness only tinges this performance; it is recognizably a modern-day rendition, not an \\"authentic\\" one. First up in one of the best singers that the general public doesn't really know, Italian baritone Luca Pisaroni, who has a strong voice, fine musicality, and dramatic presence. It's unusual to find a Leporello whose voice is so much lighter in color than the don's, yet in the modern vein, this peasant sidekick isn't played for comedy so much as lower class resentment, so the comic effect isn't present.<br /><br />DG has placed its faith - and considerable risk - in Ildebrando D'Arcangelo, having released a solo disc of Mozart arias preceding this Don G. The voice is dark and suave, a caffe mocha without milk, and D'Arcangelo's ace in the hole, besides a strong stage presence, is that he's capable of sounding sleek and seductive. I can't think of a basso Don who has exuded such vocal command since the days of Cesare Siepi. Hearing unusual vocal colors continues with the choice of Diana Damrau as Donna Anna, a role mostly assigned to dramatic sopranos - it was even undertaken by Birgit Nilsson - and rarely, in my experience, to a coloratura soprano, although there is the category of dramatic coloratura. Damrau, who sings the Queen of the Night, has come to fit Donna Anna's deeper, weightier range. Even better, she flashes and sparkles in a role that often becomes a bore.<br /><br />Pausing here for the moment, since these are the singers we meet in the first scene, the promise of starry casting is certainly fulfilled - every number proceeds with such dramatic confidence and (mostly) ease of production that you cannot help but be impressed. In addition, this is a real performance of the opera, despite deriving from the concert hall. As the string of stars continues to unfold - Villazon as Don Ottavio, Mojca Erdmann as Zerlina, Joyce Didonato as Donna Elvira - the ambitions of an all-star Don Giovanni are beautifully fulfilled. Even Masetto sounds like he could step up and do quite a respectable Don himself.<br /><br />As much as I've focused on the vocalism, and as superb as it is, what really impresses here is every singer's ability to act with the voice. In \\"Dalla sua pace\\" Villazon is far from the usual lyric tenor, and sticklers may detect some vocal strain and a bit of lunging (also true with Damrau), but how well Villazon turns a cardboard figure into a man in love with real feeling for his lover's distress. The human dimension holds true form top to bottom in the cast. Deficits? Only the lack of humor, which is deliberate in a performance that eschews stagy winks and nods. This is far more \\"dramma\\" than \\"gicoso.\\"<br /><br />In all, this is the closest to a classic Don Giovanni on the grand scale (with a few nods to musical fashion) that we've had since the heyday of Giulini, or perhaps going back as far as Furtwangler. I am deeply impressed.<br /><br />Ildebrando D'Arcangelo (Don Giovanni), Luca Pisaroni (Leporello), Diana Damrau (Donna Anna), Joyce DiDonato (Donna Elvira), Rolando Villaz&oacute;n (Don Ottavio), Mojca Erdmann (Zerlina), Konstantin Wolff (Masetto), Vitalij Kowaljow (Il Commendatore)<br /><br />Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guini), Luca Pisaroni (Leporello), Diana Damrau (Donna Anna), Joyce DiDonato (Donna Elvira), Rolando Villaz&oacute;n (Don Ottavio), Mojca Erdmann (Zerlina), Konstantin Wolff (Masetto), Vitalij Kowaljow (Il Commendatore)<br /><br />Mahler Chamber Orchestra, Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin
6304698798|5.0|This is the best western that I have ever seen and the civil war section was extremely realestic. I was impressed with this production.
1594203334|5.0|I loved this book. I have already started using a lot of methods with my daughter and can see great improvements in her behavior. Especially when it comes to food. Today, my very picky daughter ate a chicken sandwich with avocado, brie and sun-dried tomatoes, no fights no tantrums. And she ordered from the regular menu, not the disgusting \\"Kid's Menu\\" of PB & J, pizza and grilled cheese.<br /><br />It is definitely harder to implement this things when you are surrounded with so many close-minded people (West Texas), but you just have to keep trying and forget about everyone else.
B0085MNZ66|3.0|This game sounded very interesting, but it cannot open on my rooted Bionic running stock ICS. I get an instant force close. Too bad! :(

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books, I am 57yrs old and found the books exciting, I fell in love with the characters, and was hard to put down, they are pretty explicit sexually, and a little over done in that dept but overall these books were great! Loved how she keeps you hanging between books, and loved the ending!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Enjoyed playing the levels on this game very much. Some were challenging enough to do over again to better my time (for my own satisfaction). One of the better mahjong apps out there.
B005IQZB14|3.0|This book was a little too descriptive for me and a bit tedious after awhile.  It really is beautifully written, but not very exciting, plot wise.  I think if you are a mountain climber or hiker, it would be more interesting.  Having said that, the heroine does come to understand herself and chases her demons away while undergoing an unbelievable endurance contest with the Pacific Crest Trail. There are some profound moments of realization near the end of the book and for that reason, I gave it 3 stars.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was inspired by the story of hard work and dedication to be a Navy Seal. It is also inspiring to read of the motives behind the writing of the book, to set the record straight, and giving the profit from sales to charity. It was a good book, and the Pentagon, and Obama's administration are spoiled , hypocrite., crybabies for taking issue with the book.
B00471JSR4|2.0|... it's just too much going on for me. The plot is okay. But, geeez there are explosions left right and center. It just over the top technical. The story is totally lost in all those \\"WOW\\" moments. Too much sugar and coffain for me ...
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Got this bag for free when ordering my Nikon-D5100. The bag is nicely padded, has waist/chest straps, multiple pockets and is set up so you can safely secure your SLR from the get go. In addition to holding your camera, there is plenty of space for additional lenses and equipment. I'd give it five stars, but I need to see how well it wears over time and I'm also keeping an eye on how well it holds the camera in place - I'm thinking about rearranging the pocketry so the camera sits on the bottom of the bag rather than the top, but I'm thinking there's a reason they set it up this way.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The story read just like fiction, however true.  Good detail and well written.  Only a real Seal can describe the dedication to our country and protecting US lives and truly describe the events first hand.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|I bought it for my 4 year old daughter and she's thrilled with it. The extra short featuring Aileen Quinn's recollections was charming. I like the casting, especially Finney and Quinn. As for the movie, I think most adults will find it kind of pokey. Wish it was a widescreen version.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A spellbinding read! One of those \\"can't put it down\\" books that makes you postpone whatever it is that you should be doing
B008RYN44U|5.0|To me, \\"Push and Shove\\" is a great pop record by a great pop band. I put it easily on par with Duran Duran's excellent \\"All You Need is Now\\" from last year in terms of making 80s/90s era music sound fresher and better than ever.<br /><br />So if you are fan of 80's and 90's pop, you'll likely love \\"Push and Shove\\". Yes, as other ND fans have stated over and over, it's not the raw punk/ska sound of earlier efforts. But if you liked their remake of Talk Talk's \\"It's My Life\\" you'll love \\"Push and Shove\\".<br /><br />Do I love this album? Unabashedly, yes. I haven't stopped listening to it in its entirety since I got it earlier this week. It has its literal and figurative \\"hooks\\" in me -- and if nothing else, this is an album full of familiar-feeling and strong song hooks. Going back now for yet another spin on the old ipod...
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Book was ok. Lot's of what I would characterize as filler leading up to the raid. Leon Panetta wanted to make an example of the author for revealing Seal tactics. Nothing in this book regarding tactics has not already been previously covered in other books of this type. Panetta should get over himself. Thanks to all the Seals who do so much for our country.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|So what is [[ASIN:B008K6HN8I ES File Explorer]], and why would you need it on a Kindle Fire or the newer Kindle Fire HD series? The Kindle Fire doesn't include a good file manager app, but this one works exceptionally well on this tablet device and other for help with navigating the directories and much more.<br /><br />Windows users can look at this ES File Explorer as the equivalent of the Windows Explorer file management application and navigation tool that has been the operating system from Windows 95 on. Mac users should think of it being like the Finder on the Mac OS and OS X operating systems, which is responsible for the overall user-management of files and such. If you've never used the Windows Explorer on your PC or the Finder on your Mac, then in all honesty you might find this app to be of little use.<br /><br />Speaking subjectively, I had downloaded this app in its earlier version here for the primary purpose of easily finding files on my Kindle Fire, and copying PDF files to the 'Documents' directory. Have also used it to upload a variety of JPG images to the 'Pictures' directory when I have photos to review with clients and friends, and it really works quite well with tasks like this.<br /><br />If you download and install it, you'll find that the interface is deceptively smooth and easy to operate if you're used to using file management on a PC and on a Mac. But it can be somewhat dangerous in operation if you don't use common sense: if you don't know what you're poking at, leave it alone.<br /><br />In addition to performing file management duties, some use it for installing third-party apps, for installing \\"sideloaded\\" apps onto the Kindle Fire, as there are wide variety of compatible apps from the Android market on the 'Net. In that sense, this app is probably the best available for those who want to take the Kindle Fire to the 'geek' level when looking for more from this device. But again, if you're unsure as to what you're doing, don't poke at it.<br /><br />There are similar apps available here, such as [[ASIN:B00872WN58 File Manager (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B004VMY62Q File Expert]]; some are free and some are paid. If you are considering file management for your Kindle Fire, then these two are worth considering as well, but explore the features offered by each of them and see what best fits your personal needs. If you have a Kindle Fire HD device, be sure to check and see if the app is compatible, as it may change.<br /><br />This review is based on my current use of ES File Explorer version 1.6.2.0, and features can change with new implementations and upgrades. Setup is very easy, but check out the images posted by the developer and you can see some of what this app can do for you.<br /><br />If you own a Kindle Fire or the newer Kindle Fire HD device, [[ASIN:B008K6HN8I ES File Explorer]] is an excellent file manager, and it's a free app here. There are hundreds of similar apps, some paid and some free, but this one beats many of them in terms of speed, features and stability. The integration is seamless and using it is very intuitive.

B009CPEOC4|4.0|You are invited to join Katy Perry on the 'California Dreams' World Tour, in this story based and musically infused documentary/drama directed by Dan Cutforth. Perry is lifted straight up onto the stage and begins to command the audience. Kinda like an explosion, kinda like a cartoon playing out, kinda like a bunch of kids in a candy store and totally like Katy Perry.<br /><br />Because this is in the form of a semi-documentary I took a chance on this one.  Instead of a concert I found a spectacle: of lighting, of color, of the costumes and a total cast of characters together for this event. Although, most of all I got to know a hardworking  woman who states of herself, \\"I feel a real connection to Fairy Tales\\" and \\"I just wanna be the first Katy Perry!\\".<br /><br />From where Perry is today, one of the most colorful young women out there who dares to be different, it's a far reach to see how she arrived at the top.<br /><br />Being brought up in a strict Pentecostal family and having a father who is a preacher, she began singing at a very young age.  Katy was given a guitar of her own at thirteen and started writing her own music.<br /><br />Katy had a dream for herself from the tender age of three; to be in glitter with everyone watching her.  Now with that dream fulfilled, she wants to \\"give people a heart full of happiness and a dream for a lifetime\\".  She teamed with manager Bradford Cobb and shot off like a rocket with her first charting hit.<br /><br />In no way has her path been easy.  Her determination, focus and drive got her right to where she is now, while taking some curves along the way.  One in the direction of marriage to Russell Brand (\\"Get Him to the Greek\\").  They fell in love deeply and quickly, as Katy states;  \\"I honestly thought I had found the love of my life\\".<br /><br />As Katy is performing show after show all over the world, she is also jetting back home routinely to be with Brand.  Her grueling pace takes a toll on her happy life; although Brand signed-on at the outset with full knowledge of her record and upcoming tour. He files for a divorce from a devastated Perry, who is broken down and in tears behind a packed stadium of her fans awaiting her.<br /><br />While this is the stuff that may flatten a woman, Katy gets up and comes straight out onstage again.  She adores her fans as much as they do her and they feed off each others strengths in a magnetic cyclical motion.  Katy Perry is all about happiness, color and light, giving it to her fans at all costs.gh Brand signed-on at the outset with full knowledge of her record and upcoming tour.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|The Jack Reacher series is always an entertaining ride. Lee Child has done it again! The character of Reacher is so finely tuned, and has a delightful sense of humor. I've enjoyed all the books, but the story line in this one is absolutely brilliant. Very nice development of characters, and very original plot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderfull, Amazing Read. I loved the last of the Trilogy, In my opinon it was the best. Christian makes a complete turn around, And Ana, to find a love like that is wonderfull.
B004AQR24W|1.0|i watched this and i do not know why, it was not a very good movie, no plot, no charm, so so action
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day takes the reader not only into the Osama Bin Laden take down but also into the battles that rarely make the headlines, each one a move in a masterful game of chest that has been being played for over 10 years.  Of course I wanted to know the details of OBL death but this book was so much more than that.  If it was possible this book has made me even more respectful of the dedication and hard work our American troops.  This is a \\"Must Read\\" book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It was an awesome game and the thing I liked the most. about this game. I s that it has more than 1 game in it and instead of wasting your money one one hundred. more games its all in one
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I read this book on Kindle for my book club. You know from the beginning this is more than what meets the eye. It was a great book with excellent character development. It is told from the point of view of many different people; and the glimpses of life in India is fascinating and intriguing. This was an excellent book.
B0085MNZ66|1.0|do not waste your time downloading this app.  it is beyond awful.  why do you (amazon) even put games like this on market?
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|I feel this book is very much on par with others by Clancy within the Jack Ryan series.  It's a welcome change from being knee deep in espionage to talking small team tactics.  Highly recommended read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has a great story line. Yes it has a lot of explicit sexual content but the story line makes it a must read. I couldn't wait for the second one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|you just don't want to stop. fun-just like the arcade game. I ordered. this after reading. the. other reviews. get it for yourself to use anytime you want to kill time.

B00943SQCI|5.0|I was a big fan of the original show of Dark shadows.  In fact I have it on my Instant que from Netflix.  This movie was a great remake.<br /><br />I loved the music on it.  It brought back memories of the music I listened to when I was a lot younger.  The acting was great and the story line was easy to follow.<br /><br />It looks like there may be a sequel and I hope if there is, it is as good as the first one.<br /><br />I have this one downloaded on my Kindle Fire and watch it often.  I really like this movie.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Visually pleasing. An interesting and dedicated game. I love the music, graphics, and game setup. The difficulty level is also just about right, so that I can stick to the end and still feel challenged. My favorite part&#65306; love the idea that im a rain drop sliding back and forth.
034580404X|5.0|I really didnt know what the book was going to be like, I only heard that everyone was reading it. I'm not into reading because I have a hard time finding something that catches my interest, but WOW. This trilogy is AMAZING, and not at all for the sexual scenes. I love the story behind it. I was so intrigued by the books, that's all I would do in my spare time. I finished the trilogy in less than a week because I just couldnt put the books down, that's all I wanted to go was find out what was going to happen next. I REALLY REALLY hope they come out with movies...I will go see in theaters and buy them. I recommend these books to anyone.
B00846REIS|5.0|I would recommend had my attention from page 1.  Can,t wait for the next book in the series. Reminds me of 50 shades of gray but from the man's point of view

B009IF7092|5.0|The premier episode of the sixth season of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" is as good as the last season's final episode. The writers have stayed true to form with the characters. Leonard and Penny are in a \\"weird\\" place after Leonard's proposal to Penny during \\"coitus\\", and Bernedette and Howard are starting their new life - not together, however, since Howard is in space at the International Space Station. Amy and Sheldon are moving forward, as slowly as possible from Sheldon's point of view. And poor Raj - still a lonely guy, now without his best and closest friend, Howard. Raj and Stuart are becoming \\"better\\" friends. We will see where that goes!<br /><br />Overall, a natural continuation of season five, and positively done.
B00448VST6|5.0|Very funny movie. laughter all the way to the end.  You have to see it, to believe that there could be a league of evil ex boyfriends.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|cute and fun. Gameplay is similar to Angry Birds but with some extra physics elements thrown in to mix it up

B008RNGCAO|4.0|I really enjoyed it. a great batman storyline. gritty, insightful, beautiful writing and striking images. cant wait to start the next one
B00095NX9G|5.0|love it! packed with routine and drills. the yoga feels great. she really gave a lot for arm legs and body movement.
B0085MNZ66|1.0|I have a Droid HTC Thunderbolt and all I see on the screen are two dots on a white grid. Someone said something about arrows but there aren't any. Waste of time.
0374531943|4.0|This book is both fascinating and tedious.  Mike Collins is a very good writer and does a great job of describing the system and people at NASA, especially the astronauts.  His many anecdotes on incidents and happenings can really give you an insight and appreciation for the space program and everything that was involved in getting man into space.  Having said that, the many technical details are very heavy reading for anyone who doesn't have as brilliant an engineering mind as he obviously does.  If you can just skip over all those details, it's still a good read and will leave you in awe of the achievements of man in science, as well as a personal look at the people involved and the toll on their lives.
B008602KQI|4.0|Did the best they could turning this from book to movie.good acting and cinematography Very happy with purchase of movie
0425263908|5.0|Similar story to 50 Shades but much better. The characters are more human and believable. The author leaves the story unfinished so ensuring readers who like it will buy the second book. Looking forward to follow up.
0316228532|1.0|Oy vey--this book is a mess. It is dreadfully dull.  I will slog through it somehow this year, so all is not lost but--I will never believe that Ms. Rowling wrote it.  No way.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First of all the book was well written took less than two days to read (about 4 hours) I got more than what I expected, the life story included. Considering that the author did his best to scramble military proprietary items and still tell the truth about the action, well done.  God bless our military people.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome but I cant get it since I dint have a us credit card help me please no money would be taken but their still need it dunces.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I had heard of Christopher Hitchens before reading this little book, but had not read any of his works.  Hitchens was about 12 years younger than me when he was diagnosed with cancer, yet many of the dilemmas he confronted are those I'm facing on a slower timeline: my body's inability to stand up to the rigors I used to take for granted; feeling really good some days and other days not have the energy to do much of anything; aches and pains that don't always respond to medications, etc.  These were not issues I had to contend with when I was in my early 60's.  My impression from Hitchen's writing is a speeding up of the final developmental issues we all must face if we live long enough and have, or take, the time to contemplate our own death.  He lived in tumorville.  Many of us end up in some kind of \\"ville\\" before we die.  And, each in our own way, attempt to come to terms with the stark reality that we are not getting out of this alive.  And, like the final section of the book, we leave a lot of things unfinished and in mid-sentence.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|I don't know why I gave this game four stars instead of only one! I mean, it's original and entertaining, BUT...I usually like games that provide all the answers for me at the beginning of the level, so rather than actually have to think, I can simply mindlessly tap on my screen. I think i have adult ADD, or maybe I'm just a dolt. My favorite app is the one where you press a button on the side of your device and the whole screen lights up with pretty colors! Why can't we make apps like THAT!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you think you know what is<br />Going on with a character, your entire view is shattered.  Very clever book and hard to put down. Quirky at the very least.
B0011Z8SHK|5.0|My favorite Deep Purple album and one of the best rock albums of all time, a must have for those now \\"Classic Rockers\\" out there,
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of the best books I have read.  As a retired Marine, I found it to be fantastic.  A special meaning where the military members come to the top instead of constantly be overlooked!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Just as with their debut album, I have fallen in love with each song the more I listen to it. Babel has pretty much been on repeat all hours of the day unless I'm at work or asleep.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Sigh No More, Babel will not disappoint!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The movie was a gift for my little boy.<br />He likes dogs a lot and this one is a good exemple of a dogs'tale  and friendship( whit a very good actor).<br />Thank you Amazon<br /><br />Linda David
B0089BSOPA|5.0|This two-disc set of Halloween 2 is pretty good. I knew i would enjoy it, i liked the commentary from director Rick R and the alternate commentary from Dick Warlock. I got a kick out of the behind the scenes segment as well as the deleted scenes. As a kid i always figured there was something different about the ending seen on TV, but i never put 2 and 2 together. Obviously im talking about the ending inside the ambulance. Anways check out this Dvd if you thirst for more material on Halloween Two original.
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought the bundle of the three books thinking maybe it would be a good read.  The first one, okay, I get what all the hullabaloo is all about.  The second one, more of the same, the third one more ad nauseum.  I'd vote to skip it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is my new favorite addiction.  Love the app on my kindle &amp; htc thunderbolt.  The mobile web version sucks, so I'm really thankful for the apps.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|it has everything it offers for kindle fire except the use of avast account login. its because amazon doesnt use the google cloud. that being said, still the best protection.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I was expecting a horror or paranormal book. I downloaded a sample and from the sample I brought the book. The beginning of the book was great I was invested in the plot and characters and I enjoyed the writing. However once the peculiar children story was manifested the book went down hill. I guess this book was anti climatic. Also the reason the peculiar children were in their predicament was stupid it made no sense. I think the idea was good but the execution was terrible. I pretty much lost interest in the story. Also the love interest made no sense, was unbelievable and gross on many levels. I would never want to be a substitute love for another especially if it were a family member. I'm relieved I paid 1.99 for the book and not 9.99.
B00968Q7DQ|5.0|Incredibly lush and beautiful.  I was hopeful this would come close to the near perfection of The Underfall Yard.  Intead, English Electric completely surpasses.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|it was ok it had some problems but you get use to it so to me it ok so if you want to download it I want stop you
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun logical also a 3 year old could even play like a boss and that is why I gave it a 5 star rating
0316228532|1.0|An utter disappointment from JKR after her phenomenal success. Dark can be wonderful, but here it is merely pedantic and pointless.  An entirely uninspired book from start to finish.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Great DVD and the books also awsone. Can not waite Season 4 looks like going be awsone oct 14 2012
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, one of the best I've ever seen. It proves something I discovered a while ago but forgot: If a movie is great, what it's about doesn't matter at all.<br /><br />There's no way in the world I'd ever watch a movie about meth cookers in the Ozarks. Never. Never. Never. Not if you gave me a hundred dollars and a bucket of Original Recipe KFC would I watch a movie about meth cookers, in the Ozarks or anywhere else. Drugs bore and annoy me, and so do squalid, dysfunctional families, and that's all this movie is about. I only watched it to see what Jennifer Lawrence is like, and this seemed like the one to watch since I planned to watch only one.<br /><br />I'd never heard of her until a week or so ago, and from her photos online I figured she was just another of the countless dumb-as-posts bimbos (of both sexes), with armies of publicists and stylists but no more talent or intelligence than a cockroach, who have taken over the entertainment industry in the United States. I'm delighted to be proved wrong, about her. She is amazing.<br /><br />With not the slightest hint that she is acting, she carries this whole movie on her young shoulders and makes a squalid, stupid, barely believable story absolutely fascinating. The other actors are good but not anywhere near her league; and, although the writing, direction, and everything else are top-notch, without her this movie would hardly be worth watching. But WITH her it is the best movie I've seen in years.<br /><br />Whoever won the Oscar over her proves that Oscar voters are idiots (unless it was Natalie Portman, in which case it was just an unfortunate collision of great performances. You can tell I don't keep abreast of entertainment news, but I know a great movie when I see one).
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I wish season 5 was out on dvd, this the only way my husband I can see it is on to late.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Since it was a yucky evening outside, I decided to rent Snow White and the Huntsman from Amazon. I have to admit that I had serious reservations about devoting time to watch this movie. I am NOT a fan of Kristin Stewart. But, I figured that Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron would make up for what Kristin Stewart lacked in acting.<br /><br />I will start this review off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Chris Hemsworth. I enjoy watching the movies that he's in and I personally don't feel like his acting is bad. Throughout this movie, I feel like Chris Hemsworth gave some very good performances. He really put his all into the character and I feel like the movie could have really excelled with him as the protagonist. Plus, he's smoking hot. I think more screen time for him can only improve this movie.<br /><br />Review below/Some very slight spoilers<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />The scenery in this movie was gorgeous. There were lush forests that were green and verdant...teeming with fairy life and make believe creatures. There were other places that were dark and dangerous. I loved how the dark forest was actually dangerous! Instead of just a dead acre of trees. I could watch this movie again just for all the wonderful scenery.<br /><br />Next, I would give the world building a low grade. When it comes to the queen and the castle, I don't understand why no force was able to destroy it. The end of this movie was really lackluster and makes the viewer pretty confused with the easy victory. I feel like the village of woman was a fantastic concept and made perfect sense within this world. But, if your figure in this village and the fact that the queen was stealing the youth from all the young women in the surrounding villages...Snow White is the only pretty girl left in the entire Kingdom. She's basically the fairest of them all by default.<br /><br />Charlize Theron was such a fantastic actress. She really out shown all her costars in this film with the sheer brilliance of her talent. Her back story is briefly highlighted but, helped to add some additional depth to her character. I would have liked have understood a bit more about the relationship she and her brother had. Is he with her by choice? I couldn't really tell.<br /><br />Seriously, just watch this movie for Charlize and Chris Hemsworth. Speaking of Chris Hemsworth, I really wanted to give him a hug throughout this movie. Poor guy...<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />I really don't want to hate on Kristin Stewart a lot in my review. But, she doesn't have a large range of emotions when acting and I feel that this really takes away from crucial scenes. Another actress should have been chosen for this role.<br /><br />Wow, this movie had a LOT of plot holes. I usually don't even notice this stuff and it became really distracting for me.nce of her talent. Her back story is briefly highlighted but, helped to add some additional depth to her character.

B004WOZ3Y8|5.0|Odered this DVD to replace my ol' trusted VHS. Was a little nervous about \\"used\\", but it arrived in good as new shape! Watched it several times already.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Force closes a lot on Kindle Fire when trying to pin external site. Otherwise pretty good. Better than no pinning what so ever!
B008133MDK|5.0|I found this new interpretation very interesting and appropriate to the twenty-first century. It gives me pause to wonder if the nineteenth century reader found this realistic, because though amazing, Brett's version had an air of quaintness--- period piece.
B0032Y8XH8|1.0|When people are conditioned to regurgitate every bit of cultural propaganda we are fed it makes listening to them tortuous for me and every lyric this band sings does that.  Every stupid cultural lie is reinforced on this album from us having souls, having free will, to us having a maker and this perpetuates the unhealthy behavior of trying to fry an egg by thinking hard about instead of perpetuating the healthy behavior documented in the book, The Reluctant Alliance: Behaviorism And Humanism and that makes me sick.  This album is pathetic.  Nobody ever sees a soul and never will.  It was made up in Greek times when people thought thoughts came from the heart and it is ridiculous that anyone still thinks they have one, we have a brain that facilitates behavior and we should all learn that..  There is no self initiating force in the universe much less the brain, free will is just an illusion so people control you by saying it is up to you to change the system.  Nobody can or does so the system stays in place.  We behave according to an evolutionary history, environmental history and the current situation, the contingencies of reinforcement, consequences, nobody has free will.  Not one person ever behaves differently then they are determined to behave.  This garbage is a disease and this band never stops reinforcing this BS.  They even say there is a god when there is no evidence of one and that non-existent entity is tougher to explain than us.  This album is painful for me to listen to as it is tough to watch people so easily conditioned to spread the disease of ignorance, but I'm sure most people have already been infected so you don't care and will continue to spread your disease.  Have Fun!
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Just purchased the Asus T700 tablet with Amazon, tried to load the Amazon App to purchase some apps. But get incompatible device with no help or reason.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great, fast paced book! I like how the book started out with Mark Owens trails and tribulations leading to the culmination of the book and his career on the teams.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the series. It opens up<br />A world that people never even think about and then with the series turning into a real live story and seeing different perspectives it was very good. The only complaint I have is that the 3rd book was very rushed and jumped too far each time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an easy read, but also very compelling.  The book draws you in with the consistent action and intricate details about the intense lifestyles these operators live.  It is very interesting to find out the first hand knowledge that these secretive, extremely-well trained experts divulge in, \\"No Easy Day\\".  As a soldier in special operations, I expected the book to reveal some sensitive information after reading reviews and knowing about the controversial subject matter, but I did not notice any compromising details  that might be considered a threat to national security after reading it thoroughly.  I guarantee that this will be an incredibly enthralling read, and that it will allow the reader to discover interesting perspectives that would not otherwise come to their attention.  \\"No Easy Day\\" is a straightforward story that is simple to understand, but very addicting and thought-provoking.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|The first time I tried to watch the movie, I did nothing special. But when it played, something popped up in the corner that displayed what scene we are on. But every time it appeared, the scene would skip. It got so bad that the voice was out of sync. I had to completely restart 3 times and I couldn't start at the beginning. I missed the opening, but I could at least watch the movie. I don't know what was wrong with the set up, but something was wrong,
B0058YPGSY|5.0|If you're an SOA fan, you'll love this season. Also it comes with a code to enter to win a Harley
B000EGF0B4|5.0|Everything about this movie is first-rate:  acting, photography, musical score, editing, and Ang Lee's directing is over the top.  I usually prefer wide screen editions,  but found the full sreen edition to be just as good. \\"Brokeback Mtn\\" is currently my go-to movie;  I've watched it seven times, replayed the love scene even more!  It stands as one of the best love scenes ever made with superb acting by Gyllenhaal and Ledger set to that haunting theme.<br />This was my second movie purchase from Amazon and I am very satisfied with both transactions.

B008FTAAG2|5.0|This is a different sound for In This Moment. It is, in my opinion, their best album yet. This album reminds me of how Korn changed their sound with See You On The Other Side. Its a good change. Still a Great Band!!
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|BS, still doesn't work.  Don't buy this app, when it works it's great, but lately broken.  Developer sent email this morning said it works, it doesn't.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed this book, because I feel it is the truth.  So often these days we do not have the truth. Too many lies too much political campaigning. People who do not research, and vote by what is told them by the media will learn the hard way.  Too bad it has to affect all of us.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can't completely say as I'm not yet done with the book but I am really enjoying it. For me, it started off slow but quickly picked up and I've been daydreaming at work about when I can go home and read- which I am definitely not the type to do!  ENJOY!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love this band ! Mumford&Sons is the greatest band EVER ! I cannot wait to go to one of their concerts !!! From what I have seen online they put on the best live shows ever. I'm happy and lucky to be alive in this generation.

0316228532|5.0|When Barry fairbrother dies, his death affects almost each family in each house of the town of Pagford either directly or indirectly. One thing I quickly learned is that this wonderful author can still write characters we all care about. The book is told in a way that almost each chapter is given to a different family and we are almost flies on the wall watching and observing what is happening behind the closed doors of the town. Needless to say there is many secrets and scandals hidden in this ordinary town. There is sexually explicit parts in the book , and violence, and sexual violence towards children, drug abuse, self harm etc etc. The story is just about as different from Harry Potter as you can get, but saying that, for a lot of the adult Harry Potter fans I think they will enjoy it as a lot of care obviously went into the characters ,and their lives as I as a fan of the HP series was used to.<br />This book is def not for children!!This book is nothing like the HP series but wonderful in it's own right!!!!<br />The book is heartbreaking many times throughout, and my heart really went out to some of the characters and the lives they had. If it was possible to hug a character in a book then I would be giving huge hugs to Kristal and her brother Robbie. Their family life had me in tears towards the end of the book.<br />Although the book is huge it does not feel like you are reading a massive book. The pages fly by easily as the characters are interesting and the story engaging. If this is a taste of future books by this wonderful author then ,Miss Rowling get Scribbling  as I can't wait to read the next book by you!!1
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Marvel, but this movie just didn't cut it.<br />The Hulk just hanging out with everyone at the end, but earlier he wants to rip Black Widow's head off???<br />Why the change in character?<br /><br />Captain America getting into a pi..ing contest with Tony Stark???<br />Loki with no real chance of reigning over humanity - so what's the point?<br />He's not stupid so why make a deal with the Chitauri to begin with?<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is awesome as Iron Man. that dude is probably one of THE most gifted/talented actors of our day.<br /><br />Chris Evans was great as Johnny Storm, stinks as Capt. America.  Cap is my favorite hero, so it stinks to see him do such a lame job in this one.<br />He was decent in the Capt. America stand alone, but in The Avengers...  lame-o.<br /><br />Overall a big disappointment in the story.  The cartoon/animated Avengers movie is a better story, characters are true to form, and I can watch it over & over.<br /><br />A gazillion $$$ in production costs and the CGI & special effects were cool, but didn't blow me away.  You've got the coolest heroes ever assembled and this is the best you can do???<br /><br />The HULK is the most unrelenting force of rage in the universe and they show him punching one Chitauri ship and then punching a few individuals around.<br />He pounds Loki into the ground (very cool!) but why did he stop?  No Betty Ross to slow him down or distract him, no Super Soldier Serum to help Bruce wrestle for control...<br /><br />Waaaay too many holes and lapses in character/story development for me to really enjoy it.<br /><br />Hey MARVEL, if you're going to build up to a story over 4-5 years...  seriously, this is all you've got?  Lame.
0380789035|3.0|Here is what happened to me while reading the book, which is quite telling of some of its problems: I was reading it on my Kindle and had just come to a new chapter. I took a break and came back later to read. I inadvertently skipped a few chapters forward in the story. I read for a good 30-45 minutes until reaching something in the story that made me say \\"wait a minute.\\"<br /><br />And thus is Gaiman's presentation in this book: episodic, choppy, sporadic. We are dealing with gods here folks! Anything can happen. People will randomly appear, supernatural events will occurs, there will be dream-like sequences, flash backs, fast travel, disappearances, slight of hand. You've got it all. Jump a few chapters ahead and you might not notice. The story doesn't fit well in a sequence, so as a reader, it was hard to put all the pieces into place.<br /><br />The book's basis is solid. Shadow becomes the right-hand man of an old god named Odin who is a con man looking to be restored to old glory. Along the way, they meet gods of all different mythologies that were brought to America in hopes of recruiting them for a final battle against America's new gods of media and internet in a final showdown. Gaiman's depiction of small town America littered with all these gods of ancient origins is supremely well done.<br /><br />But along with it's sporadic storyline, another thing happened that deflated this supposed epic: the presentation of the new gods. The story is really one sided. Gaiman spent a good while on wonderful characterizations of ancient gods and Americanized them in very believable ways. The New Gods don't get that kind of treatment; they make their appearances as the \\"we are the bad guys.\\" Think about the fertile ground there was for that, how internet, media, gluttony and all we praise today could have been characterized.<br /><br />So why the three stars? Because even with those flaws, the concept was so solid and the ending of the book ties all of these lose strings together in a satisfactory way. Don't be surprised if this turns into a classic page turner for you: the old American Gods can be quite interesting that you want to continue to find more. The presentation wasn't my favorite, but Gaiman still has created a story that resonated with me.gs together in a satisfactory way.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|Great app.  I've tried Weatherbug, AccuWeather, MyCast, and a couple others, but I keep returning to eWeather.<br />I do wish I could filter out some of the alerts. Getting rid of them can be a bit tedious.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|Some of the tracks here will no doubt satisfy the hardcore fans, but 13 won't likely win any new converts. As for myself, I listen to far heavier stuff and most of it tends to sound much more modern and hardcore than the old-school approach on display here....<br /><br />Of course I would never deny that Dave Mustaine and co. could play circles around me; hell, I'm no musician. But too many of these songs just sound sluggish and Mustaine's tough-guy posturing just doesn't do it for me. This album serves as further proof that Megadeth will always have a limited appeal, doomed to loom in the shadows of giants like Metallica and Slayer.<br /><br />rating: caution

B008I3R2VG|3.0|While I absolutely love the Killers, something was just missing for me with this album. And I'm not one to compare artists' new work with their previous work, bc of course it will change over time and they should create what they are feeling at the time. I thought the lyrics sounded good, but I was distracted from really catching what the songs were about because most of the music sounded the same and I started tuning out. I'll keep listening to see if it grows on me, but so far I don't care for the music to the songs.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I had already set up my RPi before this book, which I had pre-ordered, showed up on my Kindle. I have had some experience with Unix type systems many years ago, but had still been struggling to get some of the things I wanted to try working on my new system.<br /><br />This guide has an excellent overview on how everything works, and easy to follow examples on setting up the Raspberry Pi, getting it connected to the internet, and beginning to learn how to program it. The whole purpose of the Raspberry Pi organization is to give anyone, of any age or any financial means a way of digging into the internals of a computer, both through hardware and software. In my opinion this book, and the supporting community at raspberrypi.org, leverage that experience to a higher level.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game.  Right amount of puzzles and the hints are available when you need them.  Definitely worth the price.<br /><br />_
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very good game. my kids love it I have to hide the kindle fire from them most of the time. buy this game for your kids
B006LSZECO|2.0|I found this book unsettling from the beginning. I read it only because it was the chosen book for a new book club I joined. The thoughts and emotions of the main characters did not draw me in and want me to find the answer to the mystery. I wanted to leave these toxic people, not stay with them to discover the real truth.
B005QN3ANK|5.0|I just mentioned the other day, to a friend, how amazing the band Aqua 'was'. Beyond the hit, \\"Barbie\\", existed many, many pop songs that were unrivaled. Her sweet voice alongside his hard edge. You know the two  I mean. So imagine my surprise when, just now, I found recent LIVE performances on YouTube promoing their NEW cd! Go ahead, imagine my surprise. If you imagined Thrilled, ya got it.<br /><br />That Aqua is performing together, LIVE, and they have a new cd is as great a reunion as I can fathom.<br /><br />Sadly, I doubt they'll tour the US. But no matter. I just forked a worthy 30 bucks for their new cd, imported from the UK. I wish them all the best. Well deserved.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I was glued to the TV for 3 days straight watching season one of Homeland, I highly recommend this DVD.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Battleship is a very good action movie that pits the world against the Aliens.  It definitely holds your attention throughout the entire film and you find yourself routing for the good guys.<br />I did like the cast of characters in the film.  A very enjoyable movie.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is a great app, but don't buy it from the Amazon Appstore.<br />The version here hasn't been updated since 2011 and is really out of date.<br />The version in the Google Play store has been recently updated and now supports EPUBs, while this one doesn't and may never.<br /><br />It's worth the price (especially if you can still get it for a quarter), but all they're doing here is price matching Google. At least get your money's worth and get the one that's still updated!
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|The movie was nothing like the book.  I was awful.  If you love the books don't watch the movie as you will be greatly disappointed!
0552159840|5.0|Absolutely! more than met my expectations. Arrived promptly, great condition and I thoroughly enjoyed the book-what a twist!<br />Interesting that each of these book is \\"registered\\" with a number to track where they go (World Book Night Edition)
B005LAJ212|5.0|Great DVD story about the lives of a few familes who live on the South Fork of Long Island.  The video shots wure take me back their - sure enjoyed living in the area and the story line of the DVD Revenge is just Great.
0525953728|4.0|\\"Not Everyday Folks\\", that's an understatement. I don't see this as one Seal's account, rather ANY Seal's account. All those guys are made of different, thank God, so we can all sleep better at night!
B008D28HYS|4.0|great app! challenging and fun!<br />thank you. i wish there were a bit more guidance on playing however at times when it gets to the more challenging levels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I always used to play it on my friends ipod touch because my mom wouldn't let me get one. So I got a Kindle fire, anyway I was sooo mad they didn't have minecraft. Then about a month after I got it, I saw minecraft on the most paid list and was so excited. I got it and love it. So that's a thumbs up for me, I highly recommend. this app!!!!!!!!!!!
B0085MNZ66|4.0|i actually think this game is pretty great. yes, the UI is simple,  but the strategy to solve the puzzles are not always as straight forward.  you have to know how the colors interact to solve the puzzles,  so that makes this unique to me.  unlike the other ''router'' games out there,  this color interaction sets it a part. great job!
B0051MKNV8|5.0|The movie was exactly what we expected. We enjoyed it very much. I would recommend it to anyone to watch.
1442337966|5.0|This book has changed my life!  The idea that we have the right to have health, love, and life is so entrenched in the pages of this book that this has become a weekly reread. I bought multiple copies for friends and as they've read and reread we've all shared how our lives have changed positively in all phases.
0984183523|4.0|Not perfect, but definitely the best resource I've found in preparing for case interviews. It really helps that Victor explains not only what firms are looking for but why they are looking for it.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|who cares if you had to pay 99&cent; after a hour into game it is a great game well worth it like always!  stop whinning if you cant afford the extra 99&cent; then stop playing it, unistall it, but dont give it a bad rating complain to the developer!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have lived, like many, thinking wheat, especially whole wheat, was good for my health. This book changed that way of thinking. If you are interested in improving your health or becoming more knowledgeable about what we should be putting in our body this is a must read. Those in healthcare or food service might find the information useful in improving the health of their clients. It is well organized, informative and easy to read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It's challenging and soothing.  My 7 year old son started playing it on my phone and is better than I ever imagined.  He now has it on his iPod and we are competing.  It's great to have something in common!
0316228532|1.0|The author is hell-bent on making you feel guilty and responsible for all the lowlife of this world. I am sure that you will learn nothing about the real British town from this book. What you will learn is that J.K. Rowling is a pathetic, dark, very angry, leftist demagogue. She could be a speech writer for the Obama White House.<br />The book itself is duller than a butter knife, just plain boring. The author completely discredited herself both as an author and as a human being. It is as if her anger was building in her all her life, and, finally, she could contain it no longer as she vomited on us this filthy and stupid novel.<br />I have read that she was very unhappy during her childhood and teen years, and that she decided to get even with the people of her home town. I think this novel illustrates that J.K. Rowling is one very sick puppy.
B005Y423ZC|1.0|The DVD arrived totally broken on half, It arrived so late, it was expensive and I waste my money for nothing and if I'd returned it it would cost me like 20 dollars more or so, no way. Not recommended at all.<br /><br />P.S: You should secure the article really well the next time, this kind of things cannot happen. Just an advice.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Thank you for this movie.  What a treat.  No sex, violence, drugs or \\"reality\\".  Just a regular old movie with characters that have depth and a good story to be told.  Wish there were more like this.
B0095R64AO|1.0|I had high hopes for this film, but was very disappointed. The characters do a lot of things that make no sense and some situations are just implausible.
B0085MNZ66|1.0|app wouldn't open on my droid 4, despite several attempts, so not able to comment on the game itself. sounded intriguing so very disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The beginning of the book drags on but towards the middle it gets really good and intense. The end of the book is unexpected. But not an unexpected that I liked.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|this game stinks I hats it and it doesn't even turn I hats it it it it it it it sucked
0525952926|1.0|Fall of Giants, the first in the series was wonderful. While preparing for the follow up, I reread this first in the Century series in preparation for more vivid characterization and wonderful, intersecting story lines. Who can forget the opening story of Billy Williams going into the dangerous Welsh mines for the first time and his heroic endeavors underground? And, how about the fascinating women of the region:  the fiery Maude, and Ethel, Billy's sister, who rose to become a member of Parliament?  As time  for the release of \\"Winter...\\" grew near, I pondered the best way to get the book. Fall of Giants, I had in paper version; it was heavy (perfect for lifting weights), or the overpriced Kindle version? I finally decided to invest the money in  the Kindle version, so I wasn't in danger of a slipped disk from the weight of the book. I was also anxious to get started  with a writer I knew would not disappoint.<br /><br />What slow recognition  awaited me! I had carefully read no reviews, so I would not be influenced. Where in the world did Ken Follett go? Did he outline the plot and assign immature writers to \\"fill in the blanks\\"? The rating I have given him is only because of the research and historical knowledge of the times that I have garnered.  I don't mind that the characters are present at every important event of the WWII years.  What I do mind is the shallow characterization of people I feel no reason to like. I really resent the few sections, possibly written by Follett, as in the 101st segment, that are cut off mid section, then summarized later in the book. I really mind the immature sexual scenes that make me dislike the characters even more.<br /><br />This book contract probably had too short a time for Follett and his assistants to meet deadline. It probably should have been divided into two books. At any rate, do not count on me to reread the second in the trilogy in preparation for the third. Also, do not count on me to spend twenty dollars for the next book. I will read the reviews and decide whether I want to waste my money and my time.
B008MEM24S|5.0|awesome game<br />awesome game. it so addicting<br />htere is problems with the beginig sometime.<br />wheni go into the beginning of the
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game! Keeps you interested from beginning to end. Can't wait for the next one. Well worth the 99 cents.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is a great app. when you see the graphics you just wanna scream. its not like one of those games when ot pauses when you are shooting the bird. I so recommend it to everyone in the whole world.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I got this game about a month ago and I still play it today. Whenever I am bored I go on it for atleast an hour rotating pieces or doing the 212 piece puzzle. All around great game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use it on my kindle and galaxy 3 phone and its great!!! The plans they offer as guide really helped me to read the Bible when I  don't know where to start!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101-in-1 games has 128 games, and is fun because you have to the unlock games before you can play them
B001IMFHVG|5.0|This incredible recital which took place in The Great Hall of the  Moscow Conservatory in 1962, has been digitally remastered for this DVD and although the picture is black and white, the sound is quite good evoking comparisons with RCA's \\"Living Stereo\\" series.Rubinsteins recordings usually took place in the studio, but if you believe aside from being a superb musician, that his playing is modest and conservative, guess again.<br /><br />This live recital catches Rubinstein in a totally inspired mood, giving virtuoso performances that sound straight from the 19th cenury comparable to such greats as Josef Lhevinne, Josef Hofmann, Moritz Rosenthal, Leopold Godowsky,young Horowitz and Rachmaninoff. The Polonaise in F# minor is dazzling, but its the 2nd Piano Sonata where Rubinstein gives every note meaning combined with superb virtuosity that is always at the service of the composer, a case in point being the 2nd movement (Scherzo) where you can hear all the double thirds and octaves clearly and distinctly, at least equal to such greats as Horowitz,  Argerich and Gilels.<br /><br />These are risk taking performances much more free than the Rubinstein we know in the studio.The Chopin Etudes (4), Barcarolle, and Waltz in A minor show Rubinstein at the peak of his virtuoso and musical capabilities, and the Polonaise in A flat major \\"Heroic\\" will never be surpassed.The power, feeling, expression and complete identification with every note prove that Artur Rubinstein is a 19th century virtuoso at heart with every note of Chopin's music in his bones.A historic document and a desert island must have.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awesome game. I always thought that minecraft was a stupid game but that was because i never played it before. but I was wrong its an amazing game definitely worth the money
B000IKNZMM|5.0|In 1937, the world shook as the greatest lighter than air machine burst into flames and subsequently exploded. Was it sabotage? Guess we will never know for sure! This movie raises more questions than answers. George C. Scott's riveting performance and great cinematography makes the movie!! Buy buy buy
B008XG1X18|5.0|love all the pictures, ideas, tips for cleaning, beauty, or fashion!!!!!! craft ideas just love. love. love pinterest! !!!!!!!! best idea spot so far!!!!!!!
B00684J49U|5.0|The show gets better and better every season.  Watch the show from Season One to understand the history, each episode builds on previous episodes. It will be money well spent.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am a slow reader.....this book, I could not put down. I read it in 1 week flat w/ 2 kids going to football and dance. Really could not put it down. The most amazing love story. After finishing this book......went to the second book in an instant. Cannot wait to finish the trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game... love to play it. Trying to finish all these different games ; Some of them really make u think!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I gave this book a four because it's full of suspense, action, love, and adventurous struggle to survive.<br />But also in this book, is cruelty. I mean the Capitol locking the 24 tributes up to kill each other, the Avox girl, and the mutts. <br /><br />What I liked about this book was Katniss's cleverness and skills.  The part I hated was again the mutts. And my favorite character is Rue.<br /><br />I would also recommend  this book to readers who don't stop when it gets a little slow, who love adventure, who can handle sadness, and whoever likes murder.<br /><br />Peace out, and enjoy!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read 50% of the book waiting for something interesting to happen.  I put it down and finally picked it up to finish, because I paid for it!  I didn't care for the style of writing, as if you were reading a diary. [?!?] I kept hoping to find something to keep me going...  I just finished the book and am at a LOSS as to why people liked this story?! It had a HORRIBLE ending!  This story just left you hanging with a LOT of loose ends! Most of this was boring?! I'm confused?  I just expected a better story!  I'll not be reading anymore 'recommended' books by celebrities and do more in depth research of reviews on my own!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was great. it had an interesting storyline, all the fun of point -and - tap, plus great hidden object scenes. I had a hard time putting this game down, it was so fun. Well worth the 0.99.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book kept me guessing til the end with twists and turns throughout the whole book. And in the beginning it get straight to the point
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Great movie, especially for my grandson. The only problem was the casing was broken, however the disc were in great condition.
B008RNGCAO|4.0|While old tales bear repeating, this one bears re-reading.  An omnibus of collected issues from the 90's any Batman fan would absolutely need to read
B0014NZNAO|5.0|ON TIME & AT A GOOD PRICE!!  I LOVE BOTH THESE MOVIES & IN THE SAME SET!!!!!<br />AWESOME!!  CAN'T FIND ANYPLACE ELSE, I LOVE WESTERNS
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Nice little game to practice basic addition facts.  Addicting even though I know them. Got this as the FAOTD and have enjoyed the twist on a familiar game.
B003A166OK|5.0|I love this movie,---just another \\"Eastwood\\" classic!!The best part is it comes with 2 other \\"Eastwood\\"classics \\"HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER\\"=\\"2 MULES 4 SISTER SARA\\"
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is the single most honest book I have ever read. It‘ll break your heart, but in the best way possible.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|EASTWOOD AT HIS BEST!!!SHIPPED ON TIME!! I ALWAYS BUY AMAZON!! I HAVE ALL OF EASTWOODS WESTERNS & YOU CAN SEE HIM GET BETTER AS THEY PROGRESS!!! HE IS AN EXELENT ACTOR & DIRECTOR!!!
B004MPESSY|4.0|The concept of this movie has been used in classic movies and print over and over again. The fate of those that violate a woman.  The difference here, is the woman exacts revenge herself. The brutality in this movie is graphic, and not for the squeamish. But the bad guys do get what they deserve in the end. I thought this movie was very well made and acted. If you like revenge movies that are graphic and relentless, you will dig it too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I offers new challenges every time. it is also VERY addictive!  Love this game. It is amazing and you should try it. One of my favorite games.
B009329ZF2|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies ever. I could not finish this predictable rubbish. The personal dramas preceding action sequences was in the worst Hollywood tradition. This movie is a waste of money and time, if the viewer expects it to get better than the opening minutes.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is so awesome/relastic<br /><br />I play this when ever I get spare time and when bored
B0058YPL66|5.0|We watched this with our 9 and 11 year old kids. Both loved it. It is the new family favorite show. Some bad language, but other than that it was perfect.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoyed the game.  Could not put it down until it was completed.  I would definitely reccommend it to others.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|A simplistic fable.  Might have been OK as a short story.  Too much like Christmas Carol.  Don't waste your time.
B0095R64AO|5.0|If you love any of the past movies of these two main characters...you will love this as well. The perfect amount of 'chick flick' and 'funny' wrapped into one! Good job director!
B007RTAR64|5.0|I bought this as a investment, have not seen it in any stores. I do not own any other Barbies!
B004124VG2|4.0|I've loved this album in the digital format I've been listening to it since it came out. It only made sense when I wanted a new LP that this should be it. The thing is, the music is great, both digitally and vinyl. However, Impossible Soul is my favorite track and what I was looking most forward to, the first and last 5 minutes of the 25 minute track being the best to me. It's a single song because it flows together. That was part of the joy of getting the LP- it would play random, the tracks would flow as intended. And then, Pleasure Principle, the last 5 minutes of Impossible Soul, are at the end of side 3, not 4- tragedy! I will still continue to love the music, but will never understand why the producers couldn't get a long enough playing side 4 to contain all 25 minutes. I'll think of this every time I have to flip side 4 back to side 3 to get my last little fix and close out the album.<br /><br />In summary, Sufjan and his music get an unlimited number of stars out of 5; this album- in vinyl- only gets 4 out of 5 for tricking me.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Just like Where's My Water but with familiar cartoon character that's a big hit with our preschooler. Simple, fun, entertaining. Just what these game apps should be.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is very fun. I enjoy playing this game because the cards are large and easy to see and I like the fact that it gives you the option to auto complete your game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I downloaded this to my kindle and when I got to about 52% I had to sequester myself and read the rest in one sitting.  Really sucked me in.  Loved the character developments and the ending.
1607885204|5.0|The Audio version of the book \\"I Am Ozzy\\" was awesome! I am very satisfied about the delivery time of the CD and the quality of the product, as well! :)
B008X8QCTO|5.0|This game was awesome. Great graphics great everything. Didn't have any problems playing it on my kindle fire. I can't believe people are giving this game bad reviews because you pay a total of $1.99. This game is worth it. Please give this game the credit it deserves even if you are unhappy with the extra $.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game - so fun to play. The only drawback I've found thus far is that, when someone stops playing with you, you can't resign / cancel the game....... but other than that, it's SO much fun :D
0525953728|5.0|An action packed, real life account of what the U.S. Navy Seals did to defend our country. Excellent book!  And highly recommended!
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|A must learn for those that like to continue developing self. If you have to make presentations, you have to read this and take into serious consideration to adopt Steve Jobs presentation play book.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|This account though a true story reads like a thriller novel and keeps the reader engrossed from page 1 to the end  The insight given into the world of the American elite forces and the comparison with the real events and that portrayed by the news media is enlightening
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The author of this book has such an imagination it was not like anything I have read thus far, Can see this book being made into a film along the lines of Lord of the rings, a must read for anybody even if you are not into fantasy.
0810996596|5.0|If you are a monster kid, a fan of old monster movies, or especially a collector of monster posters, toys, props, etc...  this book is simply essential. Beautifully photographed and presented, this is an amazing collection that is extremely broad and deep, filled with classic movie posters and props from the early days of horror cinema through the 70's. Toys from the classic \\"monster kid\\" era of the 60's and 70's feature items ranging from the extremly rare and normally never seen to the common but classic. If you collect vintage monster toys, you probably have at least a few of the things Kirk has also collected and shows in his book. I had to order a second \\"file\\" copy because the first is going to be in tatters from reading it over and over.
B0036EH3WU|4.0|Lost is an engrossing show that, if you like deep plots, will appeal to you. In particular, the boxed set will give you plenty of bonus features about the episodes, detailed episode indexes, and some memorabilia derived from episodes in the season. The boxed set is rather large, but the presentation and packaging of the DVDs and extra gifts is impressive. If you like Lost, I suggest you get this boxed set.
6305076995|4.0|Recently I have been having a bit of a personal YES revival. I'm currently reading Bruford's excellent book ([[ASIN:1906002231 Bill Bruford The Autobiography]]), just watched [[ASIN:B001BWYT9Y Yes: The Directors Cut]] from their 2003 reunion tour, and even got [[ASIN:B00007LTIC Going for the One]], never one of my favorites, but the one I saw them tour for in the fall of '77. And I am happy to say that of the music, this DVD from '72 is the best yet. Sure the sound is muddy and of questionable pitch - actually it's terrible, but it's not much different than being in the kind of acoustically challenged halls they often had to play in, and if you want the best sound, just listen to the CDs. Instead consider it a bonus, all the easier to imagine actually being there and being really stoned so you could care less (which is pretty much how the audience looks).<br /><br />And what really matters here is seeing the band. Compared to the 2003 show, which is pretty amazing as well, if slightly mellower and more mature, this early show (an abbreviated 70 minute performance from December 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, London) shows them at their peak - at least creatively, if not personally and professionally - a mix of youthful hubris, and musical virtuosity; visionary, confident, showy and enthusiastic. As different as they all are, they all appear to be playing their hearts out. Howe is especially skilled and animated - frankly amazing, and I feel foolish to have never noticed just how much (and how well) he plays the slide guitar. And Anderson, although doing nothing much more than standing there singing, provides the glue that holds it all together. Then as now I have never been able to figure out what he is singing about, but I have never really thought it important to try. Instead I listen to the music of how he says it, letting a few key words register and take my mind with them like the abstract bits of poetry they are. And Wakeman's sequined cape is pretty cool, not to mention his array of analog instruments, and his 6 Wives solo medley is pure over-the-top keyboard wizardry that is... just so 70's. And Squire has some kind of bat wings outfit on..., while White just looks so happy to be playing!<br /><br />Mostly though, this is an unpretentious, even low budget, DVD - no quality audio options, or fancy camera work, and even the concert has minimal stage lights/effects (there is a mirror ball and projected images of microscopic pond life though...). But the performance is great and the video work is adequate to show them doing it. For me, the highlight is seeing the teaser 3 minute glimpse of \\"Starship Trooper\\" during the closing credits. For the dedicated YES fan this is a 5 star must, especially if you weren't around for this era (focuses mostly on Fragile and Close to the Edge). For those more casually interested in the music, it's more like 3 star, and I recommend just spending your money on the remastered albums from the early 70's.<br /><br />Perhaps for me the best part is seeing, from this perspective of 40 years later, just how ambitious the music was, and how that's what they were into without much extra frills and fluff. Entertainment sure has changed.mention his array of analog instruments, and his 6 Wives solo medley is pure over-the-top keyboard wizardry that is... just so 70's.

B000SEGUDE|1.0|To read this book was a struggle.  There were a couple of chapters that were interesting and seemed to make sense, but the majority seemed more like the ravings of a deranged mind.<br /><br />I wish I could get my money back on this one.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|I expect a product to at least function when I get it.  Powered on, tried to scan, the unit froze with hour glass the first time.  The next time I tried the screen turned to multi-colored snow....very disappointed.

0525953728|5.0|Originally, I was interested in this book for the firsthand account from the Navy Seals.  However, upon reading this, I learned more about what these brave men do for our country.  Yes, there are details the government probably wanted to keep a secret, but I'm glad I read it.  I'm glad I know what happened that night.  I'm in awe of their bravery and skill (yes, skill).  Makes me even more proud to be an American.  Read it, see for yourself what these men are capable of.  I doubt you will regret it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|simply said, I love Pinterest and I logged my Kindle Fire. Now I have them both together. What more can I ask for.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this App! I could play w/ it for hours creating many different sound combinations! I use it every night to fall asleep to!! I didn't know how to find the timer at 1st because it wasn't directly on the page like all the sound icons are. For the others who were also having problems w/ that... On my kindle fire it is at the bottom next to the back arrow. It looks like a little page. Clicked on that & it gave me the timer & other options! :)

B005LAII8A|5.0|It is absolutely glorious when intelligent sci-fi not only re-emerges, but returns and flourishes with spectacular results. Tucked neatly into this technologically and sometimes extraterrestrial genre of film is time travel. While time travel films aren't always done right, when they are they make one hell of an impact; the \\"Back to the Future\\" films, the \\"Terminator\\" films, \\"Donnie Darko,\\" \\"Time Bandits,\\" \\"Twelve Monkeys,\\" \\"Source Code,\\" and the fantastic little Spanish film \\"Timecrimes\\" are just a few examples. Combine that potential with the impressive writer/director Rian Johnson and an incredible cast that includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, and Emily Blunt and you have one of the most anticipated films of the year on your hands with \\"Looper.\\"<br /><br />In the year 2044, time travel has not yet been invented but 30 years from now it will have been. After being labeled as illegal, the ability to leap through time is only available on the black market. People who criminal organizations want to get rid of are sent back to 2044 where hired guns called \\"loopers\\" dispose of them. Loopers make very good money and Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is living the good life. When a looper's contract nears its expiration, the mob sends back their future self who they then get rid of and have the next 30 years to live their life. It's called \\"closing the loop.\\" But when Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) is sent back, his life is turned upside down.<br /><br />While you may not be able to totally buy that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a younger version of Bruce Willis based on looks alone (even with the use of prosthetics), Gordon-Levitt does deserve credit for developing the ability to act like Willis along with similar facial expressions, mannerisms, and body language. Bruce Willis' character is a really interesting piece of the puzzle. The older version of Joe is committing some of the most heinous crimes imaginable, but his reasoning for it is just. As you're shown his back story, you understand what he's going through and almost find yourself rooting for him. He's like a villain with heart.<br /><br />Emily Blunt is really fantastic. This might be the most straightforward and emotional that she has ever been in any performance. The addition of her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) may make or break the film for you as it goes down a path that may find you comparing it to other films. The Cid character is an intriguing one though as his emotions are out of control, but his intentions are good and he's fairly amusing more often than not. While Paul Dano doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, it's amazing that that underhanded smarminess he's often associated with is still able to shine through.<br /><br />This is Rian Johnson's best work by a landslide and that's coming from someone who absolutely loves his first two films. While the concept is somewhat familiar, it's always going in places you don't expect them to go. Seth's (Paul Dano) side plot is around the time your jaw will hit the floor. The ending is really magnificent, as well. It feels tragic on one hand, but extremely fitting on the other. While the soundtrack seems to kind of pick and choose its moments to really stand out, there are a few instances where it's emotionally overwhelming. It will only get better in repeat viewings and listens.<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" is an astounding piece of cinema no matter how you slice it.

0345803485|1.0|If you still had any doubts about whether or not the United States (and the U.K., I suppose) has officially become an illiterate nation, just look at the fact that this book has become a bestseller in the English-speaking world.<br /><br />It reads like something that was written by a horny fifth-grader. And not one of those fifth-graders who are at the top of their class. We're talking, a fifth-grader who has trouble making it all the way through an \\"American Girls\\" novel. And yet, people pay money for it and are actually fooled into thinking it has some semblance of a plot and/or characters. Please, save yourself the $15.95.

B007MNV5WU|2.0|This version is not nearly as much fun as the original or Seasons. Reserve it for when you are really bored.
0345803507|1.0|Usually, I prefer to read a book in its original language. Translations typically detract from the style of the original book--it's just impossible to really capture the cadence and tone of the author when he or she is writing in their native tongue.<br /><br />In the case of these Fifty Shades books, however, the translators did the author a freaking service.<br /><br />I recently stumbled upon this book--and its companions--in an airport bookstore abroad. After cloistering myself in the airport bathroom and crying for 40 minutes, curled up on the floor in fetal position, bemoaning the fact that we are exporting our illiterate fads to nations near and far, I dusted myself off and returned to the bookstore. I cracked open this \\"book\\"--if it can indeed be dignified with such a title--and read a few pages in the Spanish translation.<br /><br />The translated version is 100 times better.<br /><br />Apparently, the translator accepted the job, then realized he/she was faced with the daunting task of trying to translate a book that was written in irreparably-broken English. The translator made a wise choice in opting for improving the style immensely in Spanish (rather than attempting to write the book in equally-bad Spanish).<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you're interested in reading something that recreates the anachronistic, illiterate style of the \\"Fifty Shades\\" books, take a look at the lovely parody, \\"Pirates of the Danube\\":<br />[[ASIN:B009479CH2 Pirates of the Danube]]<br /><br />One more note on this book--the author has truly exhausted the \\"fifty shades\\" color metaphors at this point. At least the last book's title made sense: \\"fifty shades darker\\". Since when can anything be \\"fifty shades freed\\"? Is \\"fifty shades\\" a new, meaningless modifier to be tacked onto any adjective or adverb? Can I now be \\"fifty shades hungry\\" when I go into MacDonald's? Is the weather going to be \\"fifty shades rainy\\" tomorrow?

The title says it all--only a brilliant literary mind could come up with such a play on the \\"fifty shades\\" color metaphors.<br /><br />Remember that dirty poem you read on the wall of the bathroom stall in the Greyhound station the other day? The one that was misspelled and contained grammar errors? With a poorly-drawn picture of a naked woman beneath it? That bathroom poem looks like a Dostoevsky novel next to this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Pirates of the Danube\\" for a rip-roaring parody of this genre...at least it was written to be bad on purpose.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009479CH2 Pirates of the Danube]]

B008SOS63S|4.0|The review on this live DOUBLE-CD from Joe Bonamassa performed at the Beacon Theatre in New York needs to be rated and described on numerous plateaus to benefit any future customers considering making a purchase. Based on earlier previous reviews there are a few more dissatisfied reviewers than normal on one of Joe's CD's... and this time the complaints aren't just about wanting more electric blues included... it mainly centers around the recorded sound quality. I will address my feelings on that in a moment.<br /><br />First of all there are two CD's totaling ONE-HUNDRED-NINETEEN-MINUTES-OF-MUSIC and that's certainly a tremendous bargain, especially at $12.79. One of Joe's talents that I believe gets overlooked... or not fully appreciated because of the massive guitar talent he possesses... is the fact that Joe has such a strong, booming, beautiful voice and it is evident here on innumerable cuts. The guest singers include Beth Hart, John Hiatt and Paul Rodgers. It's kind  of  interesting seeing human nature take place in the prior reviews as some people really love one of the guest artist' performance... and go so far as to say another guest artist doesn't add much. And I tend to agree... but I pin those declarations in a different sequence than others have. And to me... that reinforces how wise Abraham Lincoln was when he said: \\"YOU CAN PLEASE SOME OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME... AND YOU CAN PLEASE ALL THE PEOPLE SOME OF THE TIME... BUT YOU CAN'T PLEASE ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME.\\"<br /><br />So to me... I thought Beth Hart tore the place down... I thought John Hiatt derailed the momentum.<br /><br />Now to the discussion of the quality of the sound recording. I feel it is definitely not as bad as some have said... and not as good... as others have said. There are a couple of songs that it is hard to decipher the power and beauty of an individual instrument... and there are some songs where it's extremely hard to make out the lyrics. Just for the heck of it I picked out one of my many live-CD albums... and the one I chose was the Allman Brothers ONE WAY OUT CD from the very same Beacon Theatre in 2004... and the sound and clarity of the recording was ten times better from start to finish... so it's definitely not the venue... in addition to the fact that I'm sure recording equipment has done nothing but improve in the last eight years.<br /><br />In summary, there is also one song/instrumental that could have easily been left off and that's the opening 72nd St. Subway Blues - Intro.<br /><br />With all that being said... I give this an overall FOUR STARS and at the price... at the quantity of music... and the overall great performance by Joe and Beth and some others this is still a joy to listen to Joe belting out some powerful classic music.<br /><br />P.S. Note to RV: If you do enough research you will see that Abraham Lincoln was the original person credited with the statement that you can fool some of the people all of the time, etc.<br /><br />P.T. Barnum stated, \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\"<br /><br />Either way, whoever you decide to believe made the quote, and whoever I decide to believe originally made the quote, the end result will be that both of us won't be pleased. So if you think about it, our disagreeing proves the quote 100% accurate!it I picked out one of my many live-CD albums... and the one I chose was the Allman Brothers ONE WAY OUT CD from the very same Beacon Theatre in 2004... and the sound and clarity of the recording was ten times better from start to finish... so it's definitely not the venue... in addition to the fact that I'm sure recording equipment has done nothing but improve in the last eight years.<br /><br />In summary, there is also one song/instrumental that could have easily been left off and that's the opening 72nd St. Subway Blues - Intro.<br /><br />With all that being said...

Do see how 20 something males would but to me, seemed like script was written to give equal time to various super heroes and to me, plot was silly. I know super hero plot and all but just did hold my attention.  Special effects are good and so too action but that not enough for me at 66 years of age. Date movie? If &lt; 30 maybe. 500+ million box office for this?? A lot of &lt; 25 yr old males must have gone 6 times each. Sorry all those that loved it, it was too silly and too many super heroes for me.

I knew to expect for him to mail one in at some point just did not realize it would be this soon. The tired twist and turns are unimaginative and boring. I am expecting that maybe once he makes it to Virginia that Lee will find his way again and create a book worth reading, as this one is not.
B0072OFM28|5.0|SPARTACUS:VENGEANCE is a production of epic and monumental proportions. There is nothing even remotely like it on TV. The lavish sets and  visual effects are beyond description.<br />Although it is billed as the SECOND SEASON of SPARTACUS, fans will know it is technically the third season. When Spartacus star Andy Whitfied took ill, STARZ kept the series alive by doing a prequel showing the House of Batiatus before the arrival of Spartacus. Everyone hoped Whitfield would recover and return to the sadly. Sadly, he lost his battle on September 11, 2011.<br /><br />VENGEANCE takes us to 6 weeks after the massacre that ended Season One. Liam McIntyre has replaced Whitfield as Spartacus. McIntyre looks a lot like Whitfield although a bit younger. The transition works and the series is kept alive. The fantastic Lucy Lawless is back as Lucretia in her her conniving evilness. It's a violent and volatile time in the Roman Empire and the slaves and gladiators of the House of Batiatus are out for revenge and justice.<br /><br />Despite the murder of his beloved wife and his enslavement, the Spartacus of Vengeance takes the high ground morally. His desire for revenge is directed to Gaius Claudius Glaber but there is no desire to seek revenge from innocent people. This ease to constant disagreement among Spartacus and the men and women in his group. The ranks of the freed slaves grow and the band becomes a very real threat to the Roman Empire.<br /><br />This is an amazing show but be warned. It is not for the squeamish or those who are easily offended. It's definitely not a show for the whole family. The bloodbath and novel ways of killing people never ends. The sex can be rather explicit but this was ancient Rome afterall. The show reaches new levels of bloodspurting wounds. The killings and blood move in poetic slow motion. Visual Effects are advancing at an almost daily rate and the show takes advantage of being able to show more blood and gore.<br /><br />The effects are stunning and the destruction of the arena is the most incredible visual effects I have ever seen on TV. It cannot be missed.<br />It was an amazing and violent time in the world and the producer strive for authenticity along with their fantasy.<br /><br />History tells us that a man named Spartacus did lead a slave revolt around 70 BC. Records tell little about him,  but it is interesting to know that this series is based on a real person and real events that obviously have been fictionalized because of the lack of historical documentation.<br /><br />The cast is absolutely amazing. I enjoy the fact that shows set in ancient Rome add an authenticity by having actors speak British English. The ruling class and wealthy speak a more posh English while lower classes speak a working class British English. Somehow it all works. A \\"new\\" language and manner of speaking is created to represent the latin-speaking Romans.<br /><br />Liam McIntyre does a fine job in his role as Spartacus. It must have been difficult to fill Andy Whitfield's shoes. The end of episode one's credits leaves us with a picture of Whitfield as a memorial. He is never mentioned again even in the bonus features. Maybe the tragedy of his death was too dark to even mention on this show.<br /><br />VENGEANCE is loaded with special features that are a must see to fans of the show. It is amazing to see how the visual effects were created and how the sets were built. The explanation of how the arena was destroyed cannot be missed. Again, this is something I have never seen before and it was remarkable.<br /><br />I love this show but it definitely is not for everyone. It's the kind of show some people will love and others will turn away in disgust from the blood and violence. Whatever your opinion is of the story, VENGEANCE is a remarkable example of how a talented cast and crew and visual effects can recreate a remarkable time in history.

0316228532|5.0|So this is what real life is like after 'Dumbledore' dies -- or in this case, the excellent and upright councilman, Barry F. Without his empathy and intervention, everything goes from bad to worse in Pagford in this very grown-up novel from Rowling, who proves herself a very able writer indeed in this realistically depicted tragedy of modern-day politics and class antagonism. I found this book entirely engrossing, with well rounded characters with mostly believable obsessions and hang-ups [though for my taste Colin, or \\"Cubby\\", the deputy schoolmaster, was a little too Wing Biddlebaum for me to quite believe]. I was impressed that Rowling was so very in control here not just of her sentences [I only spotted one real clunker] but of her excellent imagery and tone. Her bleak view here is entirely intentional, as her last-minute leavening of an otherwise unremittingly tragic ending with a well told reminiscence shows us. And what is she trying to show? Well, when the little tike who fantasizes about the speed of real cars by saying, \\"Broom! Broom!\\" [in a quick nod to Harry's Nimbus 2000] meets such a sad final fate, Rowling is clearly letting us know that our magic-free world can only be improved incrementally and through the faltering efforts of rightminded individuals like the much missed Barry, so much do we depend on each other, despite all our flaws. Change is hard, so we need empathy to cut through our own vacancy and apathy and spur us to help, even when such help seems even less than pointless given the enormous weight of suffering on the one side and the forces of social injustice aligned to protect the status quo on the other.

B004EPYZXK|5.0|One of the more unusual entries in the found-footage field, Apoloo 18 pieces together footage of a secret final mission to the moon in the 1970s, launched at night under cover of a routine satellite launch.  Using tapes and film reels from before the mission launch on Earth as well as material recorded onboard the moon lander, the orbiting ship and even cameras and microphones on and in the astronauts's space suits, the movie follows the events on that fateful mission and reveals the meaning behind the film's tagline, \\"There's a reason we've never been back to the moon.\\"<br /><br />The small crew believes they're being sent to the moon to set up equipment that will serve as part of a space-based early warning system against a potential Russian missile attack.  After setting down, the astronauts make the surprise discovery of a Russian craft already in the vicinity, apparantly a recent landing, hastily abandoned and with no sign of the cosmonauts themselves.  From there, they go from simply making surprise discoveries to suspecting that there's A Lot about this mission that the higher-ups never told them, as findings and unexplained happenings on the moon's surface go from the merely unexpected to the baffling and eerie.<br /><br />Sometimes a movie rises and falls on how well it can make the really 'out there' seem real and credible.  If one was to just write down some of what happens in the movie's final stages it might sound preposterous to someone who hasn't seen the movie, but here the filmmakers make it work.  Well, to me they certainly did.  Judging by the unexpectedly low ratings the film often receives, obviously not everyone feels that way, but I thought the end stages and resolutions came off far more engaging and authentic than a number of other higher-profile, more widely seen space-based movies.<br /><br />The small cast does a great job, great suspense, the search for the fate of the missing cosmonauts, the conflict between the astronauts stuck in theunknown and the mission controllers back on Earth guiding them, and the final answers about what was really found on the moon that caused both the US and the Soviet Union to abruptly abandon the largest part of their fiercely competitive, multi-billion dollar space race, successfully round out this imaginative and surprisingly effective horror/science fiction hybrid.

Goulekas, Ray McIntyre Jr., Michel Mielke, Ryan Tudhope & Chris Wells, coordinated by Matthew Lloyd, Jennifer Mizener, Sharina Radia & Andreas Wieland is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant, thought-out and well-made (as well, as well-crafted & entertaining) sci-fi action thriller that keeps you entertained until the very end. Bruce Willis & Joseph Gordon-Levitt give terrific performances as Old Joe & the 30 years younger version of Joe. Rian Johnson has made another impressive movie to put on his resume. Also another impressive teaming of Rian Johnson & Joseph Gordon-Levitt, after \\"Brick\\" & a brief appearance in \\"The Brothers Bloom\\". This is one of the best sci-fi films of the year, if not, the best sci-fi film of the year. This is also one of the best films of the fall season and of the year.
B001AG52AG|1.0|If you have ever read the book don't EVER watch this movie. It takes the story from the book and rips it apart. Its horrible! The plot was completely twisted and flipped around. The book is amazing and there was so much story and action and it was so rich and you can see a movie in your head while you read it. The real movie is worthless. Don't waste your money when you could buy the book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book and everything about it. I have never taken it upon myself to share my feelings about a book but felt this one war rented a response. I am a teacher and I decided to read this book to gain some perspective should I ever have a student with August's situation. I feel like reading  the book from several perspectives really gave me the insight that I was looking for and really added to the dynamics of the story. I can't say enough. If ever I were to recommend a book to read this would be it!!!!
0525953728|1.0|I wanted to read a neutral account on the raid, not some pointless, biased, irrelevant bashing of the president and government. It seems to me like this guy purely had an agenda and wanted to get it out there by capitalizing on a current event. If you're looking for unbiased facts about what happened, you're best off looking elsewhere.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book contains all the elements that I find integral to a great read.  It has good prose, consistent, meaningful, and engaging dialogue, romance, friendship, discovery of what was lost, and family.  Sometimes I think I have read all the good books left, and then I pick up on like \\"The Fault in Our Stars, \\" and am happy to know otherwise. LOKIB

B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok I first want to say that im sorry i havent wrote a review lately because im so addicted to this game which is toatally aweaome.<br />  Next i want to say that it does work on kindle fire.  for the people that say it doesnt work id suggest that you go and delete the stuff you dont use or need.  also people are saying its not worth seven dollars, well you are wrong. 911 people have bought the game. So go buy the game and see for yourselves.
0810993139|5.0|This book was really good.  I'm one of those people who've always loved to read- in kindergarten I read Charlotte's Web in a day.  I progressed from there, and I skipped over stuff like this with tons of pictures that are quick reads.  Everyone, of course, said that was \\"awesome,\\" but I missed out.  Just because it's only 100 pages doesn't mean it's a bad book.  Reading some of everything helps you to grow more than reading a ton of literature from one specific genre.  Would you be physically fit if you only lifted weights and never ran a few miles or did some ab workouts?  No!  You'd be really strong with your arms, yeah, but you need balance to function.  I'm into books of around 900 pages now, and I'm not even in high school yet.  I read Christopher Paolini's Inheritance in two days, and it's in the 800-900 page range.  I'll admit that big books help your reading and comprehension skills, but I need a break every once and a while.  This provided it.  It was funny and easily understandable, like giving myself a vacation.  I could read and relax without concentrating too hard.  After the first book, I was eager for the second.  Yeah, it's not \\"real literature\\" and all that nonsense.  But at least you're reading something.  Also, if it gets a non-reader to read, then they're on the right track.  Even if you reread the series over and over again, eventually the jokes will be boring and you'll want new material.  For that, you need to look, and you have to read to look.  This, while not what teachers are truly aiming for, can a least provide the foundation upon which to build.

All of a sudden when i went to watch a video it said no connection and when i tried to download a video all it says is &quot;searching&quot; and then the word disappears. I didnt even update the app and it was doing this. I decided to update it and when i updated it the app erased all my downloaded mp3 and videos. The no connection thing was still happening as well. As a last resort i deleted and re-installed the app to no provail. I loved this app so much and now i dont want anything to do with it. Beware downloaders!!!!!!!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|this is pretty amazing how well it finds who you're thinking of.  worth the cost.  will entertain your guests at a party.
B003RO15LO|4.0|Okay, I wrote a review for this but Amazon lost it or something... so here's the spare review.  This album, like many from the 80's, is NOT freakin' heavy metal!  Okay, now that I've gotten your attention, it IS hard rock and a damn good one at that.  Now the reason it was such a good album and when it finally got noticed became such a huge seller is because of: John Sykes.<br /><br />Without going too much into Sykes' history, he was with Whitesnake from '84 thru the release of this album -Coverdale (as in David) fired him and the rest of the studio band that recorded this for a variety of reasons.  We all know that Geffen offered Sykes a record deal since he was responsible for the success of the WS album.<br /><br />This album features the great Aynsley Dunbar on drums, Neil Murray on bass and Sykes handling ALL the guitar work save for one guitar solo on \\"Here I Go Again\\", which was done by his replacement Adrian Vandenberg.  The album is repleat with heavy guitar riffs, shred style soloing (some songs) and a very thick 80's production job.  This is a heavier album, if you will, than his Blue Murder album but both showcase his extensive playing and writing/arrangement skills.<br /><br />I recommend this album to those who remember the 80's and lived thru them, are John Sykes fans or simply love 80's hard rock. If you can choke past the ballads -there are some real rockers here.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I don't know if it's the instruments they use or their voices, but this album and the sound of the songs makes me think of childhood. I really like to add Freelance Whale's album Kilojoules and Temper Trap and I'm jamming for quite sometime.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Short but sweet: I remember WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY back in '95/'96 when I saw the ads for this movie and how it was the first of its kind in that it had a big budget and (for then) high tech special effects.  I saw it in theaters the night before it was officially released, and it blew my mind!<br /><br />Look, by today's standards the effects are (somewhat) dated, this was the 90's, and CGI was starting to be used more and more (unlike today where it's practically the standard).  The movie has everything that a movie of this type should have: action, humor, good acting, a decent plot, and -POPCORN!<br /><br />As I've stated for \\"Battleship\\": this is NOT \\"2001...\\" -there are plot holes and goofy things you'll find wrong with it, but if you watch it for what it is; an \\"aliens invade us\\" movie and not worry about being too serious, you might just enjoy!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I loved Tuesdays with Morrie but this new book didn't thrill me that much.  It's an interesting concept but just not something that is super enlightening or thought provoking.
B00164EAC8|3.0|Okay, I have been a Godzilla fan since I was born (literally) and when I saw the ads for this movie in '97/'98 -I was genuinely excited.  Well, the movie was a let down for a lot fans due to the changes to Godzilla's physical features and the casting... The movie did well initially but has been lambasted for the plot, aforementioned casting choices, as well as other issues...<br /><br />It actually starts out on a somewhat serious tone but by the end of the movie -you're like \\"really?\\"... This was made by the same creative team that made \\"Independence Day\\" -features some great CGI (for the 90's folks, for the 90's) and so forth.  They simply bit off more than they could chew by \\"American-izing\\" it way too much... Godzilla will forever be a Japanese character and should have been treated with a lot more respect.<br /><br />The movie isn't THAT bad but it isn't THAT good -depends on what you can handle... I recommend only for fans of monster movies, or old Godzilla movies who won't take this to heart like so many people did.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child's new Reacher book is something of a fall off from his prior standard, although the man can still spin a yarn. We've seen too many TV shows based on interservice rivalry for this plot to be fully satisfying, and Reacher doesn't get to have sex with a female peace officer [:-)]. But Child can still surprise us with his intermediate plot elements, and Reacher, described in the book as \\"a gorilla with a broken nose,\\" remains a great character.
1454701250|5.0|Making an Impression is a beautiful book and is totally useful as well. The photos are amazing, giving you a glimpse into Geninne's gorgeous home and studio. The text is very easy to read, not overly technical, but still highly detailed. The book opens flat due to the binding which makes it easier to put on your worktable while you are carving. After a techniques section there are lots of projects showing you ways to use the stamps you carve. The back of the book has templates to trace if you'd like to carve stamps using Geninne's motifs, or you can carve stamps of your own design.<br /><br />I carved my first stamp last night, using the instructions in this book, and now I'm totally addicted. This is a new craft for me and I'm in love thanks to Geninne's beautiful book!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|WARNING-SPOILER!!! I recently saw this film on my cable provider's V.O.D. service, in which you can 'rent' films for $4.99. As soon as it was over, I jumped in the car & ran to the 24 hour Wal-Mart & bought it for my collection! Collecting films (& music) is/has been a serious hobby for me since I was a kid & VHS was the main format! My DVD Collection spans over 2,400+ & growing daily.<br />  This particular film is, to me, a masterpiece. David Fincher (Se7en, Panic Room) outdid himself w/ the mood, angles, & general helming of the picture. The cast-terrific! Craig does so well as Blomkvist, that you forget that he ever was in a Bond/007 picture-let alone Bond himself! Tricia Rooney Mara in the role of Salander? I have no words. & I believe THAT alone speaks volumes! Stellan Skarsgard is wonderfully evil in the most elegant way & you can see that he enjoyed every minute of this role! The supporting cast was chosen perfectly. Christopher Plummer, Joley Richardson, Robin Wright, & a nice cameo by Alan Dale (Season 3 of \\"24\\")!<br />  I found there to be a touch of a film-noir feeling around the whole mystery & how Fincher chose to film it. Perhaps it wasn't intentional, but friends of mine (that know film) also sensed it as well! The feel of this film is quite unique. Suspense is abundant, as well. The DVD itself looks like a 'bootleg', as it's on a Sony DVD-R, & the title looks like it was written w/ a Sharpie, but it is NOT! This caused a bit of confusion upon the inital release! If you look closley @ the disc, you'll see the 'razor blade' printed-the same 1 that Lisbeth wears around her neck in the picture!<br />  The Bonus Feature that you get w/ the DVD is a Feature-Length Audio Commentary by Fincher, which I seriously suggest taking a listen to! The insight is very detailed! The 'cover-art' is really unique. The packaging is all cardboard & folds out to reveal different images from the film. Having the original 'cover-art' is very, very important to me. I will not add a film to my collection w/out it!<br />  This is a 4-star film-hands down & will be a classic, I'm sure. If you love mysteries, suspense, & great filmaking-don't rent it, just buy it!t add a film to my collection w/out it!<br />  This is a 4-star film-hands down & will be a classic, I'm sure.

B002SAS26E|5.0|I've gotten into the hobby of game collecting (settlers of catan, ticket to ride, pandemic, dixit, etc.). The internet recommended this nice 2 player game, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />Jaipur is a pretty intense game of trading and selling of goods as you and your opponent collect goods from the market (table). What makes this trading game particularly interesting are the camels which serve as proxy cards with no trade value, except at the end, yet help or disrupt the collection of cards coming into the market.<br /><br />The design of this game fascinates me. Setup is easy with a few stacks of tokens and a single deck of cards making one shared table space. Its rules are clear, short, and easy to pick up. However, despite its concise rules and setup, it has a surprising amount of depth with tense chance and strategy coming at you with each turn:<br /><br />- Trade item now? Or wait for the market to bring more of the same good and trade in for a bonus? Be mindful of the precious points lost when not making the first trade for that good! No more than 7 cards in that hand!<br /><br />- What about those camel cards in the market? Do you collect them all (no more, no less) to help collect more cards in the future (camels don't count against the hand count)? Or do you wait and have your opponent collect them and open up the market for fresh (potentially nice) cards.<br /><br />- What?! The game is finished already?! (Opponent cleared third stock of goods or deck is depleted [game over!])<br /><br />Game time ranges from ~20-30 minutes to play best of 3 which the game is set up to play for. It's fast and can be over before you know it.<br /><br />It'll take a couple of rounds to get a solid feel for the game.<br /><br />A bit pricey for the amount of stuff in the box (cards, tokens, and instructions in english, french, and german). But all the contents is of very good quality with nice durable cards and thick, stiff, cardboard token pieces. The box is of nice quality cardboard and stores the cards and tokens on a good quality plastic tray. Most importantly, its gameplay is unique, innovative, brutal, and concise. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase and feel this game has some mileage ahead.<br /><br />Easy to travel with, recommend a small, stable table space of sorts for laying down cards.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ality cardboard and stores the cards and tokens on a good quality plastic tray.

0385344333|2.0|Let me just say that these Reacher stories are getting more and more ridiculous. This one has a plot that makes no sense, and bad guys who are completely faceless. And a lot of tedious arithmetic and conversions from miles to acres and the like. What is going on here. Humbug!!
B000WDROYK|4.0|This film was concocted by an experienced manipulator of emotions.  In the tradition of Hitchcock, Paul Verhoeven is a puppet-master on a grand scale who knows the science of suspense intimately and uses his skill to entertain the most sophisticated audiences today.  His ability and choices create a textbook of film-making perfection.<br /><br />His first film upon returning to his native Holland after twenty years in Hollywood, this focused visualist ventures back to his roots with a film dense in excitement and thrills.  Anyone experiencing his modernized restoration of old-fashioned entertainment should prepare for a tense, dizzying, delightful ride.  It holds viewers in a trance with a compelling story, a perfectly cast heroine, sophisticated visuals and a gifted director's rich talent for knowing his audience.<br /><br />This is a highly stylized, hugely competent genre film with acting, action and human insight not soon forgotten.<br /><br />I have worked with this man.  I wrote and approved this critique.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Tugs on the heartstrings everytime... I love this movie. If you've not seen it, you missed a boy who hears music like other people read fairy tales. Evan aka August knows he's wanted, and he must find his parents he's never met. His parents are not together, but the music weaves them all together.
B001GXF2YY|3.0|Spoiler Alert<br />The actions of the antagonists are so deplorable you can't wait to see how they will be exposed and punished. Although punishments are somewhat satisfying. In the end, Harry agrees to a cover-up to keep his job that allows the guilty to remain unexposed. The ending was so disappointing I couldn't believe it was actually the end. It's almost as if Connolly was up against a deadline and phoned it in. The fact that he didn't expose specific actions of other characters actually ruined the character for me.

B0089IGUP4|5.0|This album isn't as immediately grabbing as American Slang, nor does it have songs as catchy as '59 Sound and Great Expectations.  In fact, I was underwhelmed upon my first couple of listens.  Sure, it sounded fine, but not as immediate as their past albums.  Having listened to it many, many times over the last several weeks, I now believe it is their finest album.  The album starts strong, and finishes stronger without any hint of a letdown in the middle.  Every song is fantastic on its own, but as a collection and a total album they are better than a sum of their parts.<br /><br />This is the rare example of a band showing a bit more of a mature sound and growing as songwriters and musicians, and having it pay off.  If this album increases their popularity, it's not because they went for a poppier sound or sold out on their essence; they simply made a fantastic record.  As much as I liked their earlier work, I believe this one may go down as their masterpiece.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. This book is very similar to another book \\"Seal Team Six\\" both of these books are great if you enjoy getting a peek at some of what our troops face in regards to training, and insights in to their missions. Like he said early in the book, if you are looking for secrets, this is not that book. Great read for anyone interested in military and military tactics, training.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|SPOILER ALERT - Read at your own risk.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a late 20's, adopted control freak billionarie. He is a very disturbed complex man whom is heavily involved in BDSM. (yes I had to look up that meaning myself too) In a weird sort of kinky \\"Twilight\\" way he is obsessed with a mouse of a girl, whom is quite innocent in the sexual world.  At first its all about the \\"game D&S\\" but it starts turning to something more. (hint hint for all you romance novel lovers - not in the traditional way though)And yes the title involves his description of himself.<br /><br />I don't normally read books that create a plot around \\"porn sex\\" but to be fair you have to understand the sex in order to get the storyline. I have only read the first book and very intrigued as to where this storyline will be going. I have an idea but the ending of book 1 surprised me a bit. So who really knows where this is going??!!<br />I have been told the last 2 books don't have as much sex (which will be nice) and are better than the first. (I will let you know when I read the other two)<br /><br />All in all I gave this book a 4 star just because I couldn't put it down. It wasn't about the sex it was the story as to why he is that way and how the girl fits into his 'dark world'. The first book gives you hints but it will not tell you everything. And the fact, as  screwed up this guy is, how could he possibly have any feelings beyond sex....<br /><br />WARNING: very explicit sex and moderate language....uses the F-word a lot.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|I've never done this before, but I have to say that charging $25.00 for a Kindle product is way out of my comfort zone. I loved the prequel and would very much like to read the sequel but not at that price. So in the hopes that the marketing division is watching, you have been warned. Screwing the reader is not the way to go. I'll wait unit l can get a copy from the library.<br /><br />Then I'll write a review.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's true, it's quite addicting. Waiting for more coins is a bummer; however, it also requires me to strategize and place the few precious coins left purposefully.  Try it out, rate it for yourself. Worst thing that happens is that you delete it. Enjoy this temporarily free game.

B005LAIGP0|5.0|\\"The Woman In Black\\". Theatrical release: February 2012. It's a horror/thriller movie based on Susan Hill's book of the same title. It is a classical ghost story set in a village in the early Edwardian times (1901-1917) England. It lacks the fast-paced and gory scenes of contemporary horror films which I think is the strength of this motion picture. Although it's James Watkins' (director) second attempt on directing, he succeeded in frightening us and capturing our interest without splashing blood, displaying brutally dismembered bodies, or strong sexual content. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) as the lead, proved to be a successful gamble. Daniel brilliantly portrayed a mature solicitor which is a great departure from the mischievous adolescent Harry Potter we've gotten used to. Beside the evil ghost, the movie also deals with abstract human emotions such as the pain of loosing someone and cooping with the aftermath. So, prepare to be scared with class and eloquence with a hint of tragedy. I also recommend the book as it has a different ending.

B005LAII8A|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />The near universal critical acclaim for 'Looper' is something I'm having a hard time fathoming. I suppose we haven't seen a great sci-fi thriller in such a long time, that as soon as a mediocre to average flick such as this one comes along, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon, practically calling it a masterpiece!<br /><br />My first problem with 'Looper' is the overall concept. A crime syndicate in the future (2074 )wants to dispose of its victims by sending them 30 years back into the past and have them disposed of by hit men, who they pay with bars of silver. Once these hit men (the loopers) live their lives for thirty years, the syndicate decides to dispose of them by sending them back to 2044, where they'll be disposed of, sometimes even by their younger selves.<br /><br />It's explained that in the future bodies are 'tagged' so by sending them back in time, they cannot be traced. But why can't the syndicate send their victims in the present immediately back to 65 million B.C. where they would probably be immediately eaten by a dinosaur or other prehistoric animal, thus preventing the time-line from being tampered with? And by cutting out the middlemen (i.e. the loopers) in this way, the syndicate can keep all the profits for themselves.<br /><br />Once we're introduced to the novelty of the how the looper scheme operates, the novelty soon wears off. We see Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) traveling to the cornfield and then performing executions one too many times. Finally, there's a plot twist: fellow looper Seth appears at Joe's apartment, explaining that his 30 year old self from the future appears in the cornfield and he's unable to finish the job. Abe, the enforcer from the future, forces Joe to betray Seth, who's tortured and his alter ego from the future is hunted down. You might ask what this has to do with time travel or science-fiction. Actually nothing--it's simply all action-thriller at this point in time in the script.<br /><br />Soon, Joe finds himself in the same position as Seth. His 30 year old future self (Bruce Willis) appears but manages to prevent younger Joe from doing him in. In a rather derivative idea borrowed from the 'Terminator' series, Willis must dispose of a child who will one day grow up to be the 'Rainmaker', the sinister figure in the future who is now bent on eliminating all the loopers.<br /><br />It might have been interesting had we seen what this Rainmaker character looked and acted like in the future, but that never occurs. We're asked to be content with meeting little Cid, our future Rainmaker, who has telekinetic powers coupled with a severe anger management problem. One is immediately reminded of Billy Mumy in the Season 3 Twilight Zone episode, \\"It's a Good Life\\", who plays a mutant who terrifies adults by 'wishing them away to the cornfield'. So the second half of 'Looper' feels much more like fantasy-horror vs. Sci-fi action thriller.<br /><br />The meeting between the younger and older Joes in the diner is perhaps the most interesting scene in the film as it underscores the contrast between the more impulsive younger self with the more seasoned, experienced older one. Unfortunately, there is hardly any additional interaction between the two altar egos, with older Joe stalking off to blow away Abe and his crew of malevolent meanies. In true Bruce Willis fashion, the aging 'Die Hard' legend, is up to his old tricks, by machine-gunning most of the bad guys, sans Kid Blue, who appears out of nowhere on his flying motorcycle and immediately gets himself killed, instead of Joe, who is his intended target.<br /><br />If the Looper second half feels a bit slower than the first, that's because director Rian Johnson spends a little too much time out on the farm, with Joe courting Sara (Emily Blunt). Although there's a feeling that we've seen this before, the ending proves to be passable as we finally have something to feel good about. Younger Joe sacrifices himself, preventing older Joe from killing Sara. He does this after he's able to foresee that Cid, growing up as the Rainmaker, will hold a perpetual grudge due to the murder of his mother and will take it out on all of humanity (including all the loopers) in the future.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Joe's sacrifice, is not enough to make either young Joe or older Joe, likable. Younger Joe, before he takes his own life, is a criminal and a drug addict and older Joe, is responsible for murdering the second child on his list of three potential Rainmakers. In terms of a sympathetic protagonists, there's little to like here at all.<br /><br />'Looper' is also unable to score points with its look at the dystopian future. One feels that one is simply viewing a second hand set from 'Robocop'--in that film, 'Old Detroit' looks remarkably similar to Looper's Kansas City of 2044 including the grimy 'futuristic' cars and emphasis on vagrancy as a national blight.<br /><br />The performances in Looper are all acceptable, with an honorable mention going to little Pierce Gagnon as Cid, who manages to handle a number of complicated lines and take direction in a fashion way above his chronological age.<br /><br />In the end, Looper proves only mildly interesting. While some of the action sequences are entertaining, the sci-fi premise is not developed into something clever enough to deserve all the the accolades that have been heaped upon it to date.nger Joe sacrifices himself, preventing older Joe from killing Sara.

0316228532|4.0|We were all warned that this is an adult novel,  and not a sequel to Harry Potter.  This is a very readable story about a beautiful village, Pagford and a large cast of flawed people.  You will find authentic British vocabulary here,  which I find delightful.  Other cranky Americans will gripe about minivans called  \\"people carriers\\"  and high school called  \\"fifth and sixth forms\\"  and the like.  Anyway the Council Head  (that's a city councilman for you testy Americans)  drops dead and the political wranglings and personal struggles of many residents makes for a British Miniseries novel.<br /> Rowling proves that she is not just a great storyteller (Harry Potter)  she is truly a great writer.  I like her style,  especially the paragraph-long musing asides that are placed in parenthesis.<br /> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that we needed to have a main protagonist early in the story.  She brings out loads of characters and the desires of each in quick vignettes.  I would have liked it a bit more if I had a good person I could identify with central to the story.  There are many characters here,  most with selfish and prurient interests.  It makes a good story, but I needed an angelic Elizabeth Bennett to interact with the sinners in order to get grounded.  Still a really good read.  Don't listen to the Kindle edition complainers.  I quit buying bestsellers on Kindle--  they don't read as well as a real book.

1476712042|3.0|What we have here is a perfect example of synecdoche, in which the title tells you everything you need to know about the book itself.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy wants you to think she is a Good Girl. She adorns herself with preppy cardigans, sticks close to her best friend, and avoids Bad Boys. When she winds up in an underground fight club-type place, she locks eyes with the victorious fighter, Travis Maddox. She is intrigued.<br /><br />The cousin of her best friend's boyfriend (I know, I had the same eye roll), Travis is straight out of Central Casting for \\"Bad Boys,\\" down to the tattoos and the penchant for one night stands. He never met an emotional attachment that he cared to make, other than with his family. And when he sees Abby, he is intrigued.<br /><br />Abby's first move is brilliant: she acts completely unimpressed. And she is, to some degree. Yes, she is attracted to him, but she refuses to be another notch on his scarred belt. She dresses down, she is rude and sarcastic, and she tells him that he has no chance with her. When they spend the night together, they actually SLEEP together. No hanky panky occurs. Travis, for all of his overflowing testosterone, likes Abby; he genuinely enjoys her company and is determined to not mess up this friendship.<br /><br />We know, however, that he will mess it up, and Abby will as well. It is just a matter of pages until they wind up romantically linked, especially when Abby loses a bet and has to move in with Travis for a month. What is good about their first encounter is that Abby makes the decision to be with him. Travis empowers her in that sense, and it's nice to read some YA lit that does not have the girl swooning uncontrollably over her hard-to-read love interest.<br /><br />And that's where the \\"disaster\\" portion of this book comes into play. Travis! What in the world happens to you? What fresh hell does Jamie McGuire do to you?<br /><br />Here is one answer: she takes a strong, interesting character and turns him into one that is veritably emasculated, dull, and insipid. Travis becomes the girl; he cries and screams and begs. He ditches his boxes of condoms along with his dignity, and we lose interest in him just as quickly. The man who oozed masculinity and dominance now simpers along, weak and uninspired. We are meant to see that Abby changed him from Bad Boy to Boy Worth Loving, but instead he comes across as utterly unappealing.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the ending. Not only does it defy all logic, it appears to defy its characters. We are led to believe certain things about Abby and Travis, yet McGuire ends in it a way that is so unfaithful to them that you wonder if there was a publishing error in which another book's ending was cut and pasted onto this one.<br /><br />The first half of this book is 'beautiful.' Abby, Travis and their friends are created with care and creativity. We like them. We are interested in them. We care about them. And then comes the 'disaster,' and you will want to shout in frustration.<br /><br />This could have been so good. But it just is not.<br /><br />One word of warning: while this is Young Adult lit, the emphasis is on \\"adult.\\" There are fairly detailed sexual situations, as well as alcohol usage.<br /><br />Published on cupcake's book cupboard. @VivaAmaRisata<br />Thanks to NetGalley for the preview.rns him into one that is veritably emasculated, dull, and insipid.

B0085PP8UE|5.0|This book is written from Orwell's real life experiences in Paris and London. It brilliantly illustrates the hardship of many people in the large cities of Europe, which is now more than relevant during the current hard times. This account is superbly written, and although it is probably not the best of Orwell's works, it's still a must- read for Orwell's fans.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting and well written. A pretty easy read of about 350 pages gives the reader an inside look at the events leading up to the raid in Abbottabad. Setting the record of the invasion straight. And as an extra bonus he gives the reader a little insight on what it takes to be a Navy Seal and part of the DEVGRU team.

B001KVZ6HK|3.0|First off, I am a Marvel fan,DC as well for that matter, so as an established comics fan don't expect me to start comparing to or saying things like\\" ohh Batman is better for yacketty yack....\\" I enjoyed the movie...enough for after blowing X amount of dollars seeing it in 3D at the theater to not only buy it on Bluray....but get the 3D Bluray pack.<br /> Now here is where I have my complaints....<br />Pretty much the only reason anyone buys these movies on bluray, let alone the super combo pack, is for the extra features, as the avengers was lacking severely.<br />Two 15 minute featurettes, that show nothing that we haven't seen, cut scenes that are unimpressive, and trust me on their lack of luster....and then there's the sick joke of second screen....where if you don't have a bluray drive on your pc, you need a PS3 AND an ipad to view it on...<br />The only extra worth seeing is the gag reel, and that's only a few minutes long.<br /> So yeah, this is a complete waste of the format, only to be bought if you are a completist , and hopefully you found it dirt cheap somewhere, otherwise just pick up the no frills version and avoid feeling your wallet weep, or the thought of Joss pointing and laughing at your expendature in the same way the dog in duck hunt would do.

0061743526|2.0|This was an excellent book for my taste, it made you think about life but...We all know teens would dislike this book. What they want now is action, love, revenge, hate. Not a book that teaches you about life's meaning. Let's face it, nowadays kids do not like this kind of book, although I loved it, they want more modern books that could happen in a near future. They do not like classic or boring things, they want heart-breaking books that leave you wishing more and more. It's the same with everything; games clothes, TV series, music... People's likes change during history, everything changes. Here are some examples of books teens usually read: Divergent, The hunger games, Starters, The kill order, Unwind, Delirium and much more. I repeat, I loved this book, every grown up I know and read it, loved it. But ask your kids if they LOVED it or if they would have wanted something more new, modern.<br /><br />Make yourself the question: Do our kids like the same things as we did when we were their age?<br />Think of it.<br /><br />Anonymous Reader

160774273X|5.0|I have to admit that I did not buy my first copy of this book from Amazon. I bought it at Ken's book release party at his bakery. It was worth the extra money to get it signed. That said, I'll be buying more of them from Amazon because they will be an awesome gift.<br /><br />Ken Forkish is clearly an obsessive bread lover. This book is well written and the author's passion shows through wonderfully. I don't know of another cookbook that I've actually sat down to READ. Ken loves bread and he loves his business. The book makes that exceptionally clear.<br /><br />One thing you need to be careful about. If you want to buy a book that is chock full of bread recipes, then this is not your book. You won't find a Challah recipe, or even (surprisingly) a baguette (Ken told me that he has nothing to add to the art of the baguette). It's not a cookbook,; it's not a recipe collection.<br /><br />What you will find is a lot of detail on the craft, proofing, quality ingredients, technique, subtlety, and love.  I submit that there are lots of books on bread recipes, but that only THIS book explains the subtle craft in a way that we amateurs and home bakers can find compelling. So, this should not be your only bread book. But, unquestionably, it MUST be among them!<br /><br />Bravo Ken. I LOVE this book.

It has grown into such an Amazing story line. Very hard to put down.  I am looking forward to Book Three of the trilogy. I am reading 'THE BOOK', as my Dear, Friend Diz, and I refer to it. We are reading it at the same time and have each other to email to discuss with. She, Diz, we shall call her, has actually made my reading so much more. It has now become an enthralling adventure. It is so much more entertaining, to read a book, such as this, with your SPECIAL Friend! I Thank GOD for giving me an Amazing Friend in my life, at a time when I was so Broken in my own life. Myself, losing my Mom just recently. And her losing her Mom in years past. We now have formed a remarkable friendship, and bond over reading Fifty Shades of Grey together, but miles apart.  We are having so much enjoyment with the quotes n phrases. Laters, Baby has become our cup of tea... Rolling my eyes at the moment. Unexpected, exciting conversations, emails and gifts. I only wish you all were as Lucky and Blessed as I have been. To read n share thoughts about Miss Steel and Mr. Messed(being nice) in the head, but HOT Christian Grey. Im just glad a book has finally been written so well, it has taken my mind off of my own problems n stress in my life. Thank you E.L. For writing 'THE BOOKs,' the trilogy that has happily consumed my time, in a good way!

B008Y6WPXC|1.0|This film was hard to sit through.  So many times I was going to turn it off, but I continued to watch, hoping it might get better, but it just got worse.  Plot-less, thoughtless, no adequate motivation to drive the main character forward in the story.  Truly boring and uninspired.  The only redeeming aspects of the film was the nearly non-stop explosions, gun fights, knife fights, and MMA.  This is the film for you if you enjoy pure action and are not concerned about a good story line.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|You can't hire much needed extra restaurant crew without paying for them with the stupid in-game currency. I hate this new &quot;free to play&quot; trend, because the games are barely playable unless you want to keep purchasing their in-game items. At least make the important game factors free. This is more like a trial that is only playable for a short time before the game mechanics force you to purchase something to actually make the game enjoyable. Also it does get boring pretty quick, not enough changes as you progress.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I don't normally watch children's or family-oriented movies, but I kinda got cornered into watching this one. However, now that I've watched it, I'm rather glad I did.<br /><br />This movie may have been written for children; however it tackles some very adult issues. It tackles the issue of deforestation. It tackles the issue of rampant consumerism. And it also tackles the issue of unregulated capitalism.<br /><br />This movie doesn't merely entertain. It also educates and has a social message. It had appeared to me that we stopped teaching our children social messages back in the 1980s, but apparently I was wrong. Apparently *some* people out there still think that our children are worth educating and molding into responsible, community-minded individuals.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Should we anthropomorphize the film INCEPTION the first thing it might well say is: \\"LOOPER is the most intelligent and ba11sy sci-fi picture since, well, me.\\" And maybe it'll even observe: \\"Doesn't Leonardo diCaprio hava a humongous head disproportionate to his body?\\" (But that's probably me projecting.) I love time travel stories almost more than I love my dog. And if these same stories should come with the clever and the inventiveness and the sheer pizazz, then I love them more than my nana (who hates my dog). LOOPER thrills and provokes thought and, with its dizzying twists, compels you to stay alert. But perhaps the most remarkable bit is that while director/writer Rian Johnson demonstrates great flair in establishing the dystopian, near futuristic backdrop and, with it, the concept of time travel, he switches things up and grips you with character work. I wasn't expecting to be so drawn into the characters. LOOPER presents a cast in its finest form.<br /><br />The year is 2044, and near-future Kansas has assumed a BLADERUNNERy urban aesthetic, if not exactly in visuals then at least in slick-grungy bleakness. It's a world in which 10% of the population has mutated into low-level telekinetics, able only to float a quarter, maybe make it spin around in the air if they're extra-gifted. The TKs are regarded as jokes, as walking social gaffes, but never mind. The head-boggling stuff launches with this premise: Thirty years from 2044, time travel will be invented but then promptly declared illegal. Except when did crooks ever toe the line? In the future's future, crime syndicates apply time travel to dispose of their dirty laundry, of their unfinished business. Victims targeted for execution are sent back to the past, cuffed and bagged over their head, bar of silver affixed upon their person. Back in 2044 contracted trigger men called \\"loopers\\" arrive at an assigned place and time. When the victim manifests from thin air, the looper mows him down with a primitive blunderbuss. The silver is payment for services rendered. And Joe Simmons (Gordon-Levitt), ice water and apathy and strange pharmaceuticals running in his veins, has amassed quite a pile of silver.<br /><br />When the crime syndicate wants to terminate a looper's contract, it sends the older version of that looper thirty years back in time, gold bars strapped to him, to be killed by his younger self, and this is called \\"closing the loop.\\" The gold is the younger self's retirement fee. So imagine the existential angst that comes with knowing that you've murdered yourself and that your time on earth has a known expiration date. Every looper dreads the coming day when he'll have to eliminate himself. And when Joe Simmons at last meets his older self, he hesitates just long enough for Old Joe to escape. The fit's now hit the shan.<br /><br />From the moment Old Joe (Willis) appears, we're treated to his perspective as well. And it's mostly thru Old Joe's eyes that we learn of the Rainmaker, a shadowy crime lord in 2074 who's bent on eradicating all existing loopers, on closing all the loops. Rian Johnson layers in another plot thread that features a surprisingly tough Emily Blunt playing a weathered (yet very sexy) farm woman named Sara. Joe Simmons, the younger version, is now on the run from the mob because of his bungle. And even though Joe means to hunt down his older self and snuff him and so get back into the mob's good graces, he wanders into Sara's neck of the woods. Interesting stuff happens at the farm.<br /><br />This is the best I've seen Bruce Willis in a while. Shows you how good he can be when he commits fully to a role. He refrains from exhibiting his patented swagger, his showy mannerisms. Going in, I had anticipated siding with Willis' character but I was startled to realize that I was rooting more for Gordon-Levitt's more stoic Joe. Old Joe remains sympathetic as he finds himself faced with having to make a terrible decision. Gordon-Levitt turns in another terrific performance. Grafted with a prosthetic nose and having screwed contacts in, he still only vaguely resembles Willis. But there's enough there in terms of familiar cadence and facial expressions that you don't mind going along with the intent. I can't not mention how very good Jeff Daniels is here. He plays a mobster sent from the future to preside over the syndicate's interests in 2044. Daniels steals more than his share of scenes, his facade of scruffy benevolence masking a sadistic, vindictive streak. Meanwhile, child actor Pierce Gagnon fleshes out Sara's troubled (and, frankly, kinda creepy) 10-year-old son Cid. Gagnon possesses a knack for putting on these terrifying scowls, and there were moments onscreen in which I half-expected Cid to whisk someone to the cornfield, if you get the Bill Mumy reference.<br /><br />LOOPER is no sci-fi for dummies. It's a haunting high concept sci-fi thriller. It's got big brains and an audaciousness and unexpected emotional heft. It offers memorable scenes like the old looper's meeting his very grotesque end and the one in which Sara's ten-year-old exercises an apocalyptic tantrum. But my favorite scene is probably the diner conversation between Young and Old Joe, two distinct people divided by the measure of a dining table and thirty years of added living. LOOPER promotes debate. It dusts off old questions such as \\"If you go back in time and come in contact with your younger self, will both of you implode?\\" (no, you don't) or \\"If you could, would you go back in time and kill H!tler when he was a baby?\\" (...)her terrific performance. Grafted with a prosthetic nose and having screwed contacts in, he still only vaguely resembles Willis. But there's enough there in terms of familiar cadence and facial expressions that you don't mind going along with the intent. I can't not mention how very good Jeff Daniels is here. He plays a mobster sent from the future to preside over the syndicate's interests in 2044. Daniels steals more than his share of scenes, his facade of scruffy benevolence masking a sadistic, vindictive streak. Meanwhile, child actor Pierce Gagnon fleshes out Sara's troubled (and, frankly, kinda creepy) 10-year-old son Cid. Gagnon possesses a knack for putting on these terrifying scowls, and there were moments onscreen in which I half-expected Cid to whisk someone to the cornfield, if you get the Bill Mumy reference.<br /><br />LOOPER is no sci-fi for dummies. It's a haunting high concept sci-fi thriller. It's got big brains and an audaciousness and unexpected emotional heft. It offers memorable scenes like the old looper's meeting his very grotesque end and the one in which Sara's ten-year-old exercises an apocalyptic tantrum. But my favorite scene is probably the diner conversation between Young and Old Joe, two distinct people divided by the measure of a dining table and thirty years of added living. LOOPER promotes debate. It dusts off old questions such as \\"If you go back in time and come in contact with your younger self, will both of you implode?\\" (no, you don't) or \\"If you could, would you go back in time and kill H!tler when he was a baby?\\" (...)
B005KQVDH8|4.0|Goonies on Blu Ray is a pretty good transfer. Not the best, but lots of fun to go back to this classic in high def. The end scene in the water looks great, the blue water really shines... The 5.1 sound of water trickling all over the place inside and outside of the boat sounds great! Many small things throughout the movie look good, the part with the keyboard is neat because you can see small details you couldn't pick up on earlier versions. Bright colors, Chunk's red jacket has never looked so red! If you are a big fan it's worth the upgrade, and if you haven't seen it in years it's a fun one to go back to!
0316228532|2.0|So expensive. So eagerly awaited. So disappointed.<br /><br />I kept looking down the page on my Kindle to see how far I had read. Halfway thru, I started skipping pages and, finally, chapters.<br /><br />In addition, Hachette Publishers pushed an illegible e-copy and I spent the better part of a day trying to get this mess sorted.<br /><br />Amazon stood tall in correcting my e-copy. Their service rep was so very helpful and understanding about my frustration. A tip of the hat to Brian and to Amazon.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Play the game on Facebook daily and this version is the same great game. It was the free game that reeled me in. Just started playing on my Kindle Fire and I love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm Martha Maurice's wife.  I'm 75 years old and was curious to read \\" Fifty Shades of Grey\\".  My comment is.... thankful I have a husband. Couldn't stop reading after the first. Had to read all three.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am on my second session of reading these books and they are magnificent! If you need something that will keep your attention then this is the book for you!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an entertaining book that wakes up the imagination. Once you read the first book you cannot wait for the second and third.

B0051RP4DA|5.0|Beautifully sung, played & great instrumentations.  Not a big Pearl Jam fan, but I love Eddie Vedder and his performance here is great.  Wonderfully arranged pieces, sung and played with a refreshing delicacy.  Highly recommended, mostly gentle sounds.
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|I like all of hsi music...some a little more out there than others...but all in all...I would buy most of his discs...his voice is a little different in the newer discs as he's matured..but still has that something that grabs a listener and brings his words home.<br />Good all the time.<br />Milly, Mississauga, ON Canada

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I've read all the Reacher books and liked them all. This one is vintage Reacher/Child in presentation, but it lacked the personal interaction between Reacher and his chosen accomplice that we usually see. The interaction that existed was sterile with little character development. The book moved a bit slowly and sometimes bogged down in too much technical detail--for example, way too much description of the final underground nest of the bad guys. I skipped whole paragraphs of description to get to the action, but it moved like all of the Reacher books carrying the reader toward the big \\"shoot-out\\" with the bad guys where Reacher's skills would shine and bad guys would permanently go away. Getting there is always fun with the Reacher novels. It's why we read them and read them in a few days. Additionally, the plot was a little thin. The explanation/understanding of exactly what the bad guys were intending to pull off was not entirely clear, but it didn't matter because getting to the bad guys is where the book really lives. Having said all that, it was still a good read. Reacher never seems to get any older when in action and is the unsung hero that we all love.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Funny, \\"chick flick\\". I watched this movie and laughed quite a bit. Some of the characters are totally unrealistic but that is what makes it so funny.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My husband and I loved to play this at the fair - until our town deemed it 'gambling' and refused to allow it as a game. Now we can have fun playing it again wherever we like - and we don't have to have a pocket full of quarters to play! Easy UI, regenerative coins and prizes, plus a puzzle to complete makes it a game you can play for a long long time. Good job, GameCircus!
B005K17RU0|5.0|i like it more than other available options.  great work and would recommend. wife installed on her kindle as well.
B008FIHUDO|5.0|Bettye LaVette is a force of nature. That she is still alive and kicking hard after 50 years of slogging around the peripheries of show business is a testament to the power of this extraordinary musician.  The story of her success, which continues to grow at the age of 66 (born January 29, 1946), is bittersweet and heartwarming.  Her bio can be found in many places and she's been very busy giving interviews in support of this new CD, so I'll simply focus on the music at hand.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to hear her perform most of this CD live before I picked it up at the release party in New York City. I'm still buzzing from the experience.  The song selection is brilliant here, with every cut reflecting some aspect of her life experience, personality or philosophy.  Bettye is quoted as saying that she doesn't care who wrote a song or who sang it:  once she sings it, it's an R&B song and it belongs to HER.  Indeed, it does.<br /><br />Bettye is a ferociously intelligent singer whose commitment to the meaning of a song is absolute.  Combine that commitment with one of the funkiest and most expressive R&B voices ever, and the sterling contribution of her band, who serve Bettye in the manner she deserves, and you've got the makings of high art.  Her mission seems to be to strive for an authenticity, honesty, self-reflection and unself-righteous sermonizing that most performers can't touch.  Listen to her renditions of Dylan's \\"Everything is Broken,\\" the Gnarls Barkley hit \\"Crazy,\\" Sly Stone's \\"Thankful N' Thoughtful,\\" Beth Nielsen Chapman's \\"Fair Enough,\\" and the remarkable \\"The More I Search The More I Die,\\" and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />A special highlight is \\"Dirty Old Town,\\" done two ways.  The explanation for this dual presentation is that her producer wanted a funky mid-tempo approach, but Bettye and her band (\\"being from Detroit,\\" as she put it), wanted to do it like a funeral dirge.  In the end, she chose both.  But it's the funeral dirge that winsthe day.  The song, about life in a working class town in Lancashire, England, was written in the 1940's by Ewan MacColl (who also wrote \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\").  Bettye changed the place names to reflect the areas of Detroit that were important to her as a young girl, and thus paints a deeply personal, heart rending picture of growing up, loving and attempting to thrive in a bleak economic and social ghetto.<br /><br />And anyone who likes Otis Redding and Al Greene will really enjoy her old school take on Patti Griffin's \\"Time Will Do The Talking,\\" which coulda shoulda woulda been a big hit back in the day.<br /><br />\\"Thankful N' Thoughtful\\" is a record of one remarkable artist's survival and triumph through all manner of strife and transcendence.  Bettye is very generous, and if you accept the deep gifts she offers here, you'll be changed.<br /><br />Addendum:  It's a sin that this terrific CD was not nominated for a Grammy this year.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Challenging designs and nice backgrounds. Some choices in tile colors or design would be nice too. The real challenge is hurrying to finish while being lulled into a soporific state by the zen-like music.
0307592731|3.0|it is good. like a stick of beef jerky at a baseball game. something not totally wholesome for your body...a slightly guilty pleasure...and yet utterly, totally satisfying.<br />this is what i wanted when i picked up the memoir, eat, pray, love, ---something like this. a memoir both sweet and unforgiving, a survival mode biography for females who want to kick the past in the ass, a steady stream of travels and thoughts i will probably never make or have, but ahoy---a dame we can all connect with who makes our lives seem larger just through reading her lines of wisdom. oh no, this was not like that eat, pray, love book on which so many of us had prematurely bloomed hearts for. and then cried and wailed. because she had money, and a book deal, and the more we thought about it the more we realized we had been duped and even further maligned. that book promised so much, like an italian lover, and like most italian lovers, was a severe and utter dissapointment. something to be shoved under the bed and forgotten about for a bit while you regained your self-confidence again and had breakfast with the girls.<br />but no, this was good. it was good in its delivery and honesty. the pretty yet swift pace the writing seemed to take. it curved and swayed and blowed around in my mind much the way i pictured the hiker in this memoir on the cliffs and forests of her pacific hike. that is a good thing.<br />the point has been made that she is difficult to like. i disagree. she is human, and therefore, flawed and full of open sores, but unlike many memoirists cheryl strayed doesn't gloss over the unhappy stuff. she lays her load down. she reaches out her needle marked arms and sighs for forgivness and strength. she bellows at the sight of a bull. she talks to herself when she's lonely. and she makes mistake after god damn mistake. the way broken people seem to do it.<br />to my red blooded american soul, that's a normal lady. elizabeth gilbert, with her handsome loves and top notch italian food and meditation guru--now, that...just isn't quite right. perhaps i have it all backwards. but i do get cheryl strayed. one out of two ain't bad. i get discomfort and not being prepared. like third grade all over again.<br />the akwardness of just living--just breathing--how it can be burdensome just to walk through a front door some days tears through your gut. even cowgirls get the blues.<br />blues she has. bb king would be jealous. she starts out lost; paralyzed by a recent divorce to a man she adores, a mother's death she cannot move beyond, and a drug and sex addiction that hovers around her in a guilt riddled fog.<br />so, she takes a hike. literally. ultimately, the carelessness for which she prepared for the pct, the myriad of both amazing and brutish folks she runs across, and the gravitas of being so, so alone culiminate in a well written, (at times very fun and riveting) memoir.<br />as a woman who enjoys the outdoors i find these sorts of true life tales for the feminine spirit non-existent or lacking in most (all) circumstances. i've roamed the sports section in the stacks hoping for something adventurous and smartly paced by a woman on a few occasions and have clasped the only tome i could find--a book on women who braved polar expeditions in the early 19th century--with a sense of pity and revulsion. i held it away from my body. it was talking to me as if it were whispering, \\"this is what female explorers become. black and white photos on tattered covers in which the photographer attempts to make them look as masculine and homely as possible.\\" no, no. there are women who can and do do do do do things who do not have to resort to making fire pits out of whale blubber for the men folk to warm their...... it must, it has to happen in different ways sometimes.<br />it does. this is not gloaty. it is not full of book deals and good food and rinky dink relationships that convince you that shallowness might be a good thing, after all. which is why i liked it. and i hope you do too. i think there is a little something for everyone here.<br />pick a piece of the trail. the literal or the biographical; you will find a bit of treasure to take away somewhere. even if just a clammy, whimsical frog of a bit.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I would recommend this game for hidden items and good puzzle lover's.  Kept my interest and couldn't stop playing until I finished it!
0062060562|4.0|I thought this sounded like a really great idea for a novel, and it was a definite page turner. As I read along I started to notice small things that didn't fit, which added to that uneasy feeling. The narrator, Christine is totally reliant on a husband she doesn't know, and a doctor she doesn't either. It was interesting to read through this book not knowing who to trust. Halfway through the book it did become easy to predict where it was headed but it didn't hinder the enjoyment of the book as a whole or the satisfying end.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why anyone would want to read this is  beyond me   women are not sex OBJECTS   would anyone want there daughter involved in this behavior???
B005DJGMQE|4.0|I found this movie to be intriguing and had me wanting to know more about the individuals that the movie was based on.  The movie moved well and I found myself hoping the inevitable wouldn't happen because in the end it was only a mother trying to protect her son and she paid the ultimate price.  Great set of actors throughout the film, this is a film that is a must see.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Moves quickly, exciting plot twists. Good love story. I read it in three days because I didn't want to put it down. All in all a great read.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is a great wireless gaming set.  7.1 surround works well.  Have great fun with voice changer!  Still gauging the battery life as it seems a little short but if kept plugged in while not using will be fine im sure.
B009AHWLHE|1.0|The CG is great and the movie is awful. Not a god story at all, really really bad.<br /><br />Why can't someone make a good CG movie...
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Can't go wrong with this film.  It's exciting and suspenseful.  The acting and directing was a home run.  Would watch again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game of solitair is ok, I have seen better games. I am not too happy with the the method of play, it seems a bit dull. When I come across a different presentation of solitair I probably will switch to another game. I will say for now this game is OK.
B006O2QNOU|2.0|2.5 stars.  I was hoping for a good movie.  And I'm not sure what I got.  The acting was solid.  The directing was solid.  Loved the camera work.  But if I didn't know better I would say the script was written for a low budget film.  There were very few locations...and too much dialogue (and I generally enjoy slow paced films as long as the characters are developing and I'm learning about them.)  I went from enjoying the story to wondering if it were going to 'get going' to waiting for it to hurry and end.  Basically there's not much to the characters and the main theme drags....and drags....and drags.  I think the director, actors, DP and audience deserved a better script wrapped around this story.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I have played other puzzle games before and really enjoyed them. This puzzle game is not what I expected. It is uninteresting and does not offer a challenge for the player.
B00174TKGI|5.0|Not quite a 5 star but more than a 4 :)  ... I know.  I really enjoy movies when they are as solid as this one.  Acting, directing, photography and story were so well done that it pulled me in and I didn't want the movie to end.  Very, very good!
B000FDECGA|5.0|Shogun Assassin is a extremely exciting classic video for all Kung Fu movie watchers. This story is told from his son's point of view as he travels the path of the \\"Lone Wolf\\" in this epic tale of farther and son against the world! This is a true example of actions speak louder than words type of film that just keeps your intrest from beginning to end.
B000HF6XKO|5.0|I love this type of suspenseful film.  The acting was perfect.  The story couldn't have been more solid.  The photography and color completely fit the theme of the movie.  Highly recommend if you like government conspiracy type stories (in this case...america/corporate conspiracy)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled upon this book series in an article that discussed the new breed of digital authors - books that go straight to Kindle (or any other online book system). The article mentioned Hugh Howe and his Wool series. I bought the omnibus version - this contains all 5 books in one. For six dollars I must state this was a great set of books that had me finish straight-through. All together, the individual stories make for one long but excellent story that will have you continue reading and won't stop. I have found that direct to Kindle stories have made great leaps in their story-telling - much better than the entrenched sci-fi authors that have been putting out sub-par stories for years. It's author's like this that make reading enjoyable.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Actually would give 3.5  Fun movie but wouldn't watch again.  ...and I normally watch good movies several times.  The visual effects were 5 stars.  Would recommend watching Thor.  It was the best of the super hero movies!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was highly rated which did catch my eye. They were right - It has many twists and turns that keeps the reader wondering who's really the good guy and who's the bad guy? Read this book faster than any of the last 5 books I've read - Recommend!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Beautiful visuals (and color), strong story, acting fit the story.  I would have given 4.5 stars with LOTR at a 5.<br />Will watch again!
0525953728|5.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" was an informative and very interesting book. To hear someone actually give the exact account of this tremendous effort made by our Navy Seals to kill Osama Bin Laden had your full interest and made you feel you were with them.  I saw no way it revealed anything \\"secret\\", you became so involved with the way the story was written.  The way different things were explained really made me appreciate what the seals have to go through to even make it to the level of performance to be a Seal.  I am surprised as a woman, that it held my attention. I ordered it from Amazon.com and received it as soon as it was released.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|I'm not even a baseball fan (well, I watch the dodgers from time to time.)  Directing was superb.  Photography was superb.  Script was amazing.  The acting was so well done that I felt I really new the characters being played (thank you!)  This was one of those rare movies that I didn't want to end when it did.  Very enjoyable.  Brad Pitt continues to show his brilliant range in acting.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|I could not even finish watching this sorry excuse for a movie that is supposed to be about Theseus. Theseus is my 3rd favorite greek hero and they ruined his entire image with this pitiful movie. The movie makes no sense. They say the are going to go somewhere and then BOOM! they r there. There is NO journey and the jump from scene to scene with no explanation. The Gods are horribly portrayed and the acting is weak. A slap in the face to mythology. Lastly, they give no background on anybody so you have absolutely NOOO emotional attachment to a single character.<br /><br />This movie is complete and total garbage.
B00846TTDG|4.0|This film wreaks of military propaganda...and if I didn't know better, the Military Industrial Complex funded the entire thing.  However, it was really fun to watch.  The acting is not great but it totally works as it should.  I think a major star would have ruined the movie.  The story and editing worked so very well and the movie never slowed down.  This is good because it was very well done from beginning to end (director gets credit), and very well choreographed ACTION!  The usual character development I want in movies need not apply for this film.  It was just fun...and I normally almost NEVER like movies that are just action or visual effect based.  This one worked.
B005PK553C|5.0|I loved the story! It kept my attention throughout the series. I can't wait until next season! I hear it will be a totally different plot, which is very unusual for a series.
0525953728|5.0|Glad I was able to squeeze this in in between my uni class work.  The informal writing style of the author produced an easy read, I finished it in 2 days.  Also, first hand accounts of the lives of those in special ops are always fascinating.  Touche to \\"Owen\\" for being straightforward, humble and honest about himself, his work, his love of country, and the events that took place on that no easy day.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love Spider when I need a break from work or brainbuster tasks. It's addictive pasttime that can be played anywhere.
B000002UHG|4.0|This recording displays the important part that Rick Wright played in the Pink Floyd sound and their combined genius.  Rick Wright's vocals are average but his keyboard arrangements and performances are at times stunning.  An introspective album, perhaps a little too personal at times, but this is a good one.  Recommended.

So if you are a fan of his music and style, this is a must.  You may not like every track, but it is all typically creative and at times awesome.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a political thriller. It is timely, and the storyline never lags. The casting is perfect and many kudos to the writers.

0525953728|5.0|Excellent Read. Covered from prospective of people at the tip of the spear. Don't understand all the up roar from administration.
B0070XFNDE|3.0|Up front, I loved 'Shadow of the Wind' and 'Angel's Game', they both fall at the top of my list of great mystery novels.  So, I was very excited to get into this 3rd book of this series.  However, this book was much shorter than the others, and it was lacking in many facets that made those great.  This book brings back the main characters from the first two books and puts them back into another mystery situation, but this time, there is no closure to the story and ends in a huge cliffhanger.  To be honest, there are not many things that are resolved in this book, and Zafron himself begins to tear down the \\"happy endings\\" for the main characters in both previous books:  Daniel's marriage to Bea is not ideal and David Martin's storyline turns into a 'Count of Monte Cristo' clone.  I hate to say this, but I was pretty let down by this novel, because it just lacks the originality and depth of the first two.  Its almost as if Zafron intended this series to be a trilogy, but found the 3rd book getting too long, so he just cut it in half, with really not a whole lot in the first half.  Disappointing, but the cliffhanger ending certainly makes me anxious to read the next novel, which hopefully will be better.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I thought this was going to be your standard Free Willy type of movie. While it's along those lines I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Funny, sad, and heartwarming all at the same time. A must see for anyone looking for a good movie.

B008B3MZMY|5.0|As a longtime Supertramp fan, I have been looking forward to viewing this concert for many years.  It truly is remarkable how technology can enhance audio and video that is over 30 years old.  While there are some areas that are not up to modern standards, I felt the quality was really good!  As much as I enjoyed viewing the concert and imagining what it must have been like to see Supertramp live in their \\"Golden Years,\\" I cannot help but think that what fans have available today is pretty special too.<br /><br />Supertramp did not tour in the US in 2010, but I had an opportunity to see Roger Hodgson's show in San Diego last week and I can tell you without hesitation that his voice sounds even better today than on my Supertramp vinyls or on the DVD.  I closed my eyes and it was 1979 all over again, but so much greater.  While it's wonderful to see the footage of the 1979 Paris concert, what is even better is to see the original singer/songwriter live in concert today.  And yes he sang all the hits he wrote - my favorites being Give a little Bit, Logical Song, Dreamer, Breakfast in America and he and his really good band even did Fool's Overture and I got goose bumps.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Now that there is less drama, I feel the book is missing something. You for sure need to read it. But it's pretty mellow.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the most impressive Bible App I've seen yet.  With it's plethora of available versions, i can cross-check a passage or verse in its context in as many versions as i want for their syntactical input.  This is helpful in finding just the right way to phrase, or make a point, in a sermon.  I also appreciate the translation notes.  I do wish they included the actual Greek or Hebrew in the notes.  With all of it's many features and portability, i have no more excuses for putting off studying or doing my daily devotional!  I highly recommend this app.  But PLEASE INCLUDE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IN NOTES.

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|This is a tame read compared to Lee Child's earlier Jack Reacher adventures and the story line becomes predictable, a bit like sequel movies. If he writes another book I will wait a while to see what others think after reading it before buying the next Jack Reacher Novel.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|Is it epic like the last two masterpieces?  No, however, there was no way they could keep trying to accomplish albums like American Idiot and 21st Century breakdown, and they weren't trying to match them either.  Those albums were complex rock operas, whereas this is just an album packed full of fun and energy.  There's no story here just a bunch of good songs and it sounds like they just really enjoyed making music.  As a stand alone album it would feel incomplete, but as part of a coming trilogy it's a very good intro.  As a fan since the beginning of Green Day, to me they have lost absolutely nothing over the last 20 years.
B0006213WG|4.0|I really liked a couple of Sum 41 song so I started buying their records, this one is very well done. One song was a bit too spastic for my taste, but I enjoyed the rest of them.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm not often one that enjoys books told from different points of view, but that set up in this book made all the difference. The author was able to really build the charscters and allow the reader to develop understanding of their actions.<br /><br />This book touches the theme of bullying- kids and adults picking on a child and attacking him with words and violence. The book also, though, has a theme of acceptance, of family sacrifices and love, of childhood thoughts and fears, of Star Wars references.<br /><br />This book will make you laugh and probably make you cry. I recommend this for the young and old. Inside are lessons every person should learn and remember.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Good fairly easy fun game.  Who doesn't like busting things up?<br />Also kid friendly as far as I have been.  Worth the down load.
B004J4WKDI|3.0|I am not a fan of fantasy but on the whole, I enjoyed this book. It is so imaginative, you find yourself<br />constantly amazed at the imagery.  Having said that, I also found it a tad long, a bit too drawn out.<br /> For this reason, I would actually give it  2 1/2 stars.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm shocked this was a New York times best seller. There is no depth to the story and the writing is very dry. The book is also an absolute example of a mentally and physically abusive relationship.

B005GFPZYK|1.0|I wanted to like this book because I was in the military and worked with the Seals (loved them and appreciate how hard they work)...However the way it is written, with short non descriptive chapters that provided just a vague description of what he was going through was too much to read or to recommend to others. I skipped chapters and did not miss anything. It was like listening in on a conversation where the the other two parties know the story and you are just kind of getting what is being told. Additionally I don't mind a soldier having to kill to save his fellow soldiers but to show no remorse for having to do it makes it impossible to connect with him. The best I can say is that the dialog with his wife does provide some insight into how hard being married and in the military can be. That part I connected with but it is not worth the cost of the book.

B008I3QZKU|4.0|I haven't purchased an album by The Killers since their first album, Hot Fuss, until now. Yes, there is a some cheesiness to the lyrics but there's great emotion behind them and driving music. I can hear hints of U2 and even James in this album, but I probably get Freddie Mercury (of Queen) coming through the most. A newer band called Broken Records is doing similarly dramatically-melodic songs so if you like The Killers, check them out, or vice-verse -- if you like Broken Records' sound, then this album has similarities. The melodies are soaring, and Brandon Flowers' voice has not deteriorated over time unlike some lead singers who've made several albums and gone on several tours (and all of the drinking and/or smoking that can accompany that).<br /><br />There aren't any clunkers on the album but there are definitely a set of songs that are stronger than others. \\"Runaways\\" is the lead single and has placed on some charts but it's not the strongest song. Those honors go to \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" and \\"Here With Me\\", although both have some of those cringe-worthy lyrics. I give Flowers credit for the power and emotion he puts behind his delivery, and it more than makes up for lyrics such as \\"don't want your picture on my cell phone\\" from \\"Here With Me\\" or \\"don't break character...\\" from \\"Be Still\\".<br /><br />The album finished strong with \\"Be Still\\" and \\"Battle Born\\", but there are many delicious hooks along the way. I don't know if is a previous trademark of The Killers, but there are a few nice patterns I noted with the music on this album. First off, many of the songs have overlapping vocals, either to provide contrast to the main melody being sung or to strengthen it vocally. Second, the albums often have a bridge-like outro. That is, there is frequently a strong, soaring finish to the songs that is beyond just the standard of ending with a repeated chorus. All in all, this is one of the better albums of 2012.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|I installed an MSI Z77-G41 motherboard with i5-3570K CPU, Kingston Hyper-X 120GB SSD and 16GB Hyper-X RAM in this case. I added one additional 120mm fan in the front as an intake behind the filter screen. Front panel is simple to remove though the doc's aren't real clear sometimes. Simple, Solid, well ventilated. Overclocked the CPU to 4.0 GHz with stock CPU cooler, CPU temp stays near 14 degrees F above room temp. Top rear and top fans set to low setting (on rear of case). Amazing.<br />Quiet. Bottom mounted power supply easy and cable management effective. Buy it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun way to kill time. don't play too late or you'll never get to bed. just one of those point and clicks
B008220DIC|3.0|\\"The Master\\" is beautifully shot and well acted, but it lacks a satisfying climax. The film follows Freddie Quell, a recently discharged WWII vet, as he adapts to civilian life. His unstable personality and stupidity ill-suit him for steady employment, and before long he's on the run for poisoning a co-worker. Now a drifter, he comes across a yacht owned by Lancaster Dodd, a cult leader who takes Freddie in as one of his followers.<br /><br />It is puzzling the way the other characters take to Freddie. He is dim, incoherent and prone to unpredictable fits of rage. And yet, attractive women find him irresistible. He has a brief romance with a gorgeous redhead, makes out with a hot department store employee in a darkroom and gets a busty British chick in the sack merely by gesturing to her. One has to wonder though if Freddie is hallucinating these scenes. Before he is discharged from the military, he is questioned by a superior officer about some psychological issues he had during his service, including a vision of his mother. And there is a later scene where Dodd is singing and dancing in a room full of people, when suddenly all of the women in the room are nude. You never see the women undress; they are just suddenly naked. It is obvious that Freddie suffers from some kind of mental illness, maybe schizophrenia. So I have to wonder if the scenes with him making out with beautiful women weren't also hallucinations. After all, what woman wouldn't consider this guy to be a deranged freak?<br /><br />The nature of Dodd's relationship with Freddie is not clear. They are too unlike to be friends; it is not a student-teacher relationship; it's not exploitative either. Nor is Dodd's cult a surrogate family for Freddie, since no one is really attached to him except for Dodd. At times Dodd seems to use Freddie as a laboratory rat for his therapy techniques, but it is obvious by the end of the film that they have no effect on him. Is this what the film is saying? That Dodd'stherapy doesn't work on genuinely disturbed people, and therefore Scientology (on which Dodd's cult is loosely based) is a fraud? In the end Freddie's experiences seem to add up to nothing; his is an aimless tale, and in that sense it is like Paul Thomas Anderson's other movies. \\"The Master\\" is a finely acted, finely written and beautifully filmed picture, but with no larger message overhanging the plot. Perhaps if Freddie's relationship with Dodd had taught us something, it would have been a great film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put  this book down! so much detail and such a great plot. i recommend this to anyone! cant wait to read the next one
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It takes too long to get points. Should be able to accumulate points faster at least over night or a lapse in usage. It is addicting like cafe world. You want to keep checking to see if you have more coins and play more to get more coins.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I just don't like that the guys cost too much except the duck and it gets harder so you onkly have to guys but if it wasn't for that I'd love it and rate it 5 stars.
B007SGM084|1.0|I had to rate this one star in order to write a review, otherwise it would be minus fifty. I cannot believe this is what they call literature. You might as well go buy playboy, ay least it has pictures. There is no plot, no story line, unimaginitve and predictable characters. I have never been so disappointed In a book in my 45 years!!!! I wasted my money. Don't waste yours, unless you like reading about someone else's twisted, sickening sexlife in gruesome and gory detail. That's all it is. Period. I read a great deal, about a great many subjects, I am not stuffy, nor am I closed minded, this subject is brought up in a great many other writings, but there is much more to the stories. Even in the Dexter series there is more than his mutilations. This is horrible. Not just because of the subject matter, it's just plain bad writing. This authors first attempt should be her last. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome. So much fun, I'm obsessed. I found Pinterest about two weeks ago and everyday since I have found some fun craft or delicious recipe.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app that features a vast variety of music and sounds to help you unwind. I lime the combinations that you can create. The free version is great.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|How much thrill and emotion can you get from a guy stranded for nearly two years on Mars? Well, it turns out you can get LOTS. This novel got me glued to my reader for days in a row. I enjoyed the story, the technical details, and the lame jokes. The lame jokes were great! A great science fiction novel, written with knowledge and talent. I totally recommend it.
1439127700|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the detail of this volume.  So much time must have been spent by the authors putting this together.  It was a very enjoyable read and I would highly recommend this book to others....
B007THA4FI|4.0|Well, I'll start with the obvious, in case anyone has yet to hear: this is definitely NOT Harry Potter for grown ups. It is proper English Literature. Oh, there are ghosts, though. The_Ghost_of_Barry_Fairbrother is all too flesh and blood, however. It is the study of a small town and what happens to that town when it loses its touchstone, in the form of the death of Barry Fairbrother. It is both a laugh track and a gut punch. Not something I probably would have picked up without JK Rowling's name attached, but I'm glad that I did.
B007TMON8M|4.0|Pretty fun game. Fun to see things crash when your design fails. Wish it was longer. Reminded me of things I did in engineering classes in college.

0446310786|5.0|I was assigned this book in a Political Science class (yes political science) and assigned to write a paper on the social change that occurs from the verdict.  While I was supposed to read it in high school, I maybe read the first chapter and used Sparknotes the rest of the way.  However, I am truly thankful that my professor assigned this book again because I absolutely loved it.  The story, symbolism, and literary devices are all there and it is truly captivating.  I can't say that I've ever been so hooked to a book considering I read it faster than most books.  I think the older you get, the better the book gets and despite it taking place around the depression era, the story is still a good one and a significant reminder of our past.  I will say, I think it does no justice to the book to have high school students read it because like Atticus might say, they are too young to understand.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun!  Develops hand-eye coordination.  Passes the time on the phone, during commercials, listening to TV news.  Takes the place of smoking.
0545128285|5.0|This book has some of the strangest tales you might ever encounter.. If you liked the Harry Potter books, you must get this one to have a better understanding and a fuller view of the fantastic universe that J.K. Rowling created.. I highly recommend this book.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I was originally concerned with this headset because I have a relatively large head.  I am always having issues finding hats that fit me, and rarely do I find a headset that fits.  These ones fit me really comfortably, and can even go above my head size.  They fit over my glasses, and seem light enough so that they really don't hurt after being on my head for any extended amount of time.<br /><br />My problem with this headset, is that they really don't seem very loud.  I have my PC volume on full, my games are on full volume, and my headset volume is on full volume, and with everything on max, they are at a comfortable volume.  Some games though, are so quiet, that ambient noise around me bleed in, and drown out what I am listening to.  One game, the bass of the sounds, is extremely distorted.<br /><br />I am also spending way WAY too much time trying to tweak the settings to get them so that I can use them, and when I get lucky and get the settings right, the low volume level just nixes any excitement I originally had for them.<br /><br />I had a problem with the software it came with it, and had to uninstall it and download the updated program from Logitech itself.<br /><br />Also, the directions never did say the transmitter had to be plugged into the charger base itself, through trial and error, I figured it out myself.<br /><br />I will probably return these.  I am very unhappy with them, shame too, I read it was getting good reviews.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Its a great looking watch. And for a great price. It arrived in time as it was promised. Yellow details makes it pop.
B00845PRDS|5.0|This movie is unique because the people are real SEALs, so don't expect seasoned actors. The story is ok, but it is a little predictable. The attention given to Engel leads you to say \\"Ok something's up with this guy, he's probably going die\\", which is what happens. But that's ok, because these guys are the real deal and there's no liberal actor BS trying to make some false political statement like Matt \\"What's his name\\". The SEALs really use sound suppressors and a variety of weapons, all of which is not secret but it looks like maybe they weren't aware that this is the case, so they all use noise making M4's. None of this really matters because the action is non-stop. This movie is wonderful change from the Cry-Baby-USA-Are-Real-Bad-Guys crap that seems always to be the case nowadays.
B004M8S3Y6|2.0|I did not manage to find much knowledge that was not written in the magazines yet, really regretted buying it and spending time on going through it.
1475143389|5.0|This book has pushed me out of a rut I didn't even know I was in. The concepts are straight-forward and something I feel I can continue to do for years to come. Each concept is broken down in a way that is easy to understand, and backed up by research where appropriate(which is critical to me). I've read (and dismissed) several other books out there that state just how \\"easy\\" it is to get ripped, with just 15 minutes a day, and this isn't one of them.<br />While it's not said directly, the message I get from BLS is something that clicks within me, in that you will need to earn the body you want. You will need to crack down, eat healthy, work out hard and heavy, and THEN you will get what you always wanted. But somehow that message is delivered in a way that completely motivates me.<br />This book is the whole package: how to eat, how to lift, and all the little tidbits of knowledge you need to tweak what you didn't even know you were doing wrong. And the best part is, if you don't understand something or have a question, just send a message to the author Mike Matthews through Facebook. I did and he literally responded to me within a day and cleared up a question I had with an answer just as well written as this book. I can only hope this review won't cause him to get flooded with too many questions, but that kind of dedication is hard to find.<br />If I had to give a negative about this book it would be that the definitions section, given in the beginning, is too long (but only because I already knew most of the terminology).<br />Now all that said, while the motivation derived from this book is great, it's the results that matter. One week in isn't much to go off, but I'm going to keep at it and see where this gets me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible has multiple translations, highlighting, notetaking, everything you can do tangible you can do on this electronic Bible. You can even save lessons and share them publicly or keep them private. Overall amazing. More than what I would expect from a free app!

B004W2UBYW|4.0|I have read quite a bit about Steve Jobs in the last 15 years. Even know Jerry Mannock personally. Walter Isaacson's work certainly adds to the big picture and seems to be entertaining as well.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with a healthy curiosity about Mr. Jobs.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its cool because it allows you to look at your old calculations so get it now its amazing and awesome of corse
1592537251|5.0|The Art of Urban Sketching is a great collection of sketchbook pages from artists around the world. Comments by the artists encourage the reader in his or her pursuit of artistic expression in everyday life. Photos and info on the individual artists and their favorite tools and papers are very helpful. The book is filled with tips on how to enjoy sketching from life wherever you are. You can browse, or read cover to cover, or dip into over and over for fresh ideas. Worth many times more than the Amazon price!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This is a classic, to which all other pretenders are compared. It's all there: pirates, hidden treasure, good guys, bad guys, guys you're just not sure about. Great book for middle schoolers with strong reading skills through adults. The Kindle edition is sure handy!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|l love playing this game. it is a nice way to relax. only wish coins came quicker. i would recommend this to anyone
B008SOS63S|5.0|This CD is irrefutable proof of Joe's reputation as King of the blues guitar. The 2 songs with Beth Hart makes one wonder if this pair could go pop.  They are certainly better than most of the tripe out there now.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This is a classic!  My grandchildren love this, and we have read it over and over. The Kindle set up is great.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|I really wanted this little baby to function as it should, however I cannot report that to be the case.  I find that I can not charge while at the same time I use a docked device.  It disconnects the device when the USB is connected.  I think it should do both things at once.  I fail this device twice because the advertising failed to specify this limitation.  I have asked Amazon for a refund.  Thank goodness for their refund policy.
1451696205|5.0|This was one of the best books I ever read. There are a lot of emotions I got while reading this book, and I loved the main character. I can't wait to watch the movie that will be out soon that's based on this book! :)
B000W93CHC|5.0|World without End is a book set in the 1300's that is historically accurate, immensely interesting, and a book you won't be able to put down. It's a story of political power, religious power, individual power, and an intense romance. I loved it!
0439023513|3.0|I enjoyed \\"Mockingjay\\", but it wasn't as good as the first two books.  However, I'd like to read more of Suzanne Collins' books.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|You no doubt have read the other reviews; in the end, one needs to form their own opinion.  I found the tale striking in it's contrast to the fairy tale in that it has a 21Century bent, more up to date with current events:  the quest for \\"power\\" and control.  It is interesting that deep within the human condition there is the longing for the \\"enchanted land\\" of impossible things of enduring beauty and magic; it is the ember called \\"Hope\\", which strikes a chord for many.<br /><br />There is one scene where Chris (Huntsman) looks upon Snow White in her death sleep and for an instant there is the magic of the story in his eyes, a memory that is the window of his soul.  For me, \\"message received and understood\\".  It is not the kiss that awakens the princess, it is the tear.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have owned a few pairs of these over the years.  They are perfect for running or anything active.  Love that they stay in, but do not rub, pinch, or hurt in any way.  Despite the low price, they usually last quite awhile and I am not nice to them.  They get balled up, shoved in bags, and attacked my 1 and 3 yr old boys.  I am afraid they will at some point get discontinued so I am now buying multiples....just in case.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This really is good!<br />Casting:  EXCELLENT<br />Acting: Near perfect<br />Directing:  Excellent<br />Special Effects: Excellent<br /><br />The stories of the individual \\"super heroes\\" was but background for this movie.  When brought together, they are \\"enchanting\\".<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I hope such a team can be assembled when the odds are not in favor of the Human Race.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Even better than the first, can‘t wait for the third. Katniss is a girl full of emotions and right or wrong is true to herself.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All three of the books were awesome.  I agree with another post that there are some spelling errors and things they shoud have caught.  However, the love story is fabulous.  Also in book two, I didn't like how we were reading in Ana's point of view, then at the end we suddenly turn to an omnicient POV.  I didn't have any clue who was talking until I read it twice and then put two and two together.  You have to guess who was speaking.  Overall, still great and I would love to read more!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  I just watched it and I have to say, WOW.... very powerful and the performances were just spectacular!!
0345444051|4.0|The last time I read this book was when it was assigned to my English class in eighth grade, and it was a pleasure to come back to as an adult and re-experience the same emotions I did back then. This is science fiction about the wonder and awe of discovery, the bittersweetness of letting go of the primitive past, and the ultimate destiny of the human race. It's not a dystopian or cautionary tale, as so much science fiction, but a book about what it means for our species to reach adulthood -- and a sacrifice that that may one day demand of us.<br /><br />The story begins, in classic form, with the visitation of beings from the stars. The Overlords arrive on Cold War-era Earth in immense, silver starships, and immediately establish themselves as vastly superior, but benevolent masters. Yet, they refuse to reveal themselves in person (at least not right away) or explain their ultimate purposes. Here, one might guess, as some characters do, at sinister intentions.<br /><br />But, nothing so crude comes to pass, and Clarke proceeds to a new generation of characters, as the Overlords usher in a new era of peace and worldwide prosperity for the human race. Not to mention a certain amount of ennui and loss of purpose, as mankind finds that most of its traditional problems are solved. Yet, a few people continue to puzzle over the mysteries about the Overlords and chafe against the restrictions they still impose. What are the reasons? Several intrepid explorers begin to find out.<br /><br />The writing is simple and unadorned, and the characters not particularly complex in their construction (not to mention a bit 1950s), but there's a subtle eloquence to the way the story unfolds, each stage in the human race's progress revealing a little more about the fate that must eventually come. And Clarke's writing is still a pleasure to read for its vision, its thoughtful ideas about the forms that different alien races might take, the capabilities of advanced technology, and how human society might continue to function when the primary need is that of avoiding boredom. Though a few assumptions are showing their age (newspapers, radio), much of this 1953 story still speaks to the 21st century. Clarke continues to remind us of how little we know about what's out there in the universe, or how limited our evolution has been compared to what's possible.<br /><br />Read it, if you haven't yet. Or read it again. Childhood's End is one of the works that sets the template for great science fiction, and will likely still contain meaning for new readers in fifty years.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible, you can pick which version you want to read, which chapter,  which verse.  You can opt to read it yourself or use audible, which I find is not only helpful (when your not feeling well)  but also needfull.  I recommend this Bible to anyone who wants to read The Word.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this app!Tothose of u who get tired of waiting for coins to regenerate, leave your Kindle on, takes about a half-hour to get the Max amount.Or play for awhile, then come back to it when u know you've got all the coins u can get.I rate this five stars!
B007NG93CK|2.0|This was a disappointing read without the usual depth of 'adventure'...interesting about the mining element but slow and at times and lacking real excitement
0316228532|1.0|I was excited to read an \\"adult\\" J.K. Rowling book and for the first time pre-ordered a Kindle book. I checked my Kindle the first thing in the morning on release day to get started. By the way, yes, I've read 6 of the 7 Harry Potter books (didn't read the 1st one.) I slogged through the 1st 1/3 of the book and then skipped to the last few chapters just to see how it all turned out. It wasn't that interesting or well-written and I hated all the foul language, the depressing characters and the topics in the book. I feel like I've been duped by J.K. Rowling and my respect for her as a writer has plummeted. If I ever read another of her books, it will only be after I've checked the reviews and the book has been out for awhile.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|Lot's of great reviews on this, so I'll be brief....this sounds like RUSH! More so than any release I've heard from them in a long, long time. Great to hear them sounding so familure!! If your a Rush fan from way back, you'll dig this!
B004UID2LC|4.0|it was great but then it just stop working after a while. I pressed on the video but it never works. help? :/
B008XG1X18|4.0|love! could spend hours on it! just wish it would show kore of my friends pins. not just a few friends bit a good mix of all of them.
076780421X|5.0|I loved this movie when it was released.  I have watched it on TV many times since then.  I even owned it in VHS.  I am so glad I now have it on DVD and will watch it many more times.  Mathew Perry and Salma Hayeck have such chemistry.
0525953728|5.0|I wanted to purchase and read this book before Washington tried to have it disappear.  The book is well written and while protecting our military and Navy Seals, it does present insight for the public.<br /><br />I would definitely suggest reading this book!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like this app but. abit anoying how it atomaticly goes to the app when plunged in but over all it is a goo app
B0015AARJI|4.0|Everything works. No problems with the product. The packaging was good, and I received it on time. My son is already enjoying it
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I imagine that it must have been difficult for the director and producers of the movie to either go faithfully word by word to the original comic or tweak it a bit and still keep it close. I must say that it is an excellent adaptation.  The voice acting and mood and animation were done perfectly. I understand many people were disappointed that it is a 2 part movie. But I understand it. I prefer it like this rather than a abridged version. Besides, it will eventually come in a single pack. Thanks DC
B0074AGVWK|5.0|Maeve Binchy is one of my all time favourite authors, i own or have read all of her books and always look forward to her next one...enjoyed this book. Maeve Binchy stories are always engaging and involve the reader right from the start. At one point i didn't know whether to be cross at the lazy inconsiderate adult children still living at home or then at the mother who seemingly became this uncaring cold person in trying to make her children realise how selfish and inconsiderate they were...I can relate to this situation myself and i applaud the mother in the end for taking a stance.  It all works out in the end to everyone's benefit as good things start to happen for all concerned....Worth the read!
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Visully stunning, graphicly violent, graphicly gory, graphicly sexy, this series can never be accused of holding back and will offend many, many people and I pitty the offended as this is a very entertaining and captivating series and a reward to those who are not faint of heart who give it a go.<br />initially this season is a little awkward at the beginning following the real life passing of season ones sparticus Andy whitfeild. As sparticus Andy was charasmatic and bought great heart and humanity to a world of violance. Replacing Andy is Liam McIntyre, Liam had huge shoes to fill and he fills them admirably and makes sparticus his own without straying to far from Andys Sparticus, surely not an easy feet.<br />In this series Sparicus leads the slave rebelion in a war against the Roman's, i don't really want to discuss to many of the plot lines, watch it for yourself, you will be entertained.<br />RIP Andy
B004UID2LC|3.0|Cost nothing and works for a minute on the fire. Will crash if you skip through to the end. Eventually quits all together. Reinstall and it works a bit longer. That even stopped working after a bit. Now it only says open not install. Then its not in my app folder either. Some buggy stuff.
076115728X|5.0|Excellent book. I use it with my teaching when discussing how we can learn from our mistakes. The students really enjoyed reading it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I can't say enough about this app. I suffer from insomnia...a lifetime of insomnia. I've taken melatonin, ambien, lunesta, klonopin, trazadone and more. Nothing ever helps. This app works like magic. I believe the reason it works is because I can customize it to sounds that I find relaxing. My 11yr old son has high functioning autism and is very sound sensitive. He has always had difficulty going to sleep. He has his own combination of sounds.<br />I haven't tried it on the other settings. I tried the \\"deep sleep\\" setting and woke up with the same nasty overly sedated feeling that the aforementioned medications gave me. I'm not saying this well happen for everybody. I have narcolepsy and basically never get deep sleep, so maybe that's why it had that effect?<br />Anyway, for going to sleep, I can tell you, it is perfect app.
B00316DDUE|5.0|I believe the title 'The Concert Event' sums up what this EVENT did serve up. Sure it arnt Elton John at Wembley, such comparisons not relevant. It was simply a great presentation and the mixture and balance of music delivered a show that was pretty damn enjoyable. Some of these musicians Yanni shares the stage with are outstanding .. Charlie Adams on drums, Samvel Yervinyan from Armenia on violin, Ming Freeman from Taipei on keyboards to Victor Espinola from Paraguay on harp (this guy plays the harp like I have never seen it played before] .. Brilliant all of them! This is a great EVENT and even if Yanni's musical gene is not your normal groove, give it a spin on YouTube [excuse all the puns .. got carried away] and maybe you will buy like me. To all the band members who performed in this event, including David Hudson (a fellow Aussie and bloody good Didgeridoo player by the way) take a bow! Sygharitiria ke poli agapi (Greek).

B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Another free app that really isn't free - if you want to continue playing, aka buying more found, it's going to cost you,  the cheapest amount to play - 99 cents a hit.  and when you run out of those coins, it will be another 99 cents ad infinitum.  And just like the old Carnival Scam, there's no way that you're going to win this one!<br /><br />I really wish that Amazon would put an end to these money-grubbing apps, especially those without a way to &quot;opt out&quot;.  Why?  Well, I've heard too many stories of small children playing with their parent's tablets/smart phones, they get into an app like this one, and unbeknown to Papa, ring up a mountain of spurious charges to one of these money-grubber apps.<br /><br />when I saw what was up with this particular app, I realized a few things 1) many fake positive reviews - that's how they sucker people in, 2) When I ran out of coins, which was rather quick, the app immediately asked if I wanted more, when I said yes, it sent me to the app store to purchase them with real money, 3) I had to warn potential users of this app and complain to Amazon, and finally 4) I immediately sent this money grubbing app to my tablet's Trash Basket, deleting this garbage forever.  You should do the same if you d/l this piece of PT Barnumware.  Remember what PT Barnum said? &quot;There's a Sucker born every minute.&quot;
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|i had my concerns regarding what this movie was going to look in a 16:9 tv. i have a 360 so i played it there and i dont know if that helped but the movie looks fullscreen entirely and with very good definition. The sound is excellent and i know these because i have 360 with an optical output so ergo, it sounds awesome.....a must buy for anyone who is a batman lover....
0062082353|5.0|A very good read.  A book you will not want to lay down, about a true American Hero Warrior!!  The real deal story is told here.
030758836X|1.0|I bought this as an audiobook.  It reads and sounds like it was written by a bunch of adolescents who got together, had a few beers, and wrote it together for a joke.  Maybe part of the fault lies in the narrators, who I couldn't bring myself to like, but they can't be blamed too much because what they had to work with was pretty sophomoric stuff.  I bought the audiobook on the basis of its great reviews and a plot description that seemed as though it might be interesting.  I kept hoping, waiting for the story and the characters to start becoming interesting .. plausible ... significant ... dare I say even worth listening to.  I kept waiting, hoping an editor would crash the beer party, take a look at this story and say, \\"Hold everything.  This won't do!\\"
B005LAJ212|5.0|OMG I am addicted, can't wait for season 2 to come out hate that I have to wait so long for it to come out.... Need I say anymore!!

B007SGM084|5.0|The books were very wonderful!  I really enjoyed the passion that Christian had for Ana.  You could feel it as you were reading it.  I would definately recommend this book!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy this app! It serves it's purpose for when I need a Pinterest fix and there is no computer available to me. it's just as addicting on the app!
0345803485|2.0|Rec'd book as a gift, and noticed right away that the writing / editing were horrible! Alas, I kept reading, because maybe it was supposed to be bad (i.e. from the perspective of a naive protaganist). Jump ahead to the end of the book, and???  Nope, it's still bad.<br /><br />With that being said, I could forgive poor writing, bad editing, sub-par character development, etc. if the smutty scenes were as good as I had heard.  I suppose if you had limited knowlege of carnal things, then it would be a pretty tawdry read. However as a fairly urbane woman, I think the juicy parts were pretty 'Meh'.<br /><br />This book should have been titled \\"Fifty Shades of Crap\\". Seriously, how did the author get such a rabid following, enough so to sell the movie rights for several million?! If this is what passes for literature, then Ladies & Gentlemen, you've got a front row seat to the demise of civilization!
0525953728|5.0|A gutsy,  well-written account of not only the killing of Bin Ladin and the events leading up to that day.  The author, a decorated American hero, tells the story of what it took he and his buddies to become Seal Team members.  They not only gave up blood, sweat, and tears on the battleground, but also voluntarily did the same during their training.<br /><br />A facinating real-life story of what it takes in an individual to get this type of job done.
B008XG1X18|4.0|At first I was lost on pinterest, but know I love it! I use it on my fire, iphone, and computer!  I love the things that you can find. My only thing is that the one on fire will crash or hangup sometimes.

B0042H6VYG|5.0|I truly loved the album and recommend it for any interested. The album is great. There are may great songs.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent!!  This book gives a first layer opening into the lives of the people that put their lives on the line for America.  We never realize how much in given up for us to be proud of our country.  I loved this book as it gave me some way to understand what it means when we accomplish some event.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game can be played by all. My 4 yr old loves it along with my 11 yr old and myself! Much better than spending money at a carnival. :-)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun addictive game that is just like the carnival dozer game. you get free coins which keeps you playing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is wonderful. I love being able to look at a pic instead of using bookmarks and having to search through hundreds of links.
B004LWZW9C|3.0|This is one of those movies you watch when you want to see something mildly entertaining but not too deep. I thought I would enjoy this much more because of the fantastic ensemble cast but the whole thing was sort of blah. The problem with having so many characters is there isn't adequate time to develop their storylines and allow the audience to get to know who they really are. It was like a whole bunch of little snippets without any background. Why was Michelle Pfeiffer's character so depressed? What caused the rift between Hillary Swank's and Robert DeNeiro's characters? How was it possible that Katherine Heigel was the former girlfriend of a famous rockstar but nobody knew? Can Sofia Vergara possibly play a role where she isn't an oversexed vamp? Can Lea Michelle be the most annoying actress on the planet? I also thought the Sarah Jessica Parker and Josh Duhamel romance was implausible, she looks old enough to be his mother.<br /><br />I'm glad I rented this instead of spending the money to see it in the theaters.
B0087HT36U|5.0|What a great game. I usually don't do reviews, but I thought this deserved one since I enjoyed it so much. comparing the game to angry birds is silly. The perspective is completely different as are the mechanics. And even if it were the alike, so what? That's akin to saying no one should have made another first person shooter just because duke nukem or doom or whatever did it first. Silly.<br /><br />Very much worth 99&cent; Oh and bring on the cowboys miniclip! :)
B0042816YK|3.0|The view is beautiful, and it's not just Julia Roberts we're looking at; EPL is likely the best looking movie you'll see all year. Of course it helps to have Italy and Indonesia as exotic backdrops, but the art of cinematography should never be underestimated and it's really first class here; I'd go to Bali in a heartbeat, it looked that good.<br /><br />If Julia Roberts went on a spiritual odyssey it might look a lot like EPL. OK, so we all know she's married with twins and gives every indication that she's happy with her lot, but it's actually not as far fetched a notion as it might seem. Apparently she found something to her liking in India whilst filming and embraced Hinduism on her return to New Mexico. Nice though that is, it's really the main problem with the movie.<br /><br />The first time I heard someone call her Liz, as in Liz Gilbert, the real life protagonist on whose book the screenplay and movie are based, it was really grating. Towards the end it became less noticeable as she disappeared more into the role, but not much. I can't decide if she was miscast, or whether she was simply a necessity given the star wattage needed to make such an internally referenced movie.<br /><br />Whilst the book is a chatty affair, a funny, self regalatory dialogue between reader and writer, a bit like listening in on an extended conversation between girlfriends, the movie usually side steps any effort to visually translate this and resorts to extensive use of voice-over. Perhaps a lesser star would have been more capable of disappearing into the role and carrying the weight of the emotional and spiritual journey. I'm not sure why but Naomi Watts keeps coming into my head as I think about it; from an acting point of view someone like her might been a better choice for the role because she has such a talent for raw emotion and for portraying neurotic and needy.<br /><br />Having read the book a couple of times and got a lot from it, I had high hopes for the movie, but after reading a spate of poor reviews I realized I would have to downgrade my expectations. What really surprised me was how negative some of the reviews were; some reviewers really hated the movie and these were reviewers whose opinions I normally seek out and respect. They viewed Liz Gilbert as selfish and self indulgent in the extreme and whilst they may have a point, I think the problem was that they hadn't read the book. Lacking the time to really delve into the reasons for her journey, the movie portrays her as very self seeking in her treatment of the men she left behind. For this reason I almost felt it would have been better to simply launch her straight into the Italian section of her journey and fill in the missing motivation and back story as necessary.<br /><br />Apparently the director and co-writer Ryan Murphy consulted with Elizabeth Gilbert on the screenplay and as a result was able to include material not in the book, even as he had to leave much out. This led to incidents like one just before the movie ends where Julia (sorry, Liz) breaks off her relationship with her Brazilian amour Felipe because she fears it will undermine everything she has sought during her year of exploration, namely balance. Whether this actually happened seemed beside the point; it seemed true to the spirit of her journey and I wished more liberties had been taken in an attempt to get to the heart of the story. With a distinct lack of such resonant moments the movie usually seemed more interested in outer beauty than in portraying her struggle for inner peace.<br /><br />It's a well accepted truism that books and movies are apples and oranges; the movie of a book has to stand alone as a complete entity in itself and this usually means staying true to the spine of the book but substantially reinventing how that is portrayed in this most visual of mediums. It seemed to me the movie lacked the confidence to do this, probably as it didn't want to offend the book's many fans.<br/><br />Having said all that I'm sure the movie will do well, even if it never expands its audience beyond the 8 million readers who bought the book. But whilst the book led to legions of devoted Liz followers (known by some as Lizbians) and touched a nerve somewhere deep in the psyche of many middle aged women seeking reinvention, the movie leaves its audience with nothing of substance. It was probably too much to hope that it would, but it's sad nevertheless that a book that held such meaning for so many should be reduced to nothing more than a 2 hour diversion in a movie theater.
B0099G3I96|5.0|So glad to hear No Doubt again! Some of the songs made me want to dance like I was a teenager all over again. I like how they have evolved yet still sound right. Great album! Great songs! Great vocals! And most important... Great Music!
0143038419|5.0|I first came across Elizabeth Gilbert and the phenomenon that is \\"Eat Pray Love\\" a couple of years ago. I read the book and liked it, saw the interview on Oprah but didn't enjoy it as much (it's always a bit disappointing when someone isn't as you imagine them) and then moved on. But I was aware that it had become something huge in its own right, a mega best seller, a work that spoke profoundly to many people.<br /><br />A few months ago I went back to it, read it again and this time made a more leisurely assessment. Her back story is necessary but a bit whiny, Italy is enjoyable if a little superficial, but she really hits her stride in India; I learned a lot about meditation and eastern spirituality in that part, and Indonesia, well it's a great romantic tale the like of which we'd all be seduced by. My conclusion was that the book as a whole was a touchstone for the kind of writing I'm drawn to. I've bored everyone I know with repeated reference to Michael Crichton's \\"Travels\\", but I saw that \\"Eat Pray Love\\" was of similar vein; a very personal account of inner and outer travel, of great adventure, necessary growth and in her case all nicely tied up at the end with unexpected love.<br /><br />Some questions arose though as I thought about EPL, and I did some research to find the answers. I went to Elizabeth Gilbert's website and found some links to interviews that helped to fill in some of the missing pieces.<br /><br />My first question was: why was it so popular? What nerve did it hit with such unerring accuracy? One commentator summed it up well when she said; \\"She tapped into the middle-aged woman culture of self-reinvention ..... and nailed the voice.\\" That seemed very wise to me; why it would speak to so many women, but also why it would speak to me, as if there's one thing I'm all about, its self-reinvention, I mean heck I'm a Californian after all.<br /><br />My second question was; why would getting divorced and finally acknowledging that she didn't wantchildren cause such a cataclysmic meltdown? With some experience of personal trauma myself I felt like something about her story didn't quite add up.<br /><br />I found the answer in two places; in an interview, Gilbert's sister Catherine explained; \\"Liz knew she wanted to be a writer from the time she was 13, but she's so gregarious, a lot of the struggles everyone else goes through in their adolescence and early 20's -- `Who am I? What am I?' -- she managed to avoid.\\"<br /><br />In the introduction to her follow up book \\"Committed\\" Elizabeth Gilbert also makes reference to this; her general indifference to her own well being and unfamiliarity with herself meant that when the tsunami of depression hit around 30 she had no way of understanding or articulating what was happening; her body, then marriage, then mind fell apart.<br /><br />Having read those explanations I understood and felt a lot of compassion. As a result of EPL Elizabeth Gilbert has gained fame and fortune, but she has also taken criticism as being the voice of a very western kind of female mindset, fortunate to have had the kind of problems of an affluent and self involved American woman (and the publishers advance which allowed her to spend a year traveling abroad whilst recovering from them). Whether that is true is not for me to judge, but I do know from personal experience that when your life literally falls apart beneath you and you're left grasping for any point of reference on the way down it can be truly terrifying.<br /><br />I find it interesting that like myself, both Crichton and Gilbert hit big crises around 30. It does make me wonder what it is that can be so difficult about that age, or any age that ends with a zero. I guess like the first week in January there's a wake up call in the offing, an inner directive to face oneself and do the kind of challenging inner work one would never normally have the guts or desire to do.<br /><br />I've been back to both books on occasion, lookingfor something that I never found; what I realized was that it wasn't there in the first place. The books were but a mirror to my inner process, inspiring my own thought and growth. Ultimately I think that is the value of books like these; they provide entertainment on a grand scale and a chance for vicarious living of the best kind, yet they also spark something inside us, remind us we still have desires for adventure and excitement but also to live lives truer to who we really are and take the road less traveled, the road to inner peace and fulfillment.
B005SAJJHM|4.0|I don't know why I never got into watching this series real time.  It is hilarious and one of the few comedy series that I actually LOL at.  All of the characters are funny and the chemistry between the characters is wonderful.  Heartily recommend this series to anyone who needs their mood brightened.
B00000E9O7|5.0|I wore my original cassette of this album out and always meant to buy the CD.  After reading reviews of the anniversary release, I opted for the original, because I've always loved all of the subtle effects in these songs and was wary of them being submerged in the new louder version.  Great decision!  I've fallen in love with the album all over again.  (Shipping was prompt and the album arrived exactly as described.)
B008ULRY78|5.0|I didn't really hear all that much about the Raid when it came out.  I just knew it was a foreign film and that's pretty much all I knew.<br />I got really interested about it when I saw all the very positive reviews it was garnering and especially when all of them were saying how inventive the action was in it.  I am a pretty big action fan so I was pretty excited.<br />After watching a 15 minute preview of this movie I knew I had to buy it then and there.  This is definitely one of the coolest action movies I have ever seen.<br />It's pretty much about a swat team stealthily clearing out a gang controlled hotel floor by floor before alerting everyone in the building and becoming trapped on the higher floors.  The movie is them trying to escape the building while the whole gang is coming after them.<br />The action itself is just fantastic and the way it's shot is perfectly done.  The entire movie had me diabolically laughing and cheering at how these few swat members forced death upon their many enemies.  It's just a very fun movie to watch if you're an action fan.<br />I highly recommend this film to anyone with any sort of interest in the action genre.  Yes, it is a foreign film so you will be reading subtitles but no matter what you're view is on that you will enjoy watching the incredible action this movie has to offer.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is great! so fun and love how you can sell duplicate prizes for coins. too fun! easy to get addicted
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is the best superhero movie ever.  Im not really even here to review the actual film but it's just amazing.  Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.  You can imagine then how pleased I was to see how fantastic this bluray is.  The picture is pretty much perfect as well as the audio.<br />This is one of those blurays that you upgrade to a bluray player for.  This is how this awesome movie needs to be seen and heard in your home.  Whether it's this version or the 3 disc version you just have to own the bluray of this film period.  I highly highly recommend it.
0307957934|5.0|\\"The Fear Index\\" is a techno-thriller about a hedge fund manager who has developed a powerful computer program to make money at an unprecedented rate.  Strange things begin to happen in the life of the main character, and as the tempo of the plot increases, things spiral out of control.<br /><br />This book is an easy read: The writing style reminds me of Michael Crichton's, especially in the occasional passages educating the reader on the whiz-bang science behind the plot.  The story is interesting and uses the technological theme to good effect without becoming obvious or silly.  Significant secondary characters are well developed.

0425220931|4.0|If you've read and enjoyed any of the Carlos Castenada books and are a musician, you will enjoy this book. I went through it in a week while on vacation and really enjoyed it. It does broach on some pretty woo-woo concepts, but I'm already there and past that.<br /><br />If you are a musician, this book may help you become a better musician. It should also help you become a better person. It could lead you to becoming a healer, but not unless you're ready for that. And, btw, you may not be the judge of whether or not you're ready. :)
0316228532|5.0|Fantastic read. Just don't be one of these fools that pick it up expecting HP. Its an absolute page turner.
0316228532|5.0|I stayed up late to finish J.K. Rowling's newest book ... sound familiar?<br /><br /> Only the book is her adult book, A CASUAL VACANCY, and far from Harry Potter with swearing, sex, drugs and very adult-drama. When I first read the reviews, I was like ... \\"Oh...I may not like this book.\\" Still I'm a loyal JK fan, so I bought the book on the pub date, and started reading ASAP.  Not so easy...the first 100 pages felt like I was back in school and given a boring reading assignment.<br /><br /> Still, this is JK...a woman I respect for her magic and integrity. By 200 pages, it started to get interesting, and I was really liking her teen characters (shocker...not! JK writes great teen characters.) And when the first Ghost of Barry scene happened, I was finally hooked. I couldn't flip those last 200 pages fast enough, staying up till 1AM reading; saddened at the end but impressed by JK's writing...even if this is not my kind of book.<br /><br /> With continuing admiration to JK, I recommend this books to ADULTS only who have the patience to read through lengthy character background scenes...just get past the first 200 pages and you may get hooked, too.

0553381407|5.0|Has your husband tried to kill you? Has he locked you in the basement? Has he cheated on you multiple times with multiple women? Is he on drugs? Have you overlooked many of his bad repetitive behaviors or made multiple excuses to yourself? This is a great book for recovering yourself and explains why you chose such a scum bag, why you could not see what others could clearly see, the behavior of the abuser/cheater/lier, etc. and you are not alone. The book is riveting. Years ago I was referred to this book.  I have since passed it on to many people.  It is very, very helpful for adults struggling with their adult lives and bad relationships and wondering why.

B007RTAR64|5.0|If you are a Barbie Collector this is a great addition to the \\"Hunger Games\\" series collection of Barbies (if Mattel produces more dolls in the series). The product seems to represent the orignial character in the movie. I am not removing it from the box so I can't comment on the quality, but if you are a Barbie Collector you know Mattel usually does a great job on their collectible Barbies.

The story goes straight to the bone  ;-)<br /><br />The stellar SFX and makeup remain and the cast is as good as ever.<br />Camera work and the set(s) are top notch like always.<br /><br />Buy Season1, buy this Season2, watch them, love them;  trust me - you will!<br /><br />Easily 5*
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|She's done it again!!!!  Loved the book.  It is quite obvious that Picoult does her research on whatever \\"hot topic\\" she may choose to weave her story around, The Pact is no exception.  Having lost a family member to suicide, the subject matter was especially poignant to me, especially as it relates to how deeply depression can carve into the dark place of the soul.  The book is worth the read.
B003TOH8AE|5.0|Little Hit Girl makes this movie a 5 Star!! Wait for it, she comes rolling in like THUNDER! Nicolas Cage brings Hollywood Stardom, to this action packed movie! Don't miss this one, it's GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!!
B005LAII0S|3.0|Its great for kides but I did not like it, for an adult film. it was a great film for my 9year old. but a bit to kiddish forme.
B007SGM084|1.0|I sent this series of books back because I could not open it to read the books. Which was very disappointing.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Dracula is is now and always will be one of my favorite books to read, as I am a fan of anything relaated to fear or horror as long as is not a slasher<br />movie or book, the way he goes about selecting his victims and then going after them is both inriguing and at times frighting, and I think anybody<br />that likes a good viampire book will like this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best written series I've read in a long time. The kind of book that didn't let me sleep until I finished.
B008BQL77K|4.0|SUITS is the first series in a long time that I try to be sure to watch.  The actors are believable and the lines are witty.  West Wing's early seasons had the combination of drama and would slip in mundane conversations to add that element of reality.  SUITS does the same.  It's well written, well played, and great entertainment.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  If you like sci-fi, this one is a great easy read.  Very hard to put it down.  Pay attention though, lots of twists and turns.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|This is the first time I watched this movie in about twenty years and I still love it. When you look back and any movie such as this one the first thing I notice was the special effects and how simplistic they were back in the day. Jack Nicholason was a great joker and I love his devilish smile. Michael Keaton did a great job playing batman...

B005LAJ1O0|4.0|I had mixed feelings after watching AMERICAN HORROR STORY on DVD.  I'm glad I didn't watch it on FX----spared me the commercials!  On one hand, AHS grabbed my attention in its early episodes and I thought this was going to be an incredibly fresh and innovative television series.  But somehow the show took a sudden dip and what seemed original or trend-setting suddenly became muddled, redundant as if the writers developed a mid-season inertia, unsure of its direction.  I likewise was disappointed with the show's rather flimsy conclusion.<br />However, AHS is not a failure.  There are several effective scenes and some unexpected twists.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  Golden Globe/Emmy winner Jessica Lange is simply stunning as the twisted Constance Langdon, who dominates every scene she's in.  Connie Britton is perfect as Vivian, the beleagured wife/mother required to run the gamut in an extremely demanding role.  The often critically panned Dylan McDermott didn't wow me as the misguided Ben, but his performance is overshadowed by his female counterparts.  Other notable performances:  Frances Conroy, Evan Lewis, Zachary Quinto, Denis O'Hare, Michael Graziadei, Eric Stonestreet and Lily Rabe.  Don't get me wrong, though--AHS is far superior to the flat  muck of most network garbage I try to avoid and I'm definitely looking forward to season 2.  If you enjoy TRUE BLOOD, DEXTER I recommend AMERICAN HORROR STORY.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the first book, but enjoyed the second book even more. Ana becomes empowered and is no longer the weak character I once made her out to be. I am reading the kindle versions and had never seen exactly how long the books are. I was amazed that I finished the book in 3 days and it was over 500 pages long in paperback! Great read!
0316228532|1.0|This book is so disappointing. i love thrillers and drama books. I had hoped that some of the magic that this author had produced in her harry potter series would spill over and produce something really special. This book is boring, uninteresting, slow and a waste of my 24 dollars. I suppose it wasnt a waste because i know now that i wont spend any more money on her next book.
0545272629|5.0|This product came quickly, and it's description of the product was spot on. I've read the series before and wanted to own it. It's a great kids series and wonderful learning about mythology.
1439170916|5.0|This \\"used\\" book arrived very quickly, in like new condition. I haven't finished reading The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer yet, but it is an absolutely fascinating book. If you are interested in the history of cancer and the progression of medical research and treatment for it, along with a ton of other interesting information, then this is the book you need. Siddhartha Mukherjee has an engaging writing style; this reads like a story, not a textbook.
B004UID2LC|1.0|what happens to this app.was fine untill update.now it wont work says something about Internet connection not working.and when I uninstalled and reinstaled my antivirse said it was bad.so its fd-up..if I could submit my review without having to give it a star I would.because it not worth one now! !!!!!!

B0067EKY7M|4.0|Now and then a film comes along with such an 'out of left field' premise, and the producers/director get what it's all about, that it just turns out as the most peasant surprise ever. This is one of those films.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Ewan McGregor gets an e-mail from Emily Blunt. She has an Arab client with more money than sense who is in love with salmon fishing. He wants McGregor to engineer a system whereby he can introduce salmon into the Yemen ecology. McGregor thinks it's undoable but, since his wife is headed to Geneva on business and Britain needs a public relations coup, (they force the project on him) he might as well see how far he can take it. The results are surprising. There are a couple of sub plots that add to the overall but why spoil?<br /><br />This is a charming film. One of the reasons my wife liked it is because the strongest individuals here are all women. McGregor is very accomplished in his discipline but he's a bit of a milquetoast with little sense of humor. The guy in charge of securing the salmon, and pretty much every male above him in the government, are portrayed as wankers. Emily Blunt is a doll and seeing her and McGregor slowly and quietly grow closer is very satisfying. Something else I liked a lot was that, for the most part, the people here are good-hearted. Even Kristin Scott Thomas, though a bit tough and rough-edged, is not an evil queen. In one scene she's shown playing video games with her son. This is such a jolt, and so quick, it really underlined the type of person she is. There are a lot of nifty touches like that.<br /><br />This is a good looking movie. Even the desert is lovingly photographed. Lasse Hallstrom is a seasoned director and very adept at taking smaller stories and giving them their own gravity. He doesn't disappoint here. You just fall in love with these people and root for them and their cause. The music is good and all the other production values are as good as they need to be to bring this one of a kind film to fruition. If quirky indy type comedies are your poison, this should do you in.
0345803485|1.0|You got past the summary and still went on to read this shmuck of a book.  that they wasted paper on this drivel is embarrassing enough.  that people, who can read, spent time out of their lives reading it is beyond embarrassing.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really liked this game. It was a bit difficult to download, but once I finally got it, it was great. A lot of hidden objects, a good story line, and was pretty long lasting. Great for $.99

B007L6VR12|2.0|*Spoiler Alert* I just finished watching this film & didn't know at what point to stop watching.  It was was one agonizing scene after the next.  Where do I begin?  Do I start with discussing the emotionless, unrealistic, adolescent acting?  Or analyze the story's unpalatable, schizophrenic love affair?  Clearly, this is two deeply disturbed children that need serious psychiatric evaluation.  I saw one reviewer's title as \\"Stirs the memories of adolescent love\\".  Okay, for one, I personally don't know anybody that has the fond memories of running off into the wilderness at the age of 12-13 with a schizo girlfriend who's capable of stabbing a person.  Nor do I know of any 12 year old's preparing to jump off a church steeple together (Another filmmaker trying to take a blow at the Christians too).  I understand the heart-wrenching crushes we've all endured & my 1st kiss near that age, but this goes far beyond what I can consider a relatable trip down memory lane.  The raw imagery of the girl being felt up by the boy & likewise of the girl describing his erection is far more than the audience needs in trying to captivate the emotions that are being felt.  We're all adults.  We get it or we've been there before!  It borders voyeurism & pedophilia disguised in the name of \\"art\\".  I'm so sick of these masks used in the world of art & film.  Anderson tries to cleverly wrap all of this with his usual bland, retro-colored imagery as recognizable in The Life Aquatic, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums & The Darjeeling Limited.  The film also blatantly displays a socialistic viewpoint (much like Rushmore) in where the kids are the product of a sterile, systematic environment molded by a regimented scout troupe by means of uncaring, inept parents & dumbfounded adults.  Shamefully, the strong cast this film has assembled (Murray, Willis, McDormand, Norton) was wasted as character cannon fodder for the mundane, misguided love affair between two cardboard cutout kids & taking a backseat to the story's development.  The character's are all 2 dimensional & make no emotional connection to its' audience, hence the reason I wouldn't have cared if the kids jumped off that church steeple.  Much like the Life Aquatic, I had a very difficult time determining when to laugh & when to take it serious which makes it somewhat emotionally strenuous.  It draws no clear distinction in its' intentions or direction, which makes it boldly pretentious.  I did not like this film & will not recommend it to anyone.  I don't care for Wes Anderson's work beyond The Royal Tenenbaums.  He's lost his touch of quirky comedic delivery & offbeat humorous, heartwarming storytelling (The Darjeeling Limited was an exception, I did mildly enjoy it).  People are drawn to pretentiousness & traditions, so that's why fans of Wes Anderson will like this film, because it follows his latest formula & since they liked most of his previous work they will give this a good review.  Most people have a hard time looking at an individual body of work for what it is & making a clear & fair judgement, which is why it only makes sense this is getting so many rave reviews.  Sorry to burst Anderson's pretentious bubble, but this film is just not good & can hardly be called entertainment.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy read that gives one a look into the life of one of the members of the Navy's Seal Team Six.  Don't expect to a lot of classified information to be included...it just isn't there nor should it be.  DoD's main complaint is that they didn't get an opportunity to edit/censor the book prior to publication.  Kudos to the author both for his writing and the things he's done to protect our liberty...God Bless all the members of our Armed Forces.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I only just liked the books, but the movie did a great job of improving the things I didn't like (a tween centric world view) and also keeping true to the characters and story with great action, acting and cinematography.
B005LAII80|5.0|The issue with Hollywood in the past few years is studios' fascination with rebooting anything and everything. That obsession has given us some excellent features, such as Nolan's \\"Dark Knight\\" trilogy, \\"The Three Stooges\\", and \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\". However, most of what we get is middling, such as the misguided \\"The Amazing Spider-man\\", to unnecessary, such as this year's \\"Total Recall\\", to outright crap, like... well, like the rest of them. So I was a bit gun shy when I saw that Lionsgate was issuing a remake of the abhorrent Sylvester Stallone vehicle \\"Judge Dredd.\\" After some positive reviews came out, I decided to give it a shot. Thanks to that decision, I have a new film that is has been firmly added to my favorite sci-fi features of all time.<br /><br />In the future, the world is a desert wasteland, and the only life is housed in a giant city spanning multiple U.S. states, appropriately called Mega-City. Crime is out of control in Mega-City, and the only line of defense against them is the Hall of Justice. Working for the Hall are armored super-cops called Judges, who possess sweet motorcycles, tight leather chaps, and pistols that are capable of firing explosives, taser rounds, and splitter shots, to name a few. The best of these Judges is Dredd (Karl Urban), a seemingly emotionless man whose only goal in life is to deliver fair, by-the-books justice. But when he is tasked with training the unstable, psychic rookie Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), his morals are put to the test. The two find themselves locked in a 200-story apartment complex, and pitted against an army of goons amped up on a dangerous drug called \\"Slo-Mo\\", all controlled by the ruthless gang boss affectionately called \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headey.) Throughout the course of one night, they must survive both their assailants and each other.<br /><br />\\"Dredd\\", in the face of so many detractors (myself included), is a triumph in both action and science fiction cinema. Its gunfights are more tense than any scene in \\"The Expendables 2\\", and the near-future setting is far more enthralling than anything we saw in \\"Prometheus.\\" The dialogue is very minimalist, and fits the overall tone of the film quite well. Dredd's one-liners never feel hammy and are always natural, thanks to Urban's surprising performance. Thirlby conveys her character's pathos and apprehension beautifully, to the point of her almost stealing the show from everybody else in the movie. Rivaling her is Headey, who is deliciously evil and obviously having a great time playing somebody with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This is a movie that one could watch and enjoy for the acting alone.<br /><br />Action buffs have nothing to worry about, either. The shootouts are exciting and packed with some of the most visceral gore this side of a slasher flick, yet never cross into exploitation territory. More tension is packed onto these scenes due to the fact that ammo conservation and utilization of stealth are very real issues, giving more realism to the situation. The two Judges never feel superhuman, and are just as vulnerable as the droves of criminals that they pump full of lead. Special props should also be given to the slow motion effects, which are some of the best I've seen since \\"300\\", and in my opinion, raise a new standard from what we should expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. This film has less than a quarter of \\"Avatar\\"'s budget, yet its effects are far more convincing, and I daresay better, than James Cameron's $300 Million+ ego trip. Studios need to take note that it's not the size of the budget that matters, it's all in how you use it.<br /><br />Every element of this film holds up to critical scrutiny, from the acting to the dialogue to the action sequences. Even Paul Leonard-Morgan's score is enthralling. A sci-fi/action movie hasn't captured me this much since \\"The Matrix\\", or even \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\", two films which I feel are on this one's level. This is oneexample of a reboot that went beautifully right, and a definite must-see for moviegoers. \\"Dredd\\" is a triumph in action cinema, in sci-fi cinema, and in film in general. One of this year's best movies, one of the best action films of the past decade, and arguably the best reboot since \\"Batman Begins.\\"<br /><br />Grade: A-example of a reboot that went beautifully right, and a definite must-see for moviegoers. \\"Dredd\\" is a triumph in action cinema, in sci-fi cinema, and in film in general.

B0053O89KG|2.0|One of the great things about the first three seasons, the cast seemed to gel effortlessly. In this darker, melodramatic season, there were a few times you could notice the actors actually struggle in their performances. There are also a few moments of poor editing. Season 4 really shows how well done the first three seasons were. By not being that well done.<br /> The two-part episode was Castle's \\"jumping the shark\\" moment for me. The bad icing on a poorly baked cake. No more Castle, ever.<br /> Andrew, enjoy your new membership in the Ministry of Trope Propaganda. From now on, I'll avoid anything you are attached to.

0316228532|3.0|Well then, wasn't that interesting.  Love you JK and this is a well written book, as demonstrated by the revulsion along with the inability to stop reading.  But in Pagford you are either abusing or being abused by someone.  This is the predictable small town minutiae, with the gossip, waring factions, family disfunctionality, and tragic outcomes that pepper the news reports in the evening. Unfortunately in times like we are in where people need something uplifting, and inspiring us to the better angels of our nature, we are shellacked with a modern day dickensian david copperfield, in the most groveling human interactions.<br /><br />Any-hoo, If this is part of her next possible 4 part series, my hope is that, going forward, it approaches a higher focus.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Wow what a wonderful way to house your creative finds and find some new ones. love the website and the app.
B0086A40AW|5.0|I have treasured the \\"Eraserhead 2000\\" DVD (2002) for many years.  The blu-ray adds a tad more resolution, but only as much as the focus and grain of the original film can deliver.  Also keep in mind that even the best blu-ray is only about 2 megapixels.  Sound is perfect, using the same Dolby 48kHz 192 kbps compression as on the DVD.  True PCM is not needed on a soundtrack like this.  Another improvement on the DVD is the prescence of chapters.  My only gripe is that the disc is kept consistently spun-up at 30 Mbps, so the player never has a chance to settle down.  It's constantly rumbling at full capacity.  There is a slight haze to the picture, but I think this may just be the inherent grain of the film.  Maybe another firm will come out with a slightly better blu-ray.  Who knows?  This is if anything an improvement on the DVD and well worth purchasing as your only copy of the movie.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Funnest app ever. Great follow up with many twists. Will always play. Please keep the new levels coming! Great app
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I just enjoyed it!  No story?!?!? This was a great story. I loved how it went from a human pet oriented story to a totally non-human story except they were living wild west human lives..sheriff, girl to save, little guns, town with saloon, bad guys, and all. The mexican owl quartet, that somehow played an electric guitar in the desert, brought humor and were a great addition. Then there was the spiritual side of the story..deep, man...having to get to the other side of the road.  (Could of swore that was Eastwood.) There was a lot here for adults and children (not toddlers).  Highly recommend this movie.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I got into Dream Theater about two years ago. Dont know why I didnt sooner. But I forgot how I got into them, I think I was looking at a band called Galactic Cowboys and they showed up on the side bar on recomadations. So I checked them out. I think the first album I bought was Awake by them, which was good. Then My second was this album. Whick I think is my favorite but its hard to choose!The riffs and vocals, and the whole band are out of this world talented! I think the song that sold me on this album is The dark enternal night is amazing song with some amazing riffs, John always displays a couple of amazing riffs in one song! So check it out. A amazing album by a amazing band!
B0085MNZ66|5.0|Just when I was beginning to think that there weren't any creative thinking apps left, along comes this one. Don't let the seemingly simplistic look of this excellent puzzler fool you. It can be fun and challenging. I like the fact that the developer didn't include very much in the way of instructions,  part of the challenge is figuring out how it works. Very original &amp; well done. It works great on my Kindle Fire.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|I picked up this cd the day it came out in 2007. Didnt think much about it at the time, listen to it twice and never really listened to it again. Its not like I didnt like Machinehead, I did I love Machinehead, but for some reason the album didnt do anything for me at the time. Fastforward five years and Unto the locust comes out, I get really into the album, and I see Rob Flynn on that metal show talking about his new album and the Blackening, everyones saying how great it is, even James Hatfield saying how it inspiring him to write Death Magnectic, hope I spelled that right lol! So I gave it another couple of listens, and I dont know what happen something just click in my head! It was the best metal album I heard in a long time, I love the long songs, the riffs are amazing, the singing is amazing its just the whole metal package check it out!
B0087HT36U|5.0|I really didn't expect to like this game, but it caught me at the right time when I was stuck in a waiting room so I gave it a shot. Five days later and I am still playing it. I would recommend this one to anyone. Very easy to pick up and put down. Great for a casual gamer.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This was actually my fourth Pantera album I bought! Great Southern Trendkill being first, Vulgar Display of Power being my second, Far beyong driven being my third! But I think Cowboys is my fave! Its just got some classic on here and some concert staples. I love Plih's voice on this album a hybrid of Chris cornel and Rob Halford. Just a metal masterpiece from start to end, always with Dimbag R.I.P. I couldnt imagine hearing this in the 90s for the first time. Always rocks my face off, all killer no filler!

So I went to visit my dad in the summer, and he took me to see it. It was in the dollar movie theater by then but I didnt care. well the movie blew my mind, thought the acting and directing were great one of the best comic book movies of all time. Its even better on blue ray. The pictures clearer and I think they added scences into the movie very cool for a huge fan!

0316228532|4.0|I am only 1/3rd of the way through but I really felt like I had to come on here rush to this book's defense. Yes, IT IS NOT Harry Potter (but actually, the characters and personality from those books are still present in this book.) I love the humor and the unique way JKR has of depicting her characters and breathing them life. My favorite character so far is Fats. I would compare this book to Zadie Smith's [[ASIN:0143037749 On Beauty]] a book where you get to know various characters from many different generations, warts and all.<br /><br />Give the book a chance. Pretend it's not from JKR if that helps! Don't just tear it apart without reading it!<br /><br />Anyway, I'll come and update the review once I'm done with the book 100%. (And yes, I read the part about the unguarded vagina and it was hilarious!)<br /><br />---<br />Alright, now I'm 2/3rds through with the book. I'm enjoying reading it a lot so I'm just savoring it and reading only a few chapters at a time, rather than rushing through to finish it. While I don't want to spoiler, I will definitely say that Fats is no longer my favorite character. I do love how JKR just painstakingly created real 3D personalities and backstories and motivations for this whole mob of characters though. I feel like I can't even pick who my favorite is! The character of Crystal is slowly drifting towards the forefront which contrasts nicely with how, in Harry Potter, it was OBVIOUS that Harry was the star. In the beginning of The Casual Vacancy, I only saw Crystal as a dirty little Dudley-esque (though attractive looking) minor-character. A mean girl of low intellect from a bad family. And DESPITE these facts, JKR is slowly molding her to be a sympathetic character. I think something like that takes lots of skill and I'm enjoying going on the ride.<br /><br />If I can draw an analogy from the real world, I do feel like this is JKR's 'Drew Barrymore moment.' Remember back in the early 90's when Drew Barrymore just got sick of doing little girl roles and started doing sexified roles in movies like Poison Ivy and The Amy Fischer Story? Most people were like WHAT IS SHE DOING? WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?? But in retrospect we realize that she just had to rebel and break away from that old mold and I feel like this is exactly what JKR is doing too. I do feel like she's over-doing it a little bit with the rude language and sexual content (there isn't much but when it's there, IT'S THERE RIGHT IN YOUR FACE.) And it's awkward like the rape scene from [[ASIN:0312424442 I Am Charlotte Simmons: A Novel]]<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to people who are more into action and less into scenes where people just stand around talking about each other. If this book were a movie, it would be a 6 hour miniseries because of all the tiny little character-developing scenes and interactions. To some people, that's very uninteresting and basically the 180 degree opposite of Harry Potter's adventures. Me? I like those kinds of books. This is definitely a 'Read a few pages in the store first!' kind of book though.<br /><br />Good luck & happy reading!oing little girl roles and started doing sexified roles in movies like Poison Ivy and The Amy Fischer Story?

This is definitely a 'Read a few pages in the store first!' kind of book though.<br /><br />Good luck & happy reading!

B0085T684A|5.0|Note: I have seen every episode of this excellent suspense drama with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />From the suspense-filled first minutes of REVENGE, every episode has unraveled new twists and turns in this deliciously new take on Le Comte De Monte Cristo, one of the greatest novels of all time. Each episode is a single thread in a delicately woven tapestry which, when completed, is a marvel to behold.<br /><br />Season 2 begins tonight at 9/8 central on ABC...
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Not quite as well done as \\"Fall of Giants\\", but still a page turner.<br /><br />As in \\"Fall of Giants\\", Follett tells the story of a world at war from the perspectives of the common people of the U.K., the U.S.A, Russia and Germany.  Once again he seamlessly weaves a mesmerizing fictional story line into actual historic events.<br /><br />This time the main characters are the children of the people we got to know in \\"Fall of Giants\\", but I don't feel that Follett fleshed these new characters out as well as he did their parents.  Although his new characters are absolutely believable, they just don't have the complexity that he achieved with his characters in \\"Fall of Giants\\".<br /><br />Still, Follett's story telling is excellent, and I look forward to Book 3.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another solid outing for Jack Reacher.  Overall a quality read, although not quite as engaging as some of the other Jack Reacher episodes.  For some reason, this installment seemed to be a bit more up-and-down with the \\"down\\" times not as captivating as the other books.  Perhaps it was that the story line was a bit more conspiracy-theory-double/triple-cross and slightly less of the solid detective work that Jack is known for.  But overall as enjoyable read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A very engaging read. I have recommended the book at every opportunity. Many twists and turns to the plot.  Just when you think you know what the book is about, there is a twist you didn't expect.  The bad thing is one cannot tell someone who hasn't read the book about the twists without taking away part of the fun of reading it yourself. So do it.

B0075LTOR2|5.0|This is a must-have, the sound quality is absolutely excellent overall and the price is quite low for such a beautiful thing. While it is true that there is nothing when it comes to notes in form of an information booklet, I guess most buyers wil, already have that information in one form or another. Compared to previous European cd versions of rosy music s output there is a great gain in clarity. While Avalon had always been ok so unwise this was not always true when it came to the previous issues such as even flesh and blood which was previously compressed and anemic but sounds superb here. Also, no live cuts but that does not reall matter even if viva would have been nice to have as well.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|It took me forever to get the courage to watch this movie after my friend told me about it, and after watching it, will take me forever to forget it.

0385341075|4.0|Bougainville. A tropical island North of Australia, between New Guinea and the Solomons. All the whites, the former employees of a big copper mine, have left except for one, the eccentric Mr. Watts who is married to one of the islanders. Mr. Watts volunteers to teach school, despite his avowed lack of knowledge on many subjects. But he is clearly a born teacher, and he is soon holding the children spellbound with daily readings from GREAT EXPECTATIONS, his sole textbook. He also has parents come in to share fragments of their own knowledge, or even to debate his resolute atheism; like a kind of educational stone soup, the curriculum soon fills out to a full meal.<br /><br />All this is narrated in retrospect by a young girl named Matilda. Her father has moved to Australia, and she lives with her religious mother who regards Mr. Watts and Pip both as emissaries of the devil. But Matilda is enraptured, entering a world of the imagination that is richer by far than anything on the island. When the book is accidentally destroyed, she joins with her classmates in trying to reconstruct its scenes from memory. Later still, she is enthralled when Mr. Watts, like a second Homer, recounts his own version, combining Dickens with his own life and the stories of the islanders. For half the book at least, this is a wondrous exploration of the magic of literature and the power of good teaching.<br /><br />But Bougainville is no Utopia. In 1990, a group of revolutionaries, incensed by the despoliation of the island by the copper company, succeeded in getting the mine closed and declared independence. New Guinea, which claimed sovereignty, imposed a blockade and sent forces to combat the rebels, with numerous atrocities on both sides. These true events are inadequately explained in the novel, but the two forces -- the local \\"Rambos\\" and the invading \\"Redskins\\" -- lurk on the periphery as a threat of unpredictable violence. Until suddenly the violence turns immediate, brutal, and horrific, and the book becomes something else entirely.<br /><br />As it happens, I have just read another novel in which childhood innocence was juxtaposed with inhuman atrocity: IN THE SHADOW OF THE BANYAN, by Vaddey Ratner, set in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. Both authors describe things that really happened, but Vaddey Ratner admits to writing autobiographically, while Lloyd Jones clearly is not. So I found the contrast harder to take in his case, since the book is his own construct; to my mnd, he betrays a basic contract with the reader by leading us one way and then switching to a different tone entirely. Nor can I believe that Matilda can move on with so little apparent trauma after witnessing what she does. But then I don't think that Jones really knew what kind of book he was trying to write; the last third of the book changes tack too many times, to end in a drawn-out and anticlimactic epilogue. Which is a pity, since the opening is so marvelous. (3.5 stars).rific, and the book becomes something else entirely.<br /><br />As it happens, I have just read another novel in which childhood innocence was juxtaposed with inhuman atrocity: IN THE SHADOW OF THE BANYAN, by Vaddey Ratner, set in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.

B0031RS4V6|4.0|Now I am no stranger to Lee Child's novels and have shelf upon shelf lined up with all his books, racing to the shops to purchase the new editions. The Hard Way is another great story, featuring the slightly complicated, but loveable character, Reacher. As always, the story keeps the pages turning with great characters and one-liners, and coming from the UK originally, it was great to see that part of the story was based in England. However, I was disappointed by the ending. Not wanting to give too much away to those that have not yet had the pleasure in reading this book, I found it a little exaggerated and rather 'Hollywood' for my liking.  Guns, kidnapping, murder....all in a quiet English Hamlet. I'm afraid I felt rather let down considering I truly enjoyed the rest of the book until the last 4 chapters. Not to be deterred, I have just purchased Child's newest novel, so obviously I didn't hate it that much!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is a fairly thorough, concise news source.  It allows you to cover the major stories quickly without the time-consuming process of waiting for individual stories to load, a major cause of skipping the entire story and reading only the summaries.  I respect the BBC and trust their sources.  This is a fast, efficient source of news.
B000001DQI|5.0|Sometimes I forget that before the Lion King and some of the more recent years, how much a genius Sir (well, BEFORE the \\"Sir\\" too) Elton John was. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is a clear indication of what a benchmark in music Sir Elton is and has become. It is not only a validation of talent but a staple in any pop-lovers CD collection. This CD is just one great song after the next, after the next!....If you love Elton John....if you love pop-music.... and if you DON'T have this CD then please buy it immediately!!

B005LAJ1HW|5.0|My husband and I love this series. I got him hooked on it during the first season. So of course, we had to get the first season. I couldn't wait until the second season came out to add it to our collection. We watched all of the episodes prior to the premier of the third season, just to make sure we didn't forget anything. (I'm really going to miss Jimmy!) So far, this season looks like it is going to be as action filled as the last two.

B008DVJO8C|5.0|awsome cd not dissapointed at all. it was worth the money to buy a cd and not go on itunes for it.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|I will start off by saying that Green Day has brought back of a bit their punk roots back in with this album.  It is more of pop punk than it is punk rock.  What I mean by that is that it's more in the lines of Warning but more rocking.  Not so much Dookie, Insomniac, or even Nimrod.  I think this has to do a lot with the tone and the production.  There is no raw aggressiveness as in tracks such as \\"Geek Stink Breath\\", \\"Coming Clean\\", \\"Chump\\", \\"Stuck With Me\\", or \\"Brain Stew/Jaded\\", but Uno does bring back those more simplistic punk melodies.  Take for instance the first track \\"Nuclear Family.\\"  It definitely brings back a good punk sound but it has production that is more polished by its louder echo-y vocals and cleaner guitars as opposed to openers \\"Burnout\\", \\"Armatage Shanks\\", or \\"Nice Guys Finish Last\\".  But when referring to the songs themselves it starts off with three pretty good tracks.  \\"Let Yourself Go\\" comes up as the fourth track but is more on the repetitive side.  But things really turn bad when \\"Kill The DJ\\" comes in.  When the song first came on I got really eager to hear it all.  However, when that repetitive horrid chorus comes on it just ruins the song.  It's not about the constant dropping of F-bombs but it's the constant repetitiveness.  Things slowly start to get better but nothing great until the song \\"Angel Blue\\" comes in as well as the rest of the album.  So I believe the best tracks are the first three and last four songs.  This is not necessarily up there with their pre-Warning albums but it does sort of bring back a flare to them.

B005LAII8A|5.0|By the movie trailer, I thought I knew what to expect from Looper. I thought it would be a semi-mindless sci-fi action movie with little character development and a weak plot. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Looper does have action, it is a futuristic sci-fi movie, yet it is also deep. There is a lot of character development and you really thirst for knowledge about the characters past, or future. It is more violent and there is a bit more swearing that I originally would have thought, however the it is the simple ideas and plot developments which are so well depicted and directed throughout the film which amazed me.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great and considering the role, of being the young Bruce Willis, he did great. Levitt is the main character, though his older future self, Bruce Willis also holds quite a large role too.<br /><br />You may have noticed in the trailer that Joseph Gordon-Levitt does not look quite like himself. This is true because they digitally altered his face, eyes and nose to look like Bruce Willis's rugged mug. They really did a great job of doing this and I was honestly quite surprised.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, I was caught off guard about a lot of things. There are a few twists in the plot, however they are more like surprises that I did not see coming which further advance the story and what you think you may know about the characters.<br /><br />Over-all Looper was a great sci-fi action movie and it is one of the better movies I have seen all year. I do plan on purchasing this on Blu-ray the day it is available.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0142419400|5.0|In a sentence or so: Anna attends boarding school in France for a year because her douchebag dad thinks it will help culture her and stuff. She makes new friends, learns more about herself, and has complicated feelings for a hot british dude.<br /><br />Here's the deal. I know everyone and their mom has read this book already, so I will save you the synopsis. If you're one of the 8 people left on the planet who haven't read this yet, you can certainly check out the summary at Goodreads.<br /><br />Since we are reading about Anna's time in Paris as it happened, I felt like her friends were my friends. And while School of America in Paris probably didn't have a yearbook because yearbooks are lame, let's pretend they did. This is what I'd write in each of their yearbooks.<br /><br />Mer - I will forever and always love you because you reached out to Anna on her first night. You set the tone for her whole year in Paris by being sweet and thoughtful and patient with her. While things didn't work out for you and St. Clair, I have NO DOUBT that some seriously rockstar boy is in your future because you deserve THE BEST.<br /><br />Rashmi - For reasons I don't fully understand, I liked you a whole helluva lot. Something about your understated snarkiness and low-key compassion for all of your friends is just fantastic. I respect you to the moon and back.<br /><br />Josh - Your subtle humor and ability to help the group feel at ease, even in the most awkward of situations, is such a gift. You were the perfect bro for St. Clair. I have no doubt y'all talked about Anna and Ellie all the dang time. I also secretly loved that you frequently cut class and drew all the time.<br /><br />Anna - How I love your love for all things movies. I would totally watch It Happened One Night with you on repeat for a decade because I love it - and you - that much. I felt your pain with the whole being in a New Place situation, but you handled it magnificently. Do me a favor and don't sell yourself short - you are hilarious, insightful, and a great friend.<br /><br />St. Clair - You had me at your rants about Rasputin. As a history nerd who is particularly charged about the whole Tsar Nicolas II situation, this made my heart beat OUT OF MY RIBCAGE like a cartoon. Your love for Anna manifesting as a friendship first was the absolute BEST. Thanks for being the guy she needed you to be. I'm sorry about your mom, bro. Also, sorry your dad is a dickbag.<br /><br />There are so many fun elements to this story. Like being in Paris, being at boarding school, the hot British guy that is a GREAT FRIEND and then some, realizing past mistakes and moving on, accepting your friends for who they are, and punching that girl in the face who TOTALLY DESERVED IT ALL THIS TIME.<br /><br />You will find someone or something to relate to in Anna and the French Kiss. You'll also totally highlight the hell out of this book because Stephanie Perkins has some incredible dialogue and one-liners.<br /><br />Yeah, Anna and the French Kiss lives up to the hype.<br /><br />Fave quote: \\"I wish the thing that is best for me.\\" (87)<br /><br />Fix er up: Some things were painfully obvious to me, but that did not hurt on the enjoyment AT ALL. I kind of liked knowing what was coming so I could be fully in the moment with Anna and St. Clair and all the rest!f short - you are hilarious, insightful, and a great friend.<br /><br />St. Clair - You had me at your rants about Rasputin.

B0085MNZ66|4.0|I  will give the dev credit for a innovative type of app. I have to agree that some form of instructions would be helpful. I was able to get the science level. It definitely makes you think. The app has lots of potential. I will keep trying as it's not as bad as folks are making it.
B0086449YA|5.0|If you like Mark Knopfler, you'll love this. 2CD's with A LOT of really strong songs on both of them. These have to be some of the best songs he's ever written. Lots of different musical styles, great grooves (often of the gut-bucket blues variety). The lyrics are wonderful and the guitar work, oh the guitar work. Drop-dead gorgeous. I think this CD will be considered one of his greatest. It's that good.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|If you are a fan of The Walking Dead TV series, then you will enjoy this. In addition to all Season 2 episodes there are also episode commentaries and deleted scenes (which I loved!). Great way to get pumped about Season 3 starting soon, or just to go back and see some amazing story telling. Who would ever have thought of changing zombies from horror to drama?!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|You don't read a book featuring the character Jack Reacher, you devour it.  This was another Lee Child book that makes you read it at top speed, because you can't wait to see what's behind the next corner, door or body.  Great stuff.  I can't wait until the next one.  How about a Jack Reacher movie, Hollywood?

I was hoping for a fun movie and this certainly filled the bill, I just don't see it being a go-to movie for a movie night. If you have kids between 8 - 11 years old, I think they'd love this movie. For older audiences it might be a bit of a stretch beyond the cute one-off gags they have. It is an adorable movie though.

The power we have as individuals is amazing, and this book has simple, easy to use methods of practice to tap into our power. This book is written so anyone can pick up the habits of using positive thoughts on a daily basis. I like how Joseph Murphy uses biblical references for the Bible readers as well. I love this book!
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved Bared to You and can't wait for the next book in the Crossfire series. If you enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey, you will definitely like Bared to You. In some ways, it is a much better read than 50 Shades. The writing definitely flows more smoothly, and I like Eva much better as a heroine. I admire how much she has healed, how far she has come, even as I recognize she is still flawed. Awesome read!

B0028R3G5O|5.0|This double CD album was released exclusively in Australia and is, unfortunately, not readily available in the US. It's a shame, as this collection is far superior to that hot mess of a compilation known as \\"The Essential Cyndi Lauper\\".<br /><br />I'd 'almost' say that this album replaces \\"Twelve Deadly Cyns\\" except 'Come On Home' and the 'Hey Now' version of 'Girls Just Want To Have Fun' are not included. No big loss! However, 'I'm Gonna Be Strong' didn't make the cut, either! That was disappointing! But in all fairness, the song was a Blue Angel single, prior to Cyndi's solo career. Any true Cyndi fan should have a copy of \\"Twelve Deadly Cyns\\" in their record collection anyway!<br /><br />There's not much else to be said about this one. If you can find a copy of \\"True Colours The Best Of\\", GET IT! You will not be disappointed!

B007C3TVNA|4.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is full of subtleties, uncertainties, and improbabilities. We are told very little about the characters, and what we are shown is often marginal. Examples: I wanted to know more about the family's background, Kevin's condition (antisocial personality disorder or what?), how he interacts (or doesn't) with the other kids at his school, and most importantly, how he manages to commit this improbable crime. Yet, having said this I have to ask, \\"What difference would all that have made?\\" As Kevin himself states, \\"That's the point: There is no point.\\" Although the minimalism works in the end, fans of traditional film narrative may find this one a bit frustrating. Having seen it, I'm glad I did, but it's not the sort of thing I want to see again any time soon.<br /><br />The whole mood is, as you can imagine, very bleak, and, for lack of a better term, semi-surreal. The dialogue is especially important: e.g., Kevin: \\"You can be kind of harsh sometimes\\"; Eva (his mother): \\"You're a fine one to talk.\\" The physical traits Kevin and Eva share, while Kevin's father and sister share fairer traits, serve to symbolize how Eva is blamed so cruelly for Kevin's crime and the guilt she feels over same. What \\"WNTAK\\" shows and does not show leaves room for all kinds of interpretations, but I think it shows very effectively how society is cruel to everyone, and everyone learns, often in the hardest possible ways, from it.<br /><br />The first hour or so is erratic and often confusing with all the jumping back and forth in time, but everything comes into sharper focus during the second half of \\"WNTAK.\\" The fine, fine acting by Swinton, Reilly, and all three actors who play Kevin during various stages of his life is an indispensable strength here: Weaker or merely competent acting would have made this film quite forgettable.

B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I first watched \\"Psycho\\" a year ago around this time of Halloween. My mom wanted to see it once again and was always saying I needed to watch it. She first saw it when it came out and remembers it well, especially the not coming in early signs throughout the movie.<br /><br />So, we found it at the library and watched it on a rainy afternoon. At first I was scared because I can't even stand to watch today's horror films.. would I survive this one? Well the answer to that is a yes! My reaction to the ending was a big shocker let me tell you, I kept repeating the phrase \\"Oh my God, oh my God!\\" This is perhaps the greatest horror/suspense film in existence. Makes you think without being too gory or bloody or leaving you dreading bedtime. Which was a plus for me, I experienced this while watching \\"Paranormal Activity 2.\\" Couldn't sleep/bathe without the doors open. Psycho didn't do that, to my relief.<br /><br />I watch it again, and never once did it grow old, such a masterpiece for sure! Hitchcock and of course to the author who wrote the book are geniuses.<br />Anthony Perkins is an amazing actor, I cannot begin to find words to describe his performance as Norman Bates. It was a great privilege to see him at work. He really became believable while transforming into this twisted character. Janet Leigh and Vera Miles were also just as amazing as they too gave strong performances.<br /><br />If you haven't watched this movie: watch it! I promise you won't regret it, plus you'll finally understand all of the references made in other media. :) I sure felt in the club with that one after watching this movie.<br /><br />My generation (this one) should really watch this movie; they need to know about the classic horror movie that is \\"Psycho\\".
B005XN31LY|4.0|Once Upon A Time is a very creative adaptation of our childhood fairy tales.  It is quality television, well-acted, with intriguing story lines
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Before reading this book, I knew nothing about how to get my body into great shape. I bought it because I saw lots of positive reviews and it seemed to be one of the best in this category. And sure enough, it didn't disappoint me at all. The content is top-notch. It's clear and concise and backed by research and studies. Reading this book is like having a good friend sharing knowledge and giving you genuine advice about the subject.<br /><br />The author is authentic. When it comes to bodybuilding there's a lot of theories that can't be concluded to be right or wrong, but you won't see him making a claim that he knows the right answer. He just gives you practical advice about it.<br /><br />If you're into bodybuilding (and have a tendency to believe everything that the media and the bodybuilding mags are regurgitating), I highly recommend this book.
0525953728|5.0|From cover to cover this saga was addicting. Couldn't put it down. Wonderful! There was  much controversy about the book but as American's we have the right to know. I read nothing that would compromise state secrecy.
B004BUY0T2|5.0|Fritz Lang is a cinematic god.  His use of sound, dialogue and unique camera angles make transitions seamless and adds to the emotional impact of the film.  And Peter Lorrie is at his creepiest!

B008XG1X18|4.0|I use my kindle, and this app is great except that it crashes quite a lot. still happy with it though
B0092MKTL2|5.0|This album was a surprise to me.  I was shopping Amazon.com for other music and for some reason, this album kept popping up on the page as something I might also like.  I decided to try it out and bought it right away.  There is not one song on this album I don't like and I will buy anything this band puts out from this point on.  Sound unheard!!!
B0015DROBO|4.0|It was hard for me to get involved in this book. Since this book was highly recommended to me, I kept reading. It took almost half the book before I was hooked.  I think I got bogged down in all the details and characters.  However, the last half has excellent.  Made me buy the 2nd book of the trilogy immediately!
B00008IHN1|5.0|IF YOUR INTO MUSIC, MARCHING BANDS, AND WHAT IT TAKES TO BE IN IT. This is for you.  I recommand this movie.  Good story, and good plot. It is not a silly musical.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I got hooked on Firefly by my son last year.  I borrowed his copy of the series and fell in love with Nathan Fillion.  I had to have a copy of my own when my son wanted his copy back.  Loved to watch the Firefly 10 year reunion at Comic Com on You Tube.  Firefly is a once in a lifetime show.  The whole crew was amazing and that is what made it so special.  I have watched Castle last few years and feel that Nathan is an amazing multi faceted actor.  Everything he does is great.<br /><br />My favorite episode is Out of Gas as this was a good way to see how the Capt teamed up with his crew.  But all the episodes are unique and great.<br /><br />Now that I have the Firefly series of my own --some rainly Saturday will be marathon day for me.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I feel like Hiatt keeps getting better and better...and to think he started off, way back in the day, pretty darn awesome.<br />This album just rocks!<br /><br />Every single song stands alone as awesome...but my fav is 'Wood Chipper'....creepy awesome.<br /><br />His previous album was awesome stuff but I'd say this tops 'Dirty Jeans' by a slim margine...prob b/c more upbeat and good ol' rock n' roll songs that Hiatt does best.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this album.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty shades of gray=fifty shades of effed up...literally. Omg i do have to say that i enjoyed reading this book but i just cannot understand why a person world write about this. the author has got to be effed in the head. i got mad, i smiled and laughed, and i cried at the end of the book. getting ready to start the next one and i just hope there is some hope left in Christian Grey.

B0081KTI0E|4.0|My daughters wanted to see this film because Daniel Radcliffe stars in it.  But make no mistake.  This character is no Harry Potter.<br /><br />However, this is an intriguing little scary film.  The pieces come together nicely in a fairly predictable manner, though the ending offered an unexpected surprise.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|This movie was sort of an exercise for me and my daughters to talk about how our behavior influences how others perceive us.  It might not reflect who we really are inside, but it's important to be a person of integrity and match our inside with our outside behaviors.  We had such a great talk about it and I think it really affected them positively - and it definitely made us all laugh.  It's such a \\"real\\" portrait of teenage life and the acting was super excellent.  Of course, I adore Stanley Tucci and Emma Stone.  There were a couple places where I thought it was more of a rated R movie - maybe PG 16.  WATCH THIS WITH YOUR KIDS.  It's a great conversation starter!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games are challanging and is a must for the level breakers. If you love being challanged then I highly recommend this game for kids of all ages .
B005LAJ22Q|2.0|THE WALKING DEAD Season 1 was intriguing and well done. Season 2 is so MORALISTIC and full of childish domestic dramas. This is what happens when crappy writers are hired. The actors are really good, their dialogue is stupid. When you live in a world like this, you either learn how to survive and do your best to protect yourself or put a bullet in your head. The main cast characters parade around like they have the RIGHT to tell others how they're supposed to behave in a world filled with flesh-eating ZOMBIES. Give me a break. More people need to have sex in this series. Now there's some good therapy.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a wonderful app and i advise u to get it . its really fun but not for everyone
B003P2WJ6S|5.0|How would you feel if your doctor took a sample of your tissue without your consent and then used it to further his own research studies and then shared that tissue with laboratories and medical research centers around the world for a profit?<br /><br />After your death, what would happen if your family discovered that your cells had been used in medical research against the family's wishes for years, but that those cells had also been used to make some of the most important innovations that modern science has ever known?<br /><br />This is what happened to an African American woman named Henrietta Lacks in 1951. Henrietta was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that eventually led to her death. Her doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore discovered that Henrietta's cells were immortal, meaning that they could be grown in a lab without dying after a few cell divisions. Samples of Henrietta's cancerous tissue were taken without her knowledge or consent during her treatments and then again after her death. Henrietta's cells were used to conduct many experiments from developing a cure for polio and studying the effects of radiation and other toxic substances on the human body to gene mapping as well as cancer and AIDS research. Her cells represented a boon to medical research.<br /><br />In the meantime, Henrietta's family had been kept in the dark. They lived in poverty and poor health, often without health insurance, and they only found out about her contribution to science years later.<br /><br />Journalist Rebecca Skloot does an excellent job of gathering what little information there is on Henrietta's life and telling her remarkable story and the aftermath of her death. It's unusual for a journalist to get so close to the subjects she is writing about, but Rebecca's close relationship with the family only made me feel more indignant about how they were treated. The end of the novel, in particular, was a real eye-opener for me. I had spent so much time feeling angry about what had happened to the Lacks' that I never stopped to consider what would've happened if Henrietta's cells hadn't been used.<br /><br />This isn't a story about Henrietta Lacks, although she is certainly the most important figure in this novel. It's about her children, her friends, and the debate over whether or not human tissue should be used with or without a patient's consent and what that means for the future of medical science.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|I tried it 2 minutes later I uninstalled it cuz I checked the temperature and it was at 94 degrees then I checked it again and the temperature went up. usaully the temp. will go down. I followed my interwishing and uninstalled it. not good for kindle fire. oh yeah and the reason some of you had installed this and the next day the kindle fire wasn't turning on was because it was over heated so to prevent that I uninstalled it.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you are reading book number two, you have read book one and know how hard it is to put the book down! I think most of the women in America have read, or know someone who has read, the \\"Fifty Shades\\" series.  I must look intent while reading because I've had one woman at the pool ask \\"what are you reading\\" (maybe because I was pacing back and forth in the shallow end with my face never leaving my Kindle) and one on a flight home from California (could it be because I used a quote out loud from Anastasia \\"Oh my!\\").  Both had read the entire series and are hoping there will be more.  In fact, the woman on the plane said her daughter and daughter in law read the series as well.  The only disappointment I'll have is when I finish Book 3!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Nice puzzle game. Challenging but rewarding. Puzzles different enough to be interesting. Not frenetic or jumpy. Beautiful graphics and music works well with challenges.
1451648537|5.0|Isaacson has written a well researched and very well written biography of one of the more complicated characters of the 20th Century. Jobs was a narcissistic, troubled, rude, yet brilliant man who the author notes will be remembered by history as an equal to Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. His fabulous business exploits in developing Apple and Pixar are offset by his atrocious behavior to his family, friends, closest colleagues, and complete strangers. Mankind is better off because Jobs was here, there can be no doubt, but he left behind a lot of baggage for others to tote.<br /><br />A telling story the author relays is about the bachelor party two colleagues treated Steve to, who by this time was an American Icon. When the author asked one of them why they were the only two to attend the reply was that no one else wanted to attend.<br /><br />A very interesting read. Highly Recommended.

034580404X|5.0|What more can be said about the most exciting and refreshing  \\"ADULT\\" fiction in years.I never read anything light, I read the WSJ, The Economist and The Harvard Business Review. I never take the time to read anything fun. I kept reading all the reviews of this trilogy and finally broke down and bought them in this 3 book set. They arrived on a Thursday night and I started them on Friday after work. I had them all finished by 5:00 p.m. Sunday! I could not put them down. Having been born in the era of free love and benefiting from the sexual revolution, I was still missing the S&M piece. How nice to be able to vicariously experience it here in this format. This is the most fun I have had reading in a long time. I may even do it again, that is read them over....everyone should own and read this Fifty Shades trilogy. I can not wait to go to the movie(s), without my Husband.

0316228532|4.0|Another review here from someone who has actually read the whole book. And I do feel like I should offer some sort of disclaimer here- I am a huge Harry Potter fan and grew up with the books. However, Harry Potter has not blinkered my reading career, as much as I loved the books, I love other books more and am currently doing my literature degree at university. I feel like this is important to mention because whilst J.K Rowling's name drew me to the book in the first place, it is not what made me read it and not what made me enjoy it.<br /><br />Truthfully, I think the publication of The Casual Vacancy is rather brave, because this is a book that will polarize readers. It is absolutely nothing like Harry Potter and it is absolutely not for anyone under the age of 15, minimum. Readers wanting puppies, kittens and magic spells should really look elsewhere because this is grim, stark reality. It reminded me far more of Christos Tsiolkas' award winning The Slap than anything else, both books have catalyst events that pave the way for the action of the novel and changing lives of cast of characters, who share the role of protagonist. Also like The Slap, and like much of the work of many great writers, The Casual Vacancy is a form of social inquiry. Rowling is deftly weaving her story around societal issues, problems of class, politics, family, small town life and, at its very heart, human nature.<br /><br />For the first part of the book I found the rapidly changing perspectives rather confusing, simply because there were so many characters to keep track of, I found myself mentally going through a roster in order to work out exactly who was who. Of course, this did not last and by the end of the novel each character had a distinctive voice, personality and story arch that I remembered and enjoyed. At times it also verges on preachy as Rowling shows us SO many problems at once and her voice breaks through the story which is distracting and annoying, but it doesn't happenoften.<br /><br />I found it a fast read, I couldn't put it down and finished in under a day, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The book is gritty and ultimately tragic but it is also full of humour and whilst Rowling reveals her characters' abundant flaws, they are also sympathetic and relatable. They come across as real people trying to survive and live, warts and all. From smug, aspirational and distinctly Dursley-like Howard and Shirley Mollison, to humorless Kay and rebellious Fats ... these are people you will recognize. There is no immediate hero to latch onto (though my favourites were Sukhvinda, Krystal and- surprisingly- Samantha) and the reader is forced to understand the characters as three dimensional, flawed, real people.<br /><br />This book made me cry because it is real, the ultimate problem of the book is, as the author said `What do we do about Krystal?' the ultimate tragedy of the book is that embroiled in politics, small town life, self consciousness and hubris- no one does enough.  This is an honest book and it's a big issue book. It has a lot to say about the problems of our affluent societies and the human condition.<br /><br />I take my hat off to you J.K Rowling because this was an excellent book. It's not Harry Potter, it's a literary novel. People are either going to love it or hate it. It's going to get a lot of negative reviews. It's not going to change the world, it's not a masterpiece. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me feel and it made me think, and that is all I can ask for.
B008602KQI|4.0|I BOUGHT THE DVD MOVIE AND I WATCH IT. IT IS GOOD MOVIE BUT NOT FOR KIDS TO WATCH IT BECAUSE IT CONTAIN LOT OF VOILENCE AND BLOOD. ALSO SOME BAD LANGUAGES TOO!

B006IDG2T6|5.0|Sam Harris is one of my favourite authors. On this book he advocates the idea that there is no such thing as free will from a neurobiology point of view. But he also analyses philosophical perspectives on freedom. I really liked it, and I got a really good price for the kindle version!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Listened to this whole l album today and I honestly love it.  No it's not like previous albums, but I think the band would be doing themselves and their fans an injustice if they refused to allow their music to reflect their  growth and maturity.<br /><br />I have read some of the reviews and while I love the  music from Hot Fuss, Sam's Town, and Day & Age; the band has just emerged from a hiatus and I think it smart of them to treat us with an evolved sound.  I think the new album reflects the present life experiences of the band as a whole as well as the new risks that the band has decided to take.<br /><br />To be honest, I would listen to Brandon Flowers sing the alphabet song and would LOVE it, his voice is unique and I could listen to the band play Chop Sticks and LOVE it as well, cause I just think the Killers are an awesome band, plain and simple.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|We own a couple of nerf guns that my children (ages 7, 5, and 3) like to play with, but nothing over six shots.  So it's a bit of an understatement when I say they were excited to see this toy, which comes with enough hardware (well, plasticware :-) ) to shoot 24 shots once assembled.<br /><br />Assembly was fairly simple, although the instructions could have been a little clearer.  You install four batteries, snap a couple of plastic parts to the main assembly, load up and insert the 4 supplied clips, and you're ready to go.  The only tricky part is installing the plastic parts ...you need to press a couple of pieces firmly in a way that isn't really illustrated by the instructions.  But its not too difficult to figure out, and once you do, everything fits together snugly and correctly.<br /><br />The gun comes equipped with four clips/magazines, and each clip can hold six darts.  The gun itself can hold up to eight clips, and optional high capacity clips can hold up to 18 nerf darts each.  If you want to be able to shoot more darts and if your intent is to get into nerf battles with teenagers/young adults, by all means get the high capacity clips, otherwise you can buy four more clips and 24 more darts for about 15 dollars. To fire the gun, you have to hold one trigger that basically powers up the gun and pull another trigger to fire the gun.  The triggers are above/below each other, so you do it with one hand.  Once you shoot a clip empty, there is a handle on top of the gun that you pull to rotate the next clip into position.<br /><br />For its price, the nerf gun works well.  The box states that the darts will go up to 75 feet, and I find that to be pretty accurate if you angle the gun up a bit. You are not going to get reliable accuracy much past 15 or 20 feet, because the darts don't have any thing to stabilize themselves in-flight, but you can really shoot quickly, so what you lack in accuracy you can make up in volume of fire.  The \\"elite\\" nerf darts seem a little stiffer than the darts we already own, and I suspect this is to work a little better in the clips and to fly a little better.  Because the gun shoots so quickly, your children will spend much more time picking up the darts and reloading the clips into the gun than they will shooting.  However, I'm fine with that as it keeps them occupied.  :-)<br /><br />All three of my kids love this toy.  Although the gun is a little heavy and bulky, my seven year old can handle it well. My five year old girl can hold the gun, but has a little trouble working both triggers ... the trigger that shoots a dart takes a little bit strength to pull, so she needs to use a couple of fingers, and isn't able to maintain pressure on the trigger that powers the gun.  If there is a flaw in the gun, it's that there ought to be a way to set the gun so that you don't need to hold the lower trigger, short of taping it down.  I believe the reason they made it this way was to both enhance battery life - you only use power when you're holding the lower trigger - and perhaps so the gun is silent when you're hiding and waiting to ambush someone else. But it would be nice if there was a way to override that trigger.  Finally, my three year old was too small to do much other than pull the trigger to shoot while I held the gun for him, but he loved the gun, too.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun toy for your kids, or even for someone older who likes nerf toys.  While it comes equipped well enough to play, I've already ordered more 6-shot clips and darts at the request of my kids, both to be able to shoot more shots at a time and to replace some lost darts. And consult with your pets before you buy this, as this toy has the potential to really stress them out, especially if you trick out the gun so your little ones could fire 144 darts in the general direction of your furry friends whenever you're not nearby.  :-)  Five stars.little stiffer than the darts we already own, and I suspect this is to work a little better in the clips and to fly a little better.

030758836X|4.0|Overall I enjoyed this book, but honestly I wasn't really getting into it until about page 140 or so.  From there on I felt that I couldn't read fast enough and really enjoyed the story as it unfolded, with plenty of twists and turns!  I was anxiously waiting to see what equally creative ending the book held, but felt it sort of went flat and ended pretty abruptly.  True, this book is filled with psychological intrigue, but the way this ended felt far less creative than the rest of the book.  My book club is reading this book and I can't wait to hear what the rest of them think!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was excited when I was able to get my copy for the library to read the other day. We left off on book 2 with Ana and Christian getting engaged and Jack hiding to plan his revenge on them.  Book three starts out at the wedding and honeymoon but does a lot of back flashes pre-wedding days. I honestly found them a bit of a bore and annoying but, I kept on reading just knowing that it had to get better and the whole book could not be about back flashes and such.  I was correct!<br /><br />Once Ana and Christian come home from their honeymoon the back flashes are pretty much gone for the most part, or at least they are not that annoying.  Ana and Christian continue their typical relationship, he wants her to do something and she does not want to do it but eventually caves in (can we say sub here?), like the whole issue with Ana using Steele as her last name at work.<br /><br />The book follows like the others, sex, some sort of disagreement, more sex, oh throw in crazy Jack, sex, disagreement, Christian in his control-freak (which I think was called very well) in regards to Ana and her night out with Kate. He is mad that she did not follow what he want done....hey, you are not telling her the whole story as to why you have these concerns and want things done. And for Ana to find out from Kate that there is something more going on that she is aware of. ugh!<br /><br />I will admit that I was a bit in shock of Ana when they were in Aspen...who knew that she had it in her?  I know that Ray had taught her well--and she got to use it!<br /><br />Ana in her typical self, does not listen to Christian, leaves the house mad because of a 'Mrs. Robinson' thing. Ana ends up putting herself in danger and briefly freaks out Christian.<br /><br />Eventually Ana and Christian make up (yep, more hot sex again through out the book), then whole crazy Jack thing and why he was doing it was solved and they live happily ever after. I will admit that I was a bit intrigued when I was readingthe end of the book when it goes to Christian point of view and all he was thinking from the first time he met Ana at the interview up to when he leaves the hardware store. I really enjoyed reading what he was thinking, I am hoping that maybe there will be a book like that..I know a bit repeatative as it has been told from Ana view but still.  Or even better maybe a book about Kate and Elliott!<br /><br />I just could not go for a 5-star because of all the flashback at the beginning--I did not like it at all!  Besides that, I loved this book probably more than the other 2 in the series.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|Lee Child should never have released the draft. It was basically an exercise of running on and on without a thread of substance intil the end of the story. Chid is capable of a higher level of quality.
B008N9AASC|3.0|There was so little that was redeeming about what we, as humans, are doing. And what it showed about Asian and Middle-East cultures was downright creepy -- although the opening ceremony of the Olympics in China had already shown us the same thing, basically and was also rather scary. I sobbed through the sequences about the extreme cruelty to animals in factory farming (even though I'd seen similar ones before), felt deeply saddened about how inhumane we are to factory workers and to those living in poverty and how much that deadens their sensibilities. I left the theater crying, feeling that it was hopeless, that we'd inevitably destroy ourselves or, as the slant of this film seems to imply, that the masses of indoctrinated people in the East will destroy those on the West. That stood out and seemed to be a very intentional and biased agenda, despite the filmmakers saying (in interviews I read since) that it's about the flow of birth, destruction, rebirth. It was like they intend it as a warning -- or a prediction. There was hardly any of the feel-good, circle of life, spiritual aura that others seem to get from it. Instead, it's like they looked only at the beautiful filming and didn't see what the film really showed. (It was also basically the same as their previous film, Baraka, as far as I can tell. Same theme, same points, different images, although some are quite similar.)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided I wanted to read the Hunger Games before I saw the movie. So far I haven't seen the movie but I am reading the second book \\"Catching Fire\\", I'm almost done and ready to order the next book.<br /><br />I absolutely love this series and would highly recommend it. I am surprised at every turn of events, I'm usually pretty good about guessing story lines, so this is refreshing.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much so glad they to it for kindle! if ur thinking about getting it... well its awesome and free... I would totally recommend this app.
0385344333|4.0|I am writing this review on September 30, 2012 when \\"A Wanted Man\\" is number one on the New York Times list of best sellers and when 599 people expressed their opinions about this book on Amazon. I found it interesting to see that 299 of the 599 indicated that they gave the novel 4 or 5 stars, and an almost exact number, 300, gave it 3 stars or less. As the 600th reviewer, I gave the book 4 stars making the count exactly half of the reviewers liking it a lot or close to a lot.<br /><br /> I will not describe the story in this thriller because so many people have already done so and will just comment on my reactions to it. I liked it because I was drawn into the story. I didn't read it in one sitting and found myself looking forward to my next reading to see what happened to Jack Reacher and the other characters in the book. Yet, I felt all along that the story wasn't as exciting as the usual Reacher books. (I read them all.) Also Reacher wasn't using his keen observation skills as frequently as usual or reacting in a macho manner frequently as usual, and not as much seemed to be happening as usually happens in Reacher books. Nevertheless, I realized that I was comparing this volume to Lee Child's other books, and if I stop comparing this Lee Child book to Lee Child's other books, I liked it.

B006PTL1QM|5.0|Carl Jung (1875-1961) is known today as a respected psychoanalyst. His father was a protestant minister and Carl maintained a deep interest in religion, spirituality, myths, and even superstition throughout his life. He disagreed with the Sigmund Freud's theory (1856-1939) that the underlying human drive is sex. Thus, for example, Freud says that some people are unable to overcome early sexual attractions to their mother or father and he says art can be a sublimation of the sex drive. While Freud insisted on a strictly scientific study of people, Jung felt that psychoanalysts must also delve into improvable imaginative mystical and spiritual matters. One of his theories is archetypes: ideas can be transmitted from one generation to the next. This is well known. However what is not known is that Jung unprofessionally had long-lasting sexual affairs with at least two of his patients for years.<br /><br /> This 2011 film tells part of the story of Jung's affair with Sabina Spielrein. It began in 1905 and lasted for five years. The film is based on the book by the same name by John Kerr. Spielrein was 19 years old and Jung's first patient. She was ten years younger than Jung who was married. Jung at the time was impressed by the treatment method of Sigmund Freud and used it to treat Spielrein successfully.<br /><br />A serious problem with the Freud method is transference: patients develop a strong feeling of love for the doctor. Thus the author calls it a \\"dangerous method.\\" As expected, Spielrein became enamored with Jung, and Jung, who had stopped loving his wife, took advantage of Spielrein sexually. Jung met Freud in 1906 and began a friendly relationship with him until Freud learnt of Jung's misuse of his profession and sexual affair. Freud ended his relations with Jung in 1913.<br /><br /> Sabina Spielrein became a physician and a psychoanalyst, married, had two daughters, and moved to Russia. She is credited with introducing psychoanalysis to Russia. She and her husband were Jewish. Stalin murdered her husband and the Nazis killed her and her two daughters. After Spielrein left for Russia, Jung, a non-Jew, began an affair with another one of his patients who was also Jewish. Freud with whom Adler had disagreements was also Jewish. In view of Jung repeatedly taking unprofessional advantage of Jews and other acts, as well as articles he wrote during the Nazi regime in Germany in which he spoke disparagingly about Jewish psychoanalysis, there are analysts who are convinced that Jung was an anti-Semite.husband were Jewish.

B0098VYCCE|5.0|This one surprised me. I watched it for the curiosity factor. I was expecting more wooden acting from Stuart. She has a little more depth in this role. The movie it's self had some amazing special effects. I will check out a movie for that alone. As far as story and plot, it was a little shallow, but we are talking about a dark remake of a children's story. I can live with that. Don't watch this expecting an Oscar classic. This is more of a visual journey and a chance to see a mix of experienced and relative new comers in the acting world.
B007ZD17XO|1.0|Every time I tried to close out the game it would freeze up and I would have to take out the battery. Uninstalled the app. Not even worth a buck.

B004LROMWU|5.0|Excellent casting.  Subject matter is not usually my cup of tea but I'm getting hooked.  Buy the series because you can't catch everything the first time.  Recommend for those who normally don't like alien movies or series.  This one will change your mind.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I have to give this a 5 star review, because Mumford and Sons really cannot do wrong in my eyes. I know that is strong statement, but this is a band that has truly touched something in me that no other musician/band has done before.<br /><br />If you are looking for a new version of Mumford and Sons in comparison from the previous album I would have to say you will not find it. They are who they are and they do not need to change a thing. If you are like myself, and appreciate their style/lyrics then you will not be disappointed.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Love this series.  The acting is excellent...the sets and costumes reflect the era nicely.  The series has it all...sex, corruption, killing and characters I normally wouldn't like but absolutely love in this series.  Highly recommend it to those who want pure enjoyment.  NOT for children.
0120884674|3.0|Because I created them. Pieter Folkens hired me to create several of the illustrations in this book back when he was my mentor (including the original cover of the first edition when it was titled Human Osteology) in college. Never gave me credit. It was a good lesson in \\"get it in writing\\".
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Wish they had more stars!  My favorite of favorite series.  I have every season on DVD.  When I went looking for Season Four I found ridiculous prices so I once again ordered from Amazon.<br />This series has violence, sex, and content that should exclude any children from viewing.  However, the adults will thooughly enjoy it all.  Great acting...excellent story line and it always leaves you wanting more.

B008SVFX96|1.0|I've been a longtime fan of Richie and loved both his previous albums, especially his first release [[ASIN:B000001G16 Stranger in This Town]].  As much as the music on this album has the potential to be good the fact is it sounds terrible from beginning to end.  It's been compressed and limited to hell, has virtually no dynamic range (open any song you like using a wave editor and you'll see what I mean) and almost every song presents as a loud mess screaming out at you from your hi-fi.  Having just listened to Joe Bonamassa's [[ASIN:B008SOS63S Beacon Theatre: Live From New York]] I queued Aftermath and as soon as it started playing my first reaction was to jump up and reach for the volume dial to turn it down [a lot].<br /><br />It's so bad, I'd classify the album as mostly unlistenable, which is a real pity because what would've been a great album has been completely ruined by terrible production.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Why artists allow their work to be so completely and utterly butchered is beyond me.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|this group Rocks!!! Awesome by any standard, and she sings from the heart!!!!! I was blown away by them!!! This is some of the best new Blues I've reviewed and so refreshing...yet she reminds me of Janis...and I love Joplin!!

B0000793ZB|5.0|As a young kid growing up in the 80s, all I remembered about simple minds was their huge hit \\"don't you forget about me\\".  That was until recently when I stumbled upon this gem of an album while on iTunes.  I immediately bought this album and I don't regret it in the least.  I suggest you just go ahead and purchase the album and stop reading the reviews, trust me you will not be disappointed.  There are no 'filler' tracks to be found here, all tracks have something to offer.

B006QS0PF0|4.0|This story feels extremely honest.  I liked that it didn't glamorize the anorexia at all and showed just how consuming and miserable and in many ways dull it is.  I know it could be triggering to some already struggling with an ED but anything designed to raise awareness or be preventitive can be if you are sick so that can't be avoided.  I did feel like by not glamorizing it or focusing on the \\"highs\\" of the disorder and revealing all the horrible aspects of it that Portia made it a lot less triggering than it could be.  For me, personally, I got the lttlest tiny twinge of being triggered, followed by a big wallop of a reminder of how robbing, hellish and fruitless anorexia is to ultimately make this book even more of a deterrent.  It helped me to read about someone who is not viewed now as sick or crazy but who went through a version of what I did.  I also think it could help anyone who knows somebody with an ED relate and raise awareness to possibly prevent EDs.  I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone in the midst of an ED.<br /><br />I found the book to be well written. I also liked that Portia was not afraid to reveal how self obsessed and at times unlikeable someone with anorexia can be. It also made life as an actress seem a lot less glamorous than I expected, but that was interesting to me.  The book was also not overly sentimental and didn't simplify her recovery.  I did feel like in regards to her working at Ally McBeal that certain aspects were avoided.  For instance, I remember from those days how thin Calista Flockhart was and rumours and tabloids claiming that she had an ED or that because she was so thin the rest of the cast had pressure to be very thin also.  Whether any of this is true or not I don't know but I would think that since it was what was being talked about when Portia worked there that she would have at least mentioned it but she doesn't. Lara Flyn Boyle from The Practice, which is a show that Portia mentions several times was alsogetting similiar press for her extreme thiness.  None of this is mentioned though. I have an inkling this is out of respect to her castmates but it did feel as though I maybe was not getting the whole picture in regards to the influence of other actresses.<br /><br />The recovery section was much shorter and less detailed but I did feel like she attempted to describe things that helped her.  Recovery, in some ways, is a lot harder to explain and describe and attribute cause and effet to, so I understand why it was shorter.  Like a couple other reviewers, the vegan comment kind of raised alarm hairs because when I was not fully recovered from anorexia I went vegetarian and though it was partially because of ethics it also had to do with not being fully over my ED.  Portia is honest enough in the book, though, that I am going to trust that when she says her reasons for veganism are other than weight concerns to believe her.  I really like her approach to weight maintenance which involves not following a diet or considering any foods bad.  In today's culture this is pretty revolutionary.

034580404X|5.0|I didn't know whether I would enjoy these books, but on impulse bought all three...I literally could not stop reading! There were times when I couldn't wait to get off work just to go home and read!  I thoroughly enjoyed each book, and I plan to re-read each soon!
0439023521|4.0|I started reading this book because everyone was reading the series and the movie had already came out and was so highly talked about so when I was given the opportunity to read this book in my english class I jumped on it. I am not much of a reader but I love this book and it such an easy read. Reading a book that already has so much about can be hard but nothing compares to actually reading it. The author makes you feel as if you are truly in the book and part of the games. It smoothly transitions was a somewhat sad event to a true love story which can be hard to flow but I think the author did a great job at making the readers stay hooked and not confused. I highly recommend this book even if you think you know what happens it in the way it is detailed you will get much more than just what you hear. Quick and easy read but definitely worth it.
0307279189|5.0|I've recommended this book to just about everyone I know, and I'm not even a runner (nor are most the people I recommend it to). Born to run is just a plain good story. It's well written and is guaranteed to make you turn the page. I could barely put this one down and when I did all I wanted to do was run. I went out and started buying more running books, only to find there are no other running books like Born to Run. I'm wanting to read it again right now as I type this... gotta go read.
B0083EW97W|3.0|Earned a $5 credit from amazon from buying textbooks, so I used it to \\"buy\\" this John Mayer album.  Now, I'm wishing I had chosen another album.  It's okay, but no song on the album makes me wanna hit repeat.  He seems to be going through some personal issues in his life, and it shows.  But, unfortunately this album is closer to listening to a friend whine about his life than something to be inspired by.
1591841216|5.0|This was a great book written by a creative industry veteran. The words are though provoking and fun to look at (if that's even possible for a book). Loved the contents, not only what it said, but how it was laid out. If you're in creative in any way I recommend this book. If you're not in creative, buy it anyway... makes a great bathroom reader or book for your office desk. Enjoy!
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Great diet if you can tolerate eating just protein and vegetables and if you have a lot of weight to lose.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett's \\"Fall of Giants\\" entertains and enlightens through his masterful character development. He weaves the story through the upheavals in Europe in the early 20th century. The reader gets caught up immediately and led through the era by the central characters. England, Germany, Russia, Austria, and the United States are included in the dramatic events through individual characters we have been introduced to early in the saga. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this first in Follett's trilogy.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love Reacher. I love super heroes that who overcome the villain and maintain their own personal code of honor. Reacher is larger than life in every way. I am appalled that anyone would think that Tom Cruise  could fill his shoes.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Walter Isaacson agains proves his worth as a thorough and accurate biographer.  I knew little about Steve Jobs the person before reading this book, but now I feel I have an intimate knowledge of what made this very unusual genius tick.  The only negative of this book for me was the extensive verbiage dedicated to the technical workings of Apple and its products.  (I'm sure the \\"Techies\\" will love those parts the best!)  The saddest afterthought is missing out on all the wonderful innovations we would have experienced had Steve Jobs just had about another 20 years amongst us.

B008C1O8CA|1.0|So, it's the weekend before your new album, the first in 3 years, gets released. Ah, seems like the perfect time to have a huge meltdown in front of 14K people at IHeartRadio festival, and then off to rehab it is, right? Because what other way will make everyone buy into even stuff you managed to salvage from the bottom of a wastebasket, right? For an \\"unspecified substance abuse problem\\"? Well, after you've heard \\"UNO\\", you'll soon get that substance abuse really isn't the issue here. It's the lack of creativity, the running out of ideas.<br /><br />The lyrics are just the beginning:<br /><br />\\"I woke up in a pool of sweat/ my first thought was that I p---ed the bed/ Heart of stars in the midnight hour/ A kiss of death from the Eiffel Tower.\\" from \\"Fell For You\\"<br /><br />\\"Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round/ lIke a ferris wheel like it's breaking down/ drinking angel's p---, gonna crash and burn/ I just want some action so gimme my turn.\\" from \\"Nuclear Family\\"<br /><br />\\"Always f--- f---in' with my head now.\\" from \\"Let Yourself Go\\"<br /><br />\\"Kill the DJ/ hold him underwater til the motherf---er drowns.\\" from Kill the DJ<br /><br />\\"Now I'm singing out the alphabet/ averages of putting about my cigarette.\\" from \\"Angel Blue\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm wearing my heart on a noose.\\" from \\"Oh, Love\\"<br /><br />Remember that scene from Mean Girls, where Lindsay Lohan's character, in narration, talks about \\"word vomit\\"? That's exactly what this is. There's zero creativity inthe lyrics whatsoever. It's like they just took that \\"word vomit\\" concept and decided to write songs with it.<br /><br />The music is bad too, but that's a different story. Hir music has continued to be uninspired and repetitive since \\"American Idiot\\", and became even more uninspired with 21CB. here... the riffs re trite, no memorable solos whatsoever or drum licks at all.it's like they took their original formula and ran with it, puking words as they go.<br /><br />Sorry to any fans, but this album is just a wreck.is just a wreck.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|loved this game. it was challenging enough without being hard. good story and plot. kept me very entertained and it only cost. 99 cents. loved it. loved it. loved it.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|In confess, I generally think downloading games on my cell phone is a waste of space and generally not a good idea.  But I took a chance with this one mostly because of the \\"zen\\" references in another review.  I find this game stimulating.  I find myself playing in a doctors office, while waiting for a meeting, at lunch or other times when I can spend a few minutes.  There is near endless string of small puzzles to solve.  Some I solve easily, others are really challenging.  Some are just impossible.  I like the game will show you how to solve the ones that I just can't get.  This builds on my techniques that I can apply to other puzzles.  Bottom-line for me is that this game provides good mental stimulation in bite-size pieces of time that fit into well into my world.  This is the only game I recommend for my smart phone.

B005JU5JEI|5.0|The movie was funny from start to finish. The dry hump scene could have been left out. The point of the scene could have been made differently. However, the movie as a whole was funny, entertaining and Cameron Diaz was convincing and dynamite as always! Loved the movie!
0142410373|5.0|This book review is on a book named Matilda, written by Roald Dahl.  Here are some key points in the book you might want to know before you start the book. The setting of the book is in London and it is about a little named Matilda.  Matilda was born to a family that did not love or want her  Matilda is a four year old girl who taught herself how to speak at the age of 1 and read perfectly by 4. Matilda is so smart that every day when her dad goes to work and her mom plays bingo, she sneaks out to the library.  In the book, she pulls pranks on her father.  The ending of the book, I am saving for you so I don't ruin the book.<br /><br /> In the book it talks about how Matilda's parents didn't love her.  They would leave her at home while her brother, mom, and dad are all gone to do something. They called her names like not smart and a cheater because she was different than other kids. It was clear that they loved their son more than Matilda.<br /><br />Matilda loves to read.  Whenever Matilda tries to read her dad interferes and he does something mean to not let her read. Like when she was reading her dad took the book away and ripped all of the pages out of the book and called it filth and garbage. He then threw the book away. Another time was at dinner, her dad would not let her read her book after dinner and her dad made her watch the T.V so she could be more normal like other kids. So to get even, she starts pulling pranks on her father like she putting glue on his hat.<br /><br />Matilda does lots of pranks on her father.  The best prank she does is to make her dad think there is a ghost in the kitchen by putting a parrot in there fire place. Parrots repeat sounds they here. They heard the sound so they thought that there was a ghost in there kitchen.<br /><br />I really like this book  because  I felt a range of emotions.  Some parts of the book were sad, he wrote the sad parts in a funny and sad way.  Other parts of the book are funny, like when Matilda gluesher dads hat to his head .The language in the book is written in a comical way.  The setting is in London and two key words told me that and they were pounds pence.  I would recommend the book to read because it is a good book.
0525953728|4.0|I am a retired Marine. I felt that the book was very believable. I like the fact that the writer was willing to admit to his mistakes. It was an easy read even with the details it contained. I would like to see an \\"official\\" account to see where critics claim the inaccuracies the book contains are as I didn't read any scenes that I couldn't believe. And I didn't read anything that would be considered a violation of security. Barring any official contradicting book I'd say this is the go-to book for information on the raid and an interesting look at the life of a Seal.
B007SGM084|5.0|Read more than one time!! Best ever!!<br />Great for having 3 of them together!<br />Interesting book with a history that catches you and you can't let it go until you finish!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I can see why people don't like this movie, but I thought it was very good. It entertained me on a Saturday night of having nothing to do. Not Kristen Stuart's best role play, but you know... you win some you lose some.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game!!! I just wish the automatic coin return time were faster. But I get why they want you to wait, so you'll get tired of waiting and buy extra coins. #MarketingSchemes lol.<br />I downloaded the free version, so IDK if a paid version would be any better. But overall a highly addictive and fun game that brings me back to my childhood and the County Fair.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Loved this book.  Could hardly put it down.  Easy to read although a little repetitive in some places.  Not a reason to avoid reading it as I hope it provokes the reader to re-evaluate more closely what came together allowing the achievement of stunning success. Great success (or potential downfall) arises from an intermingling of many factors, not just the individual's efforts or smarts.  Many have the smarts but the misfortune of not being born at the right time in the right place.  Made me realize we mistakenly worship the \\"cult\\"of the individual's efforts without looking deeper into the timimg & circumstances that prove to be as much if not more a factor in success.
0307951529|5.0|Although I passed over the book at its $23 price point in bookstores, I was definitely intrigued enough to buy it at its new sale price. I feel like I've easily gotten my money's worth and was inspired enough to actually do the work I've been putting off for almost a year. To those that think you had to have several thousand dollars saved before embarking on this journey, I say you have no imagination and are probably not fit to run your own business anyway. Keep your 1 star rating and crappy job. I'm taking Chris' advice and running with it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its really fun though its hard to get lots of points. if you buy points though it is eaiser but the points are crazilly priced so its a rip of.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Haven't seen this in many years--I'm introducing Star Trek to my next generation--my kids.  And this was the biggest hit of all.  My 7 and 5 year old thought it just wonderful and told me to give it \\"all the stars.\\"  I couldn't agree more--the story was solid and the CHARACTERS came through loud and clear.  The humor was great--worked within character and developed them in sly ways.  And after the great visual of Spock swimming with the whales in his underwear, I love Mr. Sulu swanning around in a leather CAPE.  The next generation is safe--new Star Trek fans are born.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|This is not a ST. Vincent cd nor a pure solo Byrne effort. It is a collaboration of sorts. It is one of the best pieces of music Byrne has created in years. St. Vincent works with him effortlessly and the music is innovative yet fun. I consider this one of the better pieces of music released this year. It also shows that Byrne is still evolving as a musical presence. I would like to list individual tracks as favorites but everytime I play it I just play it all the way through. It's kind of what I did with Talking Heads 77 or More Songs about Buildings and Food. Its been awhile since I can say that about a Byrne work. For St. Vincent fans this music is something totally different for her but she shines. I wish she would have collaborated on more songs with Andrew Byrd on his recent cd . St. Vincent is a powerful music presence, I love her voice and some her compositions are awe inspiring. This cd is a must for anyone who enjoys innovative music and if fans of either of the two collaborators or of both this cd is a must have. As stated, I consider it one of the best releases of 2012.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I did not expect this.<br />How can you watch this movie and not cry...cry for the world outside of our reach that doesn't worry about their cable bills; but rather how do they maintain their own existence and the lives of their countrymen.<br />A stunning movie.<br />The world is vastly short of men like Sam.<br />This movie puts my life in perspective and makes me ashamed of myself for pitying myself over stupid things.<br />My wife and I give what we can to programs like the World Wide Food Program and others like it.<br />I hope this movie motivates you to seek out the agencies that are helping people in need of basic survival.<br />This flick should be mandatory viewing by every junior high and high school student.
0307956350|3.0|I liked &#34;The Expats.&#34; The initial premise--a former CIA operative/assassin whose husband knows nothing of her past, just as she seems to know relatively little about him--could easily be ludicrous. Pavone's understated style of writing makes this marital unlikelihood almost believable.  I found his characterization good if not exactly terrific. Mostly done through personality insight rather than appearance description, character development is woven into the thread of the story. Some readers will no doubt dislike the spareness--&#34;But what color was her dress? What kind of shoes was she wearing?&#34;--whereas others (myself included) prefer to build their own mental picture without a lot of paint-by-the-numbers details that add nothing to the plot.  &#34;The Expats&#34; isn't a superficial read. Pavone's disjointed and sometimes confusing use of flashbacks/flashforwards makes it necessary to pay attention to chapter headings, time frames, and the use of the word &#34;had&#34;, indicating past tense. He doesn't spoon feed or beat inattentive readers over the head to make sure they get the gist. Rather he allows us to draw our own conclusions--or to miss the point entirely, whichever the case may be.  If you're looking for something lightweight and undemanding of conscious thought, this one probably isn't for you.  Update, 10/29/15: Found this book laying around the house and decided to reread it (which I occasionally do with books I've enjoyed). This time I would lower the rating I gave to 3-1/2 stars. The protagonist, Kate, is written from a man's point of view. Therefore, she tends to be all over the place personality-wise. She has killed people, walked on 9-inch ledges several stories above the ground in order to break into an office, and stripped down for a backstreet gun dealer to show she wasn't wearing a wire. It's clear that she can take care of herself, and she is hard as nails. But then she goes all soft and sappy and uncharacteristically female,reverting to what the author assumes are inherent female attributes. Pavone goes overboard in trying to explain how an assassin can also be a completely normal woman--a wife and mother of two small children. But realistically, women don't change their stripes any more than men do.  The other thing--again, and as others pointed out--is the jumping back and forth between time frames. Even after a second read, when I knew the basic plot, it was confusing. I don't get the point of this sort of writing. There are better, less convoluted ways to handle flashbacks. In this case, most of the story is a flashback, a fact that sometimes gets lost in the overall shuffle. Losing the reader with weird writing techniques isn't the mark of a great read.

B00846REIS|2.0|this book had no plot.  it was all sex. I am no prude and don't mind sex in a book but I do want a plot to go along with it. the author did not tie anything up at the end of the book she left us hanging...wondering what happened to these characters, before we met them and after.  Really a waste of my time reading it.  I really kept reading it hoping it would get better, but it never did.

B0098VXE50|1.0|This was not a good movie.  I waited and waited for it to improve, never happened.  Some of the visual effects are cool, but even that gets redundant.  Theron does the best she can with what she was given.  Hot Huntsman, so a little eye candy for the ladies.  And Stewart, oh that poor girl.  I have seen her in other movies (not Twilight) where her style is appropriate for the role.  Think \\"Into The Wild\\" or \\"Adventure Land\\".  It looks like her Twilight success has pushed her into a role that is beyond her abilities.  I do not recommend.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|Well, it's still a Jack Reacher story.  It starts slowly and builds well, but the resolution is lacking.  In the last quarter of the book, when the action heats up, the whole thing just falls apart.  None of the \\"answers\\" make much sense and don't seem to present a compelling rationale for the action.  Reacher is a great character and he deserves a better playground than this.  Of course you're going to read it, but you're not going to love it.

B005X7HAAS|3.0|This is your typical organized crime film where competing families play &#34;King of the Hill.&#34; You get the feeling of deja vu when you watch it.<br /><br />It includes, paid off cops, hits, drugs, prostitution, betrayals and an odd scene where they force the ambassador of Ghana to open a casino in his embassy. This film doesn't bring anything new to the table, except the Japanese &#34;honorably&#34; cut off their own finger rather than have someone else do it to them. With the film being run of the mill crime action, the English subtitles was a big negative as it was apparent they were lazy and didn't translate everything.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, token sex and nude scene.

B000HL093A|5.0|This is a movie I'd been wanting to see for a while, but my local movie place never had it.  I'm pretty sure somebody stole it.  ;P  Anyway, I finally got around to watching it, and I was not disappointed.  It's got two of my favorite actors, Woody Harrelson and Robert Downey Jr., along with Juliette Lewis(not to mention a cameo by the one and only Rodney Dangerfield).  Woody and Juliette are traveling across the country while going on a killing spree, and becoming famous in the process.  It's wonderful metaphor for the media, and in a way, I feel it predicted the reality TV boom we're living in.  Honestly, I sometimes think producers are purposely putting crap on the air just to see what people are willing to watch.  Scary as it sounds, the idea of mass murderers becoming celebrities doesn't seem that far-fetched to me.<br /><br />This is a very 90s movie.  If you don't know what that means, I'm not sure how to explain it.  It just has that nineties feel to it, the same way 80s movies have a certain feel to them.  But it's not conventional in any sense.  The movie plays out in a very surreal, almost psychedelic way.  It's visceral and intense, a nonstop assault on the senses.  It's two hours long, but I can't say I ever felt bored while watching it.<br /><br />I loved this movie, but I don't kid myself into thinking it's for everyone.  Some people will be turned off by the violence.  Others might think it's too weird or too long.  Other than that, I can't find much to criticize.  If you're a fan of movies like Fight Club or Clockwork Orange, you'll definitely want to see Natural Born Killers.

0316228532|5.0|I never write reviews, but I feel like I need to comment. All those that said \\" I read the sample, and this is what I thought....\\" I say \\"Sit down and shut up.\\" Nothing sounds more stupid, oh except \\" I hate the price.\\" If you are going to write a review  worth reading I would like to hear that you stuck with it until the end.<br /><br /> ****Spoilers***<br /> I admit I had no real interest in the topic of the book and only read it because of the author. The first chapter or two were a bit of work to wade through. I was afraid in advance I would't be able to keep track of the many characters and their story lines, on the contrary, they stuck with me. The first time I put the book down for the night, I thought \\" I wonder what these people are really up to?\\" So, I stuck with it. I kind of forced myself to think that this is what real life was like in the other houses on Privet dr while the HP 3 were going about saving the world.  Not to say that JK hasn't earned the right to write about whatever she damn well pleases.<br /> It was the writing style that held me in.I loved the dialogue and the nitty gritty details of the characters lives. ( I kept waiting for Barry's dirty secret to be revealed but he came out clean. I still suspect he was Krystal's father. ) I loved how it laid bare how all the self absorbed people never really lifted a finger to help anyone. The whole book turns out to be a very scathing social commentary. I also enjoyed the fact that no one's story line ended predictably, they were all saints and sinners. Isn't that the truth of most of us? We see  the boy walking by the river, but we are all to busy to stop. The two people who might actually help , Barry and Kay either die or are reprimanded. I loved it. These character's will stick with me, real, greedy, bored, tired, lazy and not fully blossomed. I will think of them and what their  future holds. ( I am pretty sure Andrew will not live to regret Shirley taking his epi pen.)<br />So please put Potter out of your brain and dive in. This book stands alone. It's gritty, it's real , and yes I did she'd a tear or to at the end.
B005LAII6M|3.0|This film was clearly designed with a video game in mind. The first two minutes of the film summarizes all the films that you may have missed: Virus, bad mutants. Alice, good mutant. And something about the red queen.<br /><br />In our video game, your main character (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in a strange location wearing a skimpy towel. There will be a nude patch that you can download for the game that the manufacturer will swear it had nothing to do with. You then have 2 minutes to find your clothes and escape during a computer failure, one that is poorly designed and defaults to open the door and return your clothes. Once outside you will need to quickly locate weapons and kill low level mutants to level up. You are then forced to return to the facility. Here you team up with someone (Bingbing Li) who looks like Tifa Lockhart (FF VII). You gather as may weapons as you can. Make sure to take extra to arm any future new members of your party.<br /><br />You now have 2 hours to escape the underground area, by passing through models of various cities. You kill mutants for points and save humans who you can add to your party while you go to the rendezvous location to meet up with your rescue squad. Due to the cloning nature of the facility you can meet up with people from previous films who couldn't possibly be here. The film ends at a point where we can have a CG sequel and video game.<br /><br />Parental Guide: I don't recall any F-bombs, although don't hold me to that. No sex. No nudity, but skimpy outfits.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|It's hard as hell to review instrumental albums, but the music of Ludovico Einaudi is so good that decency demands I throw a few roses in his direction. I bought UNA MATTINA on a whim, and it made me an instant fan. It's seldom that I've heard a piece of music which is so evocative - not only emotionally but visually, creating vivid images within my mind. From the opening notes of the eponymous title track, through to its twelve minute climax, I am transported into a mood so atmospheric it almost becomes a place, and let me tell you, that place is one I want to visit often.<br /><br />UNA MATTINA has thirteen tracks which total one hour and nine minutes of total music, and while there are no losers in the bunch, some songs speak to me more than others. \\"Ora\\" has a slightly classical feel, while \\"Resta con me\\" is all romantic melancholy (as is \\"Dolce Droga\\"). \\"A fuoco\\" broods beautifully, summoning up images of a man in a firelit study looking out at snow covered fields in blue twilight (that at any rate is what I see in my head when this song plays). \\"Nuvole bianche\\" is poignent and passionate at once, demonstrating Einaudi's ability to strike several emotional notes at the same time, while the last track, \\"Ancora\\", is a musical journey which unifies all the themes touched on throughout the album.  As is usually the case with Einaudi's work, the moods dealt with on UNA MATTINA are not happy ones, but redolent of brooding, thoughtful, romantic, melancholy, or instrospective states of mind, occasionally ringing out with intensities of sustained emotion. Einaudi occasionally uses a violin or other instrument to add layers or depth to a piece, but in most cases it simply isn't necessary. The man is living proof of what a piano can do with the right fingers at the keys. Granted the music is pretty specific in terms of the emotional notes it is trying to hit, but there's nothing wrong with specificity - many a great singer or musician has made a career out of striking those notes again and again, and Einaudi is truly a master at what he does. For anyone who hasn't yet heard his work, I'd strongly recommend either this album or the equally lovely DIVENIRE. You won't be disappointed.se notes again and again, and Einaudi is truly a master at what he does.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is an interesting book in spite of the graphic sex content. There is an underlying theme that becomes more and more apparent as you progress through the book, elevating this book from porn to a reasonably good story. Not nearly as good as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
030758836X|4.0|You cannot say a lot about this book without giving away the plot, but I will say I enjoyed it.  I have the opportunity to teach teenagers on accession and when the subject of relationships comes up I usually share that any two people can be happy with each other; just some couples will require a lot more work than others to maintain that happiness.  Gone Girl breaks down a relationship that the two involved did not really get to know each other before jumping into marriage.  Plus the workload to maintain it ends up being incredible.<br /><br />As for the basic plot, I liked the story but found the details a little to far fetched to be believable.  No one with that psychopathy would be able to maintain that long-term of a front without their true character bleeding through the edges.  Specifically they would eventually breakdown and be found out by the masses.  Now I agree they could get away with it once, but not several successive times over many years, especially when the number of people who really know who they are increase.<br /><br />That aside it was a good story and the writing was solid.  Well worth the read and easy to see why it is the it book of the season.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book a lot. It made me cry, laugh, think, angry... basically every emotion that Charlie was feeling, I felt. It was a really good book for me to put things in my life into perspective. I loved that it was written in a diary format. I also loved the fact that I felt like I was the main character. Every heartbreak, confusing time, or happy moment, I felt like I was there.
B008220DIC|1.0|Sitting through this film was painful. Other reviewers seem to want to decipher the film, psychoanalyze it. If I wanted to do that I'd say the characters in the film are all manifestations of The Master. Or that it was a dream, a nightmare. But really, besides Joaquin Phoenix's performance, it was the most boring, painful film ever. The sound track made me uneasy throughout the film. I was thrilled to finally, after an overlong film, be allowed to leave the theater. I checked my watch after the first half, thinking maybe I'd just leave, but stayed thinking that it must be almost over. Sadly, it wasn't. The hyped \\"thinly veiled take on Scientology\\" was a no-show. The movie was so incoherent, it was hard to tell what it was about.

B004BSWC8A|5.0|A Meryl Streep movie is always a good bet and this one just proves that there is probably nothing that she can't do. Kevin Bacon has been a consistently \\"good\\" bad guy in several movies and this one is no exception. There is also good chemistry between the two of them as their relationship changes. David Strathairn and John C. Reilly are also dependable actors who give solid supporting performances. This is an enjoyable movie with a solid story, directing and acting.

Quiet was an interesting foray into the inner world of the introvert. The book challenges the premium that our culture puts upon extroversion, dissects theories of personality, and ends with a section that guides introverts through navigating situations more suited to extroverted characteristics, dialoging with extroverts, and raising introverted children.<br />Overall, the book was fascinating. I talked about it enough that I already have a fellow introvert ready for me to hand it over, so she can read it as well. As an introvert, I found the range of topics within the  chapters sometimes frustrating. As an introvert who likes to stop and reflect, it should come as no surprise that there were moments  of frustration because I was just settling into a topic when the chapter would end and an entirely new angle of introversion would be examined. And a few times I felt like Cain was stretching the research just a bit to make her point, but these slips were forgivable.<br /><br />At the same time that the frequently shifting topics was at times tiresome, I have to give Cain credit for not repeating herself like some non-fiction works do. This isn't one of those books that runs on for 150 pages circling around a vapid observation that could have been made in 30 pages. Each chapter brings fresh discoveries. Her hypothesis that our culture has swapped personality for character is thought provoking, and the studies that bring to light the ways in which group work manipulates our perceptions of right and wrong were downright unsettling. Her book is culturally relevant as she hypothesizes the role that extroverted leaders, who remained unchecked by introverted colleagues, played in the recent stock market crash. And any introvert who reads part four of the book, \\"how to love, how to work,\\" is sure to pick up some insight about how to approach career and relationships in with a healthier and more balanced approach.<br /><br />Note: This book was provided by Waterbrook/Multnomah's Blogging for Books program in exchange for my honest review.
0061537969|5.0|Okay, keep your box of tissues nearby when you read this book-- for the tears of laughter as well as for the tears of sadness. Without doubt, you'll experience an unforgettable emotional ride. And be sure you can read it at a time you won't be disturbed, because you're gonna want to read it straight on through! Yes, I'm a dog lover, but I think even cat lovers can appreciate the simple wisdom and graciousness of this wonderful book. Read it!
B007UW9VWO|4.0|I love the way this movie was shot.  Beautiful cinematography, soothing music.  It's easy to see the passion and dedication of Jiro and the entire team.<br /><br />The English translation, though, is absolutely shameful.  11 minutes into the film, critic Yamamoto is talking about how nothing has changed with Jiro compared to years ago.  He says \\"30 years ago\\" but the English subtitles show \\"40 years ago\\".  My Japanese isn't perfect but there have been many places where the translator took liberties.<br /><br />The translation for the fish nomenclature is also laughable.  \\"中トロ\\" or \\"Chu-toro\\" is translated as \\"medium tuna\\" while \\"大トロ\\" or \\"o-toro\\" is translated as \\"fatty tuna\\".  Well, they are both fatty tuna, just different levels of fattiness...  \\"車エビ\\" or \\"kuruma-ebi\\" is translated as \\"wheel shrimp\\" but it's more commonly known as Japanese tiger prawn.  \\"平目\\" or \\"hirame\\" is translated as \\"halibut\\", even though the fish is a left-eyed flounder while halibuts are right-eyed...  The translator simply doesn't know his/her seafood!  This is completely disrespectful in a film focused on telling the story of the subject being a perfectionist.<br /><br />SIGH...
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Solid account of the raid.  Otherwise a tired collection of already told stories and shameful political digs.  Expect more from our nations best warriors.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|I get tired during these epic adventure novels, and in this one, there are too many violent and bloody episodes. I did love the philosophy the author imparts, but he doesn't learn the lessons he's imparting. Maybe that will come in the sequel that is sure to come. I won't be reading it.
6304698623|1.0|My 3 girls and I just enjoyed reading the book and so I thought it would be nice to see the movie. I was a big fan of the Shirley Temple movie as a child, but thought I would try the more modern movie.  This movie lacked heart.  It did not hold true to the book regarding Sarah's interaction and behovior (mainly in her treatment of others.  the book emphasized \\"treating others as a princess would treat them\\" i.e. being gracious even to those who are not gracious to us). The many vain uses of \\"God\\" and \\"Lord\\" were not appreciated either as I highly doubt that language would have been used so loosely in the early 1900's.  I suppose that the movie might have had redeeming elements (I did enjoy the actress who portrayed Miss Minchim), but I thought that the casting of the lead girl was awful.  There were a few moments where she was tolerable, but mostly her lines were said slowly and the same way as the line before it.  I will be renting the old Shirley Temple version soon!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is awesome got it for xbox 360 and it was good I wish you could craft in creative mode.
0756407125|5.0|After listening to the first orthe Kingkiller books on tape, I decided to read the second one. Both books are amazing and I highly recommend them. As for the vendor, I had prompt shipping which enabled me to keep the story going without missing a beat. I really like this book and damn I wish the last one was out already. If I had one negative thing to say it is that the main character is pretty shamelessly lame in the real-time aspect. I suppose the reader is supposed to feel sorry for him, but I only feel that he is retarded.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this game is cute my baby sister loves it. It dissolve so so so so so so so so so so so awesome.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can finally pin and view pinterest on my kindle!  I have never been so happy to see a free app before.  thank you!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It appears to be refreshingly honest and straightforward. A rare commodity nowadays - especially when our military and national defense has become so politicized. Most thinking people suspected the \\"official version\\" of how the Bin Laden raid went down was incomplete or not accurate. This book shows that sentiment to be true and the self deprecating tone of the author lends credence to its authenticity.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|The totally fabulous last season on this DVD set builds toward a credible [and deserving] end for the title character.  Understandably and thankfully, the writers throttled back on the usual off-the-wall twists and turns that often stretched and tested credibility.  Most of the series' dangling threads were aptly addressed and the series brought to a fitting and upbeat/satisfying close.  The out-takes, commentary, and special features added even more value to this boxed mutli-DVD set.  Betty now can rule in perpetuity.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|it was fun until it crashed my whole kindle i cant even play it now totally uninstalling it sux now  booo
B000FBJHEO|1.0|This \\"book\\" is little more than a movie script in book form.  It's obviously an attempt or pitch to have it produced as a movie which would be more lucrative than actual book sales.  I quit reading it about half way through and am doubtful that I would even watch the resulting movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a wonderful alarm clock. Since they fixed the digital clock problem it's been smooth sailing. Alarms are easy to set. You have a choice of alarm sounds. I love the little weather notice.  I purchased the. .99&cent; package and it was worth it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very good.  Maybe just a bit to much \\"Id die for him\\" stuff but other than that it is a really good book
B000QRIGLC|5.0|If ever there were men who deserved to have their story told, it is the men in this book. I'm positive my jaw was hanging open almost the whole time I was reading.  If you are an American this book should be required reading.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down i got my kindle Monday and finished this book on Friday<br /><br />I liked this book because the action never really ended the suspense was killing me when something was about to happen<br /><br />Thumbs way up to this book... cant wait to start catching fire
B0087HT36U|5.0|5 stars! A lot of fun! I really really really really really really do enjoy playing this game all of the time.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Angry Birds-inspired or not, I and my daughters (10 and 12 yo) thoroughly enjoyed this game.  It didn't require a tremendous amount of skill, nor was it a piece of cake.  Some of the levels were particularly challenging, but&mdash;again&mdash;not a Herculean labor.<br /><br />Nice game.
B004LROUNG|5.0|It has been a little while since I read Grisham but after reading this title I want more.  This book has just the right amount of humor to go along with Legal.  Once again Grisham does an outstanding job of getting you into the characters and the plot so you don't want to put it down.  Must read!!!!
076790592X|3.0|Life is full of questions. Unfortunately we rarely ask them. And if we ever do, we never seem to ask the right person.<br /><br />Tuesdays with Morrie is a modest book with a simple story and a simple message. Many years after graduating college, Mitch Albom reconnects with his favorite university professor Morrie Schwartz. Morrie is unashamedly up in age with the effects of ALS slowing overcoming his body. Mitch spends every Tuesday he can with the professor. They share many laughs and tears.<br /><br />It is a very simple read. Something you can probably knock out over the weekend. It probably will not change your life, but it will definitely spark some hope in mankind and make you want to find some old guy to talk to.
B005LAII7G|3.0|It's an action comic come to life - so set your standards accordingly. A dystopic and overpopulated future looks like an urban [[ASIN:B000IZXR7U Mad Max]], with high-rise fiefdoms controlled by criminal warlords. Struggling at some semblance of order, the police force takes the form of Judges:  investigator, jury, and executioner all in one. It certainly streamlines the case-load, even if today's notion of \\"due process\\" goes out the window. It also makes for some serious excitement when a mega-aparment building turns out to be the armed stronghold of a major criminal enterprise. But, no problem is too tough for Dredd and his rookie sidekick. Let the shoot-em-up begin.<br /><br />This carries remarkable echoes of another recent action [[ASIN:B008XFAT7S flick]], where the police battle their way to the top of a gang-controlled tower despite treason within their own ranks. The tower even had similar (and somewhat improbable) architecture. The gatling guns were new, tough. Despite startling similarities, this is its own creature. If bloody and brutal heroics suit you, give it a shot.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Best fighting movie I've seen in a long time. All the acting was great. Great story, almost cried at the end. Great movie!
B008TMA1LY|3.0|it's. ok. moves a little fast for young ones,  but they seem to catch on pretty quickly. you know how kids like hello Kitty.
B0085MNZ66|4.0|This puzzle game starts out fairly simple and gets progressively more difficult.  First you have to understand the color wheel and know the primary colors.  From there you just have to think and plan ahead before you move.<br /><br />People who can not figure out the basics need to go back to elementary school for a refresher course.<br /><br />Ok but I would not have paid for it.
0316228532|2.0|Just like banging your head against a brick wall, it's wonderful when it's over.<br /><br />Gripping and full of biting social comment. But also full of miserable people behaving horribly. I kept hoping there'd be something redeeming. There wasn't.<br /><br />Really depressing book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good read! I hope the political agenda in Washington gets over themselves. They (actor Obama and cast) did allow movie producers access before the author did, if all recall!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I first saw this game on a friends phone. She seemed to like it very much, so I decided that i would purchase it for my Kindle and it is much easier to play on the Kindle than the phone. I like it really well.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I knew this album would be amazing when they announced they were getting back together... After not releasing a album in years, they certainly did not disappoint!
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Great movie, really enjoyable scenes. Mainly though....to everyone complaining that there were no indicators that this was an animated movie....I say this..OPEN YOUR EYES. The cover is drawn, the artwork on the back is drawn. PETER WELLER...he's on the History channel now...which means there is no way he would be in a live action of Batman. Oh and for those that don't like pictures..only words can direct their noggin... as you scroll down this items listing page and see product description Format: Animated, Full Screen, NTSC, Widescreen...big as day for you. So please don't whine and complain in a review section for a really well done conversion of the graphic novel. If when you realize what you in error purchased was not what you thought, go back and look the page over and make sure it wasn't just you who overlooked blindingly obvious indicators of this being an animated movie.<br />Fans of Miller, Batman, etc...buy this it's a great lil movie
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great on the Fire! Such a freaking fun app and its the first app I play when I turn on my kindle. A must have!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Wonderfully written.  Cannot stop reading--have to find out what happens next.  This brutal fantasy is more palatable than the brutal political war we're suffering in real life.
B008RJFRTK|5.0|Best product ever! Very happy with the bang for my buck! I have download multiple maps world wide for countries that I visited in the past and directions set for locations of the future(God Willing). If you want a map of the world that is pretty on point with getting you from point A to B with little or no effort, download/purchase this product.

8408104926|5.0|My daughther wanted this after seeing one locally.  She does not stop coming to me to show me the amazing world record info in this book. Interesting info... you can go ahead and buy it with no doubt.  You will enjoy...
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This story attempts to take on a huge scope (the Muslim tradition, the Christian tradition, and even the traditions of an oasis in the desert) and actually succeeds in intermingling the various notions of faith, to arrive at a general rule of the universe.  Even if the author is not correct, you want his notion of the universe to be correct, because he envisions a kind and loving universe that is centered on human endeavor. If you were ever unsure if you should pursue your dream this is the book for you.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it. A lot Like 50 shades but I still really enjoyed reading it  I can't wait for the next 1 to come out.
0525953728|5.0|This is a great book and very well written. I started reading on a week night when I had to work the next day, decided after the first few pages that wouldn't work. Laid it down and started on weekend and finished in two days. Great book! Thanks for writing
B009GENZ12|4.0|Atmospheric and clever, this movie was not what I expected. To her credit, Jessica Biel does a fine job delivering her most layered role to date. One particular scene weakened the story, delving too deeply into social commentary and discarding the momentum leading up to that point. Just the same, this is worth a rental on a cold, rainy night.
B003N0XDT4|3.0|I really enjoyed listening to my DT770 Pros (80 ohm) with the E7 attached both to my iMac and iPhone.  Then, it stopped being recognized by my iMac as an audio out device (I checked the system settings several times, performed several computer reboots, tried it on a Windows desktop, and prayed a little) but no luck.  It also wouldn't charge anymore (I made sure those unit settings were good too since you can turn off charging from the unit's settings).  After the initial charge was depleted from iPhone listening (it did last quite a while...A+ for good battery life), it became a really good looking paperweight.  Before it had died completely, I tried a new USB cable, reset the unit, checked the company's website for help, and offered a few more prayers to the electronics gods but still no joy.  NOTE:  I did notice upon unboxing that the packaging (very Apple-like) wasn't shrink wrapped, and there were finger prints all over the screen film; therefore,  I'm thinking my \\"new\\" unit may have been someone else's return.  Bummer!  That said, I returned the unit but plan to buy another.  I'm hopeful I just got a bad unit.  It happens.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|OMG! I feel like I've been pranked by the reviewers that said this was the best thing since sex was discovered. It's like they got suckered into paying good money for it, why not share the misery! I will have to gouge out my eyes with a rusty nail after seeing this...I deserve the kick in the testicles my wife will give me when she sees I wasted the money to buy this thing. What was it that I just spent $14.95 hard earned McBucks to watch? The `faux' reviewers that have conspired to trick people into getting this thing (you notice that you can only buy it and NOT rent it) should have at least handed out some lubrication when they tore your ticket in half and kicked you in the arse as you went into the virtual theatre. I saw the hype in the trailers when this was coming out and thought, \\"Alright! another in the Alien saga!\\", but now that it has been excreted and I have actually watched this, I feel like I need a lobotomy to forget I ever saw it, and a shot to prevent infection from the excrement. If they offered negative stars I would have, out of a sense of respect for Sigourney Weaver, given it a -10. This waste of film was awful in the extreme. Someone thought it was a good idea to toss a few million dollars down the toilet in the middle of the worst recession in history. I would recommend the geniuses behind this flop go blow their cash on some film making classes. Even Charlize Theron, as hot as she is, could not resuscitate this dead turd. Bet she never tells her friends she was even in this one. Probably says it's her retarded twin-sister or something; anything or anyone but her!<br /><br />Please, please, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! You have been warned!!!...I do not know what planet the other reviewers were on that said it was good, let alone great, but they were out there. Either that or they were smoking some heavy stuff to think that this thing deserves to be included in Alien cannon. I mean, I can't even begin to say anything redeeming about this film. ... Oh wait, the opening scenery was nice, and the alien that commits Hara-Kiri was a nice touch; other than that, total crap.Oh wait, the opening scenery was nice, and the alien that commits Hara-Kiri was a nice touch; other than that, total crap.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My husband and I love this calculator.  The memory feature is extremely convenient. The ability to delete numbers without clearing your work is helpful for people that aren't the best with touch screens.
0345803485|2.0|The ending of the book was predictable and the subject matter was so repetitive that it became boring.  The same expressions were used over and over and there was no substance to the story.
B0037VNX44|5.0|Tom Hardy is one of the best actors of our time. This is a tour de force performance. He is psycho, charismatic, funny, clever and totally over the top in this role. Loved it!!!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This season was awesome, i cant wait for season 5 to be released, americaz so lucky to be able to start seeing the first few episodez already.
B009329ZF2|4.0|We enjoyed Battleship -- one of the few action movies we didn't go to see.  It was full of fun action.  However, it was a bit confusing.  Spoiler here --  The crew inside the field was able to move quite a bit, but the movie never explained how the field got so large or why other ships were excluded.<br /><br />A good use of WWII veterans made that part of the movie more enjoyable!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Excellent movie one of the best. Batman a super hero of the old time y es una de mis peliculas favoritas se las recomiendo
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Having a great deal of respect for any individual who endures, excells, perseveres and succeeds at becoming a special forces operator, I was eager to read \\"No Easy Day.\\" The book was interesting and easy to read. It manages to provide the reader with an insider's view of what it takes to become an elite warrior as well as how the actual UBL mission was accomplished. The author succeeded at doing both without necessarily revealing tactics or other confidential details. The one thing that completely turned me off were the political references. I couldn't help but lose some respect for the author and the \\"teams.\\" A team has a leader, and in the case of the SEAL Team 6 or any other special forces team, that leader is the Commander in Chief. Despite this, however, I do recommend \\"No Easy Day\\" to anyone interested in learning about a truly historical event.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This was a great movie. It was nice to see some of the more action actors come together to do this movie. I am looking forward to seeing The Expendables 2.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|A good book.  slow at first but transforms into a real page turner. cannot wait buy the next book in the series
B000RLHDUM|5.0|If you don't enjoy this movie, you don't appreciate the good life and the plot to \\"have it all\\"! Pierce plays an amazing character in this film that shows why not eat your cake and have it too! World travel, the luxury life, hot chicks, mystery- this movie has it all!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I, like most people, was expecting very much from this book.  After reading it, I found it to be nothing short of what I expected: EXCELLENT in all facets!<br /><br />From the opening pages to it's spell binding conclusion, it is a page turner. I especially liked the personal background that was provided on the writer, and just how demanding and tough their jobs are. You can watch on TV on how difficult it is to complete BUD/s, read the many books that cover this topic as well, but I believe this book takes SEAL life to a differnt level: it puts you in the foot steps of not only BUD/s training, and being deployed to a hostile environment, but more importantly, from a personal, human perspective. Additionally, it portrays these men as being human, not super human, with feeling just like the rest of us.<br /><br />I think the vast majority of why people buy this book is to learn what REALLY happened on the night of the OBL raid, and not the government's accounting, but a first hand account told by the person who WAS THERE, and the personal toll on the men and women who tracked OBL and planned the raid. This book delivers!<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Owen, and thank you for your service to our country!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I have wanted to see this movie since it came out.  I was a bit disappointed.  The story line was refreshing because it was different than any I have seen or read but it was missing substance, too many holes to fill.  Overall it was watchable but not that good.
0525953728|5.0|On the edge of your seat reading. It gives you this Elite Seals history leading up to one of the biggest capture/kills in Americas history of war on terror.
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers is a beautiful novel about Victoria, a foster child that has been passed home to home, unable to be placed with a family.  When she turns 18, she is emancipated from the group home she currently stays and is forced into a world where she needs to take care of herself and live on her own.  The only skill she has is knowing the language of flowers, a Victorian era form of unspoken communication delivered through the special meanings of flowers.  Her life takes a big turn when she meets a florist who hires her on at her shop and continues to change when she meets a mysterious flower vendor at the local market.<br /><br />  This book is written in an impeccably beautiful way.  The flow of the words and style is magical and musical; perfection on a page.  Not only is the style of writing beautiful, but so is the story; it tells the difficult life of a child in the foster care system, finding love, losing it, and forgiveness.<br /><br />  Victoria is such an incredibly strong character, and she is like a flower herself, only a bud at first, then slowly opening herself up letting a select few slip past the wall she keeps herself guarded behind.  She has a lot of ups and downs throughout the book, and you ride the emotional roller coaster right along side her.  The author words keep you pulled into the world of this book and you feel every emotion the characters do; my heart ached so much for Victoria as i read her story and her challenges.<br /><br />  Flowers have a big place in Victoria's life, since she is not very good with people, she find she can communicate what she wants to say to them with flowers, whether they understand it or not.  They have so much meaning for her and I really enjoyed learning the meanings behind the different flowers in the book.  This story was very original and lovely.<br /><br />Emotional, exquisite, heart-breaking, hopeful, simply marvelous!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have to say, I think this book may be one of my all time favorites. I read it twice in a week. I was so scared I read it so quickly the first time, I had to read it again to make sure I didn't miss ANYTHING!! I couldn't put it down!! I cried, I laughed out loud, I got angry, I was an emotinal wreck most of the book (please don't let that stop you from reading!! I quite enjoy being emotional during a book!!). I looove looove loove these characters, and I cannot wait for Walking Disaster (from the main guys POV). You will not be disappointed in this book!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of my favorite movies of this year or any year. I'm really not a huge action movie fan but this one won me over with the engaging characters, fun special effects, heart and most of all HUMOR!<br />I've seen the darn thing three times and I will watch it many more to come. To me that's the mark if a truly great film. It can sweep you away time after time.  And now I'm off to have some schwarma.
B009329ZF2|1.0|super predictable, crappy action, story line is been done over and over and over. get real and do yourself a favor, don't watch that stupid flick.
0756405890|5.0|One of the more unique books you will ever read. Once you get the feel for the book, you will not be able to put it down. I just finished the 2nd book and am sad that I will have to wait for the third. Kvothe is one of the most likable characters in all the books I've read. Patrick makes you feel like you know him personally. Great story, will def be reading it again in the future.
B009329Y30|4.0|Is this a chick flick?  Of course.  Is it slightly cheesy or over dramatic at times?  Of course it is, but I still found it to be an enjoyable movie overall.  I have to say I was a bit surprised by Zac Efron in this movie.  I think he did a good job and so did Taylor Schilling.  In the end I would recommend the movie to others.
0142419400|5.0|So what can I say about Anna and the French Kiss?  It was absolutely, brilliantly, marvelously AMAZING!!  I am so glad I lsitened to all of the bloggers who raved about this book because it is simply wonderwul.  I am definitely a fan of Stephanie Perkins now and will most likely read everything she publishes.<br />There are so many things that make this book great.  One thing is how realistic and relatable it is.  I'm reading this whole book thinking \\"Wow I have definitely been there before.\\"  The story is real, tbe place is real, the characters are real.  I feel like I really know these characters and I could tell you about them as if they were someone I've known for quite some time.  They may be fictional characters, but they have very real personalities.<br /><br />Mmmm, St. Clair.  I was drooling over this boy from the first time Anna met him.  He has certainly become a new favorite book boyfriend.  He may even be #1!  Edward Cullen can suck it!  And how great was Anna?  Awesomely so.  Her freak outs, excitement, meltdowns, everything was put perfectly on the page.<br /><br />The descriptions of Paris are lovely, and though I have been to France, I didn't get the chance to see Paris.  It is a beautiful country and the author portays Paris beautifully.  I have to make sure I get to go back and visit Paris.  There have been books that have made me giggle here and there, but this book has me laughing so foten.  It was such a fun read and I look forward to her other novels.  This story will remind you of what it's like to fall in love.<br /><br />Fabulous characters, wonderful story, humorous, playful writing, MUST READ!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a nice app to have when you don't have a physical Bible to hold. the only thing I don't like about it is that on some versions of the Bible you have to be connected to wi-fi in order to access it.

0312641893|5.0|The main thing I have to say about this book is I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!  I was very excited about it from the beginning.  The cover is what initially drew my interest, and then I read the synopsis and thought it would be a very unique retelling of Cinderella.  Sometimes I can be a bit skeptical of a book when it uses known characters or retellings of stories, but this book was fantastic!  The only bad thing I can really say is that I am disappointed I have to wait a year for the next one!<br /><br />I didn't want to put this book down the entire time I had it, and when I was at work, I couldn't wait to go on break or get home to read more of it, so it definitely held my attention quite well.  Being a retelling, you mostly know how the story is going to go, so a lot of it you can figure out or expect, but there is also plenty that doesn't go exactly the way you think it is going to.<br /><br />Meyer does a wonderful job at invoking your emotions through out the novel.  There are characters you love, some you hate profusely, and there are funny parts with witty android comments and heartbreaking situations.<br /><br />Cinder was a strong character and I felt bad for her because of how she was treated.  Cyborg are nothing but property to most of the people and are not looked at as human, but she still stands for what she believes is right.  Prince Kai could come to my mechanic shop (if I had one) anytime he wanted!  He doesn't come on strongly and there is not insta-love between the two of them.  There are a couple of points where he acted a bit immaturely, but considering the situations, many guys probably would have, too.  Adri made my blood boil through out the book, she is certainly a character you love to hate!<br /><br />The story it self is very interesting and unique way to retell the Cinderella story and I can't wait until I get to read the rest of the series, and my mouth is watering just wishing for the next book!  This book is a highly recommended read!!  I don't give out 5 star ratings easily, but giving this one a 4.5 just wouldn't have been good enough!<br /><br />Unique, emotionally evocative, leaves you yearning for more!!I don't give out 5 star ratings easily, but giving this one a 4.5 just wouldn't have been good enough!<br /><br />Unique, emotionally evocative, leaves you yearning for more!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|Great songs good quality the lumineers are the coolest. They have a nice mix of slow songs with fast ones that really enhance the musical experience for the listener.
B001U3ZMHW|5.0|My son got this for his 9th birthday and he loved it.  He spent several days putting it together and it is very impressive. I did buy some lego platforms to build them on so they would be more stable.  Sometimes the pieces can break apart when played with but that seems to be pretty typical of legos in general.  Overall, really nice set.
B00846REIS|5.0|The book was good. After reading 50 Shades, took me a little longer to get into it, but I did finish and book was good.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I never considered myself an admirer of the whole Fantasy genre. There was always a fine line I would never cross over. However, I think I have stumbled onto something very special with A Game of Thrones and the whole A Song of Ice and Fire series. I was pleasantly surprised with this work. Never have I read a book where the chapters are separated into individual characters points of view, centered around that one character and their whole environment-it was very refreshing and brilliant of the author.<br /><br />I have found a little patience is asked of the potential reader when first entering the world of the Seven Kingdoms. The separate chapters and introductions of key characters may seem never ending, but with some interest and an open &#34;trusting&#34; mind follow Mr. Martin into his ever growing epic. However, if you find yourself completely lost with keeping which characters are &#34;direwolf&#34;, &#34;lion&#34;, or &#34;stag&#34;--flip to the back of the books and discover complete lists of houses, families, alliances, brief descriptions (believe me it will serve the new reader well to reintroduce themselves after finishing one book and moving onto the next).<br /><br />In A Game of Thrones, I overall adored the plot and was fascinated with the research that paid homage to medieval elements: the weapons, clothing, feudal system, battle scenes, war tactics, geography etc. It all just flowed beautifully where you believed you entered into a realistic world with minute touches of whimsy. On the note of &#34;whimsy&#34;, I am happy, relieved and thankful to report to any interested readers that there were no to a few clich&eacute; fantasy characters/species. A Game of Thrones (as well as the whole series) is full of betrayal, adventure, drama, mystery, and classic revenge. I found myself gasping when thrilling and dismal surprises touched heroes and villains alike. Throughout the novel(s) the evidence of &#34;grey&#34; characters was an unexpected change from the usual light and dark personalities.<br /><br />The reader will also find that Mr. Martin has a talent to capture and bottle the element of foreshadowing (every &#34;symbol&#34; has a meaning that will resurface with a flash and a boom as the reader progresses into the ever growing plot). I must also note that, it has also come to my attention that Mr. Martin has based his brilliant series on actual history or to more specific the Wars of the Roses and possibly even pulls events and pieces from the hardly mentioned Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War- this creates interest, curiosity for many more topics and events to be explored by any potential reader (you will love History again).<br /><br />The only part(s) in this book (and series) that keeps it becoming a solid 5 star rating (for me) are the graphic sex sections and modern vulgar language. At first, I tried to remember history/ancient beliefs, human conditioning from the Medieval stand point and the warped entertainment expectations of today (sadly, sex sells). All of the needless scenes and language all seemed to sum back to something that unfortunately had to be there to push the realism and sell the product. Realism and product marketing aside, I must confess after awhile the graphic scenes and cussing (that seemed to come out of nowhere) started to wear on me and I desperately wished them gone from my vivid imagination. All negative aspects aside, I am very happy I stumbled upon this series and highly recommend for those readers who wish to escape from the stereotype of &#34;fantasy&#34;.<br /><br />reviewed January 2011, review written 2011personalities.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a really fun game and addict too. The more you play the more you wanna to accomplish. Its a pretty cool game specially is you love the ice age movies.
0061726834|5.0|This is a wonderfully fresh kind of book to read.  This is an idea I have never seen before and couldn't wait to read.  Love a disease? Immensely original!  The world in this book is so ugly; people who are cured make it seem so great, and for a long time Lena thought it was great, too, until she learned the truth and saw how ugly the world she lived in was.<br /><br />The author does such a great job with her words.  The descriptions are fantastic and the reader for the audiobook version I listened to did an absolutely wonderful job bringing the book to life as she performed it.  I loved how Lena changed so much from the beginning to the end.  She was so much different by the end of the book; love certainly does change you.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more from Alex, though.  For some reason I didn't connect with him as well.  He just wasn't the dreamy book boyfriend I was hoping he would turn out to be.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about people on the covers of my books, but this one was a great cover and I loved the colors, which make me think of spring.  I like the cover for Pandemonium even more and it reminds me of the fall.  There was a couple of twists in the story, and I can't wait to see the outcome of them!  The writing of this novel swallows you up and keep you glued to the same place for a while and you feel so much emotion right alongside Lena.  My heart hurt at so many points in this book and others made me angry and others made me smile.  It was up, down, up, down.<br /><br />Rollercoaster of feelings, wonderful description, unique plot, didn't connect to the main male character.
0938045768|5.0|I was so eager to read on once i got to the six main moves, the way everything was explained and the progressions that were in the steps were great. It gave me alot of knowledge without being to technical.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|I am enjoying this game!  It's really amazing that this kind of game can work on a Kindle fire, and even tho it's NOT grand theft auto, it's a good clone and it has some of the fun that you can find in GTA!
B0085MNZ66|2.0|Looks like it would be a fun game to try, unfortunately it won't run on my RAZR.<br /><br />I enjoy puzzle games, so I tried to play but all I get is an immediate shutdown after the initial splash screen.  Please fix and I'll try it again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great time killer. The coins regenerate fast enough to keep me interested. The app works well on my kindle and the graphics are good.
B008E88TZ8|5.0|\\"The Innkeepers\\" is not an over-the-top, beat-you-over-the-head horror movie. There's not much blood, and no gore. It's just a terrific psychological thriller with a droll sense of humor and two very likable protagonists. If you like an old-fashioned ghost story, this might be the movie for you.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book!  It was really good and my heart hurt for the world Katniss lives in.  It is such a horrible place if you live in the districts.  The districts are dingy, starving, and so life-draining for the most part, where as the Capitol is shiny and colorful.  Because of the rebellion from 74 years ago, the children of these districts are the ones having to pay the price for an ongoing punishment by the Capitol.  The Hunger Games are nightmarish and grueling.  This story is intense and there is few places in it that lack interest, if any.<br />Katniss was a great character, and you could feel her fear, but her bravery also at the different places in the book.  She is definitely a survivor!  Peeta is a very likeable character also and has a charming personality.  I loved Cinna and his calmness.  Between the movie and the book, Cinna is my favorite character transported to the screen.  Lenny Kravitz made an excellent Cinna, so cool and collected.<br /><br />There is so much I can't wait to see what happens for the next installment of this series, and also the next movie won't get here fast enough!  The author's writing is very straight and to the point, and the descriptions were great, especially at the hallucinations when she thought green pus was oozing everywhere (which still may or may not have happened).  This part may be weird, but did they not used the restroom the whole time they were in the arena?  I know it isn't necessary to do a whole potty-scene, but there wasn't even a mention of it.  If I didn't have so many other books I needed to read this instant, Catching Fire would be the next one in my hand.<br /><br />Action-packed, un-put-downable, great characters, great descriptions
0984183523|5.0|Victor's new book is simply an extraordinary supplement to the rest of his high quality products (LOMS, Resume Toolkit, etc). He takes a simplistic approach to solving the complexity of the case interview process and outlines a few frameworks that can easily be customized and molded to almost any scenario. I have been relying on his materials as I prepare for my upcoming interviews with Deloitte.<br /><br />If you prefer to study for your case interview by reading a book then this is a must-read. I believe that it is a good supplement to his LOMS program as it gives you a good base. All in all, practice is what makes you perfect so I would read through his book as quickly as possible and then get to practicing/reading cases ASAP.
B008XG1X18|1.0|What is a great program on the computer and decent app on my Android phone, downloaded from Google Play falls extremly short while trying to download it to my Android Tablet.  I don't believe a FREE app should require you to have any form of pmt loaded! Credit Card nor gift card... people just want to download and be able to use FREE apps as intended! Fix the bugs that won't even allow me to get past the popup stating my payment was not available.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great book- thought provoking as all of Mitch Albom's books. Hard to put down.  Something everyone would be able to relate to.
B00993FEUK|5.0|What a great movie. This film reminded me of the kid horror films of the 80s. Movies like monsters squad and lost boys. It also has a goonies and ET feel as well. Of course most people are going to be freaked out because there are curse words and real scares just like the movies I grew up on(rewatch some of your favorite 80s kids movies you will be surprised at the level of violence and curse words that was in a lot of them). The movie is more for older kids if you have a 12 year old nephew he is probably going to love it. I took my 6 year old and she was scared during a few scenes, especially towards the end of the movie but she also really enjoyed the movie. The film has a strong anti bullying theme throughout as well as a diversity is good theme, which will probably make certain segments of the population uncomfortable. Also there is a gay character so if you are homophobic you should probably skip the film. Also for film geeks without kids I would highly recommend the movie as you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of it as well. Overall a great movie and I can't wait to check out the Blu Ray, hopefully it is full of making of featurettes. This will be great, along with A nightmare before Christmas, and Monster House for a good Halloween animated marathon.
B004YM6JP0|3.0|First of all, I gotta say that I feel terrible for giving such an amazing show 3 stars but hopefully anyone looking at the 3rd season of the show is quite familiar and possible own the first 2 seasons already, and you know the quality of the show and are really hooked to it.<br />Just before I get to the not so good part, I would like to say that The Vampire Diaries is pure entertainment, if there is one network show that can put cable shows to shame is this, writers know how to keep a 22 episode season really compelling; there are almost no fillers and there is always something happening. To manage to do this for the third year in a row, is just AMAZING!<br /><br />With that said, now to the part why I gave this a 3 star review. In simple words this package is awful. First, why on earth did WB studios thought that giving a tv show a DVD-Blu ray combo pack edition was a good idea? I get it for movies coz you can squeeze the DVD version along with the digital copy or some extras not in HD, plus a movie is usually a 1 to 3 disc edition. But, for a tv show is a whole different story! 9 discs on that package is just too much, the pin that holds the disc trays seems to be at its limit with 9 discs.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that it doesn't make any sense, there are no new extras on the DVD versions to justify packaging them with the blu ray discs. And, think about this, if you own a blu ray player is because you have an HD tv and you want to make the most of it; then you start purchasing your movies/shows on blu ray whenever you want to watch them on HD quality; based on that, why a customer interested on the blu-ray version would ever feel the need for the DVD version? why would they feel torn between each of those editions? On the other hand, if you do not own a blu-ray player and you want the DVD edition, why would you feel the need for the blu-ray? and if you do have a blu-ray player but for whatever reason you want the DVDs, again why would you need the blu-ray discs? To me, it just doesn't make any sense! They should have the usual DVD only edition, and a Blu-ray only one; let the consumer decide which one they want coz I really doubt anyone would want to watch episode 1 on a blu-ray and episode 2 on the DVD. On the aesthetic side, this set also looks weird next to the slimmer blu-ray only editions for the first 2 seasons.<br /><br />As a fan of the show I purchased it to support it and show the studio they can make a profit out of it so hopefully we will get many more seasons of this awesome show, but I gotta say, I am extremely unsatisfied with the packaging for this edition and if I could boycott it without also hurting the show, I would.ay discs?

B004MC8CA2|4.0|great app.. really is useful to keep track of scriptures and how they relate to today's everyday life and trials or tribulations you might be going through. a definite easy read and love the sharing capabilities. Just wish there was a function to print.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I don't do reviews. for this one I got interested by the fact that the dev did restrain himself, and actually seems interested in his game, not my info, iap or ads.<br />The game itself is cute, somewhat simple (at least as far as I've gotten. Personally I don't see the need for a tutorial, but would see no harm in one either.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|What a great film. This will become a Christmas classic that gets played on tv at Christmas time for decades. It is a shame it did not do better at the American box office as this film is a classic. Me and my daughter have been waiting impatiently for this to come out on Blu Ray ever since we saw it last November in the theater. If you are looking for a new Christmas classic to enjoy with your family and make apart of your family tradition, then look no further.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. It is a little more pricey now but for a good reason. They added a soda and new levles. It is really fun and addictive. Some people are saying the controls dont work in higher levles but I am not having that problem on my kindle.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|With the recent addition of the ability to display Print Replica Kindle titles in the Kindle Reader for Android app this app has become substantially more useful for reading text books.<br />The lack of the 'Collections' feature in Kindle reader for Android is a pity though.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|A lot of narrative presented as a story. This story seems to drag in some areas for this reason. I was hoping for more action and that was my reason for the disappointment. I am sure many will find it entertaining. I found myself looking forward to the end of the book just so I could say I had finished. I purchased the second book in the series in hope the story would pick up, but it hasn't.

B0053O89JM|5.0|As a physician House is the only Doctor show that I can tolerate because they have been attentive to the detail of pronouncing the terms correctly by the cast and making the technical detail accurate.  I don't watch the show every week, but buy the entire year in whole at a time in August.  I then can watch only the show, not the fluff, and see if I can get to the correct diagnosis before House.  Haven't missed yet in 8 years.  I must compliment the writers on the final episode script.  And an elegant ending to an intensely real and honest doctor show.  Well done!<br /><br />PeterJ5
B008X9Z37A|2.0|This case is not the best choice.  I had a Belkin product for my previous Kindle Fire, that was much better than this one.  The photos don't show that this version does not have an elastic strap to hold the case closed, or more importantly open, when trying to hold the device with one hand.  I fixed that with some elastic and fabric glue - but had I known this in advance, it would have had me looking for an alternative. Other reviewers have noted that this design will not stand up on its own.  Bottom line, it's just barely adequate to protect your Kindle, but lacks some key/important features.

B00932HEX2|4.0|Whoever is responsible for casting the actors in this series deserves high praise. Everyone is pitch perfect -- including the supporting characters. There's a defining moment about half-way through the season that literally put my jaw on the floor. Oh yes, they went there. One of my new favorite shows!
1781161097|4.0|Not too many words here... the author more or less lets the pictures do the talking.  Ridley Scott did write an intro... a nice long one... so that was probably the best thing about it.  Fantastic behind the scenes artwork behind the phenomenal movie.  This is one of those books that I knew... if I didn't get it now, I'd be looking for it in the years to come.  Why wait?  I got mine now.  Huge inspiration for artists in general, even if you didn't like the film.  I'm an ALIEN junkie... so it's a no-brainer.  Lent it to my dad... he's checking it out now as I write this!  LOL

B008JIWNYG|4.0|Bought this in large part because of the work of Doug Mahnke.  The guy is a great artist and storyteller.  The story was pretty good...  Hal Jordan has been kicked out of the Green Lantern Corps, and he's been replaced by his nemesis... Sinestro!  The only thing I didn't like was Mahnke didn't illustrate the last issue, and the artist that did has a style so dissimilar, that it made reading the book jarring at the end.<br /><br />Bought this on my Kindle FIRE.  Looking forward to the next volume.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is a must read! For active military,veterans and civilians!! Thank you men and women in uniform. Your sacrifices are not in vain!
B006G2NVCA|4.0|I bought this after paying close attention to the sound during the movie. After the amazing job they did on The Social Network, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross did an even better one on this! Impressive ability to manipulate the listener/viewer's emotional state by the use of sound and music. Close your eyes, immerse yourself in it, and you will find yourself feeling cold, claustrophobic, tense, depending on where you are in the album. That does not mean it is not enjoyable as pure music in itself. Superbly crafted sonically, an audiophile album to be enjoyed in certain moods, hopefully with a fire burning and a drink :)<br />The only reason I knocked off a star is that it seems a rather long and almost laborious affair the way it is structured. It is meant to be heard in its entirety, and as such it may be a bit much. Maybe I don't have the musical and emotional stamina I once had, so your impression may vary.<br />That little gripe aside, a great album and definitely recommended.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This review is more for the whole series and not just for this one season. I just finished watching the latest episode, which is now on season 9. The entire time I watched this episode with my wife I was drying tears from her face, along with having us both laughing five minutes later and then having her crying again a couple minutes after that. This series has been like that since the beginning, well the first season was really great but I don't think I remember it being really sad, more introducing the characters and making you fall in love with them.<br />  Through this series you will lose characters and have new ones come in, which first I was against. I got invested in these characters and started caring enough about these characters and their distinct personalities that I had made up my mind that when new characters came in that I would never care for them the way I care about the originals. Don't get me wrong there are quite a few original characters that are still in the series at season 9, but I have grown to love each and every character that the show brings in. If you are reading this debating on whether this is a series worth getting into, I would definitely recommend it to anyone that would enjoy an intense hospital character driven drama and I know that my wife would definitely agree with me seeing that I can't get her attention when the show is on.

B008LZHA3G|1.0|Bob Dylan's greatness lay in the fact that he could write great poetry and put it to great music, and then sing it in a great, idiosyncratic voice.<br /><br />Nowadays, the voice is shot to hell, and sounds as bad on record as it has done live for the past decade or two. In the doldrum years of the 80's, his output was at an all-time low - uninspired music with embarrassing lyrics. With Oh Mercy, he picked the pieces up again, and managed to produce some excellent albums, but for the past 10 years or so, he has been mired completely in old Americana. And it is getting ooooold. \\"Oh God, not *again*!\\" was my first thought on hearing this album. Not only is it getting terribly old, but simply recreating the old Americana sounds is intrinsically old in itself. There is nothing really new or creative in it. The same old chord progressions, the same old rhythm accompaniment. It is time to lose it, Bob! (Together with that *awful* mustache! Pleeease?)<br /><br />A breakdown of my impressions:<br /><br />Duquesne Whistle - Another standard old swing tune. Compared with the rest of the record, actually one of the most inspired ones, with a passable effort by the band. But still - it's just more of the same old, same old. 3/5<br /><br />Soon After Midnight - Laid-back ballad. The slow tempo at least has the advantage of not putting to much stress on Bob's voice, and without the growling it can actually be called singing to some extent. Still, nothing new here. 3/5<br /><br />Narrow Way - Standard R'n'B rocker. Musically, nothing we haven't heard a thousand times before. Passable. 3/5<br /><br />Long And Wasted Years - Less of a song than poetry recited over a musical background. Music that is repetitive and uninspired, to boot. This is about where the album begins to grate. 2/5<br /><br />Pay In Blood - I defy anyone to decipher the first words without looking the lyrics up on the net - that is how bad Bob's voice is nowadays. A steady rocker, but again - nothing we haven't heard a million times before. Speed it up a bit, and it's a carbon copy of Maybe Someday. 3/5<br /><br />Scarlet Town - Another interminable drag. No real melody, just following the chords progressions note for note. Just drags on and on and on... 2/5<br /><br />Early Roman Kings - And yet another R'n'B slow rocker, following the standard A1 formula. Boring. 2/5<br /><br />Tin Angel - The worst of the lot. Not only is it an interminable drag, the music can hardly even be called music. Just the same extremely basic, monotonous lick being repeated over and over and over... Gaaah! Stop it! I'll confess to anything! Just make it stop! 1/5<br /><br />Tempest - This might sound unbelievable, but after the monotony of Tin Angel, Tempest actually feels like a relief. However, the cheesy lyrics destroy everything. A totally pointless 14 minutes of your life drag endlessly by listening to this. 1/5<br /><br />Roll On John - Cheesy tribute to John Lennon. This is the kind of poetry we all wrote in high school, thinking it extremely poignant and moving. \\"Shine your light. You burned so bright.\\" Come oooon! *sigh* 1/5<br /><br />With the earlier albums, I could at least find one or two songs that I actually like listening to (Workingman's Blues, Spirit On the Water...). On this album, there is nothing I will ever return to.<br /><br />There, I said it. Cue flaming in three, two, one...

B0083GPDBO|4.0|This was a really good movie because of the point the writers were trying to make. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Nuff said
B00948EPOQ|5.0|I've seen this movie before but I decided to purchase it.  It takes me back to the romance of traveling and to the Gatsby era.
B006LSZECO|5.0|best ending ever. this book was a modern day hitchcock meets edgar allen poe. it is that good. this story will be remembered as a classic.it's like the movie &#34;gaslight&#34;  but more complex with deep character study. i bet it goes to screen. i loved the way it was written.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|This game is fun for all, graphics awesome, and solid gameplay. Although, it becomes very difficult and the file size is rather large.<br /><br />* 2 start deduction for too difficult and file size excessive.<br /><br />** I do recommend this application.<br /><br />*** Test device: Kindle Fire.
0316228532|4.0|The author is a keen observer of the human heart and human interactions.  JK brings us inside character's minds to hear the stories they tell themselves. The characters' inner fiction then drives the myriad of tragic-comedic events in the book.  This is fascinating and believable literature.<br /><br />This book could not be further from Harry Potter's charming evocation of hope and delight.  One faint echo of HP is many character's Dursley-esqe complacency.  The characters' focus on benefiting only themselves parallels their lack of concern over the pain they cause.<br /><br />Almost every character transmits their pain onto the others.  One exception transmits her pain back onto herself by \\"cutting\\".  I hoped in vain for healing or renewal.  Altruism apparently died with Barry Fairbrother and church / redemption is apparently fully outmoded.  I am grateful that we are left with the potential for selfless action in a future beyond the timeline of the book.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Poorly written. Not worth your time. Also Flow of the movie was very choppy. The actors? Honestly I feel had nothing to work with.
