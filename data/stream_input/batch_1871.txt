B008RC72G8|5.0|I am a old fan of dark shadows watching it after school the soaps johnny depp was wonderfull and play this part to my expectations comedy was good to liven it up some
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I like the album very much.  She is very talented.  I like down loading songs.  The price was great. OK
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was good, a little slow in the middle with a great ending. I would recommend it to anyone.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|They have changed it and have made it better. It is very durable and easy to use the canteen and the aluminum cup. They made it so you can fold the handles away from the cup when you put it in the fire and it makes it a lot easier to get away from the fire as well. It is a lot better than the small dinky things they had on the side before they changed its design. It may seem light and breakable at first but it is actually pretty unbreakable. I am very impressed with how durable it is and how light it is, you barely notice it is there.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Use it at work to rate the different areas for wifi signal!  Easy to use, easy to understand the app.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Lots of description, lots of technical stuff about boat parts, not too much action.  I am interested to see how this was turned into a movie.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|We had high hopes because we LOVE Despicable Me, but the musical numbers in the Lorax were almost all disappointing or annoying.  Not at all the same appeal to adults that Despicable Me has.  The story, animation, voices, etc, were all great, but the music killed it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Unless you are in the medical field, a lot of it would go over your head, otherwise there were parts that were very interesting.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I just received this bag for Christmas, but it is exactly what I'd wanted.  It is currently holding my two DSLR, 3 lenses, one point and shoot and all of my books, cables, etc., and with room to spare.  It just looks like a simple backpack so I'm not a huge mugging target when on vacation.  And it's very comfortable to wear.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I received the most awesome gift of the Kendle Fire for Christmas, and I have ordered a cover for it thru Amazon, and I think it's awesome that it will be here by friday! I am sooooooo excited that it will be here so quickly!!
0446554995|5.0|Couldn't put this one down.  I waited a long time for this concluding book, but it was worth the wait.
B00284BNKC|5.0|Darren Arofnovsky really knows how to draw you into his world.You'll cringe, try to look away, laugh but more than anything sympathize with the characters in a way usually reserved for long novels.It gets really Deep, real she uncomfortable at times but worth it...so worth it
B003O86FMW|5.0|A marvelous Machiavellian anti-war dystopic epic geared for young readers since at times it almost reads like a video game.  The action is strong, the brutality is numbing, the plot twists are endless and page turning but at the end of the entire trilogy the message is just as simple as it can be: war is inane in all regards and &#34;we the people&#34; are responsible for both starting and stopping it.
B002KKCVX2|5.0|I found these sandals to be very comfortable, perfect fit, too!  True to size, I recommend them for anyone needing sandals.
0547884591|4.0|I bought the hardcover and returned it. I just don't have space for it. But I intend to by the ebook version the next time I need it. Covers a lot of ground.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best app that involve s running better than temple run and has more charecters then temple run. so I love this app :)
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Thor was great except for the corny scenes in the desert but it was an enjoyable movie experience as well.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I like this book  its good. The paper back copy is bad though. I want to read the rest. Yeah
B006O5XYWG|3.0|i thought it would have been a continuation of the series but it really wasn't. I expected more but will have to wait,
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is an amazing writer. He has inspired me to write books; and this book has inspired me even more.<br />It's a beautiful story, it had me in tears. When it ended, I screamed of sadness.<br /><br />Keep it up, John, you're great. <3
B0068TJLSY|2.0|didn't really like this one at all. it was boring and very unexciting to me and I fell asleep on it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best trilogy ever!!!<br />Read this awesome trilogy to all of y'all.<br />Love Niki Prass<br />The hunger games diva<br />Read it
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|Another Transformer movie that was fantastic. Full of action that never ended, full of fights and after all full of robotic cars...a must see.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I like it so far I want to continue reading. I wish that there was a fourth book coming out soon
B005LS5M2M|5.0|this sci- fi thriller really took me somewhere. I loved it and watch it over and over. a must see...
B005COO1X6|3.0|So it was a good story, pretty intense while it lasted. But I'm a little disappointed with the length. Just got my kindle for Xmas and this was the 1st book I read on it. I'm just used to reading longer books by this author.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|the help was good but slow running for me. the movie requires my re watching it again and who knows!
0399160450|5.0|Tom Clancy and his co-author have outdone themselves with this all too possible thriller about cyber warfare.  The action is non-stop, the characters at their very best, and the plot just too frighteningly possible in our world.  It's a great read and a warning about our place in the world.
034580404X|5.0|Nice collectors packaging. This item made a great gift for the wife; she was totally smitten by the trilogy. .
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is a very well done dark-centered animated version of the Frank Miller comic.  It is a great compaion piece to the latest movie and does a very good job of presenting the &#34;comeback&#34; of the Dark Knight.  The voice casting is superb becasue all of the voice actors are well chosen with Peter Weller (of Robocop fame) leading the list doing a great job of making Batman come to life.  I can't wait for Part 2.  Highly recommended.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I purchased this CD for my sister at Christmas. She was so happy and almost lost it when she opened it. I personally don't listen to Kelly C but anything my sister loves I'm sure is a good product and has good music.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|What can you expect of a free book. Story intact, however. A quick read, with delightful albeit archaic turns of phrase.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I bought this for my sister for her birthday a couple of years ago. Who doesn't love Nora Jones? She has such a great voice and her lyrics are something you can relate to!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I absolutely love Harry Bosch books and have been reading them for 20 years. These short stories are fun to read if you don't want to invest time in a full fledged novel.
B008J34466|5.0|I love pink! I actually have tickets to go see her in concert in early March 2013. Even though I bought this for my sister for Christmas, I'm sure I'll be borrowing it very soon!!
B008LY9AWG|4.0|These stories are fun reading for the Michael Connelly fan. He always writes a great read and these certainly deliver.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|There's nothing better than Rent. I think the first time I heard this musical Soundrack was when I was a freshman in college, many years ago, on a road trip with some close girl friends. This quickly became a top hit on my list as I literally ran out the CD of this music. This movie is possibly the best &#34;adaptations&#34; of a Broadway musical I've ever seen! La Vie Bohème!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It's up only show some the timeline.  I don't get any notification.  But look good but when you scroll drop to old status they are in different format and can't comment or like
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book it was such a great read.  You know it's a great read when your crying in the carpool pickup line.  I passed this book on to my two girls to read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 8yr old loves this game, very easy for her to play it, gives her enough just enough reading to make it a learning game too.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a great read, it may take about the first 50 pages to reel you in. But once in your in, you're going to feel like your in the arena. \\" let the hunger games begin\\"
1577314808|5.0|This is one of my favorite books! I must say that it is one of those books that you have to be ready for since it creates awareness of how powerful your mind is and that you have the conscious choice to choose how you see and feel about life. Some people find it hard to let go of negative patterns even if they are destructive in there lives. I recommend reading the book more than once!
B008A1TIOK|5.0|Vivaldi's Four Seasons is a familiar classical score; however, this all new work goes far beyond just an arrangement.  While at times it pays homage to the original, Mr. Richter's work inspires on it's own merits.  It's enjoyable listening that will be enjoyed many times over.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I struggled to finish this awful book....it was so disappointing. Eva was weak and Gideon insanely non communicative. Their spats seemed redundant and their emotional roller coaster of a relationship extremely contrived. AWEFUL!!!!!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|It's like apples to apples with pictures and fun with the whole family and friends!!! If your artsy you'll love it
B00004RHZU|5.0|Best debut CD.  P!nk is amazing and this cd shows great early work! More R&B than anything. Great! Great! Great,
B00ARAO720|4.0|Not your typical \\"action\\" movie but I enjoyed it a lot. No explosions or super special effects, but Gordon-Levitt delivers another good performance.  It may not be your cup of tea but give it a shot if you're in the mood to roll the dice.  Definitely a worthwhile rental.
B002ZG97LK|4.0|Great price, good movie. My neice wanted this movie since last year. She loved it. I have never watched the new one, but I am sure it is as good as the org. Fast delivery. Would rec. it
B0093COK4S|5.0|the product its so perfect...and its on time.....I like it so much......and all the songs of the cd was so enjoy to hear it
B009VB97EY|5.0|Love this movie, but bought it for a Christmas present. Price was great and the stores were sold out. I would buy this movie again - hopefully for myself next time.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This singer is really gifted. Love all his songs. I LOVE TO WATCH HIM PERFORM, you never know what to expect.
B0092QITO2|1.0|There's a lot of reviews here, so I will be short. You get interested at the beginning, the scenery is grand. Then, you start getting tired and bored. Around one hour and 45 minutes into movie you can't wait for it to end. My advice: rent the original created by great Paul Verhoeven with Arnold and Sharon Stone. That one you will really enjoy.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because It inspires me to never give up and to keep chasing my dreams. Justin inspires me.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much, the storyline was intriguing  &<br />I felt the pull of pain  & sorrow for all the people caught up in a trap in which they find themselves incapable of doing anything<br />to help themselves.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|The movie might be good I'll have to rent it from Netflix & find out. I had to stop the movie. When I tried to finish watching the movie & find I have to pay again. I thought I had 48 hr to watch it. As I check again it says &#34;You have 30 days to complete watching this 48-hour rental.&#34; Not cool!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game deleted all my data! this game ducks. I'm sorry foozle for giving u one star cuz of subway surfers
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. Great story. Easy to read. Grabs your attention from the beginning. Katniss is a great heroine.  The movie pales in comparison.
B007US9NA8|5.0|I love the book!  It was in great shape and on top of that I got it in the mail alot sooner than I expected
B007V65R54|3.0|It is not very helpful for me. But it does reveal something. I haven't finished it yet though. I am looking for sth more academic.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|If you love Beatles songs you will love the way they are portrayed in this awesome love story musical. Even my musical hating husband was in awe of this movie. It mixes music, love, and all the issues of the late 60s. Just trust me on this when I say this movie is totally worth the watch.
B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|The storyline was contrived and did not flow properly.  Other than the action/fight scenes the movie was not very good.
B008KOTNVA|3.0|First off I want to say that the selection and quality of the bits and driver in this set are great. Upon delivery I immediately used it to disassemble a wireless xbox 360 controller and had no issues.<br /><br />I had to remove two stars due to the terrible build quality of the case. The lid on my particular set refuses to stay closed and instead pops open despite my attempts to fix it. The lid isn't really that bad of a problem but the cheap white plastic on the inside is. Instead of opting for a more secure storage method ifixit has instead simply molded the thin plastic so each blue piece rests on top. Note that it is completely impossible to remove a bit without first picking up the blue piece. The holes in the blue pieces are also drilled completely through causing bits to sometimes slip through. The lid issue combined with the loose blue pieces make me think that if this set ever slipped your desk bits would go everywhere.<br /><br />For almost $30 I would hope for slightly more secure storage for my bits but I guess you get what you pay for.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is such a great book to read. It is hard to put down and Suzanne Collins knows how to keep the reader going. I read this book in just a few days!! I couldn't stop and went right to the next one!
B005KA188S|5.0|My daughter asked for this for Christmas and was very happy with it.  I could not find it in stores.  She was very happy with it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book continues with Suzanna Collins great works! She keeps the reader hanging on and you can never guess what will happen next. The details that she puts into this book are very detailed and it is almost like you can picture what is happening right before you or around you.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|Fabulous pilot but I thought  my $2.99 was paying for the entire season, not jus t one episode of streaming<br />, and it keeps prompting me for another payment when I try to move on to the next episode.  What's with that? Mighty expensive, Amazon prime.  An rethinking my subscription
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanna Collins does it yet again with her final book in the Hunger Games. Keeping readers on the pages, wanting to find out what is happening, if want you think will happen, will or if she will throw another wonderful twist at you that you can't see coming until you read it! I love her as an author and within just 2 and a half weeks I have completed all 3 hunger game books! Amazing reads!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book. I read this in one day because I could not put it down. I cried, I laughed and I was excited. This book is one that you will not be quick to forget and this is a book you will talk about with your friends. This is also one you will recommend to others to read. Ms. Hoover did such an excellent job at making you feel each character and what they were going thru. You will feel every emotion from love to extreme hate. You will cry and you will laugh. You will be amazed at the power of love, fath, hope and forgiveness. I wish every woman can have a Holden in their life -myself included. I wish every young girl and every adult woman can exude the strength of Sky. This is a must read. I promise you will be amazed at the story, the characters and how the author portrayed this storey.
B00080DIWE|5.0|Didn't realize from the product description that this came with two separate model stands. (The reviews implied that). Both are excellent for anyone that does models regularly. It spins easily, but doesn't go spinning around when you don't want it to. Highly recommend buying an extra package of the alligator clips for it though. It does come with some, but you can never have too many of those!<br /><br />The one not pictured has a wire bracket frame that goes up inside the body of a model car to hold it up for spray painting. Very happy with this product, considering ordering a second one.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I got this for my 11 yr old and she hasn't stopped listening to it since Christmas Morning! I would strongly recommend this if your daughter is as big a fan as mine!
B008MM9630|4.0|This game is fun, but its a little slow to develop qwithout spending real money on it, and I'm loathe to do that. Otherwise enjoyable
B000092WD8|1.0|This is a scam...Now, they will take it back with no refund of shipping costs (which were more than the DVD itself). It should be stated in large print that this will only work in EU. I have never heard of regional coding for DVDs...am I the only one? My kids were very disappointed that Santa gave them a non-working movie!
1601251831|5.0|I've bought all three of the pathfinder Beastiary's. So I'll keep it short.<br />It does exactly what it says it does, perfectly well, beautifully illustrated, and creatively.<br /><br />It's got 100s of Monsters or strange races, all drawn well, stated and with smallish blurbs. In a perfect world each of these would be 1000s of pages long with 10 pages or more per entry. Sadly that'd cost 100s of Dollars per and isn't realistic.<br /><br />All three Bestiary's are great.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This novel was anything but a disaster. Travis is a perfect alpha-male, possessive, and protective male but only for Abby, a girl who hides her true self from everyone except from her best friend America. The story made me laugh numerous times, it made me cry numerous times, and it made my want to throw my kindle against the wall because of the situations Abby and Travis were put in were so surreal. Truly a great novel from beginning to end with awesome character development and novel plot
B001F0WXY0|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I've read it 100s of times in my life. It's like an old friend. There is so much written ABOUT Dune that mere reviews can't really do it justice. So I'll just add myself to the number of people that love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Have you ever felt like so much was being thrown at you that you weren't able to move much less breathe? The simple notion of letting air in and out of your lungs was so difficult that it was hopeless? Once Dean Holden comes into Sky's life she's faced with lots of moments where hopelessness fills her every cell and yet she is still able to move on and come out stronger than what she was at the beginning. The reality of life is that you have to live it and in order to do that you sometimes have to face things that aren't pleasant and overcome them, otherwise it's like living life without air: hopeless.<br /><br />A great novel by Colleen Hoover. I would and will recommend it to everyone because it honestly does give you hope
1601252463|5.0|Nice addition to the core book, gives you new classes and new things for the old ones. The art is great and the information presented matches the art in ways that can really inspire and make you want to play what you see there. Not THAT one, but YOUR version of one.<br /><br />Great book, well worth the money.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|this was my son's big thing on his list this year and we can't get it to work!  bullets get jammed almost every shot.  I will trade it in for another one and give it one more shot - because my son really wants it to work.  If that doesn't work, we will move back to the good old nerf guns that are this house's favorite toys.
1601251505|5.0|1000s of words have been written about Pathfinder. I don't need to repeat them all. There are plenty of really detailed breakdowns if you want that. What I will say is short.<br /><br />it's a great RPG, and beautifully done. It's how D&D should be, but hasn't been for some time. I have 100s of D&D books $1,000s worth, and I'm now, Pathfinder all the way.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|excellent classic reading in English. Read as a youngster and still love it. Recommend it for high school students especially.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Best Show Currently on TV, and just getting better. I highly recommend it for fans or even for those that haven't seen it yet, Granted you'll want to start with season one, but yeah. Great show!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Brilliant writing. Reminds me of my early years in Aberdeenshire with his evocative descriptions of the towns along the A9 between Edinburgh and the Highlands.
B0053O89WY|5.0|BBT is one of the best shows on TV. Witty and smart, it really calls out to the inner geek in us. I love the show, the cast and have every season so far.<br /><br />Season 5 you can tell the show is really hitting it's stride and you want to watch from start to end of the disks.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It is a app that has been slowing down my devices. Everytime I try to access something it says this app is interfering
1601254679|5.0|This book is great for a game master that needs a quick npc of most any level and any type. Or 20 NPC's of different types at what ever level you need.<br /><br />It's also great for pick up characters. One of your party dies when you're not expecting it, then they can grab one of the characters out of here and not miss a beat. They can play the temp char till they can roll up their own new one or take one out of the NPC book and modify/customize it and keep right on going.<br /><br />The art is awesome and it even has the &#34;Iconic&#34; Pathfinder characters in here, to either use yourself, or put in your games.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|This was my first album I purchased by Led Zeppelin and it spans their entire career. I would have liked to see more songs from &#34;In Through the Out Door' but still it has all of their hits and a few hidden favorites. Sound quality is excellent. Highly recommended.
1601253788|5.0|Pathfinder puts out quality stuff. This is no different. This is the third of their Bestiary books and just like the first two, it's full of varied and mirid monsters and creatures, both animalistic and races to use in your games. Awesome art from cover to cover. The write up's are a touch small but no smaller than the previous two.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Just enjoy it. So funny. All of a sudden - there's Chuck Norris rescuing them. Of course unbelievable things happen. Who cares.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like outdoor activities, this product is an excellent complement to my team.<br /><br />Its size and weight make it very practical and efficient.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Didn't see it at theatre because reviewers talked about it being so dark, but I really enjoyed it. Anne Hathaway was great. Loved the ending.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have downloaded many apps for free as promotion, and this is the only one I will never delete. This game is fun and the graphics are really beautiful. I would definitely feel sad without this game in my life!
B009A87X80|5.0|Found Eva Cassidy through 50 Shades (as I have many other songs and artists).  A beautiful voice and wonderful songs.  The whole album would make a great soundtrack for some movie, but especially for Christian and Ana.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The world's most incredible narcissist vs the world's most evil socio-path!!! What a story!! Nearly passed out holding my breath.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Brilliant story  it took a lot of  guts to do what Jake did!!! I think I'd do the same thing if I was in his shoes!!
B00AMS38YU|5.0|very entertaining.  action packed movie.  edge of your seat- is he gonna make it or crash and burn?  gordon-levitt did a great job!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|This is a little different than traditional UNO but probably better for our Kindle Fire as the kids can share and play with each other.  They will probably figure out the changes to this electronic version faster than us adults.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|this was purchased as a replacement cap for my nikkor 18-55mm lens.  this one seems to be a little more snug than the original, but it gets the job done.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|enjoy all the seasons I  have ordered all of them, if you enjoy this show its a great collection to get
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Another Grisham legal novel that has a few twists and turns, a bit of humour and a feel good ending.<br />Well worth the read.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Just as described, works perfectly and looks as if it was brand new. My Son loves it, Thank You!<br /><br />-Jon
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Broke the rear glass plate on my iPhone4 and decided to buy a case after I got that fixed.  In the smoke color, this cover is pretty discreet on a black phone.  Comes with a plastic shield  for the screen and even a polishing cloth to clean the screen prior to installation.  In all a great product.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I was completely satisfied with this product. The over all condition of the DVD and price was perfect. A ++
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Im addicted. Plan on spending lots of long nights watching.  It's like a good book you can't stop watching no matter how badly you want to.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I bought this as an mp3 album via Amazon Mp3 Downloader. The speed of the purchase and quality of the mp3's was just as good as a CD quality album. A ++
B009JBWOU0|5.0|i purchased this for a friend wishing that i myself didn't already have the first two! the casing and the book that comes with it make it the perfect package!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome app so cool awesome to the max must be awesome and the other hands-on experience in the midst of darkness the world of darkness of course I need to find out more information about the game
B000HWZ5VU|5.0|this item was bought as a gift and i would recommend this site for anyone lookin for great cd's of any kind
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is my first time playing this game on a kindle fire. having it on a bigger screen without it freezing and shutting down every two seconds is great. Love it!
B000HWZ5WE|5.0|I choose the item for a gift and they loved it i would recommend it to anyone that may be looking for any cd's at a good price
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Got a lot of inappropriate meanings to words and I am an inappropriate guy so I love it it is good for burning people at school at home and anywhere else. So it was an amazing resource for anything like homework, burning people, and just about anything. And every time you update your kindle you get another version. Use the Oxford dictionary anywhere your at. It is even good for the office. So get your copy of the Oxford dictionary now. You won't regret it it will help you a lot. You can find on almost any app store that sells books. And If you don't own a tablet just walk down to you superstore and by the normal book. If you don't think you will like it just download the Overdrive Media Console and enter your zip code. Find your local library on there. Next you find your library card and click login and then enter in the number on the back of the card for the username or whatever the top thing is called and then for the password you enter the year you were born in. Once you are in tap on search inter in Oxford or dictionary for your keyword and then scroll down till you find The New Oxford American Dictionary. Once you have checked out the dictionary it has a date in a little box it automatically turns the book in on that day. So there is no late fees to it is risk free this works with any other books on there!
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|This is fun, but sort of difficult to plany in a small window screen.  I will continue playing with it anyway
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is hilarious,awesome,and should win 1000 rewards.I hope there is another diary of a wimpy kid book coming out next year or more keep up the great work Jeff Kinney.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It is a fun game, and ideal for one who is prevented from many physical activities. Would be a great gift for someone in the  care facilities.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like it. It was scary nice. Love it. Fantastic. Awesome. I would definitely share it with all my friends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An amazing read but of course, Nicholas sparks is amazing. Thanks for another great book that was impossible to put down!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|If you enjoy the point n click games on the pc,this game will top every single one of them you have ever played! Great visuals,fun puzzles and mini games,really cool evil carnival vibe that really starts too shows the deeper you get into the game. HAD TO GIVE IT 5 STARS! Well done!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I recommend a serious look at this pair of headphones. I'm very satisfied with this pair. Great buy. Hopefully these will last awhile.
030758836X|2.0|I was disappointed after seeing multiple good reviews.  The two main characters are distinctly unpleasant and unlikeable, there's too much of the \\"unreliable narrator\\" plot device and the story ends up being unbelievable.  I just couldn't see what the attraction was and passed over large sections.  Mystery fans will want to skip this one and wait for a more mature effort by Flynn.
0756407125|5.0|While the first book was well received, I had issues when Kvothe arrived at the University. The conflicts were so much like Harry Potter that it threw me out of the story because of the juvenile behavior. Now, in this edition, we are finally removed from that storyline and introduced to the wider world. No hand holding here, just a move to adult themes and consequences. The pros of Pat are still the driving force of the books. While they are a bit over the top in the Fae world, I still think they serve the purpose of the story as he struggles to maintain his sanity in this strange realm. We gain some nuggets of info about the Amyr the Seven and the Fae. We also learn more about Kvothe and Denna thanks to the ever present danger of the forbidden Fae.<br /><br />If Pat puts as much effort into his writing as he does here, I will read everything he writes henceforth.
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|The good: Two 12-year old eccentrics find friendship in each other. The bad: it's odd, unrealistic, and accentuates character flaws. At best, it's a spoof. At worst, an awkward plot that lurches from one silly episode to another.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie for everyone, especially for children. A should watch, for the whole family. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen to the Tune In stations in many places, including the ESPN feeds.  Use it on Kindle Fire HD, Android phone and my computer.  All work very well.  Highly recommended it if you are a radio person at all.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Amazingly awesome and fun to play I'd suggest it to any one who likes fun games<br />Simple yet complex with making your own village or kingdom
B000VHMF0A|5.0|THE best reggae musician ever and every song is a classic. My favorite is 3 Little Birds but there's also No Woman, No Cry, One Love and more.
B007L6VR12|5.0|While it covers most forms of preteen and early teenage attempts at understanding the adult world and breaking one rule or another, their view of adult behavior is presented with hilarity.  A true farce of several institutions with a star studded cast.
1878424319|5.0|Excellent pearls of wisdom for adult children.  I recommend this book for everyone.  I need to buy one for myself
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|the dark side of the moon is easily (well for me at least) the BEST pink floyd album. it is by far one of the most intense experiences in music. the whole album realy just feels like just one long song. pick this up if you love music
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This fast-paced film stars Denzel Washington as an airline pilot with a drinking problem.  When there is a flight crash killing several people there is an investigation.  Mostly, Denzel is worried about the findings of this investigation which causes him to drink even more even though he has a legal team that is doing everything they can to protect him.<br /><br />There are great scenes in this film including the way his lawyers try to spin the facts and save him from going to jail.  His fine acting makes the audience identify with him even though it is clear that his drinking problem is out of control and he is guilty.<br /><br />There are no surprises in this film but the acting is really good, the plot moves swiftly and the story is tragic as well as very believable.  I saw this film in a theater but I expect it should be available for rental soon.  It's well worth watching and I recommend it even though the formula is familiar.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|While this application does not have everything that the full Steam client does (of course), it is a very handy app to use when I don't have access to my PC. You can stay in touch with your Friends List and keep up with the daily deals and other Store and Community updates you choose to receive from Steam.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|We bought this for our son and he loved it, as did our other 3 kids.  Liam Neeson is one of our favoites!
B0079R8IYW|1.0|The back leather cover is hard to open (to prop the book open to read). Having a holder for the stylus would be a great improvement.
141970642X|5.0|Both my son and newphew loved getting this for Christmas.  They both have all the other books in the series and this was an added bonuse.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book got me speechless. I could not put the book down because each page I read had me want to know about Sky aka Hope. Holder was just amazing.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|We got this for my husband for his birthday and he's been hooked on the series ever since.  Our entire family watches it.  We even re-watch our favorite episodes.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|A classic, of course, and I don't think they could have done any more to make the product a good buy.
B005LAII62|5.0|My son loved getting this for Christmas.  We didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters and was thrilled to open it Christmas morning.
B009B2VBWE|5.0|What a great voice she has. I really love her interpretations<br />of the songs. She is just amazing. This is one of those albums<br />you can never grow tired of.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|My son asked for &#34;dvds of great guitar performances&#34; for Christmas. I got a whoop and hollar when he opened this one.  Guess that means I picked a good one!
1419705849|5.0|My son is seven and a video game junkie, but he is a good reader, so I thought I would try this book for him. It's the day after Christmas and he is currently lying on his bed upstairs and reading. He's been there for an hour. I am so grateful.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|Excellent concise guide in improving memory for any endeavor!  All that is required is to practice the concepts and develop individual competency.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Not at all what I expected, vulgar language, unnecessary violence.  My fault should have read the other reviews!<br />Promise to be more careful!
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|I can't really criticize this app, I'm not the piano playing type. I will stick to apps that really interest me. I was just looking to add a new app to my kindle fire and this was free, and had a Christmas theme to it.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This film made the Roman Army real. History at it's finest!  Wonderful costumes, great color.  Will watch this again, worth the rental!
B004VYYA2K|4.0|This is a nice alternative to buying a Barbie house if your not ready or cannot afford to make that purchase. I bought this for my 4 year old who is not extremely into Barbies yet, but has a few of them along with accessories. This zips on all side so and has a few different scene options so it can be used in many ways. Plus it is a pretty storage bin when the child is all done! Good price as well!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|The best movie I have seen in a long time.  Cannot wait to see it in 3D.  The color was beyond belief, much a wonderful feeling of color washing over everything.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I was advised to get this so that I could watch BBC news videos and listen to radio. It hasn't worked. Maybe I'm missing something?
B003H9MSPG|3.0|Not accurate and doesn't go as far as it claims it will.  Overall it's ok but now as much as I hoped.
B001OQCV2O|3.0|I love this movie, but i didnt understand why this doesn't has spanish subtitles...... That was a problem for my friends that likes to see movies in our language
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It took quite some time to convince me to read the FS Trilogy (and I have had several people try) but I finally gave in.  I am really glad I did!  I have to admit I was a little hesitant when I started the series...not really into BDSM...but the story just kept getting deeper and deeper; hotter and hotter!  I had to find out what was going to happen next.  Can't wait to finish the final book to see how it ends.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Although, I have played the card version many times, and own a set of the cards, I DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS COMPUTER SYSTEM WORKS AND CANNOT FIND OUT HOW TO PLAY IT.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|After reading so many series books I wanted a one book light and airy read. That was not this book! Don't get me wrong once your in your hooked, it is a great read. It has a great fun banter between characters,and a beautiful love story. But folks this tackles a very series subject. But I believe that is what makes this book so captivating and real.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This purchase was a great deal, and although I somehow purchased the English/French version it really made no difference. Great quality/value.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book will be a different experience from what your used to. I was skeptical at first, but it turned out to be a great and interesting read.
B0034G4P26|5.0|Witty movie that was fun for all ages.  One that can be watched over and over.  Great story and animation
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Was just like the comics that it was adapted from. Christian bale played his role as an aging hero was fantastic. Just as well as bane as a cold blooded killer was incredible.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey has incredible scenery and acoustics that create a strong emotional tie to the path you're on.  It changes light and joyful music and scenes to dark and blue ones.  Makes you reflect on life, both the fun and challenges, and how important it is to feel the sense of curiosity and wonder.  You have the chance to randomly run into one other player at a time, and without the ability to talk to them, share part of the journey experience together.  The game was about 2 hours long for us, a perfect way to spend an evening after work.  My husband is replaying it right now.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. The action and drama kept me reading. I love this series
1401937268|5.0|This is a beautiful deck with excellent illustrations.  It is not necessarily for the beginner, however, it does give a brief interpretation on each card which is helpful.  This is for serious readers and not just for play.  This deck has deeper meanings than most Tarot decks.
B000I0QL82|1.0|I was happy to get the DVD and it came on time. Half way through the show the DVD began to skip then it froze up altogather I was really disapointed as it is a great example of Bing Crosby and Fred Astair. I would like one that works.<br />Jim Warrick
B000R9EG3Q|5.0|On time and as described. I would order from this seller again.  The price was right and I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to know more about our president.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this for all my devices. If you are looking for a good fun app, then this is for u!!!!!!!
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I love this ap. I use it on the web, on my ipod and now on my Kindle. I can share different lists that I make with different people. I've shared my grocery list with my family so they can add items and all I need to do is pull out my ipod and check off items as I purchase them. I can set reminders to do tasks - and they have recently added an area for taking notes or adding more information for each item. I highly recommend this app.
0812993357|4.0|Judging from this biography, Grace Coddington is the acoustic version of the great operatic story I think of as fashion. As I read the book, I could imagine her writing it, and muttering \\"What's all this fuss about?\\" Anyway, it's an interesting, straightforward account of her life in fashion: how she got there, who she worked with -- her observations on designers, her friends, her lovers, her favorite shoots. No unnecessary ornamentation, just her lovely squiggly line drawings to accompany the text. A very nice read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is an amazing, addictive game. I cant put it down. I suggest this game to family and friends. I can play for hours and hours.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Lenzen always gives easy to follow instructions and a little history for every knot.  These knots can be morphed into your own designs once your get the hang of it.  Good stuff!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince once again delivers a book that I can't put down. Although the scenario is more of the same that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mitch Rapp's character continues to enthrall the reader and the intertwining of real day foreign agencies adds to further the Rapp mystique.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|As a non-country/pop fan, I was surprised how high the quality was on this latest Swift album—I hadn't listened before, but had seen the very positive reviews from reviewers I respect (NYT, for example).  My appreciation may well grow after repeated addtl. listenings.
B007SSDDWE|1.0|IWe were expecting a bad movie, but still expected something better than we got! They started making up technologies and didn't really explain anything. There weren't even enough decent action sequences!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have been a long time Clancy reader.  This one is right up there with Hunt for the Red October.  Couldn't put the book down.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|We watched this as a family on Christmas Eve and we all enjoyed it (ages 3 to 40!) Lots of laughs for all!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I read this because it was short and I needed to fill some time while waiting for a library book...and because it happened to be #1 on the NY Times YA list this week, which I only noticed because Paolo Bacigalupi mentioned on Facebook that his book Ship Breaker was #15...and because when I further noticed a couple of my friends on Goodreads had given it 4 stars...and because my son is a freshman and I thought it might give me insight.  Bottom line:  Paolo's book is so much better!!!!  I mean, this was an interesting novel but I sort of wished I'd selected a different book.  I really couldn't identify with the main character most of the time (granted, he's a male high school freshman so I'm not likely to understand him completely) because his issues and personality really made no sense to me.  Of course, \\"things\\" are revealed during the story and that part is well done and gives the reader some insight into his personality but really doesn't explain a lot. But, most of the time I was just shaking my head.  I was very annoyed that this boy didn't sound like he was in high school in the early 90s. The author made it feel like the late 70s/early 80s with his pop culture references and profound drug usage (and drugs chosen).  So, I kept having to remind myself of the setting time period.  I also was bothered by the method from which he chose his penpal. I liked that he wrote letters as a form of therapy but his choice of audience was completely unbelievable and odd.  And, he wouldn't even use their name when he addressed every letter Dear Friend.  Yet, he'd sign it \\"Love always\\" which seemed unrealistic and overly fond for a high school boy.  I just felt it was riddled with flaws and nonsense.  But, for all that, it was an interesting way to tell a story and had a cast of interesting characters.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I liked the Bourne series, but what happened to Matt Damon. This was ok but you should go with what works
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is one of my favorite shows. Cleverly written, you become sympathetic with the main character and don't wish him any harm - even though his pastime should make him a hated character.
B007YZPP18|5.0|This is a mesmerizing and intriguing story about love and manipulation.  It is beautifully written and visually perfect.  I really loved it.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The movie was shipped fast and looked to be in perfect condition! This was a Christmas gift for a 9 year old girl and she was very excited when she opened it Christmas morning. We saw the movie in theaters and enjoyed it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I luv the action,sadness ,and happiness! U should read this book!it is funny too!!!wonder is awesome!!!!!I highly recommend it!read it, u will not want to put it down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I did not know what to expect.  This was a book club pick.  Was very good.  Had a lot of information from the Alzheimer victim standpoint.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|I loved this movie.  It isn't very often that a sequel is just as good as the original but this definitely is!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was a great story from page one!!  This story tells of times of slaves and the owners and how they co exist.
0470876417|5.0|I found this book very useful and interesting, it is written in easy language and illustrated with many examples from real life, I appreciate the great job done by authors.<br />Since I am new to this subject, I wondered if a little explanation were given for the broad context of business development and market research/analysis, just to illustrate how buisness model interact with them.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Really funny and a good book. I could not stop reading this book. Jeff Kinney writes a really good book.
B00846REIS|2.0|You can predict everything that is going to happen in this book.  Too blunt at times. Both main characters were whiny and spoiled. Not a very good read.
B005LAIIS0|3.0|i liked the leading actor liam neeson he's a very good actor.  the only thing i didn't like was the use of so much bad language being used.  Sometimes that can destroy a very good movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really didn't think I was goin to like this series but I loved it I couldn't put them down!
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I am fan.  Love Vampire movies anyway.  creating a love story of such between a vampire and human and then to produce a child was great.  again I loved it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wasn't that into the kinky kind of s and m but I didn't want to stop reading it.  Read it and see if its for you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is WOW. Colleen Hoover took a difficult dark subject and turned it into a amazingly heartbreakingly beautiful story.  I was sad, I cried, I was shocked. I laughed. It made me smile. It left me breathless. It was so many emotions. I fell in love. This book was one I did not put down.<br /><br />This is a must read.<br /><br />\\"The sky is always beautiful.Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy,it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\\"<br /><br />\\"While I could sit here and feel sorry for myself, wondering why all of this happened to me...I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to wish for a perfect life. The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down. I'm choosing to stand up taller. I'll probably get knocked down a few more times before this life is through with me, but I can guarantee you I'll never stay on the ground.\\"
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The success of this book only goes to prove the old adage of PR being everything, or something like that.  As far as I can tell, the author of this piece of crap must have some amazing PR people because the writing is terrible.  Apparently the people passing on the recommendations of this book either don't read often, or are so excited by the open discussion of bondage that they have to pass it along just for the prurient value. . . Otherwise, it just wasn't that interesting.  Takes more than a little slap and tickle to make a good book . . . good writing would be necessary.
B001608R5I|5.0|Bought it for our son.... arrived so fast and great price. A must for a real fan. Even came with four very cool hard stock posters for framing.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Fair story, fairly unbelievable characters, May be more relevant to teens than jaded adults.  Thought provoking messages in story.  Short read worth your time.
B000FC1MCS|2.0|Interesting book, but it left you wondering what happens?  Plot needed to be developed a bit more, as do some of the other characters.
B009SCRERI|5.0|My daughter is so over princesses but she still loves the Tinkerbell movies. While she doesn't want the toys anymore, she enjoys these movies still and constantly asked me to buy her this one.  She loved the movie once i downloaded it for her and watches it constantly on her kindle.  It;s a great movie for little ones with a great message.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|Great Historical value to own on Blue ray.Great storyline and acting. The wardrobe and sets are very good. The cast of actors is great!  Hard hitting action, great plot. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography, and (A+) CGI effects.  Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love reading my books on the go while at work or just hanging around the house. traditional books get lost or messed up and I rather have it electonically
B005LAIGP0|5.0|Great storyline and acting. The period wardrobe and sets are very good. This movie is very creepy and will work on your mind. The cast of actors is great! The sound quality is good, with great cinematography. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie. Buy it on Blue Ray, a classic. Thanks.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I don't get why so many negative comments. This is a fun yahtzee type game. It is fast paced if you go ahead and start several games with several people. And there always seems to be lots of people to play with. I don't sign in through facebook..I created an account and it keeps me signed in. I do really like this app.
B008602KQI|1.0|Interesting storyline and plot. The wardrobe and sets are ok. This is good quality entertainment to fill your time, but not as bloody or gory as led to believe. This movie actually is very weird and kind of dry and almost boring. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography, and (A+) CGI effects. But overall, this movie is weak; I would never watch it again. Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|fun mix of adventure and hidden object. took a long time to finish and was well written, plot -wise. great graphics!
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Great storyline, plot, and action. The wardrobe and sets are very good. The cast of actors is great! This is good quality entertainment to fill your time. Lots of hard hitting action. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography, and (A+) CGI effects.  Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is sure to satiate a whimsical need to fly, while wearing a soul-crushing blue business suit. It's a stupendous side-scrolling game with a 90's vintage feel.<br /><br />Achievements, missions, and upgrades make for a high replay value.<br /><br />5/5 Stars!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Great storyline, plot, and action. The wardrobe and sets are very good. The cast of actors is great! This is good quality entertainment to fill your time. Lots of hard hitting action. The sound quality is good, with great cinematography, and (A+) CGI effects.  Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love that the girl doesn't have to be a perfect little princess in this.  My 7 year old is somewhat of a tomboy so it was nice to have a princess that was more like her.  I usually don't like animated movies, but I did enjoy this one with my daughter.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I have this app on my iPod and when I got this  kindle fire he I was like, Yes! BIGGER SCREEN! This game is very entertaining and is very fun to play. My daughter's two friends who are 5 &amp; 8 play it all the time so it's very easy to use. It makes them so happy when they get different blades and backgrounds! :-) You have got to get this app!!!!!
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|I have played many games on my Acer tablet and have never had such a bad lag in play as I do with Tesla's Electric Mist.  I click on items and nothing happens for several seconds.  I looked at a walk through, because nothing I clicked on was working.  I went back into the game and clicked on the items I was suppose to click on, and still nothing happens.  I would like a refund for the game not performing properly.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This app is really fun and not that expensive. It takes good pictures and video. The only reason why I would give it 4 stars is because I expected the camera to already be in the camera!
1451696191|5.0|Shipped in great time and was in good condition for being used. Haven't read the book yet but heard really good things about it! Cant wait to read it!
B001F4UHFI|5.0|show what actually goes on in the buisness of arms dealers. especially like the fact that are government covered is a%& at all times. kinda of a scary thouight!
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|The best sitcom, a lot of laughs, beautiful package, thanks for all, and long life to &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34;
1451695195|4.0|a facinating book sounds almost an unbelievable story. I could not stop reading.<br />The fact that this was writen by a scientist makes it strong.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I get a lot of offers which can cost a lot of money and lead you down to nowhere. Well when one of them was to publish books on Amazon, I decided to do my research. Amazon provides you with all that you need to write a book formatted for Kindle. All you need to do is follow their instructions.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Enjoyed the movie for what it is, stupid adult fun. I like the cast and unique premise. Don't let your children watch it.
B008M721MS|1.0|For the kindle so i could skype my kids and nephew. I bought them each a kindle also. Worked fine at first but now my nephew isnt even listed and i cant skype him. I wish there was another app for this on kindle. Skype sucks!
B0063GORYU|5.0|great time killer when you want f<br />ast and easy...only a little thinking required when you just want a fun break in a quiet kind of way.
B000FA5STS|5.0|&#34;Total Control&#34; was a very interesting, suspenseful plot. Well written. I'm fairly new to Baldacci's writing , But will certainly read more of his work.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|What a joy to be reminded of what great writing is still to be found amongst the rubbish of today!
B005FISBTO|2.0|I don't have a problem with manufacturers placing advertising on DVD's that I rent.  I figure, I don't own it so that entitles them to place what they want on it.  However, If I purchase a product (like I have every season of Dexter) advertising is nothing but aggrivation.  But advertising that won't allow you to skip or fastforward thru it is simply holding a consumer hostage.  The discs in the Dexter series begin with several minutes of advertising that you can not get away from.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time the other night after delaying it for a while. And I really regret delaying it. I wish I had seen it sooner. I'm no movie critic but I'm not one of those people that goes around always saying &#34;oh that was the best movie ever&#34; after every good movie I see, but I can honestly say, that Warrior, is truly one of the greatest movies I've ever had the good fortune to watch. You think it's just about MMA and fighting but you're wrong. There is so much pain, sorrow and emotion in the movie. Truly a moving film. It even had me welling up a couple times and I'm a 21 year old guy. And anyone that has brothers that they fought with their whole life ( like me) this movie will hit you hard. Do yourself a favor and get this movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Brought me back to my high school days and made me think of the relationships I made during that time. Easy read.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Huge fan of the Twilight movies and the music.  Had to have the CD.  The music is awesome and the price was great!
B008RJFRTK|1.0|Is ok, but not worth it on a kindle HD. Use the free version since it does what you need.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Huge fan of Adele so I had to have the single to the movie.  Great song and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Adele.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can not wait to read the next one! I was so interested through the whole book. i recommend it!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not the best Grisham yarn, but better than those of others. A good 2-day read. Difficult to put down..  Well worth the cost, however.
B000Q76K24|5.0|Excellent depiction of behind the scenes (dramatized) of the cold war and the rise of the US intelligence community.  A must see for those who are Cold War espionage buffs. Think this was closely linked to life of Dick Bissell.
B005LAIH3G|1.0|This was a good enough movie but one wouldn't expect tp hear GD in a Disney movie.  I am very disappointed in that.  Kids are exposed to this kind of stuff everywhere, it would be nice for parents to have one place where they can trust that their kids will not hear filth.  Disney used to be that place but apparently not anymore.
0307887960|5.0|This book gives you an idea of how to lose weight without being hungry. Do I agree with everything, No. But, it is a good guideline to healthy eating.  If you follow this, you will lose your weight and maintain better than any other program.  I know I have done most of them.  The only thing I had to purchase was the Oat Bran.  What a deal!
B00028HBKM|5.0|A well made movie, that summarizes the final days of Christ's life and his most important work - salvation of mankind. Everyone should have the chance to watch this. It truely is a very moving account of Christ's love for all people.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I loved the book I am almost a 7th grader but I feel that it was pretty close to what I deal with.... any way I liked it
B0030B1WBM|5.0|How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Christmas Vacation are the 2 best MUST SEE shows at Christmas. Never get old.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is an awesome game. I have enjoyed every minute of this game.<br />I have never played this game, but I would recommend it to others.<br />I
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I laughed often and loud.  A hilarious adult<br />comedy. Just awesome . If you want to laugh<br />See this movie.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I really like playing this game it's really fun and I have it on my phone and I am really far on it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It can be carried by a handle or like a backpack.  It held a Canon EOS 60D camera body, an 18-200mm zoom lens, an 18-55mm zoom lens, and a 50mm f/1.4 low-light lens.  A lot depends on how you place the velcro-attaching compartment separators and straps.  We were also able to put a Powershot SX 30 IS camera in it.  Fits under an airplane seat (of course in the overhead too), so I used it as the &#34;second, personal carry-on item&#34;.  The outer compartments held an iPad in a soft case, and a Kindle Paperwhite. All this will add some weight, so the backpack capability helps.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Won't let me like any thing and is missing up!! Please fix and I will give Facebook a 5 star rating
B00008NRL8|5.0|I should have just bought this and Tango Chill Out v. 2 and I would have been all set.  Great chillout-infused tango.  La Revancha de Tango is a classic that I'll listen to again and again.  Great stuff.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a great book to read if you have read the others to. You should read it to every one
B009E3EY38|4.0|I'm a long time fan of Led Zeppelin and saw them live in '75 and '77. This concert was a lot of fun to watch and listen to. Eventhough most of the songs are played in a lower key, and Robert's voice is lower, they still sounded great. Kashmir was outstanding. Robert is still able to let out some amazing screams. The whole concert was great. There was one screwup  in \\"Dazed and Confused\\". After the guitar solo during the up tempo part, Jason Bonham started his drum fills a little too late and the whole thing came to a screeching halt. But they recovered and moved on. The jumping camera angles every few seconds is annoying. It would've been better to just watch them play from a few angles and not changing so rapidly. Definitely recommended for any fan.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a very original book and I absolutely loved it! This book is funny, and will make you laugh!!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I chose this because I'm not quite done with this book yet. Also every time i read a page i want to keep going and going. Very nice. I would recommend this book to any young adult.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is very true to both the historical time line and the Fall of Giants list of families featured in the first book.  I will soon be finished and eagerly awaiting the final book in the series.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This dictionary has helped in numerous ways including whenever I have English homework. But the sheer amount of pages and no way to jump to a specific letter makes it kind of like finding a needle in an ocean. 4 stars.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Short and sweet -- Overlong, boring and you'll need subtitles on when Bane is speaking. The dramatic development of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is completely unneeded. A real disappointment, not only as a Batman movie but also as Nolan film.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|This app does less than the email app that came with my kindle fire.  Just a waisted download in my opinion
B007T2XC7A|4.0|To me she is the perfect nightclub performer. Her &#34;laidback&#34; style is both soothing and very relaxing. A nice complement to anyone's collection.
B009K45Y62|5.0|The case this comes in only one upped by the art for The Dark Knight Blu ray. Nice to see some extras on Disc two, and really surprised at the price this going for ebay or here. Glad pre-ordered here.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Why is this garbage deemed a classic? It is thoroughly miserable, I give it that. A depressing look at the futility in being a cop enforcing the ruling class's laws on the poor and even middle-class like here in the US.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Great gift for my DAD, really wish  I had the blu ray version.He is loving it and that is I needed to know.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Really what's not to like there are pigs flying aroud it's a great game to waste your time with!!! fun!!
B0085YNML2|4.0|I got this as the FAOTD,  I have played it on my galaxy s3, the nexus 7, and the Nexus 10. So far no problems on any of them. The little lizard has a cute factor that just makes you want to keep feeding him. The puzzles get harder and I have not gotten bored with this game yet.
B0085YNML2|4.0|It's fun and easy to play and an all around great app!!! both the kids and I like to play
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|If your a Clancy fan then this will not disappoint, Clark and Chaves still have what it takes to get the job done. !!!
B005HSL626|3.0|even my grandson (9) is tired of it after only a few times playing with it. Maybe younger kids might like it.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Great movie that's funny, exciting, suspenseful and heart warming all wrapped up in a sci-fi package... What are you waiting for? Rent it and see for yourself.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for a long-time fan. I got the most perfect feedback! He was very excited about the CD/videos of first concert. The poster is bigger than I expected. The CD tracks are awesome. I win! Best gift ever! YAy!
B008KE3960|5.0|The only flaw this game has is that it is ridiculously addictive.  Please keep making more levels.  I am glad to have drop a couple bucks for this game.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The end felt like it ended in the middle of the story. It needed at least 20 more minutes to conclude the movie. I hate non endings, and this movie takes the cake.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I enjoyed this series although it wasn't easy reading by any means. Wasn't the kind of book you get lost in. But did have an interesting story line.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|I love almost all of this, just wish it had a few more songs. Lana's music makes me feel different than anything else I've ever heard
B000IONJH4|5.0|I saw this movie in theatres when it first came out and loved it.  I simply wanted to add it to our dvd collection-we are sci-fi fans and this is definitely one of the best I have ever seen
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is very cute. If you like farmville you'll like this. Its just like farmville and games like farmville. I'm certainly obsessed with it and I'm not a brony. I am 17 pretty much and I think fans of MLP:FiM will love it whatever age you are. Whats better is the characters talk in the game. I thought this was a nice plus. I can't wait to see the rainbow pony (Rainbow Dash?) because I've seen her colorfully before on the internet and such...
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Kids off all ages love this game on my iPad. Now that I gave my daughter a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas, I want more Toca games for the Kindle. Toca makes great kid games for iOS. We just need all of them ported to the Kindle.<br /><br />The graphics are great, the playability is fun and it's well worth the money!
B004EIZCPM|4.0|Typical high school story, I love Emma Stone. This was a fun movie, I'd recommend it to anyone out there.
B00422LESO|4.0|For those who like getting lost in another place and another time to escape the present reality, you will like the main character.  I thought the plot was clever.  How many others who have read the book actually googled vacations as described in the story?  Anyone? It's a quick read and a fun story.  It took you to the 'what if I actually lived in that time' that those who love Regencies have often wondered.  I liked it.  Wasn't the smash hit of the year, but it was a pleasant few hours spent.
1878424319|5.0|This is a very interesting and informative book.<br />Great way to look at life.<br />I need to read it again.<br />It's a quick read and thought provoking.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|I also reviewed the Winter Village Bakery, and both comments for both products are similar.  This is a great kit from Lego.  The finished product is very nice, and it was really fun to put this together with my kids.  My only complaint is that the instruction book makes it difficult to discern between grey and black pieces.  This caused a brief bit of confusion, but was quickly solved.  Overall, a great product.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Lots of fun, great dialog, cute cast, really fun story.<br />I thought this movie was worth watching more than once.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|I got this set for me and the kids to put together before Christmas.  My 6 and 8 year old were able to do most of this with my supervision.  The finished product is beautiful, and it was very fun and rewarding to put it together.<br /><br />My only gripe, and this is minor, is that the coloring of the instruction book can be misleading.  This set contains light grey, dark grey, and black pieces.  The way the instruction book is colored, it's often very difficult to tell which color (of the three aforementioned colors) are being asked for.  This caused us to have to go back and replace a few pieces with the correct color.  Keep this in mind when building...be careful discerning between the grey colors and blacks.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great Lego product.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I finished the first book at 6am. I had to get the 2nd book in a hurry!! It was a must to read what was happening next!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett comes through again with another page turner. This was an execellent follow-up to War of the Worlds. I am looking forward to the next in the series....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading the last 2 books it was a must to get the last book!! After I'm finished I'll start over again!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like all of Grishams books, you start it and can't put it down. Spellbinding and full of twists and turns.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Cool book<br /><br />Took me about an hour to read I'm usually a big reader but recomend it if your not
0131103628|4.0|The original C programming language book 2nd Edition by the fathers of the language.<br />Item was exactly as i expected. This copy was a library reject that had never been borrowed.<br />I was a bit disappointed with the price. But this popular title was printed over 20 years ago & is a must have for any programmer.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Mahjong Artifacts was a such a pleasure to play.  It was impossible to put aside.  You will surely enjoy it as I<br />have.<br /><br />Highflyer
B0001ARCFA|4.0|I very like this phone. Its reproduce a big range of sounds. Very quality materials of construction and the cable is long too. I think low level when reproduced music. Dont have level button. If you wish a good headphons, this is THE product.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|A little choppy with the story. Could of been a good movie. It didn't have much of a beginning. I guess. It's alien.
B0090EHVMC|2.0|could have been a cute movie IF the musicals werent in it.  I like the teaching about the enviroment part of this video.
0316067601|5.0|Those of us who stay in the safety of our homes, will only gain more respect for those who do not, choosing instead to protect and defend us against evil in this world.<br /><br />The 21st century has produced another &#34;greatest&#34; generation will some willing to stand the wall.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Amazing! It was put together so amazingly. She is am amazing author and I am very happy with the ending.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Works great on my old HTC DROID Eris and my current HTC Incredible 2...<br /><br />Can copy/cut/paste one, multiple, or all files/folders and paste them wherever you want (that doesn't require root access at least)... Has built in picture viewer that's actually pretty cool with its simple interface. Too bad it opens jpg files in the default Android viewer, but if I open a gif it opens the built in viewer. Also can open music and video files from within the app, so I think they are also built in.<br /><br />Probably the only thing I wish it would do is have an \\"Open With...\\" option since I have multiple apps for certain files.<br /><br />Can also share files using the Android sharing system (email, bluetooth, etc)...
B008MG1E4A|4.0|very good book, but i expected more detail of the story.  I finished the book in 1 week. It's worth the read.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love the game on my Kindle Fire. However,  I purchased some puzzle packs and they don't show up. Waste of money
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really liked this game. It is well organized and the colors are great. I would give it 5 stars if it did not shut down my Kindle every time I played the game. My Kindle is pretty full and this seemed to be the one thing that would push it over the top. I had to re-boot after playing, every time. Except for the crashes and re-booting it was an enjoyable game.
B002LMV7TS|4.0|I wish the DVD didn't come in a sleeve and was attached to the packaging like the Blu-ray disc, but overall very happy.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|it is awsomenwhen you are on road but needs work even black suit is hard get took me a week
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Thanks<br />Awesome fun readbcoolnrjsks hahaha hahaha j h h h hack oak hi no point is Jackson Jackson Jackson Jackson
1579128955|5.0|There is one element per page and it gives you a &#34;laments terms&#34; explanation and definition.<br />It also give great examples like what common things the elements described are in and what its purpose is.<br />Its filled with vivid big pictures.<br />You can get this book if you want to memorize every single element and their atomic weight, protons, nutrons ect...<br />-or-<br />you can get this book if your like me and glance through it just to see a couple of elements at a time.<br />The neat thing is what the title says- Exploration of every KNOWN atom in the universe.<br />Did you know that theres an element that was only just discovered in 1994? Rg. Before then it did not exist because it was not KNOWN. Amazing!!!<br />Long review made short: if your deciding on a book of elements, get this one.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Its adicting and it works it works what more do you want me to say this is dumb i should be able to write as many or as few of words that I want to!!!!!!!
B008KE3960|5.0|very nice twist on t he usual tower defence game. nice graphics and a great game, especially for free. I would recommend this game for any tower defence fan.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The other one-star reviews are correct.  The Facebook app for Kindle is terrible  About ten items are visible on the newfeed, then you get a few blue blocks, then....that's it.  It's rather useless.
B000YDCFUQ|5.0|These boots are great!  They are comfortable and have great quality.  They also have some style.  I have seen these boots in the stores for much more than I paid for them.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Funny book, I would say if you want to find an easy read and you have enjoyed Tina Fey's comedic writing in her shows you would definately enjoy this book
B002S4IIZA|5.0|I watched a few episodes on TV when there was nothing on. after 3, I was hopelessly addicted. I just finished it and feel a great whole in my life. I guess i&#34;ll have to fine another series to watch but I think Nip Tuck is going to be a very tough aCT TO FOLLOW.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Great movie - wheels within wheels - a mind bender - recommended for thriller and action movie fans. Would watch again.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Because she loves the Dr. Who series.  Has alot of the other yearly series.<br />It was on her Chirstmas list.
B003GJSUPY|4.0|I love the music but the files have a tag problem and I am having trouble with the files in my truck. I can make them work messing with the controls, but it is a pain.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I have read many of his books and really like this one--can hardly put it down--not getting much work done.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I was looking for a simple calculator app for my kindle fire; and I found it.  It is simple to use!
B000YMJA7I|3.0|This is not a greatest hits album....  they didn't even have i used to love her but i had to kill her on there.  It downloaded fine and they picked half the album of good songs but it could have used some work.  thats just my opinion though.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Good story about slavery in the South told in narrative form by the two principle characters. Hated to see it come to an end.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great read. Very quick, couldn't put it down! Can't wait for the movie of this one, though it won't do it justice.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great story encompassing characters from England, Russia, America, Wales and Germany and how their lives intersect starting before the First World War. It's almost disturbing how superior the aristocrats feel and act toward those less fortunate. However, I was appalled when I went to buy the second book and Amazon is charging $19.99! Totally  outrageous. I'm going to have to wait my turn at the library.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry is his usual self, dogged, determined and a pain the ass to those around him. Great story. Never retire.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|We watched the VHS version for years and are finally updating all our favorite movies to blu ray.  Very entertaining way to tell the story...the muppet characters are wonderful and Michael Craine is great as always. But they edited out one of my favorite songs, when Belle breaks up with Scrooge. Why, why, why???
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game was great! I haven't been as glued to a game in a long time. I found myself sneaking play time at work. It's pretty much a graphic novel with puzzles added in which is not normally my kind of game. I took a chance on it and it payed off. Play this game!<br />Afterwards, play the sequel! I just finished the demo of Virtues Last Reward and it was great. Can't wait to jump back in.
1455519006|5.0|DEFINITELY A BOOK THAT YOU CAN NOT PUT DOWN.  IT HAS EXTREMELY SHORT CHAPTERS SO YOU ARE CONSTANTLY TELLING YOURSELF JUST ONE MORE.  GOING TO START READING MORE BY THIS AUTHUR.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't think i could do any sort of justice in reviewing this book. I've read so many good/excellent books over the last six months, but something about this one will forever have me doubt that.  This story pulls you in from the very first page and doesn't spit you out until you see those last two words...&#34;The End&#34;.  For most of the book I found myself in tears, how could anyone live with that much grief.  I will forever remember the characters in this book, and only wish there would have been more to the story, like what happens after.....  I will be reading more by this author, and only hope that one day find out what happens between Sky and Holder.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I just love this feature on my phone.  So helpful!!  I never quite realized before how much I would really need and like to have this information available.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I really did want to like the movie......but it was predictable, pathetic & not that entertaining.  I didn't really like any of the characters in the movie.  Maybe it was better on the big screen; if I were a little inebriated with my girlfriends.  Sorry.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the main important thing in my life,  God's Holy Word.  You will have no regrets to add this one to your apps.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|A bit disappointing but only because my expectations were so high. That said, I did enjoy the movie. Some laugh out loud moments, but overall I'd say it was about as funny as an average Family Guy episode.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Most sequels using different actors aren' t always what you want them to be. But this one was't bad, a slow at beginning but iguess it was neccessary to know what was going on, but when it got going was actually pretty good. i enjoyed it, and would watch it again.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Not easy...but very fun!  Excellent graphics and frustrating levels...  Thanks for this top of line game... works great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love having this, It makes the bible always available to me, since it's on my phone. love that you can get different versions and that it can also read to me when i need  ti to. thanks for a awesome needed product. It can make a down day seem soo much better, cause it's always there. thanks
B002VPE1AW|4.0|I bought this movie for my grndson as a Christmas present to replace the one that he lost.  He is happy with this gift.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was a nice addition to the series, i like Roirdan's work can't wait for the next one to come!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|won't  run on kindle fire. keeps saying it needs memory and I've cleared off  all my games!  what a waste of time and money.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband I have played this non-stop.  The more we play, the better we get, but the levels get more challenging, and we still get stumped here and there.  Great game!!
B006KX3GXO|1.0|Downloaded this app yesterday. Took a few pictures. Then came back to take more and the app only takes pictures upside down! What the...? Would be a great app otherwise!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great time waster. but sometimes a little slower than I'd like.  My husband plays more than I do. But we enjoy it.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Good stuff. Only recommendation would be to use my playlist on my phone for music. Also, too much feedback when you are close to the device.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great! Its one of the best games on the market and a great way to pass time.
0374275637|5.0|I found this book with a lot of brilliant ideas, very comprehensive, simple and full of interesting examples that helps the reader in having a better ideas of metters that the author want to expose.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I chose 5 stars becAuse it's amazing... it's just as good..no great as the series... I disliked nothing and loved everything, hope sara Shepard keeps writing these amazing books !!!!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is an excellent film that shows the best of motherhood in bringing all there energies and resources to bear for their children.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game love the allies thing. You should make another one, ninja turtles vs zombie, that would be awesome, really awesome
B004EPZ034|4.0|This movies is ok.  The woman on the island is a little too sinister for mor taste but whatever.  It works
B0089OBLDO|2.0|Bought to use with G27 and 360'driving games. Instructions were minimal but useful. Everything worked as advertised except the one key feature which is the force feedback. It claimed forced feedback works, but we are unable to make it work. This is pretty important to a realistic driving experience. Cannot find any place to get support.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|My mother in law was looking for this every where and I found it on Amazon.  She loved it and has all the movies.
B009KHCRVO|3.0|This movie is a mixed bag.  I liked some of it.  The effects are great, but not consistently so.  Some special effects sequences are definitely high on the cheese factor -- and not in a good, noir, or genre way.  Just cheesy.  There are moments of &#34;What the ?&#34; in here too.  It left me with a meh feeling. Is it worth your time and money?  Probably not, unless you've watched everything else on Amazon, Netflix or Vudu.
0062082353|5.0|My daughter Kristin gave me this wonderful book for Christmas \\"American Sniper\\" by Navy Seal Chris Kyle. Like \\"no Easy Day\\", I sat down and read it in one day!<br /><br />What is unique about \\"American Sniper\\" is not just Chris Kyle's perspective... But the inclusion of long sections written by his wife that added a meaningful perspective on the sacrifices everyone made.<br /><br />For those looking for drama and action it is there... Even a bit of family and romance. The story to me was also about Chris finding what was valuable in this world, moving on and paying back to those who made his life successful and meaningful.<br /><br />I don't think it hurts the story to say that Chris is learning the value and contribution to the greater good in being a better husband and father. His contributions speak for themselves... But what he is now doing also helps build a better future.<br /><br />I am reminded that one of the top Christmas wishes for this year... Was for a father.<br /><br />Roger Freberg
B008Y1NY14|2.0|I mean that ironically, considering that the Kindle edition was free and no trees were harmed in the making thereof.  My time spent perusing this book, however, is irrevocably lost.<br /><br />The second page of the electronic edition is a page referencing an O'Reilly conference, \\"Velocity\\" held in London on October 2-4, 2012. I suspect that this \\"book\\", if one can call it that, was one of the presentations offered at that seminar. Wrapping it in a book cover and giving the appearance of a book, is grossly misleading.<br /><br />As for the actual contents, it is a very high-level overview of changes and directions for CSS3 compared to previous versions of CSS.  It is typical fare presented at these conferences/seminars, where attendees might want to familiarize themselves with trends and direction, without getting their teeth into actual technical details.<br /><br />So, in summary, if you want to find out what areas of CSS3 is different and how CSS3 are structured architecturally (from a high-level perspective), then this is the book for you.<br /><br />If you wanted to know anything about the actual syntax, then this is definitely NOT the book to get.<br /><br />As I said, this is a review of the Kindle e-edition. It is free on Kindle, so you will not run a great financial risk to get it and look at it. Just don't expect this book to take pride of place among other O'Reilly technical references.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game so worth the money! I enjoy hidden objects with a storyline I feel like a detective!
B004132HZS|5.0|I fell in love with this series, which came as a surprise to me. Before I watched this I actually had no interest in Sherlock what so ever. I hadn't read the books and found no desire to watch the recent movie. If it wasn't for my Forensics teacher showing the first episode in class, I wouldn't have actually watched it at all. To be honest, I didn't want to watch it in class, figured it would be boring. I even attempted to be stubborn and try to tune it out by drawing instead of watching. Of course I failed miserably. I was immediately hooked, and by the time it got to when Watson and Sherlock were in 221B for the first time; my sketch book had been tossed aside and completely forgotten. My friends had a good laugh as I got a little to into it, especially since I kept trying to get the ending out of my friend to see if I was right about the out come. In all honesty, I find this show absolutely fantastic! The story line of the episodes are brilliant, the characters are amazing and the actors do a spectacular job of portraying their characters. Steven Moffat did an excellent job of writing it. That again was a surprise; I knew he was a good writer, but being an avid whovian and feeling very disappointed with the episodes he has written for the 11th doctor, I had my doubts.(granted I didn't pay much attention to the episodes at the time) After seeing what he can do with Sherlock, I have actually had a more open mind about his writing style and now after re-watching the 11th doctor, I now enjoy his doctor who episodes more. Point is this series is amazing! I love sherlocks methods of deduction, how the show runs and just the whole thing! I definitely recommend this.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|A 3dollar game and it has two levels? AND you want us to buy the third level for almost the same amount of money? ROVIO  knows better than this.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Fun game works great on my Nex7. I would rate it 5 stars if it would not require in-app purchases.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|This was a deal of the day for $.99.  Already had this but for .99 it was worth buying to put on my cloud so I'll have access to it where ever I may be.  ..
B000YHG72E|5.0|Whole family enjoyed it. Very funny. Would watch again and probably will.  I may be bias though because I think all Will's movies are good.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl, was a unusual story. It was slow at first and a little mixed up until chapter 2. Then I really could not put it down.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|There are some breasts in the movie which lowered my star. Other than that it was a great movie, and could have recommended it had there not been nudity.
B000SGRONM|2.0|The stories are disjointed and pointless. I have read Sedaris' work before and couldn't stop laughing, I didn't even chuckle reading this book, was a waste of money.
B0083F5JE6|5.0|This was purchased as a gift, and she has listened to it several times in the first two days. Seems to thoroughly enjoy it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This is my daughters favorite series.  i was so happy to find it and at a reasonable price. thank you
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The world of Goo is Awesome game on Kindle Fire. I have played this on my Samsung Tablets before when it was made available first on Google Play. Seeing this lovely game free today on Amazon made my Christmas day even better! Thank you to the developers of this game and Thank You Amazon for delivering excellent quality games like this on App Store.<br /><br />The game has very good graphics and game play is superbly done. The characters are cute and while it seems simple to rescue the cute little goo characters by building structure and allowing them to enter the pipe trust me it requires some thinking skills to clear a level. There are multiple hurdles one needs to overcome to complete the levels. The cute little goo characters are adorable and cheer you while you take them to safety. - Superbly executed game! worth every penny you pay for it.<br /><br />The game works beautifully on Kindle fire and this is one of the top quality game that has been made free on Amazon App store! today in a long time and even at $5 dollars coming tomorrow it is still worth the money! Download it and you will have hours of fun.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon! Customers like me love it! I am positive you will also agree that this game is awesome!<br /><br />Thanks! - Merry Christmas!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a realistic card game and easy to navagate.  It is more realistic than most computer card games. I would recomend this to anyone who likes solitare
B0055SWM08|5.0|Can effectively play without wanting to get angry or frustrated. Music sounds like naptime. The \\"bloop\\" of pearls being captured is addictive. Makes you strategize every move, so you're pretty sure your exersizing parts of your brain...and we all can use that. ;D
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|Nice movie. I'm a big Hunter S. Thompson fan and Johnny Depp fan.. The book was really good. DVD was good too.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I like use Avast and used to use the free one. Its easy to use and actually has added security features that make the paid version a worthwhile purchase.
B0098460O4|5.0|This CD is so good!  I find myself listening to it constantly. Jonathan and Charlotte  are wonderful together. Looking forward to their next album
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great book loved the series it is always nail biting and sometimes slightly sad. But I'll always come back. I wonder where the plot will lead him in the next adventure.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|A classic film at a really great price! Best deal I could find anywhere. An absolute must-have for the holiday season!
B000002QWD|5.0|Great songs, listened to this with my grandma on most Christmas visits, just as I remembered it, good ol' Christmas music.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|This was so much fun to put up along with the other Disney Princess Peel and Stick items I bought. My grand daughter was delighted when she saw her whole bedroom decorated. I was a bit afraid because her bedroom has a textured wall and because it was not a totally smooth surface, I did not know if they would adhere well. However it still worked beautifully and so easy to re-position. I LOVE IT!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was great! Hidden objects with puzzles all rolled into one. I highly recommend this app if you like these types if games.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I use this app everyday, pretty good, but i still prefer to use my iphone for facebook. But when that isnt available this is a great second option
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Most of the &#34;Disney&#34; type movies give the message that child is wiser than the adults and in the end the adult realizes how wrong they were and how right the wise child is. In Brave it was sooo refreshing to have the teen &#34;tude&#34; portrayed so well and show how in the end, only true repentance from the child saves the relationship, not the superficial sewing of the tapestry. I really enjoyed it!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun and addicting, i could play it for hours and not get bored. I would definately reccomend this game
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I bought this for my 15 year old son for Christmas.  He has already seen it so it was exactly what we expected.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the game of Mahjong. I used to have it on my computer, now i can carry it around with me wherever i go.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I thought it would be awesome to playiDraw Something on my new Kindle instead of my tiny phone. I downloaded it and it has never worked. :-(
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game to have. I carry my kindle wherever i go so i am able to play it anytime. A great time killer.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Will be one of my favorite CDs for the Christmas season each year.  Great music arrangements.  I don't even own Rod Stewart albums/cds, but this is wonderful!
0807014273|3.0|Thank you for the book a must read for my class.  An A- by the way!  I loved the price and maybe actually try to get the meaning over the long holiday.  Thank you.
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie Underwood has done it again - almost all the songs could be chart toppers.  Good mix of fast and slow.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft pocket edition is a great app. It has almost everything in the origional minecraft does, but there are some things missing, like Enderman, villagers, armor( I mean, come on!), dispencers, emeralds, enchantment tables, skins, levers, and pressure plates. Zombies drop feathers instead of rotten flesh(WTF???). There is redstone, but you can't do anything with it. That's just the tip of the iceberg. I hope they will have an update soon encompassing all of these things, but until then I don't think this app deserves the full five stars.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I don't really read much but this book really made me want to reconsider my hobbies. This book had action, a human nature element, drama, and romance. Great mystery I believe this book should be transformed into a film because it was just that good.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Free classics.  Need I say more.  Great fun to watch the various movie versions and compare it to the book.
B008KE3960|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. Levels become increasingly difficult on each map.  Selection of different type aircraft is important.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW........<br /><br />I'm going to be cliché and give this book five whooping stars because it was that well done. The story line was well written, defined and developed. It touch my heart on so many levels that I really didn't want it to end. After reading a  lot of sub-standard books this book wowed me and reminded me on what a book is to be about.<br /><br />The story in of it self was messed up and touched on many really issues that happen in today's world and advises given and conclusions drawn were real life ones.<br /><br />Buy this book. Read this book..... I mean over 260 people gave it 5 stars.
B006X415GK|5.0|My daughter has not stopped playing with her since she got her on Christmas morning. The black and white look is different and gives Frankie a stunning look. Her hair is in a cute bob and her shoes stay on great. I am continually impressed with the quality of Monster High dolls.
B0001WDAX6|5.0|Friend loves it.  She had mentioned her desire for a &#34;colorized&#34; version of It's a wonderful life and yall had it listed.  Thanks!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I just got an 8.9 inch Kindle Fire HD for Christmas, along with a twenty five dollar gift card, and with this i decided to buy a drawing app. This app is amazing, when you first create a piece you can select from markers, papers, erasers, pencils, and paints, when you click on these it come up with a long list of colors/ textures. this is very user friendly and my little sister should even be able to use it with a little help. The texture I found on this was amazing, the tints and tones blend perfectly, and before you know it you have a masterpiece! The only problem I found in this app is even though I have the larger Kindle my finger alone isn't enough to give great detail to the art, so far I have only done partially abstract arts, which still look nice. I plan on buying a stylus to solve this problem. This is the best art pad I have ever seen and highly recommend your buying it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is an action packed game. Gets frustrating sometimes when you can't knock them all down. Helps if you can remember what the various birds can do.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is without a doubt the best TV show I've seen in ages. There is nothing about this show that one can't like.Every character is well defined and has it's own boundaries. The story line has enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seats through out the episode. And it may come across as strange, but you don't wait for the next episode because you wanna know what happens next (as in Prison break etc) you wait because you absolutely love the show. I envy the respect the S.O.A have for their members and what they are willing to do for one another.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the basic game - upgrades are often difficult. It is fast moving and holds my interest. I think others would like it.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|When this show was recommended to me I thought 'Bikers?.. Well, I don't know, doesn't sound that interesting.' I was WRONG! Just several minutes into the show I had realized this was something special. And that time I was right. This show is simply amazing. All the characters are played by great actors (looks like that they were written specially for them) and the story itself is very deep. If you have any doubts about it - don't. It is a must see. To make it short, just sit back, relax and enjoy this full-of-action series. Heck, I think I'll just go and start watching all the episodes all over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I decided to pick this up after hearing numerous reports of resounding success from a self-published author.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />These books are one of the freshest ideas I've seen in sci-fi for a while.  It isn't action packed, but the drama and tension build to a near-palpable level.
B005ZUR724|1.0|The accept button for the terms doesn't work.  Anyone else experience this?  How ridiculous.  Please fix this now.  What a joke.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I downloaded this app and tried it once. I loved it but when I tried to play it again it just froze and I reloaded it and still the same problem.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Love the app, does everything I need and more. However, lately keeps saying that I need to be logged into amazon to its this app (wether I'm logged in our not.) Why is this necessary? Also names of city completely overlap each other in radar view, which is rather annoying! Still overall, great app!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|To much can't stop playing its so addictive I play all the time no problems ever I could play all day and half the night
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is the first free app of the day I have reviewed but wow, what a game!  Remided me of Myst.  Really short but even with a bunch of console games to play, both my girfriend and I couldn't put this down.  If you missed this free app, buy it!
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Great book cover to cover. SEALS are as elite as I imagined. God bless them. My GOD WATCH OVER ALL OF THEM.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A must have game when going back home from the holidays ( no birding while driving). Highly recommend this game and looking foward playing the other versions.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|good read! Very romantic and I always wanted to know what was going to happen next, I recommend reading if you are into romance novels.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I chose to rent this, but in retrospect I should have bought it! The movie is extremely funny if you have a viewing history of the characters. WARNING: There is a LOT of gratuitous shooting and violence and it is not for young or sensitive viewers. It is also not going to win any awards for story lines or anything else.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was fairly well .if you like adventure this is the right book 4  you. This book deserves five stars!!!!!!=)  not 1 2 3 or4 stars ,especially not one star.=(
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Really close to the Dickens masterpiece. I used it with my class.  The amazon instant worked great.  I recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book I've read in a long time. Great plot, and always keeps you interested. Never a boring moment.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game it so awesome and fun and cool and I just love the dragons and the habitats
B009YP9L7U|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time, i could really relate to it. It kept me turning page after page, I couldn't put it down.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I had my nieces over& they stayed still during the ENTIRE movie. It was very clear & this movie didn't pause at all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great UNCLASSIFIED review of what actually happned centered on the real heros of the operation and not the sit in a seat idiots in Washington.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|and some of us do need them. The graphics are impressive, and it was responsive on my fire; but, the only building I did was using frequent/frantic swipes of my stylus...had no clue which swipes were considered successful building.  The download was the longest I've ever experienced...frustration exacerbated when I had to remove from my device. So many 5 stars, so it's appealing to the less challenged.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|We need more of these novels and heroes like them in the real world! Clancy does it again. Great buy.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Being a recently minted fan of Rebel Wilson I wanted to see this movie. It was mildly entertaining but my overall impression was that it was a total waste of talent. I recognize that their target audience was most likely two generations younger than myself.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|The added features and bio are a really nice addition to a Christmas classic. It is a great Christmas tradition.
2070404021|5.0|This book is my favorite book.<br />The character monologues without any punctuation signs makes this book completely unique.<br />The 900 pages enable you to live this modern yet mythical love story.<br />Worth it!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|A terrific story line, the best actors anywhere, I truly could not anticipate what the truth was. The second season is just as strong. I bought this as a Christmas gift, but plan on getting my own copy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it.  Couldn't put it Down.  Can't wait to start the second.  I want to know if Katniss picks Peetna to spend the rest of her life with.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|As usual all Kerrelyn Sparks books are something I order the moment they become available.  They are great reads and such fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Was a big fan of the Hunger Games from beginning to end!!  A must purchase if you are reading the series!
B002SR3T10|4.0|Very good CD. If you are a fan of Jethro Tull you will like this CD. Has the Typical Tull sound.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son is 20 and he is Autisic.  He loves to watch this movie.  Also this was a great deal !  The best one I found!
0634022296|3.0|In liked the content, but not the format. I prefer the larger, 8 1/2 x 11\\" sheet size. Also, as in recall this book has the lyrics and chords, but not the music notation.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I bought this for my son-in-law for xmas and he loved it.  I would purchase from this person again it came very quickly.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|the app is so cool you upload pictures of any thing you like so get it what are you waiting for
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I received a kindle for Christmas and the biggest app Facebook is broken. News feed doesn't load and now looking through reviews it looks like it's been broke since late October which doesn't give me much confidence in this tablet and it's support
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Graphics are awesome on the Kindle Fire. Big Fish Games puts out the best hidden object games of all levels.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app works awesome. on my kindle fire and it always has good updates on stickers and other tools especially the seasonal. stuff
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games and very challenging for all levels - highly recommended! !!  great tor all ages - I cant put it down!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I am so tired of Superhero's developing negative self-images, self doubt and self-loathing. This is not the personality I recall from the comic books I loved. These heroes had compelling reasons to do what they do; they had drive and energy to develop and master super abilities and invent whizbang new devices. They mastered themselves, controlled their environment, and defeated their criminal adversaries. They knew who they were, what they had available, and how to get the job done, and they kicked ass. ESPECIALLY BATMAN! He's a normal guy (no special powers) spurred by the brutal murder of his family in his presence leaving nightmares and loneliness in it's wake. With the help of Alfred, who nurtured, supported and assisted him; he trained his body,honed special skills, invented special tools and weapons; and when he was ready, he became the Batman. The Batman in this series is a lovelorn whiner and self-doubter with a crumbling sense of self - where'd that come from! Now they even have Alfred abandoning his commitments to Bruce/Batman. They've even got Alfred whining and whimpering about his failed expectations and he quits! I am disappointed and ashamed of Alfred. I don't like this Batman and I don't appreciate this change in this character. Stan Lee should have his ASS KICKED (Whap! Bing! Bang! Wop!)!!! The movie has great special effects, lots of action, and good suspense - it'll bring in the $$. It's this new Batman and Alfred, especially Alfred, that disgusts me. (Spiderman - is even worse..!)
1449410243|2.0|I thought it would be hilarious...but it was not.  Humor was not to my standard and it should have been based on reviews available when I selected it.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Who the He** is the Huntsman? Who is the evil-queens brother? What are they doing in this story? Man-Oh-Man, they really took some liberties in this story - poetic license I think it's called.... I guess it's basically, fundamentally, sort of the same story... I guess the real, actual, award winning story, the story known and loved by millions of people, the story with such positive messages - that story wasn't good enough for Kristen Stewart. If this movies didn't have such good special effects, I'd wouldn't have watched it all the way through. I'd have turned it off probably way earlier than those shrunken A-holes that were supposed to be dwarves. Loser of a story...
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I found this book to be predictable. But meets girl, conflict, happy ending, etc. I prefer something more original, but this wasn't horrible.
B006PZBRCY|4.0|I'm not a big Hugh Jackman fan but this is a great story. Well written, well acted, nicely balanced, and has a positive ending - sort of...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really enjoyed Diary of a wimpy kid book 7. I hope Jeff Kinney continues writing these awesome and creative series
B008ASLNN2|5.0|A powerhouse team, a superlative story, action action action tempered with rapier wit and an instantaneous superior intellect. I hope they keep making these movies - I really enjoy them.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|serves me what I need and fits almost any type of towels that I purchased in the market, the quallity is great
0307960471|2.0|I'm finished with you, Harry. You're just too depressing, too introspective, too violent, too unreal, too much. I've tried to like you, I really have. But life is too short and there are too many good books out there for me to spend any more time with you. I'd say \\"goodbye, old friend,\\" but we never really were friends anyway. SPOILER: If you survive the death scene that ends this book, I won't be around to learn how you miraculously made it through yet again. As I said, you're just too unreal.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It had it's funny moments.  But, a bit too crude and over top.  Still fun to watch.  It was worth watching with the right crowd.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. All of my friends play it also.<br /><br />This game is awesome
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|I love this album I love the vocals and My Favorite songs on this album are Fallen Angels,  Savior and Rebel Love Song  I'm so ready for the new album I love BVB X).
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Renner is very good, and the action sequences are well done.  More of the Bourne world is fleshed out, but in the end I was left wondering what the point of the whole movie was.  It felt like I had watched a really great trailer for the real film.
B005MW6IRU|4.0|This is a far cry from albums like Remisssion or Leviathan in terms of being true metal. That said, this is a great hard rock album and the drumming is still what makes Mastodon pop. The layered vocals and distorted guitar, as well as the album's story line will aslo keep fantasy metal fans enthralled. Though expensive for an amazon mp3 album, it's worth the money.
B009FBX5M0|1.0|This has all of the soundtrack except the theme. Perhaps I should have looked closer, but wouldn't you think it would be on the soundtrack? It was in the movie...
B003CN4R74|5.0|They are one of my favorite bands and  was not disappointed with this latest album. It had amazing heartfelt songs that are just what I needed to hear. Great stuff!
B004OBQDHK|5.0|Love this older movie, especially on Blu-Ray DVD.  It was received on time in great condition and was well worth the extra shipping paid to order it separately.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE Phillip Phillips! His debut album is great, and I can't wait for his next one! Good stuff!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was one of the most beautifully boxed sets of dvds I have received. The order arrived a day earlier than tracking showed it would.  It was in excellent condition.  I absolutely was the star gift giver this Christmas because of this gift!  The price was great considering the original retail price.  I am one happy shopper!!!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love HIMYM - it is a unique comedy that makes you feel good. Even the slimy Barney character is lovable.
B0001ZE1OU|5.0|Everything was in excellent condition; the box, the DVD cases and the DVDs themselves.  We are watching Episode IV right now!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|A Favorite Movie made even better by Blu-Ray 3D!  I already had this movie on DVD and watched it many times.  However, I waited for the Blu-Ray 3D version and was Delighted with my purchase decision.  A fun, great movie with 3D enhancement of Hi-Res visuals!  It may not be a verbatim recitation of Asimov's classic sci-fi story, but STILL very Enjoyable!  Buy it if you like Hi-Res 3D and the movie itself.  Note - great 3D and visuals by themselves are not enough - you still must like the movie (plot, performances) for itself! Also Forget the Native vs. Post-Production 3D Conversion arguments - just look for how well the end-result 3D production is (you can have poor 3d in either process)!
B004UPANAI|4.0|I assume the movie.  It was good: Hugh was hairy and clawy.  Liev was toothy and clawy.  And they fought.
B0064ORVCQ|5.0|A Favorite Movie made even better by Blu-Ray 3D!  I already had this movie on DVD and watched it many times.  However, I waited for the Blu-Ray 3D version and was Delighted with my purchase decision.  A fun, great movie with 3D enhancement of Hi-Res visuals!  Very Enjoyable!  Buy it if you like Hi-Res 3D and the movie itself.  Note - great 3D and visuals by themselves are not enough - you still must like the movie (plot, performances) for itself!

No recourse for this issue - hope it resolves itself with future Blu-Ray Player Firmware Updates. ***
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Smooth gameplay. Not too difficult. Worth the money. May purchase others from this company. Good time killer. Thank you and goodnight.
B007HO392S|5.0|This &#34;Blown Away&#34; album is filled with great set of diverse songs.  Carrie's voice is so incredible!  A must have for contemporary country fans!
B005ZUR724|1.0|Gameloft has practically given Kindle fire users a cold shoulder by leaving us without access to the most current version of the game. The version here is 1.1.5 and the one in the Google play store is 1.2.2 . The game itself will not allow you to play unless you are on the most current version, 1.2.2 . So DO NOT BUY unless under product info it says 1.2.2<br />Written on 12/25/2012
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I like the first book th he best.  It took me a while to get into this one, but it ended up being good!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I saw this movie today.  I thought it was rather good.  A few points in the film seemed like other films I saw before, but where it's an animated film that gives a chance for a younger audience to see it, which is super.  Gives a bit of hope to the mother/daughter relationship because in this film the mother and daughter are at odds but become closer as the film is woven together.  The daughter needs to become the mother in a sense.  But it also seemed a bit short, buty maybe it was just how it came across to me, but I did enjoy it.  Highly recommended.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I first got introduced to this story with the HBO series. I bought the first book and discovered how well the storyline on TV mirrored the book. Now that I am hooked, I will probably continue purchasing through the whole series.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game ...gorgeous graphics ...interesting plot ...fun ho searches &amp; puzzles! These r my favorite types of games &amp; this one is by far the best! Can't wait for e2 :)
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Very likeable & believable characters, love interests, excitement, glamour. I especially enjoyed the paralegal, Rachel, who was a great role model & very likeable.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love this game, I really wanted to rate it as a four or five star game, but the lag is so bad!! It skips at the most inconvenient times! It seriously needs to be fixed.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Amazing amazing amazing! Every part of this book left me anticipating the next part. Very unexpected, but overall a wonderful read!
B000P0J09W|5.0|This movie was one of my kids favorite shows while growing up.  I bought this for each of them for their Christmas stocking.  They were both thrilled to receive this gift.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a fun game to play when waiting at a Dr. office or simply to play when you have time to have fun.  I do not know anyone who doesn't love Angry Birds!
B0085YNML2|5.0|Well constructed levels with a pickup and play style that is perfect for mobile devices and tablets. Cute characters and cool interpolated 2d animations that seem to use shearing and maybe non uniform scaling on bit maps for added effect?  It works well.<br /><br />Definitely worth it. Give it a try!
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|I really enjoyed Sing Off and acquired Sounds of the Season, and Harmonies for the Holidays. PTXmas was a no-brainer to buy and add to the mix. My only complaint is there needs to be more songs. Done too soon.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|What a nice surprise...been thinking about buying this game and finding it the FAOTD for Christmas was a very nice treat...So far from what I've played looks to be great. Runs smooth and nice graphics.  Will play more later and probably get hooked, but had to at least download for such a great deal.  FREE!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game to play and keep the kids busy during a long drive. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for an easy game
0740748475|5.0|How could one go wrong with this book? The philosophical musing of the a boy and his tiger are always amusing and sometimes poignant. I love it and my children enjoy it too!
B008458O3S|5.0|This is one of the most original and addicting games I've played in along time. I like that new features keep getting unlocked right to the end.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this series!!  The other universe is in the forefront this season. An Interesting story line and great writing keep you hooked through out the season.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome game!!!!!!!!! Who hoooo! Who hoo! yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I knew from the reviews, this book would be good. This book is not good, it's near PERFECTION. Colleen Hoover's writing style is awesome in the respect that it flows so well, hooks you right from the very first page. I was fully invested in her characters and their story. I was absolutely absorbed in this book. The story of love..and loss. The story of abuse..and abduction. The story of selflessness that one doesn't often find in everyday life. The story of forgiveness, that is always hard to do, but is the only way to progress through life. She captured each emotion so well that as you read, it tugs at your heart and your only hope is that everyone survives the outcome. It was time well spent. Fantastic work...Kudos to Colleen Hoover for a fantastic story. Definitely one of my FAVES for the year!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game to kill some time with. Levels are fun and not hard to get started playing. Works well on my phone
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|This is a good continuation of the Bourne movie series and cant wait for the series if they plan any..
B002WIDRM6|5.0|It came so quick and timely that I was kinda shocked. And even better there was no damage at all, it was as if I bought right from the store. Yeah this was a score!!
B009LL4LMM|4.0|enjoyed the challenges as they progressed.  reminds me of the lemmings game which I liked more. it is worth the buck for this app.
0764137433|5.0|I speak several languages and like to go back to this series of books as a reference as needed. I recommend it to my students and have used them often in my own studies.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Funny but not the best of series, could have had more monster participation, but I,m no director. LOL.  Was OK
B005LAIHYU|2.0|I'm not one to just give up on a movie if it doesn't get my attention right away so I honestly gave this movie a chance. While the movie wasn't awful, it just didn't do anything for me. It just seems a bit too random for me to be anything but maybe a comedy. We have Abe Lincoln and he wants to kill vampires. Not sure if they were being serious or not but it's one of those things where it was like they wanted to make a vampire movie but wanted to try and take it to the next level so they thought \\"Hey let's make Abraham Lincoln the vampire hunter\\". The acting was actually pretty good, which salvaged the movie for me to at least be able to finish it. It's just the premise that I couldn't buy for a movie in this genre. Not a terrible movie by any means, just didn't do it for me. A friend of mine loved the movie, so yeah completely subjective.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love these types of games where it has a lot of puzzles and not just hidden objects.  great story and challenging. another great game by G5. keep up the good work.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|Nothing really more to say than that really. I've read the graphic novel and this is pretty much as close to it as we can get in an animated feature. Even though this is Batman, this isn't necessarily something that is great for kids. It's a pretty dark story and some kids may be turned off by it. The story itself is great though. It has great voice acting and tells a great story of Batman/Bruce Wayne in his older years. This also finally introduces the first female Robin which my niece loved because she really got behind her. If it's a bit more of a mature slant on Batman that you're looking for then you should be happy with this. It ends on a great point, setting up for what should be an interesting start to part 2. I've already got my part 2 pre-ordered and can't wait for it to release.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I love the Tv show castle, so, given the good reviews this book received thought I would give it a go. It is different enough from the Tv show to keep your interest. A quick read and kept me entertained.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is just like temple run but harder better and funer I like temp to but this beets it
034544678X|5.0|If  you love dogs, you HAVE to read this book. There is information in it you would never figure out for yourself, and likely would be very difficult to find else where.<br /><br />The book after this one, FOR THE LOVE OF A DOG, is also wonderful.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This story makes you look at things in a whole new perspective. The characters in this story are just regularly people and I think everyone has a \\"Sam.\\" She was the backbone of the story. I think anyone who is having a hard time should read this story. It makes things seem not so bad.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is simply great! Every single thing Randy Quaid says & does is hysterical. Chevy Chase was near the end, but still in his &#34;power curve&#34;. Bev DiAngelo is awesome & Juliet Lewis' teenage performance was a window into great things to come. You also get fire, explosions & the humiliation of the two most hellish yuppies ever put on screen. Though I rented it, we will end up buying the DVD!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|did not enjoy the store line because it was very slow to the action...did not enjoy as much as the ones before this one...However, I enjoyed the ending
0738711500|5.0|I bought  this set after researching a number of books on Tarot. It comes with a set of cards and clearly spells out a process of learning to understand and interpret the meanings of each card. The book recommends you first complete the exercises before you attempt to read the cards for others. By doing this the author is confident you wont lose interest. I am still familiarising myself with the cards and am not rushing or taking short cuts as the authors suggests. I would recommend this set to anyone interested in tarot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Hours of fun for every age.  Glad I got this game - so enjoyable.  Who doesn't LOVE solitaire?  Can't go wrong with this one.
B00448SE4S|2.0|I watched this movie from a recommendation from a friend. The layout of the movie is a little weird in my opinion. It has a comic book/video game feel to the movie, and I believe it was intentional. It's normally not my genre of movie. There were some funny moments in the movie, but it was seldom, and I often found myself bored because the plot is a little confusing and I thought it was weird.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|was a great movie plenty of action, stream was of excellent quality, looking forward to streaming more movies more often
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I ordered this box set when it was on sale on Black Friday and I wasnt disappointed. The quality of the visuals are amazing and worth the price alone. The postcards and extra stuff in the box set made it really cool
B0063IH60K|1.0|I never ordered it, it never showed up on my Kindle, yet it was shown that I got it. etc.  Someone,somewhere is playing Solitaire and it is not  ME!!!!!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I haven't made a review on a faotd in a long time but this one was way worth it.  This game makes me so happy I grin from ear to ear. Brings back great memories and the controls are awesome! Camera angle moves as you steer as well, this game rocks.  6 stars if i could...
B003EPPEP4|5.0|This album invokes the sounds of the wonderful singers of the past.  Nikki Yanofsky is a great new entertainer on the scene.
B003B02O3C|3.0|Good book when traveling because it doesn't require a whole of attention yet is an entertaining read. His negative opinions of lawyers (he's one himself) is a lot of fun especially if you know a few lawyers. He's not a great literary stylist but it is a good read. His newest one his only non fiction is much better written
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Cause if you don't like friggin amazing highly stylized anime then you simply dont belong here!<br />Redline after 7 years in the making and entirely hand drawn is one of the GREATEST anime movies Ive seen! The story is great (Intergalactic Space Race With A Sci-Fi Twist) If you haven't seen then i suggest you watch this quick! Definitely in my Top anime bracket . . . Worth the buy and looks great in ANY Blu-Ray Collection!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My daughter (16) loved this movie when she was a little girl and watched over and over and over. Lately she has developed an appreciation for old movies and I thought it would be nice to get her this one. She was so happy!!! I think it's a great movie for all ages, a real classic! And I would definitely recommend it for any little girl (6 and above).
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Short answer YES! . . . Long answer . . . Hell YES! . . . This movie is definitely a must own/must see! Even if you never followed the Original Evangelion series these movies do a fantastic job in covering everything for hardcore fans (like myself) and regular anime fans. I am DYING to see the third installment of these movie series, and i can NEVER get tired of this anime ever . . . I definitely am glad to have given some money towards the EVA series . . . I suggest you do too . . . lolol ^_^
B0031FNYGS|5.0|Beautiful colors and design. The flowers are so pretty. My daughter really likes it. It's durable and should withstand her. A pretty little unicorn.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Mindless fun fun fun fun and some more fun. Did I say fun? I think I did but if you missed it I said fun.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Today I got angry birds hd and I thought it would be the same as this angry birds just in hd. But sure was I fooled! I actually got unlimtid mighty eagles (for one 1$) and much better graphics.<br />  I found it funner to play in the hd version than the original version. Now I can have twice the amount of fun than this version which I play all levels but have worst graphics, no mighty eagle, and no free power ups.<br />  Yes, there are power ups in the hd version. you start with 5 of each power up ( the power ups are the same as In angry birds friends on facebook, but only the old 4), But you may choose to buy more power ups. But you also get 1 free power up every day.<br />  If you want the mighty eagle in the full version (hd or add free) but your worried that you might fail and just keep waisting your money, then not to worry. Once you buy the mighty eagle once, you have unlimited mighty eagles. and that gives you twice the fun.<br />  There is one thing that might make you mad though. I'm not sure if there is a way to transfer your data from this version of angry birds to the full version, but I do not think there is. So, you can't transfer the data, but if you truly do like the game then you will not care (like me).<br />  But the main reason I'm saying this is because you probably think, this is the full version. It will soon cost 3$ but I think at around 5p.m. from the day this was posted, so you should order either the hd version or add free version soon. The hd version is better than the add free version so try to get the hd version. But if you want to spend less, get the add free version (always 1$).<br />  I mainly talked about the full version but that was because this was a great demo version. This had all the levels to play for free. But it does not have the best experience. To get the full experience with at least. x2 the fun or for me xinfinite ( notice I meant the x=times) the fun.<br />  So if you do want more fun then get the full version. But like I said before, this is still a great demo.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Good movie but couldn't watch in HD on my HD computer. But SD wasn't bad just would prefer 720p orver 420p.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I was just board and went to the app store and I was sure surprised when I saw this one.<br /><br />  I thought this would sucked because, the video did not look so good, the photo, and according to the video, I did not notice the controles in the video. So that made me think it was bad.<br /><br />  But once I actually played it, it was easy controlled, had neat graphics, and a thrilling racing game. For those who have never played a racing game on their phone or aracade, (though most of you have probably) the left controll is to de-celerate and the right controll is to accelerate. I am only saying  this because in the game it does not come out and tell you. But the obvious controll how to move to turn left move your device left and right, we already know how to go right.<br /><br />  I am submitting this review from the first 30 seconds that I have played this game. So I don't know if there is a controll button that tells you the controll and all. But I will play this app more.<br /><br />btw:  I keep spelling controll like that because my device (kindle fire) keeps putting that and I don't want to keep going back and fourth so, yeah, you get it
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Great movie...especially in bluray. Would recommend this to any action movie junkie! Most enjoyable on good 5.1 sound system.<br />Thanks!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book.....not all what I was expecting but really loved it! I would recommend it to anyone who loves romance with a twist. Anyone with a fantasy of love.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Got this movie for my husband.  He loved it.  I actually liked this one, too.  It has a bit more story line than some that have come out recently and the action scenes were well done.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I love this. It gives you a reality check kind of and progressively gets harder every level for a challenge. I hope others like it as much as I do. &lt;3
B00009APK1|5.0|The epic story continues in this beautifully done full-screen adaption that wraps around you and pulls you in like few stories have ever done.  Breathtaking.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so it is a great app but I did one of the reasent updates and now on scaviging mode thears no creepers or anything. otherwise it is a great app:)
B000000H57|5.0|My husband loves this band and the fatalistic sense of humor in which their music is written.  It is definitely one of his favorites.
B002UXRH10|5.0|Bought this for my wife when she wanted this CD. She is happy so I' m happy. What more can I say.
B000000H6Y|5.0|Got this for my husband and he loved it.  It is a darkly humored cd that fit his personality very well.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is awesome<br />IT LETS you shoe.your.art. you donnt even need to know to draw. It's really fun for all ages
B000002IV8|5.0|I had this on cassette way back when and it was always one of my favorites.  They had a unique way of seeing the world that I appreciated then and still do now.
1442339586|1.0|Not a bad book, and it is funny. However, it is a book on how to be a man's man, and having said that a guide to how most heterosexual men operate. Not really sure I need the advice from the guy who played Doogie Howser/Barney? I mean he really kinda has been breaking the very first and ultimate Bro Code or Man Law of all time, right?
B000000H4V|5.0|Chaos is exactly what you get when you listen to this cd.  But it is in the best of ways!  A classic that trransports you into another place and gives you a taste of the way it is on the end of the world.  Its a look inside what its like to wear the other shoe and what creates the bodies that make the grass on the other side so much greener.  Insightful as it is gritty and that much more perfect because of it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A good book, is one that changes you after you've read it; and this one in particular is incredible moving.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|There is another zoo set that is a lot more money and only a few more blocks, this one is the way to go if you want the unique animals.

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I am a big fan of hidden object games - they have simple game play and, when done right, have a good story line. This game adds a few puzzles (still fairly simple) and the story line is...okay. I got it as the free app of the day but think it's well worth the $0.99. It takes a decent amount of time to work through it so it is definitely comparable to a rental movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't even now how to start this off so let me say this is amazing. I instantly fell in love with each of these characters. They all seemed human, and even though most of them had there own problems they didn't let it dictate there lives. And the writing made me laugh so much my family thought I was on pills. And cry so hard they thought I was bipolar.  Just please for the love of all things good read this book. It will not disappoint.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Excelente todo salio bien, me llegó el producto a mi pais en perfecto estado. . . . . . .
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A touching, relatable story that captivates the heart. This book had me in tears at some moments and smiling the next.A must-read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved it! Would defiantly recommended to anyone who was that kind of person in school lol. First book I've finished in awhile.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I give this book a five star rating because Greg is at it again with his funny problems again. Manny is so silly and it is so funny when Greg Uncle comes and lives with them he is trying to find a date to the Valentine's day dance will he find one???????
B009SQRL4U|4.0|We rented this to watch with the in-laws.  It's a nice little animated Christmas movie that's perfect for the whole family.  The elves and Grand Santa steal the show.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking Up Married, was a great book that always kept you on the edge of your seat, I strongly recommend it!!
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|I bought this movie for my baby boy. He really love to watch this movie on his new DVD portable player
B003WUYRGI|3.0|My review of this dictionary is an excellent help in understanding how to use a dictionary and to now how to spell. It is a great way for students to spell check for a test or a great deal that deals with spelling. It also is a great idea to auto correct the misspelled words.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|I bought this movie as part of the christmas present for my baby boy, he love it. 100% recomended. Discount price
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I find this a fantastic book. I am about half way through.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre. Several people in our book group proposed this book and so we selected it for this month.  I am the leader of the book group and we select books at the previous meeting for the next meeting. Want that book?  You gotta show up and lobby for the book you want the group to read next.  About 4 people lobbied for this book with great enthusiasm. It's a long read and thoroughly enjoyable. Some reviewers have described this book as a high-action story written with a poet's hand.  I thoroughly agree. The central character, Kvothe, is very appealing and Rothfuss develops him well. Kvothe is both &#34;is both flawed and heroic. He's proud, arrogant, way too clever by half, better at everything than a man should be for his own good, and thus fundamentally human.&#34; (from a Seattlepi.com review).  There are many reviews of this book online.  Read them to be persuaded, or not, about this book.  I feel all of them do a good job of capturing the story with truly readable and lovely prose. I say get it, read it, enjoy it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|If you're interested in achieve succes you need to read this book, Steve Jobs it's a rolemodel to me, also his friend Woz, an inredible life described by an excelent author.
B005723JSQ|5.0|What a delight this book was! I think it's supplanted Twenties Girl as my favorite Sophie Kinsella story. I'm not usually a big fan of books where texts/e-mails are the main form of communication between characters, but Sophie handled it so well and I loved seeing the evolution of the relationship between Poppy (phone \\"borrower') and Sam (uptight businessman who's too busy to look at, much less respond to, his e-mails.) As always, Kinsella did a masterful job with the comedic bits in the book. I LOL every time I flash back to several of them. And I have to give her kudos for giving some layers to her leads in this one. There was some real pathos to Poppy's backstory and some interesting twists and turns in Poppy's relationship with her fiance Magnus.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't think worked in I've Got Your Number were the footnotes. They were a clever idea since Magnus was an academic who wrote books with lots of footnotes, but they broke up the flow of the story, especially if you read the book on an e-reader because you have to click on the number and go back and forth to different pages to see what the footnotes meant. But that's a minor quibble and doesn't keep me from giving this entertaining book a solid 5 stars. Heck, I'd give the book 5 stars just for the ending alone, which I thought was incredibly romantic (It made me tear up!)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is good a and awesome<br /> and amazing how much you can see how to make the next time you're lookin guy
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I am a big fan of the movie and got this set for Christmas. It's limited edition and comes with a certificate of authenticity, as wel as the CD soundtrack, DVD/Blu Ray, and several hardbound books that have photos and stories from the making of the film. I am so glad I got this!!! And on Amazong you can't beat the price. I got this at Christmas holiday for around $30 when original price is around $90.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It is vary good it is a great book and even tells u how 2 pronounce the words. It is the cooliest
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Bright and cheery. Good go to music for getting around town. Like it even more than I expected. Get it.
159420411X|4.0|What could have been a difficult topic was very well handled. Provided insight in to disparate elements such as political forecasting, weather, chess, poker,baseball and the economy. Well done, especially the discussions related to Baysean analysis and the need to think in terms of probabilities.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|We certainly liked Merida, but my oh my:  the amount of what I call 12-year-old boy humor dominated the film.  The men still dominated screen time, and the stupidity of most of the men (not to mention the violence) made this a thumbs down disappointment.
B0082EOJYE|5.0|The Artist is absolutely brilliant and flawless. It is a beautifully filmed and scored black-and-white homage<br />to the silent film era, and a touching love story as well. I cannot think of ANYTHING that could have been<br />done to make the film better in any way. It deserved every Oscar it got.
0316066524|1.0|Bought this to read with my book group.  I guess I am just not smart enough to get this book.  Some of the descriptions are hilarious, but the overall story - at least so far - is zzzzz.  If I hadn't committed to reading it with my group, I wouldn't bother to finish it.  I can tell he was a gifted writer, but I really shouldn't have to work this hard to enjoy the story.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Attractive alarm app with weather and non-abrasive alarm sounds.  A huge plus for road warriors is the nightstand mode, which keeps it on all night so it is like carrying your own digital alarm with you.  Just plug it in and throw it on a collapsible sticky-stand to hold it upright.  The white noise is a little disappointing -- it's just a static sound. (I run Sleepy Time Lite in the background for its soothing nature sounds.)  Don't like the ads?  Turn off your network connect.  I ended up using this so much, I broke down and spent the two bucks on the full version.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|love this movie.  loved the book and never knew it was made into a movie until recently.  love love love
B005XN0SGU|5.0|This viewer does exactly what it says it will. It took a bit of playing with, but after a few minutes I got the hang of the features and functions. I love it! I am using it for all my &#34;mobi&#34; files.
B00A2BTCXI|1.0|i am on my second copy of this dvd and it turns out it will not work on several sony bluray players.<br /><br />first i tried it in my sony bdp-s360 and it would not load at all. in fact it kept freezing the player so i would have to unplug it just to eject the disc.<br /><br />so i tried it on my older sony bdp-s350 unit. the disc would load and even let me select the DTS-HD or 5.1 surround sound section. but when the disc plays it is only in regular stereo, not surround sound. if i stop the disc to try and change the audio, it also freezes the player.<br /><br />i returned the disc believing that is was defective. now i am on my second disc and the status is the same on both bluray players. i updated the firmware on both players also and no change.<br /><br />so i paid a lot of money for a disc i can not listen to the way it was meant to be heard (in surround sound)
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Crashes every time I go to make a drawing. I can't use the app because of that, its a little frustrating.
B005IQZB14|5.0|i was actually a little sad when it ended... if you have ever been lost or looking for a way to find yourself this is an inspirational story to read (if you can get over the toe nails!!! ;) )
B0086700CM|5.0|I like this game its really cool. I love playing it all the time. my son loves playing it too.
0399159029|5.0|I enjoyed this novel immensely with the World War II background in Prague and Berlin.  As a work of fiction with plausible historical information, I found it intriguing and a good \\"page turner,\\" and the central character, Bernie, and his girl friend make this even more intriguing. Kerr did a great job leading me on.  Adding some historical information at the end is a good way to initiate interest in other novels of this type.  I like Kerr's writing, and I get a good idea about his characters---even the ones who are historically real.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|The LifeProof case does everything it boasts. It's waterproof - I've taken it to the beach and the pool and have taken great underwater pictures. It's shockproof, I've dropped it from over 6 feet and my phone has miraculously been fine - with no chips to the case. It's sand/mud proof, I've gotten my phone dropped in a mud puddle and beach sand and both washed off - with Dawn soap at that. I work at the hospital and can spray my phone down with Lysol and keep it sanitized when necessary.<br /><br />BUT..... It just doesn't hold up as far as vigorous use. Now I'm not talking about dropping it and soaking it down everyday. I'm just talking about normal and everyday use without worrying about water damage/damage to the phone. I've had three so far. The first two only lasted about 4 months with different issues on each one. The first case I had managed to get a crack on the bottom flap by the charge port one morning when I pulled it off of the charger too quickly in a morning rush. The crack made it no longer waterproof. Something I used frequently. However, one call to LifeProof and bam, I received a new one. All they needed was the serial numbers located on both sides of the case. My second one lasted about the same length of time - only this time the inner layer that seals the phone was broken after only the second time opening the case. These cases are not designed to be opened very often. I opened it once to put the case on, the second opening broke the seal completely - I was at the apple store and needed the phone out of the case. Once again, LifeProof replaced it again so overall the customer service is great. The warranty on these cases is great, just be prepared to become LifeProof's customer service BFF because you will be contacting them alot if you plan on keeping the case on with heavy use.
B0076OW9DE|5.0|Paul doing oldies plus two  bonus tracks.  If you are a Paul fan you will love it.  Thats it. ENJOY!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this game was all I thought it was going to be and more. I love playing this game in my spare time.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Please comment on my review if you know how to pass the final level!! I know you hit the big guy on the head with the ice but he still catches up to me! How frustrating to be stuck at the last level. :(<br /><br />Anyway...This game is something really special. The artwork is beautiful and colorful and a joy to behold. I also really enjoy the gameplay. It feels original, I can't compare it to another game. Your little sleepwalker constantly moves, and you have to move objects and platforms to keep him on track and collect all of the treasures. I'm thrilled I bought this game, it's definitely worth the price. I would recommend it to anyone. Keep in mind you can try it for 15 minutes (and get a refund within that time) if you get it from the play store. Amazon doesn't even like to refund apps that don't work. Other suggestions: zombro, draw a stickman epic, rayman jungle run, they need to be fed.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Well it's Christmas morning and I'm playing the new CD that my brother sent me before even having the coffee brewing. Great pick brother, and Merry Christmas. That evening we went down to the man cave and played the Concert DVD, I was blown away. This is an Epic reunion 30 years after the split.<br /><br />I was surprised at Plant's vocals which were in my opinion pretty decent considering that as time goes by the old pipes can get rusty. Definitely not the case in this instance.<br /><br />Jimmy Page was as usual at the top of his game. He effortlessly paraded across the stage while peeling off lead break after glorious lead break. The man is a god. John Paul Jones provides great bass and organ with some pretty fancy psychedelic moments which brought back the 70's feel once again. And of course, Jason sitting in for his father John, how appropriate. Filling his Dad's shoes with ease, fantastic.<br /><br />The performance was top shelf as expected. Celebration Day captures a more streamlined band, men in their 60's determined to prove they can still cut it. Over 16 songs and two hours, they do just that.<br /><br />A great gift brother. Again Merry Christmas.<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out You Tube for full concert.
B0081SPK0I|2.0|this game was fun for the first 2 minutes but for some reason it froze my kindle fire twice to the point that I had to restart it and its not like a phone where you could pull the battery to restart the system its a pain I uninstalled this game maybe if the bugs get fixes ill reinstall
B00007GZR5|5.0|I love this movie, its a hart worming movie. all about true love and how true love can over come anything.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I loved it! I really recommend this to my family and they try to find it but they can't because they do not have a kindle ;)
B00A12VJZM|5.0|What more can I say, one of the top five Rocker's with some of th egreatest songs in rock for $6. MP3 format and no $$ going to Apple for a rip-off price. What more can I say!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have never played spider solitare that was so user friendly.. Great and easy to use.<br />I recommend to anyone....
0525953728|3.0|Not a terribly insightful book.  I expected more - not sure why the military cares that it was written.  Just OK.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Quite an involved plot, which I really like!  Not funny like The Litigators, but the plot made up for it.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great game for kindle fire. Match 3 games are my favorite<br /> and this one certainly measures up. You can't go wrong at 99 cents.
0345495004|5.0|True love will defy all of the social behavior that has been endorsed by the rest of us.  Artists seem to have a way of loving deeply without regards to the terms of society.  Should it not be?
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I love this character. The authors writting immerses you in a deep Society. Classic dnd themes are noticed if you have ever sat with  your friends o play the game. Couldnt put down the book.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|The author had taken a great opportunity to show us that we can find the good in everything and that we can comfort, support and encouragement to absolutely everyone.  What a great life stork.

1423113454|5.0|This is an exciting read and also makes one wonder about the happenings of the day.  Is there magic out there that we should be utiziling?  Are we being niave in our vanilla approach to lif?
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham never disappoints.  Always puts a great spin on the story and keeps the reader interested.  I simply cannot pick a favorite of his - they are all great!
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Didn't like the movie nearly as much as the last one. I guess the performance by Heath Ledger spoiled this one. Worse was the Flixster ultraviolet offer. Using the web site was painful. Took forever to load the home page and had to keep clicking on the continue button after entering the code for the movie. Then when signing up for an account it just hung until finally getting a server error message. Not very professional.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 4 year old nephew loves this movie.  It was a hit this Christmas.  The story is sweet and one of his favorites.
0062119044|3.0|About twenty or thirty pages into Lionel Shriver's almost 400-page novel I decided that the entire scenario -- a mother whose sixteen-year-old son had massacred his classmates in a Columbine-like shooting now writing letters to her estranged husband -- was just not credible.  I would think that a mother who had just been through sixteen years of fighting against a sociopath son, and the attendant global media frenzy spawned by her son's atrocious act would want to get as far away from her son and her husband as possible, not see the son regularly in prison and to write long incriminating letters to the father.  I also find the very tone of these letters -- glib, almost to the point of celebratory -- distracting and annoying.  Where's the depression, the haunting guilt, and the grief in these letters?<br /><br />This is an extremely dark and cynical novel, and there just isn't much to like in this novel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got very interested since the begining, very good book I higly recomend it! to all the avid readers, and I just starting the third book.
B0064W65SO|5.0|I found this really entrancing and it was one of the best I have read concerning the Batman's origins. The art is great an it was worth what I spent. Great comic.
B004X30XPC|5.0|Ella & Joe are arguably the finest who ever lived at what they do. When I was sudying jazz guitar under Herb Ellis, Herb told me that Joe was the best guitarist ever to pick up the axe. Nothing need be said about Ella.<br /><br />The vocals with guitar doing the job as only Joe can do it are so gorgeous that I immediately ordered the other album they did together. As far as the tunes go, they are all well done, but especially \\"My Ship,\\" \\"By Myself,\\" & \\"My Man\\" were my favs on the album. The combination of vocals plus guitar are great.<br /><br />Well, that's it. Thanks for reading my review.
B008B68IEA|4.0|Abbey's bed doesn't look exactly like the picture but it is still very nice.  In the picture it looks very clear but is instead more white.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Son loved this. I thought it was on his wish list but it was the wrong name, so make sure of that. But he likes it anyway.
B008B68IUY|5.0|My daughter received this item for Christmas.  This car is very detailed and fully functional.  It will fit up to 4 monster high dolls.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Complex, but not disconnected. You can follow along with the plot and don't have to wonder where the ending can be explained. Took only one and a half days to read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Very difficult for some children, OK for adults.  Gets a little boring at times but can be fun for some
B006O3MU96|4.0|The game is so adorable and funny. Can't help but laugh, he reminds me of QBert in many ways. Love it!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a great book for dog lovers. A friend recommended it to me and so it was my first read on my new kindle. No regrets. This book will make you laugh and cry and think about how much your dog really knows.<br /><br />This would also be a good read after recently putting your pawed best friend down. It helps comfort the soul and give you a better idea of how at peace they are now. Amazing perspective.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is just the easiest and best way to keep in touch with all of my family that live so far away!

B0091LS07E|3.0|I really enjoy Alicia's more traditional &#34;jazzy&#34; style.  &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; is great.  Maybe I just need to listen to the CD more to get used to the new songs?  It would probably also help if I were of the younger generation.
B0036R92V2|5.0|Django the real one the original i love it... .This is really a good buy.I will watch it over and over..
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I play this 2 disc CD set over and over in my car and do NOT get tired of it.  I also listen while working on my rubber stamping projects as wonderful background inspiration.  It's great!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I finished this just before midnight on the 25th. Of December it is the first of Charles Dickens I have read and I enjoyed it immensely.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Recently purchased this package and was able to play the cd's while on a long road trip. I must say, most excellent! The boys are back together for possibly the last time with Jason Bonham doing an excellent job of filling his dad's shoes. Jimmy Page still blisters the guitar and John Paul Jones is as good as ever. Robert Plant has a bit of trouble with the high notes, but it is great to hear him front Led Zeppelin once again. No one does it better.<br />I have been most fortunate to have grown up on Led Zeppelin, purchasing all of their albums upon initial release. This release is the icing on the cake.<br />I am looking forward to watching the Blu-Ray version now that listening to the cd's has put images in my head. I am sure it will not disappoint.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This is an awesome movie!!! It has every action hero from my childhood plus more!!! And it doesn't get better than Chuck Norris making a Chuck Norris joke!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When my best friend told me about this game I did not think it would be as good as temple run. She always talks about it and how it is so addicting. When I tried it on her ipod it was out of this world. I saw it at the appstore on Christmas Day and it was a Christmas miracle.My little sister got a kindle fire hd and I got the app for her.During the night she snick in the kitchen and got her kindle fire hd to play Subway Surfers:).<br />I recommend this game for everyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an interesting and quick read. However, I disliked the majority of the characters. I also felt that some of the characteres should have been developed a bit more to understand their motivations a bit more clearly.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Even though the series are ongoing, this is the one of the tv show to continue following!<br />Can't wait to buy the next season dads

B000HKW7E0|5.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  This movie has been around for many years and it's still one of our favorite movies.  This movie is especially great at Christmas time when everyone can sit and spend some time together.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Getting a dual mp3 album at this price for Christmas was wonderful.  Thanks Amazon.  As ever Bob Marley is great as usual.  Almost all of his familiar hits are on this album.  I listened to both sides as soon as it finished downloading.  What a delight to find this album in Amazon's mp3 Christmas Specials, so thanks again Amazon and the Marley folks for agreeing to be in the Christmas specials.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I love Kay Scarpetta books. This one wasn't as much of a page turner as others.  A great story with twists and turns. Go ahead and read it, you won't regret it.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|If you're debating on  watching it, just pull the trigger.  The movie doesn't disappoint. Don't expect an Oscar worthy story line, but the movie keeps you engaged throughout.  Think of Inception with one less layer of reality.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I purchased it and when it was downloading it paused and I cannot unpause it, so I cannot get the app.

0345803507|5.0|This trilogy was superb, intoxicating and simply magnificent. I hope the author E.L.James comes up with another fabulous collection, so l could become enamored all over again. I hope her main character again would be Mr. Christian Grey.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|The only funny scenes were in the 1st half of the movie, most of which were spoiled in the previews.  Then, half way through the movie, it turned weird and almost like they were switching to romantic comedy format.  Extremely disappointing, as I looked forward to seeing this for over 6 months.
0345803493|5.0|l was hooked from beginning to end. Fabulous!!!!! I would not put the book down, it got to the point that l would not answer the phone unless it was SOS.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|CD arrived in very good conditions, appears to be brand new. Plastic still on Cd case, not distroyed, very happy :)
B000SEIK2S|5.0|One of the few Kindle books I have actually paid full price for lately. It was well worth the $7.99 I spent on it.<br /><br />A good sci-fi romp with a fairly unique premise.<br /><br />I read it in a couple days. It was one of those books that was good enough I could have read it straight through.<br /><br />It is fiction and some if it is hard to swallow as far as the science goes. But, I had fun reading it and that is what I care about.<br /><br />Imaginative battles that revolve around small groups of desperate soldiers in close combat are one big draw of this book.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is one of the best shows still around! I think a lot of writers could learn from the writers for this show and what NOT to focus on to make a show a HIT!
B0002V7O3I|5.0|This movie came out when I was a child and my kids now love it too. It is very entertaining!
0375703764|1.0|I have nothing to say about this book except that it's pretentious and half the pages are blank.  i feel like i bought brian griffin's \\"wish it, want it, do it\\"...

1455519006|5.0|I'm a first time Baldacci reader, and I LOVED this book! I personally thought the beginning few chapters were a little slow and drawn out, but then the storyline really got going.  I especially like the short chapters since most of my reading is done on my lunch break. I loved each and every character, and couldn't get enough of Will Robie and Julie Getty. I really fell in love with the two characters, and the determination each had to figure out what went wrong.  I secretly hope that Baldacci will continue Robie's adventures and have Robie end up working with Vance again while maybe have something develop between the two.  There were a lot of twists and turns, and I couldn't predict the ending no matter how hard I tried.<br /><br />I look forward to ordering more Baldacci books.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Stephen King is my writing coach--even though I've never read more than two of his books. Here's why: it's Christmas day, and I'm writing. I love King because he gives me permission for this singularly obsessive behavior and lifestyle.<br />In On Writing, he tells an interviewer that he writes every day \\"except Christmas, Fourth of July and birthdays\\" and in this book he confesses, \\"Actually, I write on Christmas, the Fourth and my birthday too. I just didn't want to sound like a workaholic dweeb.\\"<br />Thank God I'm not alone! As I become a more experienced and disciplined writer, I get new insight out of it.<br />The first time I read On Writing, I mulled over King's messed-up childhood, as any good therapist will, and concluded it was why he was a horror writer, and liked his downhome \\"you can do it, just keep falling forward\\" tone.<br />The second time I read it, I was amazed at the fact that he could write such a wonderful, honest, humorous and helpful book practically on his deathbed after getting mangled in a hit-and-run.<br />The third time I read it, I mulled over his premise, that ideas pre-exist in space/time and the writer only unearths them \\"like fossils.\\" I think stories (and especially archetypal characters) exist in the collective unconscious, an intuition based on Jungian psychology. Writers are the telepaths and scribes of the dreaming world's stories, not the inventors of them.<br />On the fourth reading, I was reminded about the Elements of Style and bought it. I also went on an adverb and attribution hunt in my latest WIP, and was glad I did.<br />In this, my fifth reading, I finally really get what King says about the discipline of daily writing. I still admire and aspire to his daily goal of 2,000 words. I find his admission that he virtually never takes time off validating. (It's put paid to my worries I'm becoming over-obsessed, even bipolar about my writing, surging up and down in my emotions with my characters and their plights.)<br />King is unapologetically prolific and I am too. Even in my daily life, my stories go on behind the backs of my eyes. I can feel my busy brain working all the time, and a longing to return to the page is always there, a sort of nagging hunger like an addict must feel. As a mental health professional, I'm investigating what's happening to me--and part of me has been frightened by the transformation.<br />King says it's okay, and even necessary.<br />King's not \\"normal\\"--but whoever in the world has followed a passion and been normal? I just want to write every day, even Christmas--because the stories I'm meant to write burn to be shared. Normal is overrated.is unapologetically prolific and I am too.

B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is very clear and easy to play.  The tiles are not focusing and it makes it a very good eye exercise.
0061537969|4.0|It is a very interesting book. It makes you stop and think about relationships and how you could relate better to other people. I would recommend reading this book.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I like it a lot great show very entertaining one of the best shows on tv should be renewed next year
0394804406|5.0|I rebought this book for my son's 42nd birthday!  He was thrilled again, as I read it to him time after time after time.  It is a classic book and will never go out of style!  I still use one the chief phrases in this book, &#34;Fish are fish and frogs are frogs, and that's that&#34;.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|it drives me crazy that I can only get 15 news feeds at a time. Maybe I am not using it correctly but it doesn't seem like rocket science. I haven't been able to find an answer either.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It is well written, very suspenseful, and the type of book you can't wait to continue reading. Very troubling subject especially after what happened in Newtown, CT

1451695195|5.0|The author describes sequences of experiences and changes in view points as he (i.e. consciousness or point of awareness) moves through varying levels of materialism. A very good read and I highly recommend this book. [[ASIN:1451695195 Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife]]Also I think that people who can relate to this book would enjoy \\"The Tiger Fang\\" by Paul Twitchell where his travels through the levels of consciousness are described.[[ASIN:B0012FXK8Q The Tiger's Fang]]

B0058YPGVQ|5.0|One of the greatest shows on television. Preordered 2 weeks before release and came on release date. Now waiting for season 5 to come out on blu-ray.
1469203839|4.0|&#34;The Wise Man's fears -the second book in the series was well written. I enjoyed this book it was well written other than the two problems mentioned in the headlines. It had too much profanity and too much explicit sex for me. The storyline is well thought out, and keeps you riveted to the book. Do read the first book in the series start parentheses the name of the wind and parentheses. Without reading book 1, you will be lost on a lot of things that happen in book 2. You should understand that Patrick takes a long time between books. There was about five years or more between book 1 and book 2 of the series, book 2 was finished in 2012. So it could be a number of years before book 3 is out., In the book is telling his life story and by the end of book 2 is only up to the age of 17.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Awesome book. Read them in two days; I had to see how it all ended. Adding it to my list of favorites.
7799128836|5.0|This movie is great. It is also great for learners of Mandarin. You need to watch this movie. Smiley face.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Just brilliant :) love this book, I haven't highlighted this much since college! Very inspiring & at the same time very soothing, like a reading meditation. Thank you for sharing Anita!
0316154687|3.0|I like this book, but I don't really like the author. He's okay, but I guess just not my cup of tea.<br /><br />It was set up pretty well, but some things could have been placed a little better.<br /><br />I like the fact that he incorporates pieces of his life and such in his work. The stories weren't bad.<br /><br />Something just didn't sit right with me, I suppose.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wow! John Grisham just keeps getting better and better! Finished this book in one day because I just couldn't put it down!

B005LAJ16I|5.0|Don't subscribe to Showtime so have missed this program.  Came highly recommended and it didn't disappoint.  Was a bargain when on sale and a much better way to watch than paying monthly subscriber rates.  Great program.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So many of the self/indie published books I have read were duds- mediocre stories not well told or well edited. This has been the case so often that I am reluctant to try/buy new ones and don't review most of them because the cascade of one and two star reviews would overwhelm the better books I review.  I also don't typically review books that hundreds of others have already reviewed because there's no new ground to cover. But with this book I just can't help myself.  Hopeless by Colleen Hoover blew me away. It's a world apart from those other indie/self published books.<br /><br />Hopeless is a dark, emotional story that despite its title ends up being filled with hope.  The book touches on sensitive subjects such as custody matters, suicide, bullying, and sexual abuse.  They are treated as complex issues with far-reaching emotional, physical, and legal consequences, rather than as \\"after-school specials\\" to be easily resolved.<br /><br />As the reader I was willing to handle these problems with the characters for one simple reason- I was deeply emotionally connected.  The mystery of Sky's childhood is fairly easy to deduce by the average/discerning reader. Even so, there is still an incredible amount of tension (and heartbreak) in experiencing the discovery of it with her. And there's an incredible amount of delight in experiencing with her the developing relationship with Holder.  Upon meeting, Holder and Sky feel an instant connection, but love develops slowly and believably. There is intense emotion and passion here, not to mention exquisite sexual tension (the hottest non-kissing date ever!).  I have never met a real boy/man so open to talking about his feelings and both his physical and emotional needs, but I hope they are out there.  I have every faith these two have what it takes to make it, no matter what else in life may knock them down.<br /><br />A perfect book?  Not quite.  I don't think the use of the present tense was appropriate, especially for scenes in the past. Some of the secondary characters, though appealing, were not well fleshed out. (I think the author's focus was on Sky and Holder which I can't complain about too much!)  I do appreciate that Sky's biological father was given some complexity rather just being a one-sided baddie.  At times the intensity of the relationship and the story bordered on melodrama, but never crossed the line thanks to the real issues and the naked emotional honesty.<br /><br />As Holder and Sky might say, I \\"lived\\" this book. I melted, I held my breath, I stayed up all.night.long to travel this road with them in one sitting. I will re-read it over and over again.nes in the past.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|This was well packaged and of great quality! Great gift package and well worth the cost. Great experience and a solid gift idea.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is not only consistently adept at accurately and meticulously presenting the intricacies of competent homicide investigations, he also has the skilled writer's flair for complex character development. Inevitably a single piece of evidence discovered by his dedicated protagonist, Harry Bosch, proves significant in a long chain of evidence which eventually results in the downfall of the guilty party. And the suspense he creates in this book is riveting and realistic. As a former single parenting father of a teen-aged daughter, I was also able to thoroughly appreciate how well Connelly captures the complexities, tenderness, and nuances of Harry Bosch's relationship to his teen-aged daughter, Maddie. This is a very fine book on many levels; a dedicated, driven protagonist with the utmost integrity working in a non supportive environment; who is also a loving, struggling single parent dealing with periodic guilt that his parenting is not as adequate as it should be. I highly recommend The Black Box by Michael Connelly.  John A. Martin, Jr.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This was well packaged and of great quality! Great gift package and well worth the cost. Great experience and a solid gift idea.

B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Embarrassed that I read this.  Just sickeningly silly writing. Probably better than what I could produce, but not my taste. Had to force myself to finish. Very happy day today that I can move on.
B005FISBTO|5.0|An other wonderful addition to my set of DVD's.  The sixth season arrived in excellant condition.  Anyone that likes Dexter will enjoy this.

B0036BK6MW|5.0|Absolutely great and inspiring movie that is actually based on a real event.  Highly recommend everyone sees this movie! Price is great as well.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|If you like Nikita you must own the series on DVD's.  If you missed just one episode you will love having the series.
B002XXLKHY|3.0|Ok for a comedy but not as funny as I had heard.  Doesn't give that warm, fuzzy Christmas feeling like most kid-friendly movies do.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I liked the very beginning but I hate the way it's written.  I finished it because I had paid $11 for the Kindle edition, I tried and I tried but it was an agony.  Confusing,not well well written (I am sorry),  it really left me empty.  I have a friend that tried to read it and gave up.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|lee Childs is like eating box of yummy chocolates...a decadent pleasure that never disappoints! all of his books are uniformly wonderful!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|After several plot lines reach a climactic fervor in the third Book of the series, this book make a far (and somewhat odd) departure from the 3 previous to introduce some new characters.  It is a bit of a discombobulating effect that I really didn't enjoy, particularly since the 3rd book is so good.
B00AB0AXU6|4.0|It wasn't the best Resident Evil movie but i did enjoy it. it was cool, just not the s*** lol
0812550706|5.0|Many books and movies have thought about how to use children.... but this book takes a different perspective. The concept that children are smart and that if you stop treating them as &#34;children with wild imaginations&#34; that you can mold them into being brilliant. Often parents speak baby talk to toddlers, how does this help them grow and adapt? This book looks at both sides of the puzzle, what can, and what will happen. I think that this book is wonderful for young readers as well as adults and should be a class requirement in 7th grade.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|Being a drama groupie I love seeing the extras.  Loved the books and having the movies is great as well.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|First, the book is better with the female lead being a Canadian diplomat. I feel that this sets the the risk higher for all sides.<br /><br />The movie is smart, and the dream of anyone that has had head trauma. The art direction is not limited to one country making the story line almost limitless; and the camera angles and characters have a very grounded sense of reality. This leads the audience to feel like they are in the movie, and the director has a wonderful way of setting up and answering questions. Matt Damon I feel makes this a movie that both men and women can enjoy.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|This version of Mahjong was too difficult for me because the designs were so similar.  On our Kindle Fire HD it was hard to tell the difference between each tile.  It kind of defeats the purpose of playing if you can't even tell what you're doing.  There are better options out there.
0790729393|5.0|Sleepers is one if my favorite movies. A ton of great actors makes it worth watching many times... I highly recommend it.
B006O6F932|5.0|It was cheaper than the stores here in my country, I am very happy with the product and my niece too!
B004EPZ070|1.0|Movie would not play when I watched it on a normal dvd player, and skipped on a high tech dvd player! I was very disappointed!
B00A5052YE|4.0|Great album.  A couple of the songs she could've done without -- like the Jamaican style song \\"Limitedless\\".  Other than that, great adult music.  \\"One Thing\\" and \\"Brand New Me\\" are my favorites!
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|Did not work was useless to use would never sync with Bluetooth could not use product with iPad 2 sorry
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Great feel good, love life songs to listen in your car with the windows down. New on the scene making fans left and right!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We enjoy competing with each other on the amount of moves it takes to complete each puzzle. We Love it
B006P0FIGU|5.0|It really sticks to the book!!! Soo many good looking guys, yum yum!!! Add in a dash of humor and you have a great movie!!
B001VLXNLU|5.0|A lot of people may not like this vampire series because the main character comes off as shallow and idiotic sometimes, but the books go deeper as the main character grows. Almost all of the main characters, Stevie Rae specifically, are very dynamic and become more realistic with their issues. Mostly a page turning suspenseful read with a lot of twists and surprises. I wouldn't really recommend this book to people who do not like vampires of course, teenage drama, romance, or inspirational/gooey books. If you do though, this is the series for you to begin! It is pg13 enough for young teens to read but has enough (barely) sensual scenes for young adults to enjoy. Even if you don't like any of the things above I listed but you enjoy altered realities and fantasy then youll enjoy this. If you have also read the Vampire Academy series, i would compare this to be its softer more innocent sister.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I'm more inclined toward her old work but this is right up there in my highly listened to mp3s!!! I'm a fan regardless!!
1449410243|5.0|The oatmeal is a great website and this book, being a product of it, was well worth the money. Love it.
B00622B3MY|5.0|Feel good movie with no humans included!! Super funny and great new characters make it a great sequel to watch over and over.
0321714113|5.0|Have been reading it since I got it. Very informative and helpful. Would definitely recommend this to anyone considering c++.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|most amazing first person shooter ever made for a handheld device THIS IS A MUST BUY thank you gameloft and keep em coming ill buy them all. I am not being paid to say this buy this game you wont regret it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing<br />I loved everything about this book.<br />Can't wait to read the next one.<br />I love the character s and the story line was spectacular.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|This movie is a real dark comedy!  Bad family relationships that are made worse with every scene.  A beutiful young girl/sister. A prtective brother. Mathew Mcconahey (sp) is fantastic!  One of his best preformances!  A definite much watch!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The Third Wheel is probably my favourite book in this series! I recommend this book to those who have experience in school dances. But if you don't, like me, but you like a good laugh, this book is perfect for you! The jokes in the book are creative and hilarious. Diary of a Wimpy Kid fans will enjoy this book. This book is a personal best for me! This read is worth buying for sure, and I believe you will agree!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars 5 Stars--- The kids love it so much.  I love the fact that they both can play at any level.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a helpful free dictionary that comes with the kindle fire and now i don't have to buy one
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My little sister absolutely loves the show! She kept asking me to get this so we cod play together.5 Stars, guys!
0345529057|5.0|I have been enjoying the HBO series A Game of Thrones, which is based on these books. Reading the books makes the story line of the TV series much clearer. At the same time, reading the novels on their own is very pleasurable. I am truly enjoying them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down! I can't wait to complete the series. I also now have the urge to pursue survival training...
B00632HWOG|1.0|The most recent update has caused a SEVERE battery drainage issue on my Kindle Fire and Galaxy S, draining the batteries in less than a day, even when devices left idle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was alright not for me but you know it's weird...Now after I read it, it is the mos amazing book ever
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Really let down.  The only thing that will be worse is the next.  How could you do this to me?
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a very good romance novel and just for a warning there is a lot of intimacy in this book, still it is a great book!
B0019IB0II|5.0|Recently lost my mother to a similar stroke ,wish I had read before her ordeal. Highly recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Larry
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book, it's now one of my favorites. I wish people wrote more books like this. It made me feel infinite.
B00004VVND|4.0|Mild by today's standards.  Not as intense as today's movies.  The story line is good though.  I'd predict this one will be remade and updated (probably into a more &#34;racy&#34; version).  If a few scenes could be edited out, it would be a good modern proverb for children regarding the pitfalls of over entertainment and reliance on technology.<br /><br />Yul Brynner's taunt, &#34;Draw....!&#34; may haunt you for a few days after the show.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think the book is good but I would've liked it more if the story was a little longer. Overall good book though.
B0026PW67W|5.0|This was given to a close family friend for Christmas 2012. To keep it safe for Christmas delivery it was never opened until it was received. Once opened.it looked delightful to share. I am looking forward to exploring its magic with the recipient.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Kick Ass is a movie that makes me question my decency, if not my sanity. This film is the most violence, brutal, crude, and juvenile film I would ever even consider watching, let alone buying or recommending. It is so wrong; so very, very wrong, and yet it's perfectly, deliciously dark and hilarious! Rewatch value is exceptional. I'd give it five stars, but I wouldn't respect myself in the morning. This film is too funny, too well-conceived and acted, and too cartoonish not to own on blu-ray! Video is colorful, slick, and gorgeous and the audio track matches in quality.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Highly reccomended for children over age of 4.  similar to the cartoon!  neat little details and easy game progression.  dosent take a lot of $$
B005IA9K2G|4.0|The film itself has never looked better: vivid color, perfect sound.  I don't believe there are new extras beyond what was on the fine DVD release of just a few years ago; all are enjoyable.  John Fricke's commentary is absolutely riveting.  The packaging, however, is an overblown waste. There are multiple pages inside this \\"book,\\" but they're all just filled with lists of songs or banal text. The photos are good, but nothing new, and the design is dull and inappropriate for the subject matter.  A film of this stature deserved much, much better.  Fortunately, the film itself is marvelous.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love organizing all my thoughts, ideas, and creative goals on pinterest!  It's a lot fun and helps me get organized.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show!  Can't wait for the rest of season 3.  Great story lines and makeup special effects this season.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I've tried one of these cables before, with no luck. But with this one I was able to plug my non-apple phone into my apple-only input car stereo, very exciting! I can't use the car controls, I have to start and stop music on the phone, but I expected that based on the other reviews. Overall, as advertised.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|I was really skeptical of buying this album at first.  &#34;Payphone&#34; and &#34;One More Night&#34; are obvious hits, but some of the sample clips other songs didn't grab me at first.  After hearing them in their entirety, I really like this album.  Also, had to buy the &#34;clean&#34; version so my kids could listen to it.
B009KUWWW0|4.0|A wonderful follow on to The Pillars of the Earth....  Could not put it down... The struggles in dealing with the black plague where particularly moving.... Especially the constant battle between those who try and implement progressive change and those who insist on the old ways..
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great finale to the trilogy.  Just wish it wasn't the last one with Christian Bale,  even though they left the door open additional movies.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I thought the inspiration and concepts behind this movie were worth noting, however I'm not sold on its execution.  There are huge unexplained gaps in the story line which makes me think that this was intentional so that you would be compelled to watch a sequel...well it worked on me but until then I have to say that this movie was incredibly unsatisfying.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Poor acting and marginal plot. The special effects couldn't compensate for the rest of the film. Worst Batman film to date.
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|The premise of the plot is idiotic.  Decent actors phone-in their performances.  The directing by Gilroy is 1/20th of what Greengrass did on previous Bourne movies.  This was a forced studio script to capitalize on the excellent acting by Damon.  Renner is not convincing as someone remotely capable of being a super-assassin/agent.  Weiss' acting is as flaccid as a pancake.
B0016CVN02|5.0|Can't go wrong with this classic Rolling Stones. Bought MP3 version to replace CDs missing over the years. Very happy with the quality, and I can flash to the past quickly and easily.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Five star rating because this movie introduced us to two different cultures and had something for age groups from early 20s to retirement age.<br /><br />We sent in the sweepstakes entry to go to India based on seeing this movie.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Il istened to rod stewart since I was a kid back in the early70s.i like the album. He does sound a little bit older than he used to.but the man is 60 some years old.hecsounds a lot better than the rolling stones do right now.the song selection is good it's a good album for background Christmas  music at  a party
B009DKFST6|5.0|I had not heard this CD before I purchased it.  If you like Pit Bull you will like this CD.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I watched Prometheus not only because of the premise of the original director of Alien tackling a prequel of his work, but because I wanted to see Noomi Rapace, who I was impressed with in the Swedish version of &#34;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.&#34;<br /><br />The corporation is running an expedition to a planet that the crew believe holds the key to Man's origins.  When they get there though, they find a weird ship by another race that looks similar to us.  There is also the usual stereotypical characters which were hard to watch -- a pair that would make Harold and Kumar proud (thankfully they die before we get too far into the film), a megalomanical corporate sponsor, and an alien &#34;human&#34; who not only does not want to talk to us, but wants to kill us!<br /><br />The Weyland (8) Robot, David, was the show-stealer, who despite his spying and infiltrating, and wishing to experiment on the very humans he was entrusted with, shows what he is &#34;made of&#34; at the end.<br /><br />The dual DVDs do have some neat &#34;making of&#34; features and watching them makes the film come alive.  Recommended.
B004DMZ3SK|5.0|I initially got this in tandem with the Lego Black Pearl because I wanted to have a pair of ships, and I was mildly concerned about The Queen Anne's Revenge looking rather tacky. It is actually an amazing set. I collect lego sets, and this is easily my favorite one. It's pretty simple to build, is large without being excessive, and would be fun to play with if you were considering buying for a younger person.<br /><br />The service I got was great too. The vendor delivered my package timely, and the box was in perfect condition.
140120841X|5.0|This book by far is one of my favorites. One of the best written by alan moore.  If you are a fan of watchmen, you would love this story as well.<br /><br />Amazon also proved pretty dependable upon its shipping. Arrived within 3 days, in absolute perfect condition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. I play it on the computer and was glad to find it for my kindle
1401216676|5.0|packed and sent in pretty decent shape, book looks fantastic, even under the sleeve , coloring and pages are perfect, and by far best batman comic out there!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game. I play it on the computer and was glad to find it for my kindle
B006O2QNOU|3.0|Movie was just ok, sucky ending. I expected much more. I think the story was the downfall, actors did a fine job.
B00000DGUY|5.0|Another great 80's band with many awesome songs to listen to. I will have to grow a mullet now! Produts arrive in great shape and on time.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Loved the game could not stop playing looking forward to the next instalment I'm sure it will be as good if not better
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This being narrated by a Pet. how he sees his race car driver owners life. learned alot about Racing. Kept me motivated. the audible voice was a perfect for listening.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|[[ASIN:B00ASMJGKK Schoolgirl Cinderella]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00ASMDK0C Swan Story]]<br /><br />A masterpiece in every sense. I have seen this film countless times and know all the words by heart. I know it's a for children but the characters are so well formed you know you've met someone like Gaston, Belle or even the beast at some point in your life. The ending's pretty powerful too! Please Disney make more of the same!!!!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Every bit of goodwill that can be found  at Christmas time can be found right here. This will always have a place in whatever bookshelf I own.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite DVDs so to be able to go from VHS to the sharpness of a Blu-Ray was a nice switch!  A wonderful romp and take on Homer's story Odyssey!  I love the &#34;look&#34; of the 1930's and we just laughed our way all the way through this DVD.  My husband also likes Bluegrass, so he loved the music, too.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|its a decent time waster. Force closes sometimes on Kindle fire. rather have ads than buy coins. will probably uninstall eventually.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Beautiful and spiritually enriching.<br />This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen.<br />Wish I had a 3-D computer.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought Diary of a Wimpy Kid The Third Wheel by Jeff Kinney was an outstanding job and I hope Jeff Kinney will make some more Diary of a Wimpy Kid books because I love this series.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I bought this for my father in law for christmas, went perfectly with the #1 that I got him last year.
B004RL9T50|5.0|I am usually a Pixar snob, but wmy friend made me watch this.  It is great!  Will Ferrel def makes the movie for me.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book so much, I could not put it down, I can not wait to see how that take and make this a movie, it will be very interesting. A modern day &#34;secretary&#34;?
B004T2QZL8|5.0|For all you people who said &quot;the game closed on me&quot; I'm say maybe it did and maybe it didn't. I don't know, but I do know that after playing this game for 30 minutes it didn't close on me once. This is an awesome game and it is quite worth the 99 cents.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great reading  Excellent service.  Everything I purchase through Amazon arrived in a timely manner and always in great shapeI enjoy buying from Amazon
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is the best game. i had it on my ipod and i just got the new kindel fire hd soi downloaded it and it better than any other hsirstyling game.i just wanttto see<br />more.people
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wonderfully written. Could have read it in a day but I wanted it to last,. I would read it again tomorrow.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Game is a classic!  Easy to play.  Many different layouts and configurations offered in each level.  Almost makes waiting for the Doctor pleasant!
0307742997|5.0|I was looking for something after reading the Dragon Tattoo series and found Jo Nesbo. I love the Harry Hole books. Just finished The Snowman. Loved it from start to finish. There are always so many twists and turns. Harry is a great character.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Glad to see it for Android. I was shocked, surprised, and delighted to find this as a free app of the day. Challenging game that is so much fun. Plays great on my Kindle Fire 1st generation. Even at what seems a steep price of 5 bucks, I would probably still get this game. There are not many games I write reviews on, but this one is worth doing so. Get it!
B001HN6918|5.0|Got it for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loves it especially the baby panda parts of the movie.  Better than the first.  Can't wait for the 3rd.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I started reading this book and was upset when I got too tired to read it. I can barely wait to finish the next one.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Love this movie with a passion.  The music is beautiful and singing is beautiful.  The ending is my favorite part!!!!! Absolute recommendation to everyone!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|You are always going a hundred miles an hour.  It takes a bit to get up to speed but fun
B007REA93K|5.0|If you like old Rockabilly music at all, I think you'll quite enjoy this guy! Makes me want to go back in time to where this style originated....
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|... of a viewer of this extremely boring and stupid movie. My god, I was with the wolves - please eat them faster, please, please! All in vain, wolves were patiently waiting while people were admiring the nature and reflecting on their wasted opportunities!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This cartoon is very family friendly.  My three year old loves the musical numbers.  She watches it over and over.
B0091LS07E|5.0|One of the best CD's I've listened to in a long time.  Some Alicia's best work.  Very, very original and artistic.  Got love Alicia's talent and what she has to say!!!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|I enjoyed this movie but kids under 13 might not get some of the jokes. They are not so bad that I would prevent them from watching the movie. Hey, it's British so enjoy the show.
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|Great cast, entertaining storylnes.  Just plain fun and mostly a pick-me-up movie.  Enjoy viewing! Almost didn't recognize Michelle Peiffer with dark brown hair and cut into a bob; for a few seconds I thought it was Susan Sarandon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless<br />By Colleen Hoover<br />5+++++++++++++++++ Hearts<br /><br />I am in utter awe of this book. My mind is totally spinning.  This review is going to be kinda short--Just for the mere fact that I don't want to give ANYTHING away!!  As the reader, I want you to be as blown away as I was.<br /><br />I have to start with Colleen Hoover.  She has some serious talent for writing.  She draws you in with her amazing character development and unpredictable storyline.  Her writing is amazingly flawless and she left me stunned.  She added so many twists and turns, but kept them is such an even flow throughout the story.  At one point, I thought I had things figured out---but damn I was wrong!<br /><br />The feelings and emotions I experienced during reading were monumentally strong. I was laughing, crying, angry, surprised, shocked and ultimately stunned.  It pulled me in so many directions that I was twisted in knots!<br /><br />As I stated before, the character development was amazing.  I totally fell in love with Sky the moment I began reading.  I love how smart she is and not just book smart--people smart.  She is so wise beyond her years and it was astonishing.<br /><br />With Holder, I felt differently.  He left me very uneasy in one sense--but on the other I was so drawn to him.  Not to mention--GORGEOUS!!!  He almost makes me want to take up running so maybe I could get a glimpse of him.<br /><br />Overall, AMAZING MUST READ NOW BOOK!!!!!!!!<br />Captivating....Unpredictable...Emotionally Packed.....Amazingly Written Book of 2012!!!!
B004EPZ070|4.0|Very good story.  Don't love the cheating, but love that the main girl wins her guy and that true-love finally wins out in the end.  Don't love the attitude of Kate Hudson's character; she obviously didn't love her BFF enough to want her to be happy.  Especially the way she swooped in and stole Colin Egglesfield's character's interest in the beginning.  Interesting plots and twists.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Love the story line. The bad boys always get my attention and Travis got that. The background of Abby was great
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the memory and how it lets you see what you are adding/subtracting/multiplying or dividing. Works well on my Kindle. No issues.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|How do you beat this ensemble? While each player  is a virtuoso,  the whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts.  The interweaving, (sometimes spontaneous, sometimes arranged,) of the individual statements being made by these guys is a joy to experience.
B00881PPTO|1.0|I could not load this onto my Kindle after several attempts. Then I loaded it on my phone and it was total junk. Deleted it and will not ever use again.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Wonderful piece of work. Donald Fagan tells great stories,  paints great pictures with meaningful lyrics, artful melody lines (not necessarily sing-able by your average singer) great textures, arrangements, production. One can listen to this cd over and over (as I have) and hear new things each time.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I'm pleased to say that Nelson DeMille has never disappointed me, and &#34;The Panter&#34; is as good as all of his other novels. He's a master at realistic fiction, and I sometimes wonder just how close to reality his stories are. Of course you'll have to wait for his next book as he doesn't turn them out as quickly as I'd like. However, he doesn't disappoint you as some other writers, who publish on a more regular basis, do.
B008476HBM|5.0|Excellent character study.  I find new nuances and information about the players each time I read it. I give it a 5 star rating.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|this installation in the harry potter series is a little bit slower that the previous ones. A good movie but its different than i was expecting
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Unfortunately it is a waste of money. I don't blame the app itself. The kindle was just not made for photography.
B0012GMX1K|4.0|i really love this album this is a classic , and if you like GG you really must get it
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My five year old and I play this game together and she loves it. The graphics are well done and the pets are adorable.
0765348780|4.0|this book started out a little dense , but as it progressed it got better , and as the series progressed is has become among the best i ever read. There is such a rich an full backstory it really makes the story so much more relateable and much more interesting. READ THIS SERIES but give it a little time
B009VB9VKY|3.0|it was ok...not really all that in my opinion.  would not have paid for it if I had known...wait till it's free
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I really liked this final movie in the harry potter series. It was very action packed and the ending tied everything up in a nice shiny bow. Definitely a good movie
B0053O89JM|5.0|Dr. Gregory House...oh, how I'm going to miss seeing you on TV every week!!  I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every season of House, and have all 8 seasons on DVD.  I've watched them over and over.  Was a bit less enthused with the new cast for the final season, but the compassion House shows for Wilson during his battle with cancer touched me.  I've not seen a side of House quite like that before.  The ending was a little &#34;cheesy,&#34; but overall I highly recommend this series.  There will never be a Dr. House on TV again.  Hugh Laurie had the role mastered, and no one will captivate it quite like him.  I miss him!!  :(
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is great in every way! The sound quality is very solid, almost professional. There is virtually no delay. Transmission quality is amazing, you can even travel between rooms without loosing the signal. Noise is minimal. The 7.1 surround effect is impressive and although not perfect, the positioning is better that in any other headset I have tried. Microphone is clear and very comfortable - the mic tube is flexible and can be bent and adjusted however you want. Mic is muted when you fold it upwards. The overall fit is one of the most comfortable I have experienced, with ear pieces adjustable in 10 directions (incl. tilt degrees). Controls on the headset are very handy and reliable, especially the volume wheel and Surround switch. Battery life is very good with up to 8 hours of continuous use.<br />The software comes with high-quality voice morphing features that can be quite amusing in online gaming sessions, it you are into this kind of thing.<br />Another thing worth mentioning is that when you put the headset on you don't get that eerie sealed off feeling in your ears, that is because the headphones transmit a small portion of ambient room sound into your ears and it feels like you don't have headphones on at all.<br />Set up is quick and easy.<br />I would confidently recommend this headset to any PC gamer out there!
B000669GAI|5.0|How can you go wrong with Pearl Jam?  They're one of my fave groups of all time, and Eddie Vedder is phenomenal.  Love this CD.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Up there with Mariah Carey Christmas album, just perfect.  The message at the end of the album just makes it personal.

B007XIC1GI|3.0|Manson's work reminds those of us of his age of the shared things of youth. However, most of us didn't catch Grandpa getting off to S&M and Bestiality in the basement. The downside of the work is that his you is the most fascinating part of him yet he barely touches the surface of live in the 1960s and 70s.
B00846REIS|5.0|left me wanting more.  I immediately purchased the next book to continue this thrilling ride.  Cant wait for the third book to come out.
B0098TL4YU|5.0|WRITTEN BY BRENDA TUCK-MUMFORD<br />JIMI HAS DONE IT ONCE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME BETTER THAN EVER. I'VE BEEN A FAN SINCE SURVIVOR DAYS, AND EVEN LISTENED TO HIS EARLIER COBRA AND TARGET WORK. HE HAS PUT OUT SEVERAL OTHER CDS LATELY AND ALL HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC AS JIMI IS JUST SUCH AN AMAZING TALENT AND THOUGH I LOVE EVERYTHING HE DOES I JUST CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS CD. THE MUSIC IS GREAT-SEARING GUITAR WORK, POUNDING DRUMS-BUT ABOVE IT ALL THAT SOARING PERFECT VOICE. HE PUTS HIS HEART AND SOUL INTO EVERY SONG. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO HIM FOR 30 YEARS AND HE JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER. FOR JAMISON FANS IT IS A MUST HAVE. FOR PEOPLE UNFAMILIAR WITH HIS WORK IF YOU WANT GOOD OLD FASHIONED ROCK & ROLL(WITH A SLIGHTLY HARDER EDGE ON SOME TUNES) GIVE IT A LISTEN. I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ready for the next book to come out!!  Held my attention throughout the entire book.  Now excited for the third book to be released.  Deffinantly a great book to read
B0098VYKSA|1.0|WRITTEN BY BRENDA MUMFORD<br />THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN. DARK(IN STORY AND CINEMATOGRAPHY), BORING, NO LIKABLE CHARACTERS, THERON WAY OVER TOP, STEWART JUST PLAIN BORING, DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE ANY OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS. ONLY BRIGHT SPOTS WERE THE TROLL MONSTER AND THE LITTLE SHORTY GUYS(DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE CALLED). LOOKED SO GOOD IN PREVIEWS BUT AS WITH MOST MOVIES TODAY THE PREVIEWS ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS-JUST WATCH THEM AND FORGET THE MOVIE.
1591396190|4.0|A good summary of moving from just another commodity business competing at the same level as others in your industry - to completely changing your value proposition and differentiating your organization.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great read.<br />Thought provoking and disturbing.  The legal system vs. Truth aspect of the story is right on..a sad reality.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched season 1 @ 6 months ago.  I felt lost after it was over.  But now after starting season 2 from Amazon, I'm back home.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was ok. Not the best book I ever read.<br />I didn't like the ending. I wouldn't read it again
B006VRDZ44|4.0|It's an interesting show.  I'm looking foward to see more.  I intend to purchase 1 or 2 more per week.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Loved the movie. Harrison Ford does a fantastic job in his acting. Always love to see Tommy Lee Jones in action.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We bought software to convert regular DVD to e-notebook.  This was marked WAY down and was a big hit as always.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|What can one say about this collector's edition, which is beautifully packaged and really done right? It's well worth the money, and it brings a feeling of event to the package that must mirror what audiences felt when this epic film was first released. I love the fact that the set includes an actual 70mm frame from the movie, mounted on a solid card and in a plastic sleeve.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer of the film itself is superb. Great colors and depth. The variety of the effects of natural light are mesmerizing, especially in scenes shot early in the morning and just before twilight. This film can be appreciated on so many levels that it's hard to know where to start, and it's even more difficult to know when to shut up! It's an added bonus that a CD of the movie soundtrack has been included, featuring some extra tracks that didn't appear on the LP versions of the soundtrack. The sound on the BD is good as well, and it's thrilling to crank up the stereo and listen through the wonders of surround sound. Maurice Jarre's score is expertly conducted (though NOT by Sir Adrian Boult, who didn't actually conduct a single bar of the score, but who was given the film credit for contractual reasons) and has held up very well over the decades.<br /><br />I highly recommend this BluRay in this packaging. However, if you can't afford or don't want the CE, then certainly go for the BD transfer of the film itself in its less-expensive packagings.<br /><br />This film belongs in every film collection, bar none. You need to own it.
030758836X|5.0|I initially read a friend's copy of the book, but then bought more copies to give as Christmas presents.  I rarely recommend books to others, but I have not only told other people about this book, but given it to them.  It is very well written and in a style that keeps you turning the pages as the layers of the onion unfold.  I can't wait to read her other books!
0061733199|5.0|This book gives great details about survival techniques in evry type of condition or region that you may face.  It was written in a very easy to read style.  This is a mut have book for survivalist libraries.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|Ordered this movie after watching a review on YouTube. Wasn't what I expected but ended up being far better. Not a gore fest but an actual movie. Great story and acting. Might be a bit slow for the zombie crowd but really picks up the pace in the second half. Really a story of hope.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|There are many games out there that are just as, if not more educational and a lot more user friendly. I am so tired of buying poor plastic quality toys!! Long gone are the days of my youth when toy companies put pride in their work and produced high quality toys made in the USA! The point of the game is to knock down a tower of blocks and pigs to earn points up to 1000 for the winner. The plastic blocks weigh less than the pigs and birds, making it very difficult to build the structure. It's cheaply made. It's difficult to build. Not worth it. If your child is insisting on having this game my suggestion is to use some wooden blocks of your own and use the pigs and birds from the set.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|love her she is amazing God bless her always. I enjoy all her music. she gets better n better. xoxo
1451648537|5.0|Gave as a book to my teenage grandson. He loved it and so did his parents. Finally a gift that covers different generations.
B000WT5IUQ|5.0|I have always loved Karen Carpenter's voice.  In my opinion her Christmas music is as iconic as Bing Crosby's, Frank Sinatra's, Nat King Cole's, or Andy Williams'.  It is very natural and unpretentious.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Got Ted for Christmas and still haven't stopped laughing.  Don't get this if you are easily offended.  It's straight up Seth Mcfarland at his best.  Hilarious
B009GEAPYW|5.0|great movie! watched it christmas night with my nephew and brother and we all loved it. can't wait to see part 2
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was an amazing book with lots of detail that really explains Greg and how he lives with such a big family
B007P6VM04|2.0|I felt deceived. Many of the songs that are played repeatedly throughout the season of the show are not on this album. I thought they would be on the album and didn't think to check.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|This may not be fair if you like this kind of movie or the previous MIB movings.  Simply too silly for me.  Will Smith one liners were saving grace.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I have been watching since season 4, and enjoy it very much.  The cast is fantastic and I can't wait for next season.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Great movie for anyone interested in what our military men and women, especially those in any SF area go through.
1451695195|4.0|This interesting  book was not quite what I was expecting, yet I enjoyed it.  A bit overly scientific for me.
B0000027RL|5.0|this is a great CD, and a album that I have missed listening to over the years.  I had this poster on my wall when I was younger, thanks for the cool offer.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I figured the twist out halfway through but then something happened to make what I thought was going to happen impossible.  But then what I thought was going to happen actually did happen and the thing that made it impossible was just a giant mistake in the story.  I really like Kate's books and for the most part I really liked this one, except for the glaringly obvious mistake.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book goes from calm to intense and deep real quick. As the story goes on it just gets deeper and deeper. I love the names Colleen chose for the characters. I can't wait for her to write more books because I have loved every single one of hers so far. She should do a book from Holders POV.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Many of Marley's best music. I would recommendas a great starter album for those want some of the best of reggae.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This is a great heroic, action filled, alien movie. I am a fan of end of the world type movies, and this one did not disappoint me. The hero is a troublemaker, a smart young man who can't seem to get his act together. When his brother dies, he is pushed to the forefront as a leader of a Navy Destroyer. He has to lead the crew and fight against aliens out to take over the world. The story has a couple of different aspects, but for the most part it was about the special effects and action sequences, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I liked watching the Destroyers and the Carriers sail. The special effects were really great to watch. I was really worried when the Battleship Missouri was brought into the battle. I didn't want that ship destroyed, even in a movie. I would have to reconsider my rating if something happened to that floating museum.<br /><br />Overall, it was great. The actors were believable, even Rihanna. I thought she was so cool to watch. Femme fatale shooting all the big guns. I recommend this movie. Thanks
B009FZHYKU|5.0|More than guts and gore... You fall in love with the characters and find yourself missing them and wanting more. It's very well written and crazy intense.
B005LAIH54|5.0|Wrath of the Titans is a great movie. In this story, people have stopped praying and believing in the Gods, and the Gods are loosing their powers because of it. The tone is set early. It's brother against brother, a family of Gods splintered, never to be healed again. Perseus is the reluctant hero in this story. He doesn't really set out to save the Gods in a  sense, but to save his father, Zeus. I think the storyline is powerful. It shows the length a son will go to save his father. But that's not it for this movie. There is plenty of action, special affects, and magical places. It also has mythical creatures, including Pegasus again.<br /><br />I really liked Liam Neeson in this movie as Zeus. I'm a fan of Mr. Neeson's work, and he never disappoints. I do recommend watching this movie. It is a great way to get away from the mundane.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|As much about North Korea itself as the actual escape.  It does bring to light how the treatment of the people affects them emotionally.
B0002I831S|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying watching season #1 again!  It's been many years since I've seen these espisodes, and they are some of the best episodes!  I especially love &#34;Space Seed&#34; with Ricardo Montalban -- a classic!!!!  Now I have the entire classic Star Trek on DVD.
0425166805|4.0|Very awesome book. To think it was one of the great thought-starters for amateurs and professional alike! The theory and presentation is a five star in the only reason I gave it a four star rating was because of the information included being related heavily to the times of being published. There were no updates on a large scale which sort of made some of the things that have changed, obsolete. But over all very good, have recommended numerous times and will continue to read other works by Von Daniken.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Amazon, the low quality of the apps available on the Fire, such as this one that has been broken for months, will spell the death knell for this tablet. I got it for Christmas, but lots of my favorite apps are broken. I'm considering returning it. Fail.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Possibly the funniest book I've ever read.  The writing is superb and the wit is quick, quick, quick.  There were moments I was laughing out loud.
B004JMY312|5.0|this was more of an impulse buy for me on Halloween.  Just remembered this movie from my childhood.  Classic Halloween movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this in literally a day! Couldn't put it down, and about to<br />buy the final book. Def a good and easy read
B0072OFOM6|5.0|This is my wife and I's favorite series on TV.  Bought it in anticipation of the new season coming out in Jan 2013.  We are going to do a Spartacus marathon of all the previous seasons (Gods of the Arena first) leading up to the launch of the new season.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I love this app. It is so realistic and fun I can't put it down!!! I would recommend this to everyone.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Great game i havent played Ico yet but SoC was by far one of my favorite games on Ps2 and replaying it again has been great. I still remember all the weak points and remember the struggle to find them when i played it with my one of my best friends the first time.
034544678X|5.0|I have been a fan of Dr. McConnell for well over 20 years.  Would love to see more of her on TV.  She was the first and still is the best.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Love this game and was glad to pick it up as the free app of the day.  4.99 seems a little steep for it - but if you can afford it you will not be dissapointed.  Especially good on a tablet!
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|Overal the movie is pretty funny. I would recommend it for a date night or just hanging out with friends.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|this is a wonderful book and i remember reading the paperback years ago. the best part? its a free download!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall has lived up to my expectations that it is there with some of the greats (From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Dr. No, Casino Royale), and for fifty years, James Bond has took us all around the world with Bond women, gadgets and the highs and lows of many Bond villians and henchmen and henchwomen that he always outmatches at the end. But this time, Bond faces a threat that hits home as M's past comes back to attack MI6 and kills six agents that its up to Bond to bring him to justice with many surprises and twists waiting astore. This is Bond meets Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy that improves by a longshot the disappointing but watchable if you people can understand Quantum of Solace as the continuning story of Casino Royale that this one is now up there were the Bourne movies (and where Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocal did last year by giving a much needed and unexpected comeback being the biggest film worldwide of that series) in not only one of the best James Bond movies ever but one of the best movies of the years and becoming the first James Bond billion dollar blockbuster that have beat box office expectations all over the world being the highest grossing Bond film in the United States not for inflation (but for inflation, its the third behind Goldfinger and Thunderball) and overseas especially where it beat Avatar for biggest movie of all time in the U.K. where now this film made me want to see it again before getting Skyfall on dvd even this is my first Bond movie I've seen on the big screen!
B007CKNX28|5.0|I'm fairly young and a wannabe music snob at best, but in my opinion Jack White is the most unique artist of my generation. His music is unlike anything else I've heard, it's always fresh, creative, no two songs sound the same besides resonating with that receiver in your gut that makes you want to dance and wail. It's retro and progressive at the same time, like watching my best childhood memories on an Ipad. I love anything he touches but this may be my favorite album yet. I <3 Jack White.
B005LAII12|5.0|I saw Ted in the unrated version and I laughed my butt off watching it all the way through, who knew with a couple of Family Guy veterans including Seth McFairlane being the writer, producer, director and the voice of Ted come along to make this an unexpected comedy smash hit about a bear that is a bong-smoking, womanizing, Sam Jones Flash Gordon-loving, foul mouthed talking teddy bear that people can love! Amazing! Congratlations hosting the Oscars, Seth and for your unexpected Oscar Nomination for Best Original Song!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Unlike most bands who's first release is scratchy but good, second is better, third and maybe fourth are awesome and then the remaining products seem to decline, Deftones somehow just keep upping their game. I didn't think they could top Diamond Eyes, and truth be told I had to listen to this one a few times before I realized, it's actually even better!
B0081336FO|5.0|I have been a fan of Sherlock for over 50 years.  I am often disapointed in movies and tv shows that don't measure up.  I think this series is the best ever.  I've watched it several times and hope they make many more.  Dr. Watson is terrific.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I enjoy being able to get on facebook on my Kindle. The only thing I do not like is that it is not very easy to navigate through as the screen is very different than the actual Facebook site. I can not play Farm Town on my Kindle through the Facebook site. Those are the only issues otherwise I am very happy with the app. Would recommend to anybody that has Facebook.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|This was amazing I love him and I got to go to his house<br /> Post this on 2more of his books and you can go to his house he will call . U
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I watched this movie with my niece on our HD TV. I had the HDMI cable and was able to hook my Kindle up to the television with no problems! Very good picture quality. I will definatly order more HD movies through Amazon. I love having the convenience of wathcing a movie in my home without having to pay the high price of going to a movie theater. Highly recommend this product.
0547884591|3.0|I was interested in the 30/30 diet plan that was mentioned in the Dr Oz show.<br />There was only 2 pages on this and much more that I am not even interested in.  There were some interesting facts and it is a good book if you want to know a lot about cooking and preparing foods.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This app takes great pictures and videos. I am glad I had it for Christmas so I can save the pictures and videos for the future. I would recommend this app to anybody that has it available to them.
B004UJTG6Q|2.0|He is cool  but  finds out he's not so sure that he is cool anymore and that he is wrong. Love, Alexis a. Hopper.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|works great, allows me to create word documents as needed. you do have to have an external flash drive if you want complete mobility.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love all these books . This is one is my favorite so far. Hope everyone else enjoys<br />Loved the book.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|the movie itself is 5 stars. Blu-ray disk won't play on my computer because of some hardware security BS. Digital copies require you to register for several sites and upgrade security software. This was a major PITA. The digital comic book won't actually let you download it and can only be viewed online.<br /><br />This sort of stuff needs to work better and be more convenient if you want customers to buy it.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|I really want to play this game but all I get is a black screen. I have the kindle fire edition. I bought this game for a dollar. Idk what to do
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I was a little slow getting started, but it got better as it went along. I really didn't like the ending much. The other Bourne movies were much better.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I am writing this because I really enjoyed the movie, but I also want to praise amazon because I bought this product 3 days before Christmas as a present for my husband and it was delivered on the 24th, I was very impressed.  I would recommend the movie and as always Amazon to all my friends and family.
B00633W614|5.0|It was even better than the first book of the series.  I have already put the upcoming book on my wish list so I know to get it as soon as it comes out.  Wish I did not have to wait so long now for it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I always enjoy MC's books, howeverthe first 30% of this book is in 2 of his short story books, labeled &#34;Snow White.&#34;<br />Wish I had know that before I bought the short stories too!<br />Great story, Bosch is excellent as always!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I personally love a story of redemption. The story and characters warm my heart and the fact that it's based on truth, makes it even more special. The acting, particularily by Sandra Bullock, is wonderful. All these factors make me give this movie the highest rating of 5 stars!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's fun.  It's addictive... Just got to keep in mind----It's only a game!!  Have fun.  Best of luck getting those pigs.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I AM NOT ONE TO PLAY A GAME ON MY KINDLE- BUT THE APP WAS FREE AND BEFORE I KNEW IT AN HOUR PASSED BY AND I WAS STILL PLAYING.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This show was really well made, however, there is a lot of nudity.  The subject of the show is very relevant.
B001NI24OI|5.0|Football is a way of life in many of the small towns across America. This protrayal of what happends with a small town football team and the ups and downs of what happens around it is fairly accurate. Many of these players have dreams of &#34;making it big&#34; and relish the chance to do it. I found the acting in this movie to be on target and was surprised and amazed at Tim Mcgraw's acting skills. If this guy ever stops singing he should get an oscar for his roll as the drunk, loud, foul, mouth father. Billy Bob Thornton was no slouch either as Coach Gary Gaines. He was amazing and so beliveable as the Coach who on the one hand overused his &#34;star&#34; player then turns around and has to deal with the fall out after the player 'James &#34;Boobie&#34; Miles' gets injured and can't play. I like the way he is a father figure in one scene and then has to turn around and be less of one in another. Great job by the entire cast!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What an amazing story...truly a beautiful movie. Hachi (aka Hachiko) is based on a true story of a Japanese Akita. It brought me to tears. I would recommend this to anyone.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Out of all the songs on this album there are only 2 that I would consider not a hit. Kid Rock manages to balance the blues, rock and country and turn out hits like Chickens in the Pen (really good song!); Rebel Soul, Detroit Michigan, Mr. Rock n Roll, God Save Rock and Roll, Redneck Paradise and my favorite Cucci Galore. Kid Rock seems to write from life experiences and manages to serve up one delicious song after another.
B009NCM248|5.0|Always love anything Stone Sour or Slipknot put out, and this didnt disappoint. Great album, probably Rock album of the year.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|It's amazing to me that even in the year 2012 the Rolling Stones still have it. Their new song Doom and Gloom take you back to the days of Muddy Waters and Buddy Guy. I love that when I listen to one of their songs it takes me back to the first time I ever saw them in concert. I really like that they included songs from more recent years that seemed to me didn't do as well as what songs from the 70's had done. My only complaint is that they cut an entire verse from  the song &#34;You Can't Always' Get What You Want&#34; it's not the original song that has been played on previous greatest hits packages or when the played it in concert. Whether or not you are a life long Stone's fan or just a fan of their music from the last 10 years this album is definatly something you want to have in your collection.
B005OR9MJY|2.0|Meandering because it goes into technical details that I, as an implementor, don't care about. For example, why would I ever consider omitting the body tag from my markup? Why do they need to explain that I can omit it with 4 paragraphs of text then explain that I should not, however?<br /><br />Dorky because these guys are are failing at the use of humor --rarely is it funny and rarely  does it add to the delivery of the material. It just comes across like office dorks failing at trying to get your attention with funny statements at a brown bag presentation. &#34;Like a feline taxidermist will tell you, there's more than one way to skin a cat&#34; --har har, was that really needed?
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Well I got this game because I have it for the wii it is a little hard but I like it!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I was very pleased to find this item on lightning deals. I purchased all 5 available seasons for my fiance because she loves the show. Typical dvd packaging, well organized discs.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|A little raunchy, too much drug use, but overall it was a laugh riot which hides a surprisingly touching storyline underneath.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I was very pleased to find this item on lightning deals. I purchased all 5 available seasons for my fiance because she loves the show. Typical dvd packaging, well organized discs.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Nice graphics, enjoyed this game. Worth the money. Hidden object and extra puzzles were interesting. Hints were included, if needed. Story line kept my attention.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I was very pleased to find this item on lightning deals. I purchased all 5 available seasons for my fiance because she loves the show. Typical dvd packaging, well organized discs.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|It is good, but feels off and awkward. Maybe it is because I've read The Cousine's War out of order but is slow, and a bit dull, you don't even realize who you're dealing with untill the end of the book. It lacks her usual flair.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I was very pleased to find this item on lightning deals. I purchased all 5 available seasons for my fiance because she loves the show. Typical dvd packaging, well organized discs.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Why the title? Because I ended up way beyond my bed time reading this mixture of road movie, exploration of mythological archetypes and vision of the heart of darkness in the American dream. For me, simply unputdownable. By using mythology Gaiman has tapped into a powerful source of human experience, and a way once chosen to explain the human condition and and sets all that off against our new deities, which makes the novel a savage critique of what we have become. But there are many other elements in this book and I find it hard to do them all justice.<br />Another warning: you may end up wondering if the local postman is an incarnation of Hermes, Ogun or Lugh! Be careful, the book makes you look at the world in a different way, and that's what I've always looked for in this genre, another reason for giving it fives stars.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I was very pleased to find this item on lightning deals. I purchased all 5 available seasons for my fiance because she loves the show. Typical dvd packaging, well organized discs.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|One of my girls favorite movies and we listen to the soundtrack all the time in the car!!!  Right on track with the classic Muppet movies!!!  Highly recommend!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game offers good variety and plenty of ways to pass some time when you are bored. The games are simple and fun.
B006O6F932|4.0|Lots of little pieces and needs to have more detailed directions for opening and closing but my daughter absolutely loves it.  Played with it most of Christmas!
1423140605|5.0|I love his books and the Percy Jackson series is a great one!!  Not as good as Harry Potter, but close!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I liked all the music in this movie and the actors were very good. It's a fun movie to watch,
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging and fun. It is a great family-friendly game and I reccomend it for ages 8 and up. I love to play it with friends and it is crystal clear. It is amazing. One pointer is it is difficult at times and is easy. Love it!
0525952926|5.0|my mother wanted this book so bad but couldnt find it for under 40.00. she is on fixed income and could not afford that. she had read the first book in the triogy so i got this one for her she says she can hardly put it down.
030758836X|5.0|Great read.  I had a hard time putting it down.  A book club discussion group recommendation.<br />I look forward to this author's next novel.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i play this with my grandsons, and they love it as.much as i do. this makes for hours of fun for all of us.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book! There are all these books people say are page turners and I could never find that in a book. Until I read this book it took me one day to read. I honestly couldn't stop reading it. I loved the first love romance and Augustus smoking but not smoking. Just over all a great book I will read this again and might just be one of my favorite books.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Total Vince Flynn, I love the book! Non stop, I would recommend it to everybody.  When is the next one coming?

B006WQLH7G|5.0|This is the best Anti-virus out there, at least for the Kindle Fie. An independent study was done by AV-Test to see which android anti-virus apps were most efficient. Avast scored very well, here's the proof... [...]
B005HSL626|3.0|My kids have fun with this game, isn't super great in my eyes , kids say its kinda fun, so helps to pass the time for them.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A moving and touching book, I'm interested in psychology and the ways of human choices, this was interesting to read. I wasn't a big fan at first, because it was all formed in letters to a person. Mainly because it is different to what I usually read. But eventually I fell in love with Charlie. This book made be cry and made me laugh. I never been affected by a book the way I am from this one. I would recommend this book to my sister Natasha.
B004UID2LC|5.0|We all love having Youtube at the palm of our hands.  Lots to check out and search for, haven't had any issues.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think that this book was very helpful because I needed this lesson in grammar.<br />The only way to do it was very good at a series of articles about the same penis and it's enlargement
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|My Daughter says it was fun and an ok game, says its like a claw machine and you grab coins and stuff.
B001N4RORE|5.0|If you like musicals at all, you'll love this movie. We watched it and enjoyed it so much, we immediately bought our own copy from Amazon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|All 3 of my kids love this game, i have yet to try it out but my kids say its addicting and fun:)
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good movie.  The chase scenes are ridiculous as expected, but the story was pretty good and the acting is good.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I played this game a long time ago when i was in school, and found it again as i was searching apps, i love this game and so do my kids.
B00ARAO720|4.0|A really good movie.  Steady action, and a unique subject area.  I thought the role of the cop (the villain) was well thought out.  That is, he was a relatively decent cop, but who had a deep flaw which put him in way over his head.  The more he tried to dig himself out of his (self-created) hole, the deeper into the hole he got.  He couldn't win for losing.  To me anyway, I felt a bit sorry for him.<br /><br />There wasn't much I would change about the movie.  I could see myself waiting a couple of months and seeing it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This Book was well worth the read, and money.  Loved the series which i already read.  This is worth it !
B002EEP3NO|4.0|I was looking for Lego Items still available dealing with the Star Wars Theme.<br />I bought this item for my young grandson.  I'll give it to him when he's old enough to work on it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I TOTALLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME!!!!  IT IS PERFECT FOR  AGES 7-50!!!! EVEN YOU COULD TEACH YOUR GRANDPA TO PLAY IT! EXCEPT THAT I THINK THAT ITS NOT FOR 6 AND UNDER BECAUSE THERE IS SOME DIFFICULT LEVELS FOR THOSE KIDS BUT FOLLOW MY COMMENTS!!!BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE WILL EITHER LIE OR PUT CRAPIN THERE STUPID JUNK COMMENTS!!!<br /><br />Shalom OUT..............:)
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son. He loved having all of the earlier Batman movies in one box set collection. Well worth the price!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Rolled the dice on this album, but fell in love with it quickly! Purchased it along with Norah Joan's Little Broken Hearts. Great combo purchase.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A really cool and helpful app.  It's the first thing I open on my Kindle when I turn it on in the morning.  I love the Weather Channel on my computer, and now it's even more convenient to find out what's happening outside and how I should prepare.  I highly recommend this app.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I just bought this application, but I can see that i&#34;ll use it a lot.  The photos seem to come out good.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I knew nothing about the graphic novel version of The Walking Dead when I began watching the AMC TV version two (?) years ago.  I love, love, love the show--it's probably my favorite television program of all time.  So now that I'm forever hooked on The Walking Dead and started reading the Rise of the Governor and The Road to Woodbury novels, I decided that I had to see how it all started as a graphic novel.  I only have the first volume (for my Kindle), but I'm enjoying it immensely and am planning on buying them all, one after another, until I have read them all.  It's fun to compare the TV show with the graphic novel and see how they diverge.  If you're a Walking Dead fan and haven't yet read the graphic novel version, I highly recommend it!  It's very well done.  And who knows?  It may just help you survive the zombie apocalypse!
B001JI7WTO|5.0|I purchased this mainly for my grandson so he could watch in car on Kindle during a long car ride.  Good family adventure.  Adventure with slight humor.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have it on my ipod and kindle fire great game me and my friends play it all day long and even compete
B008XNZMOU|4.0|If you like Taylor Swift then you'll like this CD. That's all I can say. A gift, they loved it.
B004FA8NOQ|1.0|the package was opened.<br />it wasnt sealed.<br />I am very disappointed.<br />I have nothing more to say.... ... ... ...
B0019OP0GU|4.0|I liked this movie.  Not what I expected from the title, but enjoyable. I enjoyed Emma Watson in Harry Potter so I bought it to see what she did in other roles.  As expected, I loved her as well in this.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I got this as a gift for my mother, to go along with her Kindle Fire.  I read lots of reviews about plenty of cases, and this one just stood out.  It has a great look to it, and my mother loved the color. The functionality seems good so far, with the standing feature and the fact that it locks the Kindle when closed.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always... Clancy is a fascinating author who will not let you put the book down until the very end
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think that this app is so fun to play. it can keep ur attention for like ten minutes but then kind of gets boring. other than that I like this app.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Better than I could have imagined.  My first thought when opening the box was \\"wow\\" this was only $60 bucks.  If I saw it with no price I would expect to pay at least $200.  Second thought, proud that this was made in America.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I like cats. I don't really care about reviewing this game. I'm in my bed at 10:30 in the midnight after Xmas chilling on my kindle. good bye.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|Every little girl needs to read this book.  It's okay to be smart, clever, and independent!  Every little boy needs to read this book to see how NOT to treat girls!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVED THIS BOOK!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun. I love the graphics. You might not be able to stop once you start!
0393343405|4.0|I liked the book, but there was too much middle (who really cares about Poggio???) and not enough information about the modern influences of the poem discussed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its A good game but it takes a long time to download. or maybe its just cause my wifi is bad. lol! also it kind of copied temple run.
B003NGTYPA|5.0|Young Natalie is a gas. Invokes memories of a simpler time.  Thankfully it was not colorized.<br />Yes, I believe in Santa!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The story was good but of course with most romance novels there are some eye roll moments. It's not bad for a free novel.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Was very realistic regarding a marriage.  Rather sad though.  Can relate to the struggle.  They acted it out very well, but no 5 stars.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It is a good book. It's a lot different form the movie though a lot. She has I think yellow shoes instead of red. The munchkins don't sing to her either.
B009VB97EY|2.0|dancing wasn't all that and didn't care for actors.  Story really was very lame.  Just disappointing I think to me.
B004U52VPS|4.0|This is a fun game our 5 yr old son played for a long time.  The cards go well with the game and make it a little more advanced.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|i would recommend, was very interesting the way it took different turns.  And Nev is such a sweet guy in the show.
1599290634|5.0|First Spectrum Mag I have ever bought.  This thing is HUGE.  Great artwork.  I love it.  I was really impressed with the diverse art.  I love this product and think the price is right for the amount of art.  I am really happy with this product and will probably continue buying it.  I don't know if there is some form of subscription that would ease the price but I would definitely get it.  Great item, won't dissapoint.<br /><br />For the record, I am not an art student or aficionado or whatever.  I was simply looking for contemporary fantasy art and stumbled upon Spectrum.  Love it.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Brilliant music from a young and talented artist. I love every one of the songs. Wicked Games is my favourite. I would love to see him in concert. This guy has a good future ahead of him and I wish him all the best.
1426308469|5.0|My son can't read yet, but he really likes it when Mommy and Daddy read to him.  This book is huge, with lots of pictures.  Good job, NatGeo.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was surprised how good thus book was.  Very exciting, hard to put down.  I can't wait to read the second one.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Not as good technically speaking as the broadway play score, but nicely done.  Remember, most of these characters are not seasoned broadway actors.  As a movie score you can't go wrong with this.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|It is a wonderful game. It runs very smoothly and is a beautiful game. I love the graphics and songs. I really liked playing with it. Some of the songs are a challenge and I like that. I like challenges.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun and a bit better than temple run if u like temple run u will love this game
B004RJMUJO|5.0|The game is very synthetic and a challenge. I love it. The game is worth every penny. I have been very attached to the game buy it now the only thing is that the rewards are stupid ads I hate that.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Overall, I liked the movie. Not a big fan of Leonardo but let's be honest, most of the movies he is in, turn out to be pretty good movies. This movie is no exception. The only thing i didn't like about the movie is the &#34;Juno girl&#34; had no point of being in that movie what so ever. I just didn't really see a point for her to be in this movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt might as well have also taken on her role and it still would have been a good movie maybe even better.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|The only real problem with the movie was the inevitable comparison of the original story line and the new one. They should have called it something else.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Liam!! What do I say about this MAN!! AWESOME!! BRILLIANT!! SUPER BAD @$$!!! This was a must have! I love it!
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Not hilarious funny, but fun to watch. I wouldn't be tempted to watch again though. Good cast, looks like they had fun making it.
B00006AW63|1.0|We purchased 101 Dalmations that was sold to be in great condition.  Christmas gift for my 6 yr. old daughter & we put in movie and it doesn't work.  Very frustrated!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I stumbled on Downton Abbey on a blog that someone had written and mentioned watching it and being obsessed with it. I had to check it out. I had to play catch up and watch the first two season. Now I am hooked on it and can't wait for the next season.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I've grown up watching The Wizard of Oz. This book is nothing like the movie. It is way better. I strongly recommend this book. Don't expect it to be similar to the movie.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies out there.  It has quickly become a classic.  It is definitely a 5 star.
B00867GHS8|5.0|i love this movie. Dora is my favorite character. This movie is funny and family related all<br />at the same time. Watch this movie, you will enjoy it. Trust me
B005LAII12|1.0|This movie is the worse movie I have seen in 20 years. Its hard to pick what was worse between a stupid car chase, the gratuitousness use of the F word, or the simply really bad acting.  This looked like Wahlberg never acted before -- he is terrible and MacFarlane should keep to 30 min cartoons.  It was very difficult to keep watching it to the end.  Just painful.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome worth it<br />Loved it gggggggggg high g g g v v v v vBulletin v g v v vb
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though I saw the movie version first, the story was intense with an excellent mix of emotion as I read the book.  I only regret that I read it in just a few days and it is finished.
B009LREA1S|3.0|First off let me say that I LOVE the Batman character.  I also love the direction Chris Nolan took the story.  When I compare this to his first two, it disappoints.  Take the first two away and I would probably rated it higher.  There is plenty of problems with this story.  Lots of problems with the story.  SPOILERS: How does a man with no money travels across the world from the prison, how an ancient prison with no escape has cable and electricity, rookie cops could never just become Batman, leaving the batcave to him was garbage, parents die and inspires you to fight, girl you barely had a relationship dies and you quit for eight years, Alfred thinks your dead but your not and you let him cry like a baby over your empty grave and later he smiles about it?, Bane with no venom?, no guns yet every vehicle you drive has guns, &#34;The Bat&#34; is probably the worst name for a helicopter like vehicle. It goes on....<br /><br />On the plus side:  I loved Ann Hathaways Catwoman.<br /><br />Finally:  Batman Begins was the best of the trilogy.  Just because Heath Ledger died, doesn't make 2 a better film.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf has become one if those christmas movies i look forward to seeing each year at christmas. It has become a movie that we recite parts from all year long.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Instructions are weak. But got it paired with two Kokkia i10s twin Bluetooth headsets. Works great.  Now my wife and I can listen to iPAD content together when we're on the plane or hotel.
B0019GO58C|5.0|Recommended for all 80's movie buffs. Great acting and believable characters.<br />De Niro and Streep are great together. Worth buying.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This weather app works. It does what we expect it to do. There for it deserves a 5 star review. Also this weather app is pretty to look at. Good job. Buy it!
B005XLN97M|5.0|The beach house is great. It was a bit confusing at first to put together because some of the pieces look very similar, but it was pretty simple otherwise.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Totally love her CD's....can listen to her for hours
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was ok they could have went on into details at the end but other than that it was ok
B009H442DG|4.0|was nice for them to get together and make this cd...its just a fun CD to listen to..<br />..<br />.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It was okay it was a little confusing to understand being so young and all but for adults my mom said it was easy for her
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|This was a hit as a Christmas gift!  This is one of my wife's favorite shows, and I like it also.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was pretty good but I don't think that this is my type of book but I'm sure it'll still be a good one for a lot of people who are interested in these books.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Everything that I received was great! The product arrived when it was expected. I am very happy with the product!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm not done so I don't know why I'm writing this review- it's good so far. I'd like to finish it undisturbed
B004EPYZT4|5.0|I love the fact that this is not a remake but simply a retelling. Jason Momoa plays his own kind of Conan and does a good job.
1451695195|5.0|In terms of understanding the human being, near death research is, in my opinion, the most important scientific frontier that has opened in the last 30 years. There are literally thousands of accounts now on record detailing experiences of those who have momentarily \\"died\\" and lived to share what they saw, felt, came to know as true. While many of these stories contain imagery bordering the bizarre, they share many common elements.<br /><br />Some will find Eben Alexander's story incredible, for it contains imagery unlike that found in other accounts. The thing that sets this book apart, however, is that this near-death experience is being reported by a scientist, a former skeptic, a neurosurgeon who had been in the habit of giving short shrift to patients who reported to him similar happenings while under his own knife.<br /><br />It should be exceedingly difficult for anyone--believer or skeptic--to ignore this book, especially considering its source. The evidence is on the table, placed there by an extraordinarily credible, first-hand witness who understands completely the implications of the brain disease that triggered his experience. In addition, Dr. Alexander has an excellent grasp of the scientific community and the ramifications involved in sharing this story with his peers, which he does quite eloquently ... and without blinking.<br /><br />The book lends a strong and credible voice to the NDE research effort. I commend Eben Alexander for his courage, his skill, and his commitment to sharing with others a message of life that can't help but inspire us all.<br /><br />Rev. J Douglas Bottorff<br />author of Native Soul, Unlocking Your Life's Potential
B009JBZH54|4.0|Its a great box for any Batman or Christopher Nola´s Batman fan. The 3 movies come with the best quality of sound and image, so its a perfect oportunitty to vibrate with this amazing movies.<br />It came with a great packaging. The only weak point of this box is that the bonus disc of ´the dark knight´ and ´the dark knight rises´ is that are very poor.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|I had no idea how the story line was going to continue after Shiver but I loved Linger just as much and cannot wait to read Forever!!
B004IFYMYI|5.0|Taxi Driver is a classic film, and in this presentacion comes not only with the movie in blu ray (that have an incredible image and sound) it also came in a perfect packaging and with lots of very good extras.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath?<br /><br />If you can watch this film without crying, I don't want to know you. The woman behind me was on the edge of her seat, not just because I smell good. The audience at the 10:40 a.m. matinee - the theater was packed - applauded at the end, and was very slow to leave the theater, even as the closing credits rolled.<br /><br />Typical of big, fat, nineteenth-century novels, there are numerous implausible coincidences that drive the plot. These coincidences took me out of the movie, but that was a good thing. The human suffering onscreen was overwhelming: suicide, enslavement, exploitation of living humans' body parts, prostitution, disease, spite, malice, child abuse, starvation, sadism, a dying man escaping through very graphic sewerage. I did have to repeat to myself, \\"This is only a movie\\" even as tears streamed down my cheeks.<br /><br />Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children. He slaves for twenty years. He hauls a massive, capsized sailing ship. The scene does look like obviously fake CGI, but that doesn't make it any less gut wrenching. The workers sing, \\"You'll always be a slave. You are standing in your grave.\\" They are the men we see in Sebastiao Salgado photographs of Third World laborers. They are Ilya Repin's \\"Barge Haulers on the Volga.\\" Valjean's nemesis is the crazily obsessive policeman, Javert. They spar throughout the film, as Valjean's fate rises and falls and rises and falls and rises ... you get the idea.<br /><br />A story this big, this broad, and this implausible requires one hundred percent commitment from the performers. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is superb. He believes. He emotes. He is as big as the story itself. Jackman is the heart and soul of \\"Les Miserables.\\" I loved him. Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen - they all had me convinced. Russell Crowe was a surprising disappointment. He's a brilliant actor and I kept waiting for him to bring some fire, some ice, some power, some insight to Javert, the obsessive and punitive policeman who mercilessly hounds Jean Valjean. I wanted a memorable moment that would make me feel that Crowe's performance brought Javert to intimate life for me. That moment did not arrive.<br /><br />I wondered while watching this movie whether it will be embraced by the political left or the political right. It is a deeply and unashamedly Christian film. A Catholic priest, emulating Jesus, is the catalyst. Valjean spends the rest of the film working to live up to the priest's Biblical example. \\"Les Miserable\\" is leftist in that it depicts the poor rising up, but then the poor fail their own putative saviors, and allow them to be massacred, alone. Javert, representing law and order, is a monster. The film's brief glimpse of heaven is like some limousine liberal's fantasy.<br /><br />I think \\"Les Miserables\\" is as popular as it is for the same reason that Cinderella is so popular. When \\"Les Miserable\\" was a stage play, tickets were a very expensive and difficult to acquire luxury. It is ironic that a play about the wretched of the earth would be such a luxury entertainment. Why do we enjoy watching people much poorer and more desperate than we will ever be? Why do we pay for the privilege? Because we all see ourselves in Cinderella, in Jean Valjean, no matter how lucky we are. I'll certainly never standin cold sea water with iron shackles around my wrists and neck, overseen by a cold sadist like Javert. But, along with millions of others, I saw my own struggles in Valjean, and thanked God that I didn't have it as bad as he. If Jean Valjean can go on, I can, too!<br /><br />I wish the songs had been a tad better. There are a couple of good ones, \\"I dreamed a dream\\" and \\"Do you hear the people sing?\\" All the actors sing very well. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman sing especially well.in cold sea water with iron shackles around my wrists and neck, overseen by a cold sadist like Javert.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|Very happy with the value-to-quality you get with these headphones. Built well, fit well, sound great. No glam, just works well and well priced. Plenty good enough for the studio!
B000YIWF4C|4.0|It is a book worth reading many times and carrying around to flip one or two pages any time. Great to have it on kindle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book with lots of twists and turns.  Just when you think you have it all figured out - surprise.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed Defending Jacob.  I did not see the ending coming the way it did.  Surprised is an understatement.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is definitely worth the money! Although I still might get the ultimate edition (If it's worth it). If you want the 3 movies in Blu-Ray, this is definitely the way to go.
0345803507|5.0|I loved this book, and have read the whole Trilogy now.  I couldn't put them down once I started reading the first one.  They were so well written, and very exciting.  All of my friends are reading them now.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Second time to watch it, missed a few things the first time. Streaming quality was good, no issues at all
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I chose this rating for this book because I didn't think it was very great especially because it was a free book that came with my kindle . That is kind of pathetic. I recommend this book for anyone retarded that does not know anything.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to finish writing this review to get to the final book! Good authors keep me on the edge. Suzanne Collins is a GREAT author!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Very addictive. Looks beautiful and is lots of fun to play. Time slips away when you are playing it. It is an awesome game.

B009MF5BXK|5.0|The item bought was received on time and in great condition. There was no skipping or scratches on it. It was a great movie
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun for me and for my kids ages seven and six.  There are basic and challenging tasks to accomplish in each session, so this game easily accommodates different players' skill levels.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Got this for 6yr. grandaughter, even got mom building stuff and having fun playing this game. Played all of Xmas day
B0095R64AO|1.0|something wrong with this movie it is not funny! good idea not well developed, missing timings and comic rhythm, not good
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|a great amalgom of action, comedy, drama and romance. top nottch acting and entertaining for viewers of all ages.<br /><br />should have had a bigger audience. much better than shows still on the air with less quality.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Thus is a great game! Fun, creepy, and intelligent. Great graphics, scenes, and content too! Fun and addictive, but smart.
B0096HFOZO|4.0|This book is gross,funny funny and AWESOME! The characters are,Mr.Twit,Mrs.Twit,4 monkeys,big bird and some ravens. research on this was great!
B000YHG72E|4.0|will Ferrell is pretty great in his chaotic element and Zooey deschanel is damn sexy as a department store elf. The rest of the cast compliment these two greatly. There isn't a single character that could have been cast better.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|this lifeproof case was used which i didnt mind but the owner said it worked which it didnt.I tried it out and my phone screen was all wet, my phone didnt power on in the whole day.The cover was broken.
B000SZK41M|4.0|A classic in the genre of action and for those who hate Christmas movies, think outside the box and pick up this unlikely holiday joy ride!
B0018QPPXW|5.0|I enjoy this movie as one of my favorites from the past. Tom Cruise is excellent in the early part of his career and I love the music in this movie too.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Better than the bad right ups and comparisons made to old movie. Action is good, graphics are good. I would rent it again.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|a must read for women AND men, to better understand what it means to be a woman. Funny and thought-provocative!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I have had this \\"life proof\\" case for one day and have not done anything to it. First of all, it already has a crack in it and the corner is scuffed. Additionally, it is impossible to switch the sound on and off as the lever does not move with the covering over it. Finally, this case impairs texting. Do not waste your money on this product - it is definitely not worth it.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The plot is good and the characters are interesting. But the constant joking around by John Corey gets in the way of the story and eventually bores me.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|Just like the last two, Men In Black 3 did not disappoint.  It was funny, free spirited and easy to enjoy :)
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Review by Claudia<br /><br />This was a cute show & story line!  Some of the animation was very impressive (e.g. eagle flying)!
1250027624|5.0|This is a great gift.  Arrives looking nice and pristine.... gift recipient was delighted!  Lots of fun stuff inside for any Downton Abbey lover.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|My wife and I have been watching this show from the beginning and were hoping they would release an album of songs from the show. We love it!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I loved this book! I'm a huge fan of the Pendergast series & eagerly await each new installment. This story was full of twists & turns as usual that made me want to just read straight through until the end!
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This movie turned out to be a great movie. Not just because I like the actor so much but because it had such a wonderful plot. It made you feel that even in troubled areas in our cities it can take only one person to make a difference. Really it is a great movie and I'm not a big movie purchaser but this one I have watch several times.
B004HW7JH4|3.0|The first disc did not work. It showed &#34;incorrect disc&#34; when I tried to use it. The other discs worked fine. I enjoyed all of it. I'll return the first disc when I receive a replacement.
B0086700CM|5.0|Super fun game and very addicting. However, it gets kinda hard to beat after certain levels. It's a nice entertaining game though!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Amazing effects and witty dialogue. Enjoyed more than I thought I would, and I am looking forward to a sequel!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|AMAZING!!!! Can't say enough good about the music! It's a good review of the story before seeing the film. :)
B009MF5BXK|1.0|I wish I could get back the hour and a hald I wasted watching this. I pray a third movie isnt made, if so I guarantee no money will be made. Cheesiest lines and pharses throuout the movie. Horrible acting by everyone. Way to much digital blood and spilling. I would give this movie 0 stars but I cant. I just hope people read this and take my review to heart. A part of you dies after you watch this.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|It's no good, kindle fire needs an update, I've owned one for a year and it seems every time I use it I am limited to what I can do. Please make the kindle worth using! Maby access to the real android market /google play... Kindle is great for shopping and books that's it!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Fun game, I thoroughly enjoyed the killer clown story line! Wonderful artwork, delightfully illustrated characters, bravo! Good fun, great price,buy it.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Every track on this album is memorizing. It's beautiful and great for nighttime.<br />Pick this album up and you won't regret it.
B001706I5I|5.0|The kids love this movie and watched it twice in a row while mom cooked Christmas dinner. I recommend it
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This movie is the best of the all three movies...<br />Very great stuff...<br />Can't wait for another one...<br />My husband Adel and I enjoyed it alot....
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I like most Eastwood movies and this one was no different. My wife and I both enjoyed the movie. Baseball and Clint Eastwood in the same movie equals a good time for all!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh, this book. This beautiful, wonderful book. There are reasons why this book is a best seller. Perhaps it's the phenomenal writing. Or the beautiful characters. Both? Definitely both. This book is the best book I have ever read and I have read A LOT of books in my 16 years of life. It made me laugh and cry and laugh again. No matter what type of books you are into, you definitely should make some time for this one. I promise you will love it from the moment it starts to the moment it ends. The only thing I regret about this book is reading it so fast.
B003PJ6UHA|3.0|The authors receive 5 stars for their clear, thought-provoking and humorous written style to bring to the front and explain in 'almost' concise English language the issue of animal- and human sense-perception (and its relation to manifestations of consciousness) through describing mind-opening personal experiences and also by explaining various scientific experiments and principles.<br />The authors receive 0 stars for their apparent lack to include any (of the many) scientific experiments that also show a thought-provoking manifestation of consciousness in plant sense-perception. I propose it is because they still use in the text the concept of \\"our consciousness\\", in stead of realising, as Dr. Gustav Barnard would put it, that \\"Human beings does not have consciousness, consciousness has, amongst other things, human beings.\\" Wow!<br />And please, do not discard the manifestation of consciousness in 'gravel' (inert matter) when scientific experiments with Biocentrism as base is devised and conducted.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very good read.. really worth the time.. had me laughing out loud. Then such a happy ending..
B0094BB4TW|2.0|No way to scroll farther down for older news feeds.  Doesn't do much good if you can only see approx 10 most recent news feeds. Also, unlike facebook, you cannot sort the news feeds by most recent or top stories.  Hope you can fix a few bugs then it will be awesome!  Thanks!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|We're reading this for book club at my school. It will be a really good book to discuss. I also really enjoy Charlie and all his adventures.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I've always enjoyed Bing Crosby movies and Fred Astair movies.  This movie definitely does not disappoint.  A fun movie to watch.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I JUST THOUGH THE book was amazing. It was nice to read all the adventures he went through  his first year of high school.
B000HT3PPG|3.0|The colorized version is nice to watch but the colors are a little too bright; probably because of the lighting techniques employed for the B/W master copy.  The colorization is better than the earlier attempts in that the gray halo is not apparent around the object as in the earlier attempts.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|One of my friends describes it as &#34;Risk, but it ends&#34;. Strategy game with some complexity, but easy to understand once you get started and the games don't go on forever.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written and edited, and a bit difficult to put down. The author gambles with a plot  about a grim reality under an oppressive futuristic government that turns out to be a bitter struggle for the characters involved.Welcome to the Hunger Games.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|played on phones and kindle fire and it works well.  higher ratings get hard fast.  some later maps too large to enjoy.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|News just got a new makeover with the Flipboard app. Easy to use and a very powerful news browser, makes you want to check out the news like you never read any before, also this actually saves time and takes you right to the stories that you want to read, since you are the one that selects all of the categories.
B002ZHKZCO|5.0|Bought this for a Christmas present.  We picked names and it was on the list of possible gifts he wanted so he was well pleased with it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was a good book. Not the best that Jeff Kinney wrote of the series. The ending could have been better.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|In addition to really enjoying the vocal and guitar skills that are demonstrated on this CD, I am impressed with many of the songs that Phillips wrote.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Out was a good book. I think Jeff Kenny could do better though. I recommend that you read diary of a wimpy kid the last straw. One of my favorites.-Addison pilant
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Arthur Christmas is an excellent movie to watch on Christmas Eve. Very creative and the animation is very, very good.
