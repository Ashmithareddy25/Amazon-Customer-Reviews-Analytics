B00448SE4S|4.0|I enjoyed the effects, the music, and the pace of this movie. I give it points for originality. Its a comedy with a moral tale. I expect some people may hate it, but I think it holds up well even watching it the second or third time round.
B00A0T0NWQ|3.0|great movie, poor library tech for playback . the Japanese and German language scenes have subtitles in the original and on disk.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season three is absolutely fantastic! I loved every episode! The quality was great! I am very happy with this purchase!
0385751532|5.0|This is a wonderful story for adults and children alike.  Great for understanding without being too disturbing.  This book should initiate conversation about differences, treatment, and history.  Wonderful story.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was Reallz happy when this came out on kindle fire because I had played it on my friends I touch. it is just as good as the Apple version and I Reallz recommend it!!!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This is a good Lada Gaga CD. &#34;Born This Way&#34; is a CD that has radio singles, great singing, and good musicality.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am so in love with this series. I've finished book one and two and am anxiously awaiting book three.<br /><br />Since reading Fifty Shades of Grey I'm always looking for books similar to and this is it. There are similarities and I LOVE them. Strong, hot, crazy rich, powerful male lead kinda obsessed with the female lead. Yes please!<br /><br />Gideon and Eva are different characters from Christian and Ana and I love them. By the end of book two Gideon will make your panties disintegrate. Holy cow I loved the ending of book two. A great big thank you to the author for not leaving us on an awful cliff hanger seeing as there is a bit of a lag until book three is available.<br /><br />Stop reading this review and go buy the book!
B000002IM7|5.0|King's X debut CD &#34;Out of the Silent Planet&#34; is an awesome start to a long career for the hard rock veterans that is KIng's X.
B004XGN8W4|1.0|the display quiatly is very poor,  i was expecting another thing in this product but is not good, the case protec the sp3 and xbox
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Come on this is Zep! Jason does such a good job you would think it's his father playing. A must have!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Thought I was going to see a comedy.  Not so.  Stressful marital relationship with many tears and fears.  Production values were okay.  Acting really good.  But story is not fun.
B007VYQ9G2|4.0|This DVD came in the mail very fast and in great condition for a used item.  Watched it right away and had no problems.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|What a herculean project!  To portray Thatcher - a most complex person with a complex life - and all from her point of view.  That focus may have stunted some of the story, but still in all, top notch.
0375826726|5.0|Headline says it all. Nuff said. Just go and buy the book. You will not be disappointed at all. Its that good
0547884591|5.0|The book gives you a blueprint of how to develop new skills. The author explains how he deconstructs the basics of a technique and then using a personally evolved methodology how to learn it as fast as possible. Highly recommended.
B000SEI230|4.0|As usual, Nicholas Sparks gives us a wonderful escape into a different world... a world where we laugh and cry with the characters portrayed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i only read the sample.at the end, i found myself going &#34;a[...] so soon?&#34; :( im 11,halfway through the h.p series. iwant something longer!!!read azkaban in ONE DAY! &#62;:(<br />But I am thrilled. Want this. :3
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Good when you want a diversion for a few minutes... read a chapter and try to guess the ending. Characters believable; adventures well written.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|only gave it a two because they are 2 of my all time favorite actors......but it was awful......rent It's complicated.....now that was a great movie
B004LROUNG|5.0|How does he do it? Every book grabs you after one or two pages. What a gift!! One of those Grisham books you wish wouldn't end... just another gift of escape by John Grisham.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I enjoyed the prior men in black movies but with an amused detachment. This one was more engaging and less &#34;silly&#34;
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Pride... and prejudice... just like it says... Allows us to spy on a world and in a time we'll never know, where pride rules at the expense of others, and prejudice is at its best... If you see yourself in the pages, it's a good thing to step back and think about how to change... or read just for the enjoyment.
B001O6W9QC|3.0|I dont really get Ben Stiller and his brand of humor, however i am a big RDJ fan and decided to watch it. I found parts of the movie funny, and had it not been for Ben Stiller i would have probably found the movie much more enjoyable. Slap stick over the top humor. I would suggest you see it if you are in a fart joke mood.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Flynn's books.  I can never put one down!  Can't wait to read another.  One of my favorite authors.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Brave was just that in my book. it was a brave move for Pixar to step outside of their comfort zone and make, IMO, a different type of movie. The Scottish lore, the characters and the story telling were powerful. I would NOT suggest this movie for children under 5.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Nicely packaged, a very good price.....the original uncut UK version; what is there not to like.<br /><br />Having the series on discs allowed me to view several times, both with subtitles on and off.  Due to English accent, some indistinctly spoken lines, and disc rather than direct tv viewing allowed me to enjoy the nuances.<br /><br />I did not see the original Downton Abbey series so this was a good way for me to get involved.  I truly enjoy the series, looking forward to Jan. 6 season three viewing in US.  I admit to checking the spoilers from a UK site....won't stop my enjoyment of season three.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Tom C. did a nice job... only positive thing i can say. I would not suggest this to anyone ever.
B00009R6J7|5.0|I'd been told this type was the one to get, not a cheaper one.<br /><br />I had been led correctly, works well with all shots.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Joss W. did a fantastic job of bringing all the characters together. Also the story and presentation felt true to the spirit of the original comic books. RDJ is amazing and does a fantastic job. Also... Hulk Smash... yes.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It is one of the most interesting tv show I have seen in a long time.  I will recommend it to anyone who likes interesting tv with little violence
B00ADYYY50|5.0|By Far A Really Good Album. Can't Stop Listening To It. i Recommend People To Buy It And Listen to It.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Enjoyed the book thoroughly.  Good perspective of life and times leading up to WWI for both the working classes and those of privilege.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This was an entertaining film. But I couldn't help but sense a lot contrivance in its structure. But what will please lots of folks is that there is also a lot of guns, noise, explosions and impossible feats.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I love paranormal, I love certain types of fantasy.  I love mystery and seemingly impossible love stories.  This book contains all of that and more.  Rebecca gets you hooked from the very beginning.  Very well written and easy to read.  I was so enraptured I finished the book the day after I started it, which is saying something for my busy life.  Can't wait to read more of this series.
B005MMYGSS|5.0|I caught a few of these episodes on Starz by off chance the other night and enjoyed it so much I sought it out here. If you're looking for love, sex, romance, violence, allegiance, betrayal, and vengeance you will find it here. Loved it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read this book after reading Gone Girl, already being a Gillian Flynn fan. This book did not disappoint! While the scenes that take place in the pig farm are a little graphic and disturbing, the book is fantastic, complete with the twists and turns that Gillian Flynn executes with brilliance!
B008DVJMAW|5.0|For any Southern Rock fan, this is a required album. Every song is a hit. They just keep coming. Musically, I think they fall between .38 Special, the Allman Brothers, and Lenard Skynard.<br /><br />I saw Blackberry Smoke recently at a local festival (I admit I came to see the headliner, but these guys blew them out of the water!) and was amazed at the energy and talent they had. During extended solos they threw in some Allman Brothers and some Led Zeppelin as well as others. Can't say enough good things about their show, this album, and the band in general.<br /><br />Smoke 1!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me a while ago and it took me a while to get to it. Having read it now, I wish I had read it sooner. Such a heartbreaking book and a powerful read, I absolutely loved it!
B00A12VW86|5.0|Love Green Day!!!!! They are so amazing and so is this album!!! Can not wait for the the third of their trilogy!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|this is one great game that u have to own. my only sugesten is not to get all of power ups to the max, because then its way too easy and not as fun as it was in the start, but still fun. as long as you don't do that your good. but don't listen to me, that my oppinon not yours so ..... go bye the game Temple Run or Temple Run BRAVE!!!!!
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|Better than E2! Jet Li is hardly visible in E2, but in this first version he is awesome, and funny.
B000000W5F|4.0|A Reviewer here said this is a \\"predictable\\" Stones album. That's good for me! :)<br /><br />Another review said this is [mostly] a collection of leftovers. Even better!<br /><br />Oh yeah..and a self-penned set by a couple of above average composers....now I'm psyched...as we said when this album came out, originally.<br /><br />Very big, bulky blocks of Stone: START ME UP, hooky and funky; HANG FIRE, hooky and funky, revisited; LITTLE T & A, oddball but harmonic and rhythmic - great mix; WAITING ON A FRIEND, a Stones Classic - made a terrific video. BLACK LIMOUSINE, here's the one really \\"predictable\\" track as it has all the Stones funk 'n roll and a typically welcome Chuck Berry-style solo, courtesy of a dude named Keith. Yeah, it sounds alot like WHAT A SHAME. Relax, baby.<br /><br />It's still early in my first, full Tattoo visit and so I don't know if the remainder of the tracks will get under my skin. But I confidently deliver a solid four stars.
B00007E7K0|5.0|It seems to made like the original cap that was on the camera. I am very happy with it and would purhase another in the future.
B008Y6SA36|5.0|Always loved this movie but was to cheap to buy it until now.  Streaming it is great!  I don't have to clutter my house up with a bunch of DVD cases.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|In The Time Keeper, Mitch Albom, takes us on another thought provoking journey through the souls of men. The idea of a person controlling time is not new but the thought that the person controlling time is only controlling it because he created it.<br /><br />Mr Albom presents the readers with characters who have too much time, characters who have too little time and a character who has all the time in the world. This book is well written, flows effectively and captures the reader into their world. Recognizable with references to today and references to times of old, Mr Albom has here a book that will cause you to ask yourself what will you do with your time left.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is a book that will captivate audiences for a while yet to come and then will probably make the transition to a motion picture.<br /><br />Thanks Mitch and see you next time.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It was just so much fun to follow this gentleman through his adventures.  I laughed out loud more than once!  My spouse is reading it now, and he rarely reads what I read.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim delivers again in his witty, direct tone. Wonderful to get hands on this.<br />I am reading on kindle. I am loving it. Recommend for anyone who needs incremental daily changes in life and live it to the fullest.<br /><br />Isura
B001CDWFPC|3.0|I use the ESV study bible routinely for bible study in the paper edition. The print is too small and our church too dark so I prefer to use a kindle but there are problems!<br />I recently updated to the current Kindle Fire and hit all kinds of navigation problems. The new kindle is designed well for 'serial' reading, but NOT for 'random access', flipping between books, chapters and verses.<br /><br />This is for Kindle edition only. On the Kindle Fire there is a HUGE difference in navigation between the original (1st Generation) and the current 2nd Generation.<br /><br />On Gen1 you could pull up menu /  table of contents / pick a book of the bible then a chapter number.<br />Gen2 has done away with all that and collapses it all into a long list with every section listed in one GoTo page - imagine scrolling though every chapter of the bible.<br />This renders the study bible worthless on the current generation Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Consolation prize: The ESV bible reader app [[ASIN:B004UFUD2Q ESV Bible]] provides reasonable navigation, is free, but lacks the study material.<br /><br />Update:<br />An updated version of the kindle ESV study bible exists.<br />BUT it takes a lot of unexplained steps to get the upgrade and get it active on your kindle.<br />However, once it is there the navigation moves from abyssmal to decent!<br /><br />GoTo now lists the books of the bible, and tapping on a book lists its contents unambiguously for the sort of access you anticipate.<br />[...]
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|ultimately stupid with no redeeming qualities. everything about this film sucks. I have to write a certain amount of words to describe this piece of trash, but I refuse to waste them on this hokey stupid movie.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This is a great read. A nice little mystery with love stories gives it a great twist. I couldn't put it down.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I had a lot of fun getting to level 101 then had the game reset itself and now have to start all over again.  so far no word from gameloft despite filling out their form.  Whatever you do, don't spend real money in this game.  you could just lose it.
B003B02O3C|5.0|did not think the subject matter of the book would be all that interesting but I was wrong . Started reading it and couldn't stop . John Grisham just has a way of holding you captive to his every sentence . Don't want to give away the story but it is very good , can't imagine anyone being sorry they purchase this book .
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I used to use the Nostromo gameboard for years and recently picked this up when I upgraded my computer.  This device worked wonderfully.  I really enjoy having the joystick on the thumb.  I would definitely recommend this to any gamer would wants to get the most out of their experience.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I expected more. There were definitely bright moments in this movie (the first part was pretty good) but it *seriously* lagged through the middle.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared<br />Extremely funny and enjoyable. Unlike anything I have read before.
B007EECSFA|3.0|After falling in love with The House at Riverton, I became a huge Kate Morton fan.  However, this latest book is a disappointment.  The plot was too basic and the twist at the end was very predictable.  The wartime London setting was not as interesting as the English country manors of previous books.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a wonderful film and a refreshing change from all the sex and violence. There is a real story here and some wonderful life lessons.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|the best awesome piece of work could watch this s*** over and over again.lucas is the man go star wars
B004HW7JHE|5.0|This show is an exceptional show from top to bottom.  It is a masterpiece.  The show is filmed looks brilliant on Blu-ray, offers breathtaking cinematography, is carefully edited, and has a wonderful orchestra as a sound track.  The stories are intriguing, powerful, and this show is definitely on the top ten list of the best shows of the year, if not the decade.  I highly recommend watching this film.  Each character will get you wondering what is going on in their life and the show never lets up -- for five seasons strong so far!  How many shows can do that?  Very few.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|To my mind not quite as good as some of his other Jack Reacher novels. Not as tightly written. Not worth the kindle price.
B0092SPYQG|4.0|Can't for the life of me figure why his life is still so bad! some great tracks on here though!
0060987464|5.0|amazing book it really gives you an look into what made him into what he is today. it has hidden humor in it. I love it I would defiantly recommend reading it
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It is so frustrating to start reading book after book that does not meet up to the reviews. Thank goodness the first two Kingkiller novels have me waiting for a moment to sit a read.  The character and story development had me intrigued. Very refreshing after reading so many books with plots copied from other authors.
1932735410|5.0|I must say that after I read all the comments from the reviewers I was motivated to invest in buying this book. I have reviewed the content and studied only this book and I was able to pass my PMP exam this past week !!!!... I truly recommend this book because it will break down the materials in order and will let you focus on the core principles to make you pass the exam, as well as it gives you the opportunity to assess yourself and find the gaps and work on to remediate those gaps and prep you for the exam.<br />Good luck to all of you out there, I just want to put the word out that I would spend the money than retake the exam.  Thank you RITA
B001EC2ISA|5.0|This is one of those movies I consider a modern classic.  Good clean fun for the whole family with lots of memorable scenes.  The price was unbeatable too!
0763655465|5.0|This book, along with Little Owl Lost by the same author, are delightful!! The graphic illustrations are really adorable and the humor in the books is silly enough for kids and subtle enough for adults. I hope this author does more books, but so far every time I attend a baby shower, I buy these books.
B0099114WO|5.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were great together. Story was well written.<br />Tommy Lee Jones plays a perfect miserable aging husband.
1401322786|4.0|Enjoyable read that helps us pause to examine our own lives.  Nicely crafted and this would make an ideal gift.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|her songs on this CD are incredible and happen to be my favorites.  I have all of her albums but this one CD is great to listen to while working or cleaning the house.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Logan's Run has been a favorite since I first saw it 30 years ago.  And for the low price, you can't go wrong.
B003YUU6T8|2.0|This is New York City and I would rather walk barefoot than in a pair of actual Crocs. They are a statement of anti fashion, or I might go as far as to say aesthetic sadism, that says: the pain my looking bad inflicts on you makes me feel good.<br />To my astonishment I saw these and they seemed like they were just understated, comfortable slip on sneakers with the very slightest touch of Joe American Style, I even felt remorse for being so hard on Crocs, after all, their logo is particularly cute -- Oh but I was so wrong.<br /><br />They arrived and, they are much wider than you see in the pictures. Inside was all full of semi rigid plastic pieces you have to pull out.<br />Trying them on they felt plenty long enough for my foot to have an extra half inch.<br />Here is the problem because of the lip around the edge of the curved plastic insole - that looks just like the inside of an actual pair of Crocs and feels almost like the same rubber as the underneath of the shoe - they rub on the edges of my feet and because the insole curves up all around on my smaller toes they started to give me sore patches and blisters within a few hours.<br /><br />I realized what these actually are: Crocs in Vans clothing - just a pair of crocks on the inside that have been dressed up to look like vans on the outside. No wonder they look so rotund.<br /><br />To be fair, they are adequately spacious on the inside, but since they do not come in half sizes, getting a whole size up would feel like I was slapping around in a pair of clown shoes.<br /><br />I am a runner and run lots of places in normal flat shoes such as Sanuk's Standard Slip-On, which is a very cool shoe by the way.<br />These Crocs Sneakers are amply padded on the bottom, almost bouncy, but shaped for the feet of a cartoon character. Too bad because I like the color, and I liked that Crocs were trying to redeem themselves.
B008OOYALE|5.0|You should because even though they bribe you to rate it 5 stars,you get to raise dragons and that is awesome!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Can't put the book down! It even raised my blood pressure as I waited in the room at the doctors office, haha
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|One of the Holiday Classics in our household.<br />Althoug we watched the B&W version there is a colorized version out there too.<br />Ist funny and Fun.
B000M53GM2|5.0|We love the Pierce Brosnan Bond. So we are collecting all the movies starting with these. The service was very quick and I got them in less than a week.
1558908358|5.0|What an imaginative look into your PC!  After you watch it, be sure to get Tron Legacy.  It is a great pair of movies.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I'm disappointed with the limited amount of newsfeed you are able to see with this.  If anyone out there has suggestions that may help me see that I'm doing something wrong, they would be appreciated.
B001TODOCM|5.0|Another excellent read by one of my now favorite authors. His novels are great reads and hold my interest. Plot and characters great
0977326403|5.0|Thanks it appears to work just fine. Less expensive than other ways to order it. I'm satisfied with my purchase.
044022425X|3.0|I agree with other comments in that this is a disappointment after the first 3 books.  Jaime has turned into a caveman, just fighting and not listening.  Roger is not acting like the Oxford scholar that he is.  He meets Jaime and he doesn't tell him his name?  All he can do is admit that he \\"took Brianna's maidenhead\\"?  Really?  But then there wouldn't be all the misunderstanding that makes the consumes of the book.  It just seems very formula to me.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I love all the Avenger movies and I am working on getting them all collected. The service was very fast.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|If you liked the original Tron then you will love Tron Legacy.  What a creative look into the PC world.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|Everybody will love this movie, the whole family enjoys it, young and old. Great quality, fun story, makes everybody think about what's important in life, and to enjoy it!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Don't waste your money.  I was really disappointed. This guy tracks himself everywhere.  It was so boring I actually quit reading when the helicopter crashed in the compound!  That's boring.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Entertaining way to spend some time worth down loading would recommend it easy to play can be easy or harder game will help you out if you have never played it before
B00881VLCE|5.0|I think that this is a pretty cool app. it even allows you to increase the number of puzzle pieces used. there are free puzzles you can do as well as paid. it is really an interesting app.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it!!!!! I bought book three before I finished  reading this one! I highly recommend the entire series - you won't regret it!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This one took awhile to figure out. Hard to see where it was going sometimes and ended in a whimper.
B004G6009U|5.0|We love this movie, a very fun cute show, great animation, and it's great quality. One the whole family enjoys watching together.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I have fun but hate the dark rooms I also think it is too hard to buy things unless you play this all of the time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I absolutely love this app! Its what I depend on to get my day started everyday. I like the feature that alllows for the use of setting personal music as an alarm, instead of the classic annoying beeping sound. Listening to my own choice of music is more motivating and helps me get out of bed. All i can say is that I love this app, everyone should use it!!! ^o^
B004PR71JC|5.0|It's so nice to have lively music that the kids can listen to (without inappropriate language) and that I can listen to as well.  Typical &#34;kid music&#34; drives me crazy.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The version for the smart phone does not have all the game modules as the full version but it is still a great game. The graphics were very well done.
B0063IH60K|4.0|For what it is, this version Is nicely distracting and provides enough lotions even when not connected to the web..
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|This is a great movie, the animation is beautiful and the quality of the blu-ray and dvds is great. One the whole family enjoys watching together.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|A Christmas tradition for us.  We like to run the gamut, so it is 'Miracle', 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation', and 'A Christmas Story'  (&#34;You'll shoot your eye out kid.&#34;).
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This movie is just incredible. I liked all of the animation and how effective the scenes are. Watching on 7:1 home theater system was very entertaining. One thing to be aware of this movie is graded as PG13 as there are lot of gun shooting etc, but kids will like it. Some scenes are very creepy and nail biting. I see that there is a TinTin 2 coming from the way the movie ended, but for someone who has read several of TinTin comics growing up, this was nice. I wish there are more scenes with Thomson and Thomson. They are very funny and I was disappointed with their low presence on the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a missing person story.  At least at first; husband comes home to find signs of a struggle and his wife, Amy, missing.  That is all I'm going to say about plot line so I don't give anything away.  The characters are so believable and well fleshed out you really care about what happens.  Did the husband kill his wife?  Was she kidnapped?  Just read this book!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book; it definitely lived up to expectation. The descriptions of the war scenes totally drew me in with the characters. Looking forward to book two.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was my 1st romantic novel. I really enjoyed reading the book. If the leading man Conner was not a fictional character my kudos for his strong character and beliefs.
B002LMV7TS|4.0|Love this show, we have to watch it every Christmas, Jim Carrey is awesome in it. The only complaint I have is while watching the blu-ray we noticed some scenes were missing.<br />Scene 1: Cindy Lou in class saying she wants to do her report on the Grinch<br />Scene 2: The neighborhood lighting display contest - picking the winner<br />Both of these scenes were left out of the movie, the one was in deleted scenes but we never found the other one.<br />We know these scenes because we watch this show every year on ABC Family, so I don't know why they were left out. I'd love to give it 5 stars but the product didn't come through. Still a good movie
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great for travel and storage!  This works great, always have a charged headset when traveling and it is a nice size and provides protection for the device in my travel gear.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|greatest game ive played. id recommend it to not only my friends but to anyone who wants to experience a fun and totally addictive game such as this.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|&#34;When I RE-UP on reloaded, I'mma hurt them bad!&#34; Nicki wasn't kidding. The Re-Up is such a good EP. Better than her last album lyrically and sonically. Its definitely more gritty, with more all hip-hop songs. I love it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We technically have all the movies, but because we got them back when the series started some of the original DVD's are scratched. This was the perfect gift to my sister who loved watching and rewatching the movies but couldn't because our DVD's were older than our DVD player! Loved it!!
0307719219|4.0|The ship was good, but the product quality is not so good. My suggest is to send books with more quality
0788832182|5.0|The movie is fun for everyone and the used quality was one that worked well for me. It was a good value.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I watched the original Swedish film, \\"Let the Right One In,\\" several months ago and thought it was great so I decided to give this remake a shot.  Most remakes don't live up to the original; this is one does and then some. Unlike most vampire movies which dwell on horror and suspense this movie has that but centers around the interaction and seduction of a twelve year old bullied and lonely boy by a \\"twelve year old girl\\" vampire.  The child actors are very good as is the directing.  Symbolic of the boy's isolation is the absence of any direct camera views of his divorced parents.  Drawn to his loneliness a bond forms between the boy and vampire and slowly he is drawn not only into accepting what the vampire is but eventually assisting what he vampire requires.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Gameloft now enters into the world of strategy war games,the most common in this category are World at War,Forces of War,and Modern War all very solid games and they all know what they are: STRATEGY WAR GAMES!This game doesnt know what it is,is it like the games i previoulsy described?is it like the successful Nintendo series:Advance Wars?or is it a Facebook app?All of those are mashed into one accord in this game plus many IAPS(which I disdain) to move on in the game.The graphics look like a smash between Asian an European designers which I dont like at all.It makes the game looks cartoonish and not real.A vague, yet uninteresting story ,it seems like a copy Gamelofts other series Modern Combat which is this:Koreans are attacking America save it.Completely  boring and useless.<br /><br />Pros:The game doesnt take much space up 0.88 Gb not as much as other Gameloft games.(Thats not really a pro is it?)<br /><br />Cons:A lot of IAPS,doesnt have a real identity,graphics are horrible,bad plot its misjointed and non captivating,and gets boring after 2 min.<br /><br />Gameloft need to improve on their free games they are horrible and since they are free it appears Gameloft employs novices to make them.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This movie is an all-time Halloween favorite movie in our house. Finally realized I didn't have a copy of it in the house.<br />Item was delivered on time and in good condition.<br />Very satisfied.
0762777931|5.0|This book is worth the money. The wealth of health truth inside covers so much information in such a sassy, fun way. I LOVE this book.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I was only excited about Depp playing Barnabus because of the attention he would bring to a series I love. Wish they hadn't played it for laughs but I'll take more DS however it's served up.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I read the bad reviews of the movie first, I almost did not want to rent it.<br />But for only $4 dollars, I am very happy I did. I would dis regard most of<br />the bad reviews, the movie is much better than I thought.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I like 3 songs on the album and rest are more pop than my taste. It's kind of a unique style but I have no idea what exactly Lana Del Rey is trying to be.<br /><br />Overall the album is enjoyable and covers a varying styles of music from rap, to Pink type , to slow sad songs.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This is a really cool game its fun loving for kids and adults but it really ducks that you have to depend on buying things to get further and sign on to social networks as well. I think its silly and to give this to a child they would buy up a lot by mistake and post things to my friends who may not be interested in such a thing.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Excellent writing style, gripping flow of events. I have always admired Lincoln,... this book has elevated my admiration much further.<br /><br />A must reading for all students of US history.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I think anyone should have this! It has tons of different sounds to choose from and you can even dim the screen! The part i like the most, though, is that the clock even tells you what the whether is like in your area! It is terriffic!
B0054SMID0|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer gives criminal law a nice, bare-knuckle boxing finish.  Matthew McConaughey taps into his steely charm but the movie allows itself to have a good, winking, time.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I have heard the Foo Fighters on the radio and seen some of their live videos. I thought I would bet a CD which has many of their hits.  The CD delivers, but I can only give it 4 stars because I am not a die hard fan.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Really enjoy this album.<br /><br />Fun, upbeat music that makes me want to dance and makes me happy.  A bunch of songs that will make you tap your toes and sing along
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Lucas sold the rights to Star Wars to Disney.  So now Disney is going to beat this dead horse for years to come.  Overpriced, re-badged fluff.  Like this app.
B008G59IKO|1.0|So far !uno is the best out of the three so far. !dos is absolute the worst Green Day album I have hear since the groups existance. I hope !tre will make up for it!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love free news since I do not have cable. Yes, I do like the BBC news because I like to get the news from different sources. I like this app but I prefer to get the BBC news videos via Swagbucks so that I can earn more Swagbucks. But it is nice to know that I still have this app as an option.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like everything about it except when you try to input a specific location. I tried to put in my address and wound up someplace in Spain, with no way to correct it other than to start over, again and again.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|When my husband and daughter wanted to rent this for our &#34;Family Movie Night&#34;, I was less than thrilled.  I am so glad I watched it with them.  It was great!  What a heart-warming and funny story.  I want my own little group of Minions now, they were hilarious...
B000TERK3C|5.0|The Bends is one of Radioheads all time classic albums. Every song is amazing and it has an undertone of sadness and regret throughout the whole album.
B000EQ5TSI|5.0|Bought this for my son, but enjoyed watching it as much as he did!  The story was amazing and the acting was great!
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Some of the best music I have heard in a while. Clever lyrics and very easy to listen to. Buy it.
B009186JYI|5.0|\\"Charlie Is My Darling\\" is a fantastic document of the Rolling Stones early days. I enjoyed it MUCH MORE than \\"Crossfire Hurricane,\\" which was a document of their first 10 years as a band. \\"Charlie\\" was put together by ousted manager/Producer Andrew Loog Oldham, who played a VERY significant role in their development. He WAS given his due in \\"Hurricane.\\" This really showed what it was like to be on tour with this band. It is more telling than The Beatles \\"Hard Days Night.\\" There are scenes of Mick and Keith making fun of then-current Beatles songs. This is a great DVD to own. Most of you know I am a big Beatle devotee, but I also have great respect for Mick and his merry band of degenerates. Great insight by Brian Jones in this film also..
B009S8PEHY|5.0|It's Rod Stewart.  It's Christmas.  It's old standards.  Is there anything more to say?  Well-done classics for this time of year.
B0040X46TE|5.0|If you have ever heard if &#34;IZ&#34; you will really enjoy this CD. I was really impressed and would highly recommend it. His voice<br />is beautiful.
B005XRU62C|5.0|Not as good as the first album but still a great listen. Plenty of songs that capture the energy and passion of the band perfectly. While not as good as the first album I still listen to this extremely often.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This album is so awesome. I definitely love the style and work from these guys. Looking forward to the next album!
B004G600A4|5.0|Arrived on time as we requested.  No issues.  Don't know why I have to write a certain number of words.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|and a few surprises.  Tommy Lee Jones is only in the beginning and the end.  Overall -- I'd buy the movie
630463949X|5.0|I gave this as a gift (I have my own copy) to a friend who lives on a mountain above lake Lugano in Switzerland.  He used to be a DJ (still does occasionally, even though he has a doctorate degree), and has these very, very large speakers.  He can spread this music in a quality way throughout his valley.  I really love seeing everyone perform on a large screen TV.  This rates as one of my favorite DvDs.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie with some insight into an egomaniac who knew he was one and who had a real talent for warfare...and for shooting off his mouth, which got him into professional hot water more than once. George C. Scott does an outstanding job in the role. The musical score is by turns rousing and haunting. Karl Malden does a great, understated job as the modest Omar Bradley, which is an added bonus, as is the actor who plays the German officer who seems to be channeling Patton's soul all the way from Berlin. You don't have to be a warmonger to love this movie. I'm a liberal Democrat who opposed the war in Iraq from Day One, and I really enjoyed it.
1451696191|5.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is a powerful novel that hits every person in some personal way. Charlie is narrating to unknown person about his new life of being a freshman in high school. He doesn't give any of the actual names of people he describes, since he's trying to keep the unknown person from figuring out who he actually is. This sense of mystery keeps alive a possibility that these people could be anyone, and gives the reader the feeling of attachment. Any one person is bound to have experienced one of the conflicts that Charlie encounters. Charlie's life gets turned around when he meets his new friends, who are seniors, Sam and Patrick. They introduce Charlie to many high school activities ranging from girlfriends to drugs. As he struggles with social awkwardness and his fragile mental state, Charlie manages to go through his first year of high school with a very unstable lifestyle. His relationships with people flow though the book as a jerky, up and down roller coaster. The profound amount of character development of Charlie's friends will remind yourself of the people in high school that were known as \\"that guy\\" or \\"that girl\\". Charlie's character, however, is a completely different story. It's rare to find someone that can represent Charlie, making him a pretty unrealistic protagonist. His too sweet to be true personality was entertaining, and at many times comical, to shadow. All in all, the novel is very moving and you can't help but feel sorry for Charlie. What makes the book so amazing is that anyone can feel connected to  any one of the conflicts in their own unique way. After reading the book, you feel different, and view the whole book as if you've been experiencing someone's life in their shoes.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Bought it for my daughter who is a big Phantom of the Opera fan. What could be better then getting to watch it close up!
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|I downloaded this book on my Kindle and I am enjoying it.  A friend lent me the first 2 books and I really like the story.  My only hope is that there is a definable end to the story and I am not left hanging until a 4th book is written.
044024367X|3.0|I have read most of the books in the Reacher series.  I just didn't think this one was as good as some of the others
0307730697|5.0|vlikens<br /><br />This is an incredible book!  Admittedly, I love to read non-fiction, but this book is outside of my genre in that I don't usually read military non-fiction.  However, it was the best book I've read this year (and I've read nearly 150 books in 2012, so that's saying something).  Adam Brown's story should be told...it was so stirring on a cellular level; not only what he overcame to become a Seal, but what he gave up for what he believe in -- that's TRUE commitment.  This book is a MUST read.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I've watched this series from the beginning and have really enjoyed it. This season is pretty downbeat, as the main characters bump up against the barriers imposed by the weird social restrictions of the times, including sexism, racism and homophobia. I loved how Betty has gotten fat in this season's episodes - the Weight Watchers segments are a little slice of feminine self-effacement masquerading as heartfelt self-help. It's interesting that nobody featured in those segments is morbidly obese or anything close to it - so different from now! If you like everything to be perky and cute, you may not like this season. I found it entertaining and thoughtful. Can't wait to see what happens next season.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This version has been on my wishlist for a long time and was glad to score it at a reasonable fair price at amazon.com - especially the 4ht disc containing the interviews with philip k.dick - which is my favourite sci fi writer - and the deleted and alternate scenes are a joy to watch.  This version stands now high on my BD shelf between the European final cut version BD and the also sheer beautiful spinner included unicorn cover edition.  Each time i see this film i am enljoying the sheer beautiful sight of the spinners flying through the LA air.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The electrical insulation on the original USB Cable that came with my Amazon Kindle dried and cracked, leading to exposed wire and the attendant safety hazards.  This replacement seems fine so far.  The smaller connection end is a rather tight fit, but it fits and allows me to charge the Kindle battery.  Whether the electrical insulation is better this time remains to be seen.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|What a great series.  My only complaint is that the book ends like a cliff-hanger of a favorite TV series.
B007PS0X0W|3.0|I imagine there will be another movie that includes finding Michael.  There was plenty of action.  Beckinsale does a superb job as always
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|This movie was funny and well written. It played well on my Roku.  Would watch again.  Not sure what else to say.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. Not one of Johnny Depps bigging shows. But it is very good. Try it !
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I rushed to read this book a couple days before I saw the movie and it was so good that I had no trouble putting it down. Beautifully written and it keeps you thinking and feeling the whole way through. Not super action-packed, but definitely interesting enough to keep your attention.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The worst out of the series IMO. Could have been much better. I am looking forward to the next movie so that this series does not end on a weak note.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Book three is great.  Now that I have completed all 5 books, I find it hard to remember what is in each of the books.
B004JMY312|4.0|Appropriate for any age.  This is just a fun movie.  Good story line and great acting.  I have this movie
1407130293|5.0|i would definitely recommend buying this in the trilogy set.  this is a very well written and fast moving story.  i'm so glad i can stqrt the next book immediately!
B00773YOB4|5.0|She's still underated........great blues and gritty truth. I imagine she scares a lot of folks. Such a survivor and so much talent.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|We have a lot of trouble finding books my 10 year old daughter enjoys. She loved this! I read some of it with her. It is well written, keeps your interest and the end makes you want to read the next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|nice graphics, easy and very nice. We child spend a lot hours fun. Excellent game. Maybe this game one year, buy my console
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Poor story line.  The movie was carried with excellent acting by some characters.  Something was definitely lacking here.  I would not rent it again.
034580404X|1.0|sorry, but i just couldn't force myself to jump on this bandwagon and gave up after chapter 6.  this was described  as an erotic self help book, so i figured, okay....i'm all about continuing education!  a 20 year old girl, psycho analyzing a  mixed up sexual deviant, written by an author with a brand new thesaurus.  yikes, you gotta be kidding me.  how about going old school and give john cleland - memoirs of a woman of pleasure  or fanny hill and try if this is your thing?
B00846REIS|2.0|After reading several raving reviews I decided to give this book a try. I was very disappointed to find that it was nothing remotely worth my time. I enjoy romance in a story as much as the next girl, however, I prefer it to be along with a solid plot line, but there was nothing even resembling one in this pile of steaming crap. The entire \\"story\\" is shallow and silly. I'm actually embarrassed that I read the book, not because I'm a prude, but because I wasted my time and brain space on utter drivel. I kept waiting for the plot line to develop and when it didn't, and I realized it was the end of the book, it left a very bad taste. I just kept thinking there would be more....maybe some sort of rise of action? Nice little narrative? Beginning, middle, and end? Some friends become enemies, some enemies become friends? At the end your main character is richer from the experience? Got a compelling protagonist? Got an obstacle for him to overcome? Nope!!!<br />All I can say is this type of writing, eroticism for the female demographic, (I guess we can't get mad at our husbands when we catch them with dirty magazines and movies anymore, can we ladies? Eh? But I digress...) it's just not for me. I probably won't be reading any more books by this author.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I am happy to have it, but it doesn't take clear pictures.  But then again, I didn't buy my Kindle as a camera
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story is out of this world! It starts off a little slow but the main characters are interesting so no problem, just push on through the first 2 chapters and then you are hooked! I couldn't read the book fast enough, stayed up late on work nights just because I couldn't put it down! This was the first story I read by Gillian Flynn and I have to admit I am now a fan! I will be reading Sharp Objects in the next few weeks...can't wait to get started.
B009AP4MGE|5.0|Great transition from old cast to new cast. Music is entertaning as always! Story lines started slow but have built up. Don't give up on Glee!
0440246016|4.0|I have read almost all of these books and like them very much.  Good story line to keep your interest
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Great actors.  Good pace.  how much more BS does this review want me to write?  This is ridiculous!
B005KELR3A|5.0|I ordered one of these marked as &#34;used-good&#34; - for only $6 - $7 it is just perfect. It's great quality, feels good and durable and like it will protect the kindle quite well. it's soft, so it's not against bending, but will do for anything else, I also suspect its water repellent. the black one I have looks great. you can zip it from either side and the part that has the white pattern is some kind of soft rubber that will prevent it from slipping from your hand. great product, great price.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like having FaceBook near by so I can see what's happening and make goofy comments to my friends.  well done
0307454541|1.0|Lets write one long run on sentence with no literary skills that just keeps going without any punctuation nor page breaks or friggin paragraphs or plot...........what is the hype about?  SUCKED!
B0013FSL3E|1.0|This product arrived in horrible condition and I am very upset about the way it looked.  The box was crushed and I am not happy about it.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Well played.  Good movie for teens and older ages.  I would like to see sequels.  Maybe what happens when all of the surviving numbers get together.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Great actors.  Good pace.  Older generation on their way out. How much more BS does this review want me to write?
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Overall, reading Tim's book took extra concentration, because it did jump around a bit and felt kind of patchy in parts, but the sheer amount of fascinating and useful information that was contained within, made up for that. Tim's writing style is fun and engaging, so it certainly wasn't a slog, especially for such a colossal book! Recommended.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|\\"Paradise\\" is Del Rey's successor to the successful album \\"Born to Die\\" also released in 2012. \\"Paradise\\" is considered a mini-album, sometimes even as an EP. The playing time of over 33 minutes is more than what many classic albums of the 1960s from groups like The Byrds, The Kinks and The Beatles offered. In fact, only one single album released by the Beach Boys in the sixties surpasses \\"Paradise\\" in playing time. My point is, of course, that I in no way feel cheated because of the short running time of \\"Paradise\\".<br /><br />In fact, I think you could well claim that the eight songs come out as a very homogeneous release, whereas on \\"Born to Die\\" there were a few songs that seemed unnecessary and umimportant.<br /><br />\\"Paradise\\" also features a trio of stand-out numbers here. Especially the opening track \\"Ride\\", is a distinguished dramatic ballad that shows Del Rey from her very best side. \\"Cola\\" with its controversial lyrics is also an irresistibly catchy popsong. Del Rey's cover of the old Clover song \\"Blue Velvet\\" surpasses for me all previous versions of this song that I have heard. The song does not in any way fall out of place on the album, where the music otherwise written by Del Rey herself with help from various friends.
0374275637|5.0|It provides thought provoking ideas about the human brain and the process of thinking. It has made me revisit my thought process.
B00574PQDU|3.0|First half of the movie was good and kept the interest level high. But I was disappointed with the ending.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I have come to the conclusion that the books are much better than the movies.  But I didn't think that the books were that good.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Such a beautiful voice. My favorite is &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34;, though &#34;Turning Tables&#34; is also a great tune. Well, I really think the whole album is great...
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Its the same typical Plain Jane meets Handsome Man... can't understand why he loves her romance novel.  It's Twilight, Fifty Shades, without the steam.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|One of the best I've seen in forever.  Such a great view from a young person's perspective.  Acting and settings are wonderful.  A joy.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Connected to LG Nexus 4 & started mirroring whats on the mobile screen in Landscape mode.<br />Worked perfect with 720p HDTV<br />No software/hardware hassles..<br />Additionally, the USB cable can be used to charge the mobile for long duration use.<br />Works as intended
B004N868DS|5.0|Best pad I've ever had.  Very solidly put together.  The blue logo looks awesome, although I wish the control side had it as well.  It is huge and gives you plenty of space to sling your mouse around.  The rubber feet stop the pad from sliding around on your desk.<br /><br />Don't think I'll ever find a better pad.
160059672X|5.0|This book shows some of Serafini's best work. The pieces are elaborate and showcase her talent. Not everyone can actually create these beautiful pieces.  The instructions are for advanced beaders
B005LAJ16I|5.0|A very compelling story. The actors are all very powerful and each of them lives up to the words that were written for them.
8866131121|4.0|I have looked far and out for a tool to keep me on schedule. I have tried google calendar, remember the milk, and various other daily planners. Moleskine is probably the best among those. The quality of paper is great. It hold up to pencil and regular pen well. It does not leave impression on the other page like other cheap daily planners.<br /><br />The only negative thing I would say is that the elastic band does get little floppy after a year of use.<br /><br />I would buy the product again.
B000089QCA|5.0|What a wonderful example of friendship.  One of my favorite movies of all time. Just had a few friends watch it & they loved it too.
B003IDMUVI|3.0|This novel shows the life of a lawyer through some civil cases, mainly about the insurance business. Interesting but too focused over the lights and shades of this profession.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Was a pain to get phone in and out of case but it got better with time. Would recommend product
B009HV2JT8|4.0|The acting and the backgrounds were very good.  I watched it more than one time.  It had a good story line.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Lady GaGa. I feel like a rebellious teenager (which I'm far from) when I listen to her! From &#34;Electric Chapel&#34; to &#34;Marry The Night&#34;...hell, they're all good...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent and now I am finally interested in seeing the movie. Should read the next 2 books quickly this week.
B00A5052YE|5.0|AK is the real deal... burn baby burn! I really like this product you should too, so get it now!
B0035FQ1UU|4.0|This &#34;end of the world&#34; movie is big, visually stunning, and very entertaining.  However, you have to overlook the fact that hundreds of millions of people are being killed, often before our very eyes.  The science behind it is sheer nonsense so there is little concern about this movie becoming a documentary.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I like Steve jobs I really do,  iPhone is cool but what he did with Pixar and kept them afloat and which in turn gave us Toy story and forever we will have this and many more amazing movies.<br />An absolute gem of a book, very insightful & like an apple product very well done. It shows why Steve jobs did what he did & what helped him do those stuff. His philosophies, his brash attitudes, reality distortion field. Everything we heard about Steve has been discussed, more importantly light is shed on his personal life, esp the Macintosh days.<br />I would recommend this book to ppl who love Apple but esp to ppl who hate Apple, you don't need to buy something to admire it's beauty esp admire the genius who created it.<br />Watch his Stanford graduation speech before reading this book<br /><br />R.I.P Steve Paul Jobs<br />In your favorite words, you were truly \\"insanely great\\"<br /><br />Walter please do your next book on Sir Alex Ferguson
B005UG542S|3.0|I agree that it is difficult to get all of the action into one film.  I dn't think Radcliffe did his best in this movie.
B008ASLNN2|5.0|I have to say It was blasphemous that I didn't see part 1 sooner than late 2012 but I watched both 1 & 2 and it was an amazing movie. Can't wait for part 3.....
B007XHWROK|5.0|i love justin songs he's becoming a good singer most teenages like his singing album has good sound quity and lyrics
B009NPKTN6|2.0|While this does have some rockin' licks it just doesn't stack up against the original.  For whatever reason, big budget names never seem to have the power that a live production can deliver.  It'll do in a pinch, but go see it on stage, you'll thank me for it.
0738727326|3.0|It's smaller and less grand than I was imagining, the artwork feels cramped, I expected the art to be larger. Once I got used to it however, the deck grew on  me, but it's still not exactly what the pictures led me to believe.
034580404X|5.0|If you think that you already know the whole story thank to the reviews, you are wrong!<br />Most read the books... Excellent writing, story! You get addicted to this book until the end!
0440246008|4.0|I have read almost all of these books and like them very much.  Good story line to keep your interest.  Never thought I would like this series
B0063IH60K|4.0|I found this app to be exactly what I was looking for a quality solitaire  game.  The graphics are good, and the winning animation is fun.  There is little customizing of features but it is a free app.  The add at the beginning of the game is a little annoying but over all it is a solid app.
B009LRE040|5.0|NO SPOILERS HERE, SORRY:  I keep calling it Batman Rises, though THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is more fitting for obvious reasons.  Having watched five or six times in the past 48 hours; I see that my few, initial mental criticisms were ignorant of the subtle layering technique (so many small gifts Nolan leaves for viewers to collect, if they are patient) that leaves Nolan technically blameless of the Plot Condemnation - 'gimmicky.'  He is meticulous, so that once viewers have followed the RISES breadcrumbs as many times as I have, trails leading to the multiple conclusions are quite clear.<br /><br />ONE PROBLEM:  I watched it for the first time Dec 8, 2012, and love RISES more than is wise (as amazing, dark art).  However, Nolan made a terrible mistake with Bane, turning an amazing, AMAZING villain...into a bodyguard (robbed of his compelling origin story by the one plot twist I truly dreaded and found hard to swallow, besides).  Whether it is arguably legitimate and believable, it steals the dynamism of an incredible creation in Bane.<br /><br />Philosophically, the questions raised are worth answering, whether we agree with the conclusions of any given character; the big ideas stand alone.<br /><br />I love the soundtrack, too and will be glad to add RISES to my collection.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Hoping this would be another great thought challenging adventure from Scott along the lines of Blade Runner...but was really just an Alien re-run....the storyline and scenes were so similar... I thought I had rented the wrong movie...Don't get me wrong, Alien was a great film....but I have seen it already.  Could not even watch this entire film..
B005721W9O|5.0|Excellent spoof of our favorite 60's & 70's sci-fi series. The only thing missing is the stars from the past playing some lame network game show like Password or Pyramid.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|One of the apps that I like a lot. I usually listen to the FM while driving and sometimes there are songs which I like but I am not sure which album the song belongs to when I try to download the song after reaching home. But with this app I can easily find out the song and the details while I am driving and it becomes easy for me to download the song once I reach home.
0525478817|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It got to my place exactly when promised. It was my autographed copy, as promised. And it was the best book I had read in ages. Definitely worth every single penny and then some.
B008RTE09S|5.0|I last saw this film at the theatre years ago at a midnight show. Animal Crackers and Reefer Madness were also on, a triple feature! So...when I heard it was coming out on DVD, I was thrilled. The film itself was not a classic by any means, but the songs make up for everything. To see Paul doing &#34;The Fool On The Hill&#34;, John with the only clip of &#34;I Am The Walrus&#34;, the fun &#34;Your Mother Should Know&#34;,etc., makes this film worth having.
B008Y5QJ6M|5.0|This has got to be one for the best movies ever.  I have watched this movie over and over again.  Love it.
B0054TVW04|4.0|I liked this book, because it gives special and odd points of view about the rise and fall of nations and civilizations
B0034G4P1W|5.0|My nephew is obsessed with pirates and this movie was a perfect addition for his collection.  It is cute, funny and keeps him occupied and quiet!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Not sure what I would have done without this application. I am a hardcore facebook user and I am very happy with this app specially after the last upgrade where in we are allowed to share the posts. Also the way the photos can be viewed and after viewing the user can again go back to the news feed is awesome.
B007B6VOG0|2.0|I usually listen to all songs before making a purchase, however this time I didn't.  I read all the reviews and decided, what the heck, why not.  Well, the over use of auto-tune is why not.  He has such a great voice, he doesn't need to use the auto-tune.  And if he was trying to sound original, it didn't work out for him in my opinion.  It just doesn't fit with his music style.  Not in my humble opinion anyway.  Unfortunately, this album sits in my cloud player lonely and collecting dust.
0553386794|5.0|Can't put it down. I sleep, eat, dream, and BREATHE Game Of Thrones right now. Don't ever want to stop reading. I vote George R. R. Martin for president!
B0081X8AE6|5.0|Love this album. It's a total throwback to the jams I grew up with. And I cannot get enough of it. Try it out. I Won't Lie has the soul I've been missing for years.
B0086700CM|4.0|A very a addictive game. I have a hard time putting the game down especially late at night.  I would recommend this app.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is one of the smartest, funniest, and best written shows ever to grace my television screen! I am enjoying watching this series again. What is poignant is that many of the issues presented in The West Wing remain pertinent now. I would vote for Jed Barlett any day of the week!!!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|It is just like Yatzee.  You can play among your friends and pass the phone from one person to the other.
B000096IBI|5.0|I used this as part of World History course to highlight many concepts such as effects of technological change, social change, etc.<br /><br />An old classic video that students can appreciate.<br /><br />I used the disks at least 25 times and never had problems with quality of disks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I highly recommend the Hunger Games series to anyone looking for a good read.  They are hard books to put down!  Good for all age groups.
0765357151|5.0|The book and the movie share only a few details in common.  The most obvious shared attribute is the title.  The differences are almost staggering; Los Angeles/New York, Caucasian male/African-American male, blue collar/white collar, etc.  The story is roughly 160 pages long, although there are ten short stories that follow:<br />Buried Talents, The Near Departed, Prey, Witch War, Dance of the Dead, Dress of White Silk, Mad House, The Funeral, From Shadowed Places, and Person to Person.<br />If you are purchasing the book because you like the movie you may feel cheated that the movie is merely based on the book, rather than a direct cinematic interpretation.  The book is a great (and a quick) read, told by the perspective of Robert Neville, a man feared to be the sole survivor of the human race.  The beginning, however, seems to be drawn out and the word choice is less than sophisticated.  Thankfully, as the story progresses so does the word choice.  If you love stories based on the appeal of the last man, or on the decline of society, then this book would be to your liking.  Matheson also takes a new spin on vampire lore, which was one of the reasons this book appealed to me (the other being that it was a required text for a class).  Although better vampires stories exist, this book is worth the read for any vampire enthusiast and highly recommended.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|You need some coordination to play this game.  I don't have very much coordination, so I do get frustrated with this game.  But it seems to work very well, even if I cannot.  The graphics are bright and smooth.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|This product doesn't work on my device. It just does not work on my device. It doesn't work.  No work
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I saw the movie first and loved it so I thought I'd read the book. So much more detailed! Now that I've finished the book I really want to watch the movie again. One of the best books I've read!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This movie is a little violent, but good.  I especially liked the fact that this was based on a true story.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I would recommend this book to everyone.  It applies to all types of relationships, esp romantic.  I really think this book could save a lot of marriages.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i really like this game it exercises my brain  makes me think i wish there were more like this one
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the rest of the series, I have a feeling I will be glad I read the book before seeing the movie.
0061351342|5.0|A gorgeous book!!! Came at a perfect time for me. The story it's very spiritual and must be able to ready between the lines.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you play this game on Facebook then this is a wonderful app for you. And if you don't play it on facebook then you should try this app anyway. It's great graphics and smooth operation. Easy to find what you need to and the sound affects aren't bad either.. I LOVE THIS APP !!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Got two of these.  One for me and one for my boyfriend.  They are high quality whether you are using the cable or going wireless.  The headset is very comfortable around the ears and the top of the head.  Can wear it for hours and not get a headache or any pain.  The sound is high quality as is the microphone.  No complaints.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this series of books to anyone looking for a good read!  It was hard to put down!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|sorry but maybe because i'm not young but i'm just not good at it.i lose my bird even before i launch him.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Thought provoking and inspiring!!  Highly recommend.  Rejuvenates the Christian spirit as we all need at times.  Heaven is REAL!  Enjoy!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|as much as I'd like to rate this high and leave a nice comment I can't at this time. I've tried installing this on my kindle fire and for some reason it keep telling me it's already in my library...and it's not.... :(
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a great app. What fun and even my kids love this one. The puzzles are not all that hard to figure out if you just think about them or look around and the hints are nice when you want to cheat a bit.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|My boyfriend loved this as a gift.  He loves Star Wars and really enjoyed the animated series.  It does not feel like a cartoon.  The graphic quality is really good.  I recommend this to all Star Wars fans.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Simple alarm clock. Just what I needed and it hasn't failed me yet. Alarm sounds to choose from as well as sleep timer.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|This is by far my favorite book in the wallflower series.  The main male character does a lot of growing and I love seeing the female lead giving him a run for his heart.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I like this game, but hate when the cards are hidden because of the graphics blocking the numbers.<br />There is always a glitch of some sort and, it's pretty hard to get bingos, much less the collection items.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|It follows the book quite closely with a few little twists here and there to keep you on your toes.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Tiene de idioma español, no hay problema. Llega perfecto, y dentro del tiempo acordado, incluso antes. Nathan fillion looks awesome!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|EXTREMELY GRAPHIC AND DESCIPTIVE. MAKES THE READER FEEL AS IF THEY ARE THERE ON PELELIU. THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT THE MAKERS OF HOLLYWOOD MOVIES HAVE YET TO DUPLICATE AND THAT IS THE SMELL OF WAR AND DEATH IN THE TROPICAL HEAT
B0013K4MPU|4.0|I love listening to this album, now in my iPod. It has my absolute favorite songs ever by him and I would recommend this album to any Michael Jackson fan.
B000FBFML6|4.0|I loved this book. Now on to the next one. Cant wait to see what happens to the Fool and Nettle.
B000P0J09W|5.0|It's a classic. My kids loved this movie when they were young and it still is a fun movie for kids 20+ years later.
0802473156|5.0|Even if you and your spouse are fine, this book can help.  If you are engaged or thinking seriously about marriage to someone, USE THE BOOK.  It walks you through a series of exercises and thought provoking and conversation evoking pages.  Something I learned, the test is subject to interpretation. By this I mean I looked at the test to define what I always need where my fiance looked at it from the prospective of what she will need more of in the future because I was providing a number of the things already.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Loved the movie this summer and I wanted to have a copy to see it again. Movie is great fun with a lot of good musical performances.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Really lived up to all the hype. Book and the movie were great. Recommended reading for all.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Yes, I really liked this movie and I am glad I got it.  I have nothing negative to say about it and this is saying alot.  Another great addition to the my husband's Denzel Washington collection. Great story, great scenes and amazing actors, you'll love it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent book. Discussed emotionally difficult subjects very eloquently.  The characters had depth and complexity. I'm adult and would recommend this to both adults and teens.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|If you not seen the movie ....GO!  This is the greatest CD I now own.  I can't get enough of it!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|If you're usually underwhelmed by the cliche story lines that are typical of Hollywood hits, you can feel good knowing that I just saved 2 hours of your life by recommending that you skip this one.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Jimmy Stewart is attorney Biegler in this terrific courtroom drama. All of Biegler's thoughts and emotions play across his iconic face revealing a subtle, journeyman performance. Lee Remick is wonderful as a sexpot wife on the loose, and Ben Gazzara is scary as the accused, murderous husband. Enjoy Duke Ellington's brief appearance, and music underscoring the film creating a blue mood. Also notable is Joseph Welch as the patient judge best known in real life as the lawyer who brought down Joseph McCarthy during the Army/McCarthy hearings. If you can believe it the cast also includes George C Scott, Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden and Arden's real life husband West Brooks. Don't miss Kathryn Grant, Bing Crosby's second wife in a key role. Two hours will fly by!
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|This movie takes you back in time to the point that you believe you are watching a classic. It was wonderfully made and the story was captivating.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I am not a huge fan as many people were surprised I hadn't seen it yet. I watched it and liked it.  It starts out slow then then after the middle of the movie, it gets good.  It was different and I like it a lot for that other than that it was deal so I grabbed it.  My kids thought it was good enough to own.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I loved the Harry Potter series and I wanted to see what Casual Vacancy would be like. I had a terrible time getting into it. I didn't even finish and feel like it was a waste of money. Very disappointed.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I cannot stop playing this CD!  The movie was fabulous and the music is even better!  LOVE THIS MAN!!!!!  BUY IT!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I didn't know a lot about this movie going in but I am very glad we took the time watch it.  It was witty and cute, never boring, and was just an all around great film enjoyed by all ages of our family.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|9 year old grandson really liked this book as he has all the wimpy kids before this. That's about it.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Great movie. My kids love it! It provides lots of entertainment for them and its nice b/c both different ages but still both enjoy!
0452289963|4.0|I simply could not put this book down. It is a wonderful read and very interesting.  I love Eckhart Tolle books and this one is perfect for my collection.
1432794426|5.0|I was happy to see how beautifully Karen Moriarti understood who Michael really was. This book is about defending him and the way she speaks about him is just what I was for so long expecting someone to do. Made me cry. The reviews here are so self explanatory that I find myself with almost nothing else to say. Her book made me happy, very happy indeed. Her words are the words I would like to have said if I had dare write a book about this fantastic, mysterious, private,  brilliant,talented, unforgetable, unimitable,unbreakable,irresistible, charming, a dream in motion, fascinating, kind, childlike and shy but invincible juggernaut. A huge humanitarian who walked around this world full of poverty and misery, and as an ambassador of good-will made this same world a much better place with his presence, love  and help to children all over. Who can ever beat him in all that he accomplished? And Dr. Moriarty was able to bring all this for us to remember and enjoy Michael. Forget him? I don´t think so. Neither the millions of fans who love him, nor the ones who didn´t.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Good price and good fit for device.  It fits the kindle like a glove and I can easily access the screen and apps.
B00A72989U|5.0|Great Album! I own all of her music and look forward to her next release, this music is on FIRE!!!!
0446547573|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and this book was like his others;GREAT! I highly recommend it and buying used books is the way to go for me.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids love this cute movie! It is educational and sweet and made for children of all different ages. Thanks!
B002ZG99TK|3.0|I am a Denzel fan, no doubt, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  Almost all the movie is based on him inside the train which was kind of a bummer.  I know, that's what the movie is about and I don't hate it but it just didn't grab me.  There were some nicely done scenes where are tense but overall, it's an ok movie for me.  I got this on a lightning deal and it's for my husband, a Denzel movie collector, so it's good to have as part of it. Overall, I've seen way better Denzel Washington movies.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I really enjoyed the story.  The movie did not seem that long and most of the char. were well done.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is so much fun to watch the birds attack!! Have really enjoyed playing the game. Love to watch the levels crumble.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Excellent book series.  Characters are interesting and easy to love or hate.  Sad that so many have to die - guess that's like real life.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|The whole family loves this film.  Great music for a love story with a view of more simplistic times.  They don't make them like this anymore.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Do not make the mistake of reading the condensed version of this book<br />this one is definitely the best version
B005IQZB14|5.0|After reading about all the stress and strain Cheryl endured on the Pacific Crest Trail, I felt as though I had hiked the PCT myself.  It was such a realistic and detailed account, full of humor and well as profound sadness.  I loved this book and I recommend it to everyone especially those thinking about hiking the PCT. I can't believe that she survived her ordeal with an overweight backpack, little to no cash, and almost NO water or food at some points on the trail!
B005RUV0NY|5.0|great season. loving this show. I was hooked after the 1st episode. It just sucks you in and before you know it, you are a zombie junkie. =)
B004GEB9UQ|4.0|This is a great introduction to a very effective diet.  Explains things well and supported by good research.  Didn't like all the personal stories but they reinforce the effectiveness of the diet.
B005DESVPO|3.0|Great songs, but only a few on cd. Keep them coming Gary. Smooth voice. You &#34;ROCK&#34;, Mr. Clark. You have a new fan.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|The title is confusing -- Beethoven's Copyist would have been better.  Beethoven is trying to complete the 9th Symphony in time for the primere and he is desperate for a good copyist of the score is is continually revising even as it is in rehearsal.<br />To Beethoven's distain, he is sent a young woman.  As they learn to work with and appreciate each other, we see how  true genius functions.  Worth getting if only to see the sensuous  teamwork between Beethoven and his copyist while conducting the final movement of the 9th (the chorale).
B003KTMW9K|5.0|The story is compelling. The graphics are good. The mix between combat and other activities is perfect. I really love this game.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I love this movie. Comedy or not, I still would vote for it as the best zombie movie of all time. Worth owning, no question!
1451620829|4.0|Just a hunch, but 50% of Americans probably will admit they like Kiss ... and the other 50% are lying.  After 40 years, this band has covered just about every aspect of entertainment imaginable, so its reach is quite profound (globally).  I confess that I am a recovering Kiss fan who has thankfully been in remission since 1980.  Initially hooked on the \\"Alive II\\" album, I was an actual member of the Kiss Army in the 70s (still have the welcoming kit), saw them perform in 1979 (a friend of mine retrieved one of Peter Criss' drumsticks that night) and was one of 5 people who actually bought Gene Simmons' solo album.  While Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley are arguably the \\"faces\\" of Kiss, it was Peter Criss' song \\"Beth\\" that really put the spotlight on the band.  Always in the background, Criss never seemed to have a voice outside singing \\"Beth\\" and \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" ... until now.  In MAKEUP TO BREAKUP, the man spills his guts, whines about everything, cries an ocean and exposes the filth that hides under the band's painted faces.  The book offers a little bit of something for everyone:  violence, sex, greed, back-stabbing, front-stabbing, humor and heartbreak.<br /><br />While I've read a significant number of books that reveal the predictable depravity of rock and roll bands (including Led Zeppelin, Motley Crue and Guns n' Roses), none have matched the disgusting, deplorable world of Kiss, as described by Peter Criss ... Motley Crue's world is summer band camp by comparison.  But, while Peter Criss' significance is dictated by his experience as Kiss' \\"Catman\\", there is a whole lot more to the man's life and he has no problem telling us ... about everything.  I found his book to be an interesting read in more ways than one.  Criss comes across as a refreshingly honest individual with a somewhat fascinating life story.  Sure he has an axe to grind and seems to relish in revealing the dirt on his former band members, ex-wives and acquaintances ... it's a huge selling point.  Where MAKEUP TO BREAKUP differs from other tell-all books is that it deviates from the typical \\"they're bad and I'm good\\" mantra.  Criss openly admits he has been a seriously flawed individual throughout his life and while some may interpret this as making excuses, I find him accepting responsibility for most all of his actions and poor decisions.  While convincingly presenting Simmons, Stanley and Frehely to be total buffoons, he willingly confesses to being one as well.  In fact, Peter Criss is less God-like rock star and more \\"stupid human\\" by his own admission.<br /><br />The book's two running themes are music and women, with drugs and alcohol serving as the constant backdrop.  Criss details life being a young street tough in New York struggling to make it big as a musician.  Things really get interesting when he meets Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, the two-headed hydra that has been both a blessing and a bane most of his adult life.  Kiss fans may not appreciate the manner these two are portrayed throughout the book:  Simmons, a disgusting and despicable creep and Stanley, an insecure, effeminate joke.  Ace Frehely gets some love from Criss as a co-victim of the Simmons-Stanley hydra, but eventually throws him under the bus as a drug-addled \\"waistoid\\".  While Criss (somewhat annoyingly) portrays himself as a victim throughout his tenure in Kiss, seeing Gene Simmons as himself on television (\\"Celebrity Apprentice\\" and \\"Family Jewels\\") lends credibility to Criss' claims.  The hilarious and decadent stories about his days with Kiss are the best parts of the book ... some will likely make readers cringe.  He doesn't shy away from humiliating Simmons or Frehley by detailing their sexual proclivities ... readers may never look at those two the same again.  Not to be short-changed Stanley constantly gets the \\"he might be gay\\" treatment throughout; Criss even recalls one of the front-man's favorite activities was \\"shopping for fabrics.\\"  The on-and-off again sagawith his band-mates definitely gets old over time and comes across like episodes of \\"Dallas\\" (with Simmons being JR Ewing, of course).  But, we all get the idea that the band was never the unified group it appeared to be.<br /><br />The storyline of the women in Peter Criss' life is just as troublesome as his life with Kiss.  The man openly admits his insecurity and a need to be married always led him to relationships that were doomed to fail.  Drugs and alcohol issues exacerbate insecurities and incite destructive, violent reactions (such as firing a .38 at his television to \\"off\\" an actor his wife thought was attractive).  Readers get a heavy dose of drug-fueled one-nighters, details of his sex life with his wives and even an account or two of impotence.  While this is typical fare for rock star memoirs, I admit I felt a little embarrassed for Criss and his penchant for revealing so many personal details, but give him credit for having the guts to do so.  His introspective approach to his relationships and the numerous mistakes he's made all come across as some sort of healing process ... with the added entertainment benefit.<br /><br />Overall, MAKEUP TO BREAKUP is immersive and enjoyable ... an easy, entertaining read.  Typical sex, drugs and rock n' roll recipe with better ingredients.  I always felt Peter Criss was the unsung hero of the band, always overshadowed by the other three ... it is nice to hear his side of the story.  While I am sure the veracity of some stories will be challenged by his band-mates, they still seem genuine.  If there was one thing that prevented this book from being outstanding, it was the underlying whiny tone (especially the last several chapters) and his penchant of being victimized in almost every facet of his life (even his bout with breast cancer is a little too sappy).  So vulnerable and weak at times, I don't think there is a single chapter in the book where he doesn't admit crying his eyes out at some point.  But, in the end the storytelling won me over.  I guess it is time to dust off the \\"Alive\\" and \\"Alive II\\" albums again.with his band-mates definitely gets old over time and comes across like episodes of \\"Dallas\\" (with Simmons being JR Ewing, of course).

B004WGIXX4|3.0|Entertaining if you have time to kill, but completely predictable. It wasn't a horrible movie, and the characters were at least likable- though Natalie Portman's character was less so. Wouldn't watch this movie again, and wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it, unless you really like the romantic comedy genre and don't even mind sitting through the latest Katherine Heigl or Gerard Butler dud.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Just received this cd and really like it. Gary has a very smooth voice and unique sound. Kinda reminds me of the 60's
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Great movie, not for kids. Would watch again and again and again and again and again and again and again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Would be 5 stars since I love this game but I cannot play it when I'm on the phone or have no internet connection
0756666937|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew, who is getting very into Lego sets, collecting them, learning about them, etc. This book is perfect for that. It's not only very detailed, but there are tons of pictures of the items and the book is a very good size for the price it was sold at- quite a steal! I'm very happy with this book, and my nephew is sure to love it!
B009K0OL06|5.0|Can't wait for it to return after its holiday hiatus. I can't get enough of Revenge. Get on it ppl!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is fun.  It takes a long time to gain any points/coins. My daughter and I both enjoy playing the side games too. Glad it was free too.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|It's pretty good. Slow and great vocals, as you'd expect from these guys. Fun songs. &#34;It's cold outside&#34; is done with genders switched, which is nice. Good listening!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|We enjoyed this movie. Would watch it again would not let 16 or younger watch.  Funny good for a date night
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|These guys will blues-rock your soul off. There's no trouble here, just bad-assery galore. Get ready to dance and groove.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I enjoyed this novel but I was somewhat disappointed in the ending. I will definitely purchase another Vince Flynn novel.
B0014H32MG|4.0|Don't start this book if you want to do anything for a couple of hours.  It is extremely fast paced and dark.  For King, it's a little more future-tech scary than it is mystical, and I liked that about it.  Super gory, not to be read before bedtime (what Stephen King book is, unless you like nightmares??).
B004UPANAI|5.0|Fast delivery and at a Great price. Bluray definetly better than DVD in color vividness and sound quality. Completes my collection of x-Men
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It's an improvement over the first two, at least there is some normal scenes in it.  A pretty perverted trilogy if you ask me.
0525958002|5.0|I had to have this as any Duranie should. I'm reading it now and am totally enthralled with the story. A must read for any Duranie!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great,no bells or whistles just good. Gives you time scales on how long it'll work doing whatever your doing.
B004VD3YIM|1.0|This was a great app, but recent updates have made it constantly blank out the screen, its useless if you have a galaxy s3, and most bothersome is I tried to contact the help/developer 4 times, and no responces, two weeks later
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This app is just like having a complete Microsoft Office Suite. Its better than any other app of its type.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|it's ok if you want to take pictures of yourself .... but to take pics of things in front of you is VERY awkward at best.  The ipad camera is so much better.  Too bad as I love everything else about my kindle.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I only read it because I was told it wasn't as perverted as the first book.  Well it was slightly better but that;s not saying much.  The first was disgusting!!!!!
B007XNAQPG|5.0|I am a Duranie at heart and I couldn't be more pleased. Saw the show live in the US and was amazing to relive!!!DD Forever!!
B0031N2NFS|5.0|This is simply an amazing album.  I decided to purchase it after hearing their song Acts of Man and was not disappointed.  Every song on this album is one you will want to listen to over and over again.  if you have never heard of Midlake before do not hesitate, you will love this band!
B006TJXZ30|4.0|I love the app, the only issue is not being able to customize a lot of your settings.. can't complain though!
0547569653|5.0|This was the most useful book - food recipes  - running barefoot info and just a good all around read.

B001HM1PFO|5.0|still awesome of course, looks great in bluray and  is packaged in a hardcover mini-book, which is a nice touch.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you like all the previous seasons, you'll love this one.  I watched almost all of the seasons all at once!  Love the cast and the writers are genius!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The good thing about this game is that it does not have any bugs or glitches. The levels are challenging but doable, and I like that you can skip levels if you are stuck on one. The only thing that i do not like is that you only get 3 hints. I wish that you could get more hints instead of having to buy them. Here's a warning, use your hints wisely if you are not planning to buy any more than the three they give you.All in all, it's a pretty good game though. I would have given it 5 stars if there were more hint.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|I was so looking forward to owning this movie on Blu-ray so I could show my favorite Christmas movie to my children. Thankfully I read the reviews before I bought this. I am very disappointed that the song\\"When Love is Gone\\" is not included. I will not be buying this DVD, as I still have a very tired version of my VHS tape with the movie in its entirety.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The stankin' game keeps saying that I need to keep downloading stuff. It's s really annoying. I love everything else about it though. Other than that I absolutely love this game! Opps I said almost the same exact sentence! ;)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|best alarm app in the market place. I would reccomend to everyone. I love that you can add as many alarms as you want!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Many adventure game are just random hidden object screens with a forced plot that doesn't hold together.  This is the best game I've played since &quot;Lost City&quot; with an interesting plot, great graphics and an adventure that hold together.  A bit easy is my only issue but with the hint key you're unlikely to get stuck.  Well worth a couple of bucks for 6-8 hrs of play.
B008NW67E0|5.0|If you liked the first album, you're gonna love this album.  It's fantastic!  I can't stop listening to it.  It's on repeat in my car, on my ipod, everywhere!

B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Interesting twist on angry birds. Downloaded it for my son to play and he hasn't even got to play it yet because I played it first.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time.It's good to see a great movie with morals like this,to be made and apeal not only to just Christians...but also to non-Christians,to plant a seed in their hearts after watching this inspiring movie.There needs to be more Christian-based films like this to made,to combat all of the un-Godly trash that liberal Hollywood produces,that corrupts the minds of people.Overall,I highly recommend this film.
B000I3UMKM|2.0|I've wanted to see this movie for years, but was very disappointed.  It was not at all what I had expected, somehow.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I like this album a lot.  A very relaxing Christmas album.  Thie songs with other artists are very nice.  Enjoyable.
1933633867|4.0|I found &#34;Debt: The First 5,000 Years&#34; insightful and that the historical material of &#34;Debt: The First 5,000 Years&#34; was substantiated by some additional historical reading I was doing as research in another area of study. Also, the book provided substantiation of my own thinking in regards to societal structure and looming effect of debt.  So, I found it
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it! Pretty cute so far!! I wish it was so expensive to play through! But I guess they have to earn money so how.
B009PEKRY6|3.0|Cute, but more sugary sweet than I care for. I would say its a sure fire hit for a teenage girl.!!

B000VYX8PE|5.0|Book review for the bad beggining<br /><br />Phoebe's review<br />At the beggining they say it's not a happy ending. Characters klaus,sunny,<br />Violet,mr.poe, justice Strauss. My question is why do they have nice nice names but bad things happen to them? I like lemony snicket because he shows not tells. I would give this book a five star because of good dialogue, action and inner thinking. Count olaf is a bad person and he is evil.<br /><br />Emma's review<br />The series of unfortunate events.Book 1<br />I give this book a 5 star because,this book is surprisingly the best book I had ever read.It really captures my attention right away,and it will probobly catch your attention to.I recamend this book to people who don't need to hear happy story's because this story isn't very happy.I felt like I was in the book with the three Baudelaires.a lot of people like this series, I love this book.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|Great special effects<br />Great plot<br />Very good acting<br /><br />and then - this movie goes off the tracks in a manner I have never seen before. I will not spoil it and I should say I still watch it every once in a while until it pretty much becomes a &#34;Halloween&#34; type movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show.  I can hardly wait for the next episode. First time using this service, because I do not own cable.  Would recommend to others.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|His Dark Materials is an epic fantasy trilogy that is right up there with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings in terms of detail and scope.  Philip Pullman has created a world, or rather, many worlds that contain a vast array of characters both good and bad.  The novel is listed under \\"Juvenile Fiction\\" at my local library, but some of the content, especially in the third novel, gets into some pretty dark stuff and is interesting and suitable for both teenagers and adults.<br /><br />Lyra, an orphan girl, finds herself in the midst of a war between good and evil in which she plays a crucial role.  She is armed with a truth-telling device that leads her on a journey across many worlds.  The book borrows ideas from popular topics in physics, namely, the belief that multiple universes exist in different dimensions that are inaccessible to us.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />* The world that the characters live in is intricately detailed<br />* Even the most fantastical aspects of the story are rooted in truth<br />* The story unfolds slowly so you aren't overwhelmed<br />* Each chapter ends with a twist that makes you want to continue reading<br />* The lines between good and evil aren't always clearly drawn, giving the story an element of truth<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />* Sometimes the story unfolds a little too slowly<br />* The physical version of the trilogy is big and sometimes hard to handle - ie - holding it in your hands while reading for long periods of time becomes tiring - if you have a Kindle, go for the digital version for a more manageable format
B007HACDLK|4.0|I am a Vince Flynn fan and would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a Vince Flynn fan.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|its easy to use. quick and percise. i recommend everyone to download and enjoy learning, remembering and teaching!!! i love it! it's definately a must have!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|If you are looking for an affordable processor that can handle all but the most extreme of tasks, this is great.  There are newer, more powerful processors out there, but the vast majority of users are not going to make use of the extra performance, so why pay extra for it?  This chip has no problems handing modern (as of 2012) games on maxed settings.  And at this price, you are going to be hard pressed to get this much bang for your buck.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have never written a review for a book purchased from Amazon before, but this book is exceptional.  It is a book that makes you think about how you are using your “time” between the dates on your tombstone.  Albom using the main character, Dor, takes you on a not quite imaginary trip through the development of time and how humans use it.  It forces you to think about how you are “spending “your allotted time on earth.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|It's not that I expected a \\"nice\\" novel from this generous author, but I didn't expect to feel quite so bad. When I think back on Mcewan novels I especially liked, SATURDAY and AMSTERDAM, I see that they were not satisfying in a conventional way, but they did make me feel as if I had gained insights to recognizable emotional states. This one gave me strangers that I don't wish to know.<br /><br />SWEET TOOTH comes with a sales advantage: it appears to promise us a better sense of what goes on behind closed doors in a secretive organization. In fact it gives us much more to chew on concerning what goes on behind the closed doors outside the MI5 offices. In understandably secretive minds. Poisoned minds. Turned in on themselves. Thus, the disadvantage attached to the novel is the first person point of view and a voice which begins to grate, even though she has a tantalizing story to unveil, piece by piece.<br /><br />Maybe I hold too much love in my heart for England and prefer not to know -- or at least to care -- about these dull folks who can't carry on a normal conversation. Mcewan laves the impression that higher education and employment in service to the government automatically lead one to a life of meaningless, ineffective drudgery, deceit, and detachment.
B003498SDA|5.0|This movie is great!  It being one of my husband's favorites movies, I bought it for him as a Christmas present.  Shipping was so fast, I decided not to wait & I gave it to him early.  He was so excited - we watched it that same night. We have watched it several times since too.  Excellent movie!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I got this game for my 4  year old but because of all the reading I sat and helped her, these are my observations.<br /><br />1) There is way too much reading for the age this game is designed for.<br /><br />2) Maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine but why does this game want to post to your Facebook? My daughter doesn't even have a Facebook and I imagine most small children who this game is for wouldn't have one.<br /><br />3) The worst complaint is this game uses &quot;bling&quot; to purchase pets, houses, etc. It also uses it to speed up the game, like get a new pet but you don't want to wait 2 minutes to see your new pet spend your bling for instant access. You only start out with 10 &quot;bling&quot; but guess what you can buy more with real money. Lame. To be fair the game also uses coins which you can earn but some pets, houses, etc can only be bought with bling.<br /><br />My recommendation if you download this game for your young child make sure you have parental controls on so they won't spend your money and also be prepared to sit with them and read for them. I personally am deleting it off my Kindle.
B009VB97EY|2.0|We heard this was good, but the acting is bad and so is the plot. Don't bother watching this one.

0007466064|3.0|This novel is not the same quality as the previous books. It does not have the action and does not move thru the characters with the pace of the previous books. It far to worky, but I had to read it to find it out. Good read to those who decide to read thru it.
B000VS20M2|5.0|Was never a huge fan of this movie, I thought it was kind of slow, but with the blu-ray version, its so much better looking and sounding, just gorgeous to look at, much more enjoyable now.<br /><br />P.S. I got one of the foreign versions (really wanted the Dirtectors cut) and it worked fine on two different brands of Blu-Ray players.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought this book was a little hard to understand at first but as I went along, I found I couldn't put it down.  This is the amazing tale of a young boy who is headed to Canada with his family and animals from their zoo.  The cargo ship they are on sinks and Pi is the only one to survive (besides some of the animals).  It is the story of endurance and overcoming odds.  A must read.

B0061JPT46|1.0|Yes, it looks fantastic. Kudos to the Russian counterfeit art department. But, this is a bootleg, plain and simple, made up to look like a legitimate Japanese import. Some of the tracks were transferred from noisy vinyl. The \\"bonus tracks\\" are common and available, in better quality, elsewhere. It's interesting that at one time, Soviet Beatle fans would do anything to get the music, even press the tracks onto exposed X-rays. But, now that the Iron Curtain is no more, Russian bootleggers are flooding the market with substandard product. Why is Amazon even selling this crap? Leave that to eBay.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Finally I did a purchased on DVDs, Before I buy it. I've remember to seen a TV Show ever long time a years unitl they're finales show. I'd enjoyed watches them on DVDs for almost everyday. I love it so much. Thanks. :)
B002SSUQFG|1.0|Really like the design of this watch but for some reasons it didn't work, not even a slight moment from any hand!  Have to return it and it was really a disappointed experience.  But to be fair with this watch, I will try to get another one with a different seller just to see if it work.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|How I rank it, it's better than Batman Begins  but not as amazing as The Dark Knight (but close). However, this is the best ending to a trilogy I think I have ever witnessed in my entire life. What a wonderful movie this is, I saw it 5 times and counting. I will admit I was iffy on how i felt the first time I saw it but after more views I grew to appreciate it. While it doesn't have the perfection that the flawless Dark Knight has, it still suffices and is one of the most powerful films I think I have seen recently. It has such a great ending, very emotional.<br /><br />I am going to make this review short because I do not want to tell too much, it's a movie that I would never forgive myself if I provided any spoilers. First off, the movie does begin 8 years after the Dark Knight, Batman has been a fugitive and therefore missing. Bruce Wayne is beaten up and can barely walk because of all the beatings he took as Batman. He then learns of a man named Bane who is plotting to terrorize Gotham, one of the things that pushes him to put on the Batsuit again. In the film it's about him rising from his fall. I am not giving anymore details on the plot because again, I am not giving you, the reader any spoilers. I can't do it, it's simply the movie that needs to be witnessed and experienced. The movie is intense, Bane is a frightening villain, probably the scariest villain I have seen on the screen. He gave me chills throughout, he unlike, the Joker has an agenda and it's a sinister one.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever read the comics would catch that it's a lot like the story, \\"Knightfall\\" and \\"No Man's Land\\" which are two stories that must be read by the way. The movie is loaded with amazing performances, I did mention Bane, Tom Hardy who gives a great, eerie performance. Anne Hathaway is another who stood out. Many whined before seeing it that she wasn't fit for Catwoman, funny, Anne looks like Salina Kyle and acts like her too. Anyone who criticizes her is simply wrong and should probably read a comic for a change. She had that role down to a T. She was sexy and mysterious like she should be. Another great performance that stood out is Michael Caine as Alfred. He was always good, however, he had to give his all in this role it was a performance that really stuck out. These are just a few examples that I can give out.<br /><br />This movie is a prime example on why I hold Christopher Nolan on a pedestal. He can take a big idea and make it practical he doesn't need to go heavy on the CGI to make his films look visually amazing. He proved it many times with Inception, the flawless Dark Knight and Batman Begins. He is without question the greatest filmmaker in this new generation of filmmakers, he and Darren Aronofsky can do no wrong at this point. Nolan is the filmmaker that I hope to be one day. I hope to be able to do what he does. I have seen every Christopher Nolan movie now, he has made nothing but great movies, it's almost as if he's never seen a bad movie nor knows how to make one. All his movies have perfection all over them it's insane how good he is. He's made enough to prove himself if you ask me.<br /><br />I have sang too much praise for The Dark Knight Rises, I will admit the movie does have some flaws here and there, one of them is I felt they needed to develop the character Catwoman a little more and serve her more of a purpose. That's just one, there are some plot holes in it but they're mild plot holes and I will admit there were times I could not understand what the characters were saying. Bane and Jim Gordon were two that I had a difficult time making out what they were saying that needed some work. It was a problem I had with them but it did not stop me from loving the movie. I can go on and on.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has made the perfect trilogy. The best I have seen since the original Star Wars trilogy. He has proved himself yet again that he is here to stay and is one of the best there is at this time, I love his Batman movies but also his other movies. I can't wait to see what else he has in line for us to watch. I look forward to seeing more works from him and I look forward to seeing The Dark Knight Rises yet again. It gets an A+ove his Batman movies but also his other movies. I can't wait to see what else he has in line for us to watch. I look forward to seeing more works from him and I look forward to seeing The Dark Knight Rises yet again. It gets an A+

Thanks :)
0425264351|4.0|While reading Killing Floor I started to worry that the slow pace of plot development would lead to a very disappointing and rapid conclusion. This was not the case, the story came to a satisfactory conclusion and not one that seemed like a convenient wrap up for the author. However, to me the story never got so exciting that while I wanted to put the book down for a breather, I had to keep reading. It was enjoyable to read with  just enough detail to get your imagination going but not so much that reading is tedious. Also, it keeps you guessing about the plot. At one point I thought I had it all figured out but then a few twists came up. But, it was a touch anticlimactic (my thoughts on this are below with spoiler alert). That being said, it was good enough that I am looking forward to reading the next in the series.<br /><br />**Could be considered spoiler**<br />The reason it was anticlimactic for me was that Reacher is such a hero, the group was never in any real danger of losing. Reacher's sidekicks were helpful, but never critical. Key people disappear, but Reacher was so clever it wasn't an issue. This was my impression upon finishing the book.
0316228532|1.0|I'm certainly not an accomplished literature critic, but I definitely did not like this book. I could discern no plot other than a multitude of dysfunctional characters and their interactions. I, like others, did not see any humor in the 30% of the book I muddled through. If I knew that many dark and troubled people in my life, I would get a new life! It may be shallow of me, but I read to be entertained and not bombarded by the foul language and cruelty that is abundant in this book. I very rarely give up on a book, but I did give up on this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this book really ties everything up and leaves you with no questions i wish that we would could read about christians side thoug
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great this game makes you really think how to place things it needs more ways to earn invest points cause you cant do anything without them
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app. I can listen to music and talk radio from around the world. I have recommended this app to many friends.
B005LAII08|5.0|Pixar and Disney never cease to amaze me with their artistry, enchantment, and the way they see things outside the box.  This too will be a timeless classic with all  the other Pixar/Disney Films.  This was the perfect Mother/Daughter film of a young lady who wants to be her own person, not what her mother wanted her to be. We all want our children to be educated, smart, good, etc., but if they want to be an archer or whatever, let them be.  Excellent movie.  I recommend it to everyone.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez story is amazing. I love his style and his thoughts. What a find. So glad I saw the movie
B007IXWKUK|5.0|book was well written and a good read i liked this one better than the first one for sure but it really takes you on a journey

B009PU2KIQ|5.0|Gary is truly an amazing artist.  I first heard of him on NPR in an interview after hearing a sample of his work I looked him up online and instantly bought his album.  He's so good I ran to the mountain tops to spred the word that finally an original amazing talent has arrived!
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|I have a new respect for Tommy Lee Jones and his chemistry with Meryl Streep was seamless.  A new type of movie.

B006OE7XM4|5.0|It's been a very, very long time since I bought a CD and LOVED every single cut. Actually, I immediately loved each cut as I listened to the snippets on Amazon, and decided that I had to own the entire CD. Gregory Porter's voice is like butter, and he croons and teases the lyrics with the utmost ease. The consummate jazz man, he knows how to work a song, and he worked his magic from start to finish, here. His voice is smoky, yet familiar, as if he was born singing. I am reminded of Sammy Davis Jr. when I hear Gregory's voice. The accompanying musicians were outstanding too. What you get are songs and complex rhythms that stay on your mind. I am frothing at the bit to see this gentleman in a live performance. If you love great jazz, your money will be well-spent on the \\"Be Good\\" CD. I would give \\"Be Good\\" a 10-star rating if I could. You will not be disappointed.
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe I let myself be suckered into buying this trilogy.  We were leaving on vacation and I wanted to download a series to keep me entertained reading on the beach.  I'd read some of the reviews, but thought it couldn't possibly be THAT bad, right?  Wrong.  I think this book has scarred me forever as far as trusting my instincts.  Other reviews list in detail the reasons this trilogy is horrific, so I won't do it here.  But I will say this - not once did I care about the characters or feel vested in them whatsoever - and that's after reading all 3 of these nightmares.  At a certain point, I was hoping for at least some good sex scenes since I obviously wasn't going to get any plot!  But, I was denied there as well.  The sex scenes were plain old boring.  The story was just a repetitious plot line over and over.  POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!  The H does something \\"bad\\", Christian gets mad and punishes her, H gets scared and/or mad then they make up.  Repeat about 50 times and you have your entire trilogy.  The writing is sub-par like many others have said.  I REALLY wish I would've listened to the reviews.  If I have one bit of advice it's this - don't make the same mistake I did.  If you must read it, borrow it, do not buy it.  Run fast, run far and save yourself from the torture that is Fifty Shades of Grey.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Tried many different pens for ipad in the past. This is definitely the best. Solid grip, precise. Very good value for money.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|All I can say is that its about time they came out with this collection on blu ray. If you're all about action adventure films then this is the one for you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A must see!  Went straight to my kindle upon viewing the last episode, hoping<br />that season 3 had already played in England and I could purchase it early!  Can;t<br />wait!  I was late to the game, my daughter repeatedly telling me to watch.  I watched<br />two to three episodes a night on my kindle; that's how good it is.
B009X01C64|4.0|This neat holder for the kindle fire is light compact and keeps my kindle fire very well protected.  It opens up like a book stand but it also has the ability to be rotated 90 degrees so you can view the screen in landscape and portrait.  Just be careful when rotating it since it only moves in one direction.  Plus because it is designed to be light weight the internal area is slightly floppy or unstable.  The kindle sometimes falls down since it is only held in place/upright by an opening or slot and does not `lock' into place.<br />Nifty little holder and stand!
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Gift for nephew.  I'm sure he will enjoy it!  He loves star wars  so this should make him happy!  Its hopefully not one he has.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very good weather app for the android platform. I have BeWeather Pro also and I think the AccuWeather app is slightly better.
B008VVT51U|5.0|quality movie , quality viewing on kindle - was pleased with all of the aspects of this purchase.  enjoy if you purchase the same!
B001E75QH0|5.0|I have an HTPC so it ups the resolution of anything to near blue ray quality.  The nice thing is these can also go on the road with the DVD in the SUV.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|Continuing the reboot, I really enjoy the more action style of the new Bond. This one felt a bit darker, as bond felt like he was a lot more out of control but I really enjoyed the story telling and the action scenes.
1401323820|5.0|The book is in perfect shape. The item is exactly as described. I can certainly give it as a Christmas gift. Thank you!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app gives me all the info I need and looks great doing it.  I have not had any problems whatsoever.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I just installed it, haven't had a lot of time to play.  Have to wait until after Christmas (it's a Christmas present).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love using my Bible app for daily devotions and to search for particular verses.  I also use it at church sometimes instead of my regular Bible and to read along at live services.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Very fast service!  I can't wait to watch this movie. I haven't seen it yet because I bought it as a Christmas present for my grandchildren.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a great app. I used it to make my family Christmas card and it came out perfectly. Sometimes, though, it gets a little quirky and the sticker tool doesn't work, but eventually it works. I highly recommend this app.
B004KKX814|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my nephew. Hopefully he doesn't need to read anything on the box since it is all in JAPANESE. Beware.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I just installed it, haven't had a lot of time to play.  Have to wait until after Christmas (it's a Christmas present).
B0034DGPEU|5.0|An excellent bittersweet story about an indentured Irish servant girl.  Characters were interesting and realistic.  This would make a good book club read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome 5 star person here I love this game so much I wish for two things only 1 for a new update and 2 I wish it was a bit cheaper
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Awesome album! It is just spectacular! I love to hear it when I am studying or relaxing. And I got it for a great price too! Thanks Flo and Amazon!
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles this one is great.  Instead of all the pieces on the board you pull out what you want to use as you need them and they lock in place if they fit.  Love it, highly recommend it.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|I found the story crowded with one dimensional characters that were hard to keep track of.  The theme was the music world of the 60's and on?  Not a lot of real information but rather a fantasy trip.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is fun and addicting it also brings the creativity in you check out my resturaunt maris grill 2 or add pumkin4pie2
B007HACDLK|5.0|I couldn't put it down, one page let to another and then to the next chapter.  I found myself trying to find a place to stop for the night and ended up reading until the alarm went off.
0385532458|5.0|good i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i thanks  for the price too
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history as presented by a host of characters that give life to the historical facts.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I was very excited to see the package laying on my doorstep the other day. This is my favorite movie of all time. It even beats Dirty Dancing! lol
B00992CF6W|5.0|Your game is being copied and they think they can get away with it. Here are all the game makers who are copying you: Jessica, Candy Rufus, and, worst of all, Vicky.
0345529057|5.0|arrived in great condition.  A must own for any true  Game of Thrones fan.  A great gift for the holidays
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|idk about you, but a director's cut dvd, a regular dvd, the blue-ray disc with both the original and director's cut, plus a digital copy for less than 10 dollars is a deal. This is a most have movie, and why not have all of it in many formats. A digital download would be too much to ask for but it would be even better lol
B006FE83U4|5.0|The remastering on this Blue Ray is fantastic! I'd recommend this for everyone who likes old movies! This was a present for my wife who collects old movies and she was tickled.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great following of the first book.<br />I couldn't wait to finish it to be able to start the third book.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Learned a lot about many presidents that I never expected.  Great research and well written.  Particularlly on Hoover, Truman and Eisenhower.  Who would have expected Eisenhower to be so obnoxious.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put the book down, once I started I just kept reading. Took it to work just because I couldn't get enough.
1451648537|3.0|I was very excited to get this book last year and my wife gave it to me for Christmas.  I was very interested in reading the section about Jobs working at Atari, and having Wozniak build the prototype Breakout game that Jobs submitted as his own.<br /><br />I was quite disappointed at Isaacson's lack of real detail on Jobs position, interaction and overall time at Atari, he actually had quite a bit wrong as well on things, so while I enjoyed reading the book, I am skeptical as to how much is actually correct and factual in the book as a whole.<br /><br />Finally a book fully detailing Steve Jobs time at Atari, along with direct input from Wozniak just came out on Amazon called Atari Inc Business is Fun and this has far more personal stories and insight into the person Steve Jobs truly was during his first job work at Atari, it even goes into detail the meeting where he brought the Apple Computer into Atari trying to get them to become an exclusive seller of it for $50,000 and another interesting story on how Jobs was stealing Atari engineers left and right and Atari's response was to threaten to build Apple ][ clones if Jobs didn't stop immediately.  There is a better perspective of Jobs in the Atari book than in Isaacson's.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thought the end of the story lacked the force of the first two books, as it usually happens.  On the other hand, the author needs to finish the story, one way or the other.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Absorbing story, beautifully written. It's one of those books that makes you get excited when you pick up your Kindle because you can't wait to see what happens next.  Loved the story, loved the characters and the magnificent journey back in time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have not read any books in such a long time, that it felt good to get into a real book again. The only thing bad about this book is that it ends. I hope we find out what happens next.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It's a long read, but not long enough. Once again just really really good stuff. I have no qualms for spending my money on this one and believe I received good value.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|There is no better Batman, yet, than the 1989 Tim Burton version with Michael Keaton. Yes, many objected to Keaton as being used for the Dark Knight role, but he plays it perfectly. He really looks like a believable Bruce Wayne. This 2 set DVD is great for any Batman fan. I love all the extras that are included in the 2nd DVD. It took me about 3 hours to watch them all. My only regret is that there isn't any more behind the scenes info.
0698115635|5.0|I read and sang this book when I owned a Montessori School in Florida.  Bought  it now for my two grand children and we sing it when ever we are together.
B008N1V11U|2.0|I have really liked the game, it is clearly a great game, but it needs a lot of fixing. The game lags sometimes. The graphics aren't as good as in the pictures, there are some constant glitches like roofs disappearing, black areas where something should be, the vehicle controls appearing on top of the normal controls when one uses and stops using a vehicle (making it impossible to move), semi-constant crashes, and the one the bugs me the most is the fact that in my game all the trees in the second island are completely pink, unrealistic, and plastic looking. Also  I hate how the fight with bane is so monotonous , repetitive, anticlimactic, and very boring, with a very pixeled non interactive character as the enemy. Lastly, the characters need better graphics and interactivity, as well as better movement in the cut scenes.<br />Oh, another thing. Please add the possibility of ussing vehicles in freeroaming after finishing the story mode. Add the ability to use all the gadgets after story mode in free roaming, and add a system to generate random free roaming missions.<br />PLEASE UPDATE TO FIX THE MENTIONED ISSUES AND GIVE CUSTOMERS A BETTER GAMING EXPERIENCE.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I liked the movie but I paid for HD quality and got worst than SD I could see the pixels and it was terrible at least it streamed the whole way through but it sure wasn't in HD quality someone just recommended I try Vudu and I did and their stream is really good compared to amazon. So if you going to get this dont go to Vudu or just get the SD version since the extra buck wont get you HD. This was on a cable internet that is 50 MB/s.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|George Clooney is a great actor and this movie shows his talent. It's a shame that he has to hang out with no talent hacks like Brad Pitt.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read every DeMille book and think that they keep getting better. Wonderful dialogue, timely topic and terrific character development. My father and I read it at the same time and both thought we could have read another couple hundred pages.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Better than the movie that I saw before reading the book. Much more detailed and explains a lot that was left out on the movie. Looking forward to reading the next book.
B009NPA3MS|3.0|This is just ok for me. My wife loves it,but I'm not thrilled. I suppose it all depends on your own style of music.
0743270754|4.0|Gives you the flavor and the sense of the people in their time.  Very scholarly work that is well written to be enjoyable to the reader.  You get a sense of exactly how smart a man Lincoln was on so many levels.  Everyone interested in leadership and history should read this book.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic Christmas flick that still provides lots of laughter after all these years.  Christmas wouldn't be complete without watching it, so I went ahead and bought my own DVD.  I'm sure glad I did.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  Bad guys turns guy ... nothing has come along as good as this since Shrek.  Yes, Despicable Me is close but this one's humor is more grown up.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|The music is both new and classic.... beatlesque, psychelia, new wave, indie and classic rock all in one package.  Cannot stop listening to this stuff!
0316069434|5.0|As always Connelly writes stories that respect the reader.  He gives you all the information needed to solve the case before he gives the answer.  Very engaging story.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Every sane man wants to be in Castle's shoes. Niki heats is hotter than hot, oooooooooooooweeeeeeeeeee! The story lines are fantastic and the whole crew has chemistry.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book surpassed any expectations I had about it. I fell in love with all the characters and just when I thought the story was going to go a certain way, it went the opposite direction. It was beautiful, terrorizing, and couragious all in one. I would recommend this trilogy to anyone wanting a reality check. It really gets you to thinking about things that never really occured to me before.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Good movie.  Fantastic cast. Enjoyed every moment.  Each character's story is engaging and told in an understated manner.  I found it very refreshing.
0316069434|4.0|Michael Connelly has done it again-written expertly on the life of a burdened detective.  Harry Bosch is always at odds whether or not he's doing good or bad.  In the end, he always does the job.  As his character says, \\"everyone counts, or no one counts\\".  Brillant.
B009HEJEF2|3.0|This move really felt like a bridge or a link kinda movie. What I mean is that it seems like it was just kind of a filler to get the audience from the movie prior to this to the movie following this. The movie after this one 'Retribution' was phenomenal.  Anyway nontheless it was entertaining.
B002PLALCO|5.0|Fifty years from now Pink is going to be seen for the true artist she is. Nobody does what she does. Nobody.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having Pinterest on my Kindle Fire. Everything is the same as viewing on a computer and the menues are easy to scroll between. A must have for an avid pinner.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|All the text, good illustrations, easy navigation. Can't go wrong with this version of this Christmas classic. Probably the best one at this low price.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My favorite Xmas movie. Love the hot chocolate scene. The flying ticket scene is awesome too. We watch every year.
B008CP93S0|2.0|There were some great characters in here but either the actors, script writers, or the director couldn't bring it together to make it funny and entertaining.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series! I could watch it over and over. Great quality, worth the price. Cannot wait for season 3
B006X08EZY|5.0|I came to this because I am Veloso fan, but I keep listening because I finally have the right introduction to David Byrne. The two serve each other in context, This is beautiful and SMART singing. I keep listening over and over and haven't tired of it yet, This is a concert I trult wish I had experienced \\"live,\\" but this is the next best thing. Highly recommend.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This was a good time killer until I bought the new Angry Birds Star Wars. I was impressed how I got into it and building the contraptions for the pigs to ride in. Worth the download.
B005IQZB14|3.0|The first half of the book was pretty entertaining, as the author navigated backpacking for the first time. However, it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, feeling superficial at times, perhaps reluctant to go much deeper. It's a good holiday or vacation read, though.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a great game for basic majong. The colors are vivid and the sounds are cute. I don't quite understand how the point system works and you can't customize the look too much, but it's great for killing time.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Great story about dealing with death in a positive way, easily the best movie on the topic.  Funny zombies, a scary ghost (that turns out fine in the end) and touching family story.  Fine for young kids and old alike.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is more than I could have hoped for. I was sure it was going to be great based on previous versions. The fact that they merged the Star Wars graphics and sounds so well makes it that much more addictive!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|She and Him renditions of Christmas songs is a classic. Those who love alternative rock will love this album! I enjoy listening to the at work over and over.
0307730697|5.0|Simply awesome. Makes me think twice about the many sacrifices military men and women and their families make for this country every day. This also makes me think of what we are all truly capable of with commitment and hard work. Great book.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|BluRay transfer was well done. Clear and crisp picture. I don't have a sound system, so I cannot comment too indepth with regards to sound, but the audio on from the tv was adequate. I love these movies, the first two especially, and seeing them in this format was a little like seeing them again for the first time. Well worth the purchase on BluRay from my perspective, and I loved the special features that were collected for this release.
B004X4R3FE|3.0|It held my attention pretty well, but I could get distracted.  I enjoyed it, but would probably not see it again.
1603427244|5.0|I've been knitting on and off for 60-some years, but I always just used the cast-on and bind-off my mother taught me when I was eight. Now I can see how to do and use all the ones the patterns suggest without having to ask someone, or go online to find it.
B0072OFM28|4.0|The series is good but not as good as the 1st season. But series starts out a little slow but picks up and it gets better. Good buy for the price.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Love this movie.  It is quirky and fun and if you love plaid you will love this movie.  A good time was had by all.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I have bought many knives over the years for kayak camping.  I should have bought this Becker BK2 along time ago.<br />T
B000MS9XAS|5.0|It's a collector's item. The What's The Story Morning Glory album was so genius that Oasis (probably not to saturate the british market) released this song (and Champagne Supernova) as singles in Australia only. But both songs deserved to be released as singles. Pity the b-sides are the same from the Roll With It single, but the artwork is worth the price of it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great story about an &#34;elf&#34; coming to NYC for the first time. Will Ferrel is his usual funny self and Zoey deschanel does a fantastic job as well. It really gets you in the Christmas spirit! I highly recommend this movie!
B009VB97EY|5.0|I love this movie!! I was so pleased to see with the purchase of the dvd for my mom I got this for free!! Awesome!
B009P5K4HK|3.0|I'm reviewing the CD + DVD set. And yeah, I got ticked when I found out that the UK version has two DVDs. Why cheat Winehouse fans from across the pond?<br /><br />Firstly, the CD is taken from various BBC appearances. Amy's in wonderful voice and also on the accompanying DVD. But I don't think she's performing with the Dap Kings on the CD, and that's a major disappointment. The arrangements are very slick in a traditional jazz way, and the Dap Kings had a more textured and funky feel that was way more appropriate for our Amy. Also on the DVD performances, Amy's only accompanied by a bassist and guitarist. So, while the minimal setting allows the listener to fully appreciate that magical voice with minimal distraction, I just wanted to see her with the Dap Kings! With those guys behind her, Amy Winehouse was at her jaw dropping best.<br /><br />Another problem I have with the DVD is the distracting camera work. While Amy's performing, it often zooms in on her hands completely, whether she's gesturing or pulling on her strands of hair. But if the performer is singing, isn't it just basic to at least show her face all the time? It's like filming a pianist and zooming in on their feet pumping the pedals, while the hands out of the picture frame are actually playing the music. Some say this release comes much too soon, and it looks like it was orchestrated by the foundation created by Amy's parents in her memory. Of course, Amy fans will enjoy the work - it's certainly not sub par - but it could have been so much better. Just for reference, free for all the world to see are a couple of live performances on youtube that blow all of this out of the water completely. For reference, check out live \\"Back to Black\\" and \\"Me and Mr. Jones.\\" It don't get \\"bettah dan dat\\"!<br /><br />As part of the package, there's a booklet with some memorials from people (like Naz) which feels like an unnecessary add-on. What fans like me want are details about the various performances and musicians who accompanied her. However, no such information is afforded. Perhaps, this was partly due to contractual restrictions?<br /><br />Here comes the big problem. I do have an old DVD player, and this DVD would only play with much visual and audio distortion on my television. On the other hand, it works with no problem on my desktop Mac. What's up with that?cians who accompanied her. However, no such information is afforded. Perhaps, this was partly due to contractual restrictions?<br /><br />Here comes the big problem.

0671027344|4.0|I bought this book when the movie was released.  I fouind it has very interesting characters.  Very good story and ending.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun game. great graphics and in game shopping pretty cheap. game can be slow at times while trying to raise money but fun nonetheless.
B0084I9QFU|5.0|I love MJ so this was just to replace the one I have that is to scratched up to play now.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|an example of why most sequels don't live up to the original.  the underlying plot seemed a bit forced.  Josh Brolin did a good job--not so much for the other two stars.
B0056369RO|5.0|I love these guys. Just look at the album cover. They're clearly in heaven. There are two great songs on here that I love hearing a lot, such as shots!<br /><br />I definitely think this will not be appropriate for kids but more for young adults. I hear this played in every club EVERY time. I wish the DJs had better things to play.
B004V5A7K8|2.0|Tried on my RAZR MAXX, but screen on a smartphone is just too small for this game. Should be fun on a tablet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome I love the game guys good job on it if I was to improve it I would give out a bonus for every time someone stayed on it an hour or so
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Good acting, appropriate story-line/plot for the intended audience.  Nice ending.  I would purchase this DVD.  (five more words required??? and now 1 more word???)
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I love Daft Punk and this soundtrack is really, really good. I initially didn't like this movie. I thought it took too much for me to get to like it but now I love it and especially Jeff Bridges. There is even a scene in the movie where Daft Punk performs in the club. They always do a great job.<br /><br />You will like this if you like:<br /><br />- Techno, Dance, 'Drum 'n Bass'-like music. I hope you enjoy this music.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Very nice movie. Good script and story. Would watch it again if I get a chance. Would recommend to everybody who is batman fan
B00979CS50|5.0|Bought as present for my husband who is a Neal Young/Crazy Horse fan.  Haven't played it yet, but sure he'll love it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's lots of fun. Great way to entertain yourself while you wait. The Spider card game card movement on the Kindle Fire is quick and sharp.<br />Jacque
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I love Gizmo and always have. I think this is a great Christmas movie. I bought it when the price FINALLY stopped jumping around. I saw it initially at $3.00 and then it jumped to about $9 then finally got it for $5. It's a classic and if you can get it with the digital version via Amazon, go for it. You'll probably just miss out on extras and things like this.<br /><br />I had no idea Steven Spielberg directed this but good for him. Yet another trophy on his wall.
B003O86FMW|5.0|10 stars! Phenomenal follow up to book one, leaves you desperate to start book three!  The author has hit it out of the park with this series and I can't waite to see what she comes out with next!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|With my kindle fire HD, I only have the self facing camera which is not really usable as a regular camera. There is no flash so the lighting has to be just right. It is mostly just good for making sure your own nose is clean.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I thought the title looked a little goofy but decided to go see the movie. I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised, It had allot of action and some great special effects. I love the way the camera would display the scenes where Abraham would whirl around the axe. If you love a fun movie buy this one.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|The blurb says... actually, I don't have a clue what the blurb says. At this point I never look at the blurbs for Milan's books because they feel like spoilers. I'd rather go in without any expectations and just enjoy the story and writing. Of course, for The Duchess War I was partly spoiled because of [[ASIN:1477589031 The Governess Affair]]<br /><br />Here, the only legitimate son of the previous Duke of Clermont, Robert Blaisdell finds a mouse in the library and becomes fascinated. Of course said mouse is clad in a severe blue dress and scowls without her glasses, so that's a perfectly natural reaction for a handsome young lord to have. Except anyone who's read The Governess Affair knows Robert's upbringing wasn't quite the traditional kind and he's grown up bent by the aristocratic standards.<br /><br />Minnie Lane has her own secrets and an unusual past to hide. She uses her scar and simple clothes to mask the final vestiges of her former self, her exceptional mind. She struggles with her new name and the attitude that comes with it, but treasures the friendships.<br /><br />Both Robert and Minnie are having and identity crisis of sorts and they need each other to lean on and to guide themselves out of it. It's the best kind of growing together that can happen to two people who fall in love and end up married. Or course because it's a romance novel and more importantly a romance novel written by Milan, things aren't quite that easy. There are truths and lies to be told, betrayals and choices to be made, there are apologies to be made and forgiveness to be asked.<br /><br />There's history be distorted.<br /><br />What I like most is that Milan takes a historical fact and builds around it. She chooses a time period, looks what was going on in the world then and picks the things that fit her characters. In doing so, she reminds me of things I've learned and forgotten, and she tells a brilliant character driven story. Her characters make mistakes because of who they are instead of because what the plot requires, deus ex machinas are wonderfully absent, and whatever misunderstandings happen are dealt with promptly instead of prolonged unnecessarily.<br /><br />That isn't to say that this novel was perfect. The beginning was slow and felt like it was progressing in fits and starts. I'm not quite sure why, but the pacing felt off and didn't get better until the later half of the book. I also wished there'd been more interactions between Minnie and Oliver considering their shared interest. At the end, I would have been happy with a casual mention of chess boards being left all round the Duke's household for the two enthusiasts. It felt like an obvious connection Milan somehow missed.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure the Dowager Duchess earned her son's forgiveness. She could have been on her way to achieving it, but I didn't believe she quite got there and that's another reason why the epilogue felt like an easy out or a too tidy a bow on a messy gift wrapping.<br /><br />Also, at the end there's a scene with the reporters. That scene quite decimated the high I was feeling--there were tears--after the brilliant scenes between Robert, Oliver, and Oliver's mother.<br /><br />I've read worse, but Milan at her worse is better than most authors are at their best.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|I rented this movie on amazon video using a credit that came in with Black Ops 2. The image quality was horrendous though the application kept showing it was HD, Netflix HD is much better and the cost of that is 7.99 a month. If I had paid the 4.99 an HD rental is on amazon video I would have been really pissed.<br />At least now I know the service is garbage and stop wondering about it.

I understand that the author wants you to see things through that charcters eyes but I didn't like it. He wasn't auistic but he might as well of been from how he thinks and talks. I don't like the repeatitiveness about it. She repeats her self quite a bit.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|Had to chime in here. Deftones' latest is a great album. They are not reinventing the wheel at this point in their career, so there are no big surprises here. Deftones deliver exactly what their fans expect here, a heavy album that has enough melody and light moments to make it a diverse and memorable listening experience. But also, this band continues to refine their craft, and keep finding way to subtly twist their blueprint to avoid repeating themselves.<br /><br />To me the standout track on the album is \\"Leathers\\", with its pummeling guitar and its sublime and cathartically catchy chorus, but each song has a different feel to it, with a different memorable hook as a payoff. Koi No Yokan is the best kind of album - one that grabs you immediately, but that has the depth to reveal new surprises listen after listen (and keep you coming back for more). To me a great album is one where your favorite song keeps changing. Most of the songs on here have had their moment as the one song I had to put on as soon as I got into my car after work.<br /><br />The production on this album is top notch, crystal clear yet very heavy. Chino is a one of a kind frontman, the guitarist delivers aggressive riffs galore but also a variety of different textures, and the drummer Abe Cunningham, one of the best in the business, forcefully keeps the beat and offers interesting fills and flourishes that enhance every track. There are also subtle keyboard/turntable that add depth to the sound.<br /><br />The thing with the Deftones is their ability to mix aggression with beauty so well, to the point that often the heavy guitar parts are beautiful and the quiet, melodic passages can be mesmerizing and maybe a bit unsettling. They are utterly unique in music in that regard. That is why they are my favorite metal band by far and one of my favorite bands overall. I won't say this album is as good as their masterpiece White Pony, but it is pretty great and proof that Deftomes are still very mucha vital and relevent force in music.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I really enjoy customizing the different sounds into relaxing combinations. There are so many to choose from! I also like that you can change the volume for each sound to further customize. It would be nice to have a sleep timer... if there is one, I haven't figured it out yet.
159102594X|1.0|I really tried and I really wanted to like this book - I will write this as to not have any spoilers, but the gist of this book, that I got out of it, is this:<br /><br />The chapters jump between three characters, not a bad thing, happens a lot in Fantasy, and I expect it - the three characters are, an \\"Inquisitor\\" whose job it is to interrogate information out of people and is generally not a likable character - the second is an ex-assassin, on the run from a guy that kicked him out instead of killing him, and he hooks up with a mage that is a complete a-hole and an apprentice which is too stupid and too unbelievable to be an apprentice - and then, and guard that fences - a lot - like every chapter about him he is either training, fencing, or talking about fencing, and all that I can think is WHO CARES?!?<br /><br />also, after about a third of the book has passed, we get 2 more characters added, whose stories connect even less than the first three, and are even less likable - but rule of thumb is that you do not add major players that late in a novel - I got to page 400 of 502 and quit, because I was skipping entire chapters of the fencing guy, and oh boy do we get details about fencing - and politics - Fantasy Politics is so much fun, that I scheduled a root canal to come down from THAT high - I know that this is supposed to be a great book by a great novel, but is my copy bad or something - did an eight year old write my version and I was the lucky Willy Wonka winner for bad fantasy - I don't know and I don't care - this was horrible and I would never recommend this to anyone for any reason ever.<br /><br />Oh, add what is the first law, because in 80% of the book, you never find out - so, again, who cares?
B00004D301|1.0|Love this movie,  One of my all time favorite disaster movies!!!  It arrived promptly, however it didn't work. I tried half a dozen DVD players.  Still couldn't get to play.  I didn't contact the seller.

B009PU2SX8|4.0|Excellent album.  Rooted in a variety of generes, from the bouncing pop of &#34;The Life&#34; to the heavy crunch of &#34;Numb&#34;, this album is worth getting. If you like the Black Keys, you'll like this.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like the size of the numbers & easy to use format.  I like it better then other calculator apps. Almost like using a real one.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and starting from the first page, I could not put down my Kindle. As it progressed, I could not read it fast enough. The characters became so real to me that I truly came to care what happened to each of them. The writing is so clear that at times the &#34;hard parts&#34; were difficult to read, but necessary to the plot. Now I am in the phase of trying to get my friends to read this, too.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|I was initially very pleased when I got this controller.  Took it out of the case, turned it on, paired it via bluetooth with my Nexus 10, and my emulators and most of my games (Dead Trigger, Riptide GP, GTA 3, Shadowgun, etc..) were working perfectly with it.<br /><br />Next, I decided to load up Nyko's Playground software from the Google Play Store.  Terrible, terrible idea.<br /><br />Nyko's Playground software is meant to allow you to program your Playpad for any games that don't natively support their controller.  It does nothing of the sort.  Not only is the app very unnecessarily confusing, but it doesn't work.  At all.  Nyko doesn't even deny this fact.  Their app is officially in BETA, but as far as I'm concerned it shouldn't even be considered an alpha build at this point.  It just doesn't work, period.<br /><br />So after realizing that the software didn't work,  I decided to go ahead and continue to use the Playpad and use the controller on games that DO natively support it.  I powered the Playpad on, and it wouldn't sync via Bluetooth any longer.  I tried every conceivable trick or workaround to get it to work again, but no go.  A quick Google search revealed that this is a common problem after loading the Playground software with MANY android devices, and the only satisfactory resolution is to do a full factory reset of your Android device.  That's what I ended up having to do.  Worked like a charm again after a factory reset but I'd be EXTREMELY hesitant to load up the Nyko Playground software ever again.  Even when it's out of Beta and is supposedly 'officially' working.<br /><br />If I never bothered trying to use the Playground software I would've given this controller 4/5 stars.  It's solidly constructed and works very well for games that natively support it.  Because of the headaches caused by the Playground software, however, I can't feel comfortable rating this higher than 2 stars.
B003EV6DBW|4.0|Great series, great quality, my only complaint is that neither of the christmas specials are on this. Got this after the price drop, and well worth the deal.
1451695195|5.0|This book chronicles the journey this doctor made into the next realm---completely amazing and spirit-lifting.  I could not put it down until I was finished.  It is a story I will never forget and has truly changed me.
0345803485|5.0|Love the books the first one is of course my favorite book was in great condition and was like i bought it right from store
1451695187|3.0|I believe that Dr. Alexander believes his account of his NDE to be accurate and real. I believe he feels a very strong compulsion to share his experiences and that he put hurculean effort into recording his experiences after the fact.<br />Whether or not he has unravelled an ancient mystery remains to be seen. Of course, when we finally discover the truth our time will have run out for sharing the news with others.<br />My guess is that devout Christians will embrace this book and the agnostic crowd will be swayed very little if at all. The writing style and organization of the book--while admittedly not within Dr Alexander's extensive training--leaves a bit to be desired. All that said, I commend him for trying to make a difference in the lives of others.
1451648537|4.0|I have waited patiently for a decent biography on Apple front man, Steve Jobs.  When I learned that Walter Isaacson, one of my favorite biographers took the challenge, I jumped at the chance to read this book.<br /><br />Two words - \\"Steve\\" and \\"Jobs.\\"  Ordinary words.  But smash the two words together and two things happen: ordinary vanishes and controversy begins.  It is common knowledge that Jobs rubbed many people the wrong way during his days at Apple.  Isaacson documents numerous stories that confirm this. And while some reviewers resist Isaacson's willingness to share the good, the bad, and the ugly, this biographer truly seeks to present a balanced portrait of Steve Jobs.  Isaacson writes with a measured, yet realistic respect.  His work is thorough and the research is extensive.<br /><br />Whatever one thinks about Steve Jobs, it is important to recognize that Apple recently emerged as the most valuable company in America, topping out at $337 billion.  There is no question that Jobs' ingenuity, creativity, \\"out-of-the box thinking,\\" business sense, and vision helped shaped this phenomenal company.  Apple would not be Apple without Steve Jobs.  Rick Warren rightly tweeted on the day of his death, \\"Steve Jobs, the Thomas Edison of my generation.\\"<br /><br />Jobs' Edison-like influence on contemporary culture is widely known.  This review is hammered out on a MacBook Pro.  Multiple people surround me using Mac devices including iPhones, iPads, and iPods.  It is an indisputable fact that Steve Jobs changed the way people look at and use technology.<br /><br />Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is a vivid reminder of God's common grace - the grace that gives people an ability to produce great art, inspiring music and useful technology.  It is a reminder that all good gifts come from God and God alone.  The takeaway is simple: Will we reflect God's glory with the common grace he has extended or will we turn the spotlight on ourselves?  \\"For from him and to him and through him are all things.  To him be the glory forever and ever\\" (Rom. 11:36, ESV).ough him are all things.  To him be the glory forever and ever\\" (Rom. 11:36, ESV).
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Great game, a lot of fun and some parts made me laugh. However, the ads break in far too often, more than regular Angry Birds.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|Another great Mitch Albom boom.  A friend didn't like it too much, but I enjoyed it.  As always with his writing, it was an easy read, but insightful.
B004EI2NM2|1.0|Normally the premise of having two chicks naked throughout a movie would have no chance of failure, but this does.  I got this just to see Elena Anaya because she looked cute in another film I saw.  She is better with her clothes on.  She had this hideous boy haircut and her body is full of ugly moles.  She has ugly brown mommy breasts that were a turnoff too.  The Russian chick is a little better, but nothing special.  There is nothing erotic about this movie.  They just go on and on talking nonsense the whole time.  Maybe this is a chick film and I just didn't get it.  I don't know how it ends because I only made it halfway through before ejecting the disc.<br /><br />Don't waste your time buying or ever watching this film.  You would get more entertainment watching the Weather Channel.

0399160450|4.0|A Tom Clancy novel is no longer a Tom Clancy written novel.  In the beginning, he paid very close attention to detail.  The books had dramatic flow.  Getting around 100 pages left, one could not help but stay wherever you were to finish.  The pages would not turn fast enough.<br /><br />Now Clancy has made millions and found if he puts his name in big black letters on anything, it sells.  He now gives vague outlines to other writers to do the work for him.  The books uses characters created by Clancy, doing the job Clancy gave them, but it is nowhere near the page turning flow of Clancy nor the accuracy of Clancy.<br /><br />He has made too much money to be bothered with it now.  I do sincerely wish this was not true.  I sat in a restaurant parking lot finishing The Hunt For Red October when it first came out.  I would love that feeling again.
B0098466CK|3.0|This album is ok, but if you compare it to their debut album, you can tell that there's something missing.  It has no energy, no freshness, no hunger.  It's like they just fulfilled their contract to put out an album.  There's some synthesizer parts making their way into the songs too.  That's a most disturbing trend.  Sword better turn it around and go back to their roots, or they won't get my purchase anymore.

B005721W9O|5.0|This movie is quirky and funny.  It pokes fun at the sci-fi world.  I had this movie as a VHS but wanted to replace because I watch this movie a lot.  If you don't want a more lighthearted version of Star Trek, this is your movie.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|The world and characters Howey creates are captivating. The prose is quite good, and in general the plot moves along very satisfyingly, with its interweaving vignettes delaying our gratification just enough.<br /><br />And then there's the ending. I won't give any spoilers, but I will say the ending is the biggest sticking point for me about this book.<br /><br />In many ways the things I liked about this book were the same things I originally liked about the show Lost. As in that show, we have an experiment in society gone awry. High-minded ideas about what makes for order and prosperity are shown to create a dystopian reality in practice, and for a while, we're not quite sure who the good guys are.<br /><br />But like Lost, the ending is a copout. And as with Lost, it tarnished the memory of the work as a whole for me. It seems so many escapist works of fiction end up that way. It's almost as if the writers are afraid to take risks with endings, and so we rarely get a bold statement in the end. Maybe they're afraid of the backlash they would get, because, let's face it: the majority of people buying books like this on Amazon or watching television series probably want an ending that's not going to challenge their worldview. But good science fiction *should challenge our worldview. In fact, I would argue that's its highest purpose.<br /><br />I was so drawn in by book 1. I found the stark reality Howey created there to be a little horrifying in its believability. I think many of us understand at some level that that reality could very easily become our own future, if things don't change in our world. I only wish that the arc of books 1-5 as a whole could have been a bit more like the arc of book 1.

0545123291|4.0|Once again, conflicting emotions. The good news is this book doesn't spend nearly as long dwelling on the girl-falls-in-love-with-an-animal plot point, which I still find creepy. Grace and Sam are now both human and in love (in a relationship which may be a tad too obsessive to actually be considered healthy) and...happy? Well, no, not really happy, because Sam still has angst about being a wolf, and about the rest of his pack who is currently a wolf, and about the strange unknowns of the new wolves. Sam is just an angsty kind of guy.<br /><br />However, Linger is not entirely the Sam-and-Grace show, because now we add in the viewpoints of Cole and Isabelle. Cole was not a very likable guy. I'm not even sure if I was supposed to like him. He's charismatic and charming, but not the kind of person I really want to spend any time with. Add in that half the characters also don't like him, and I think it's okay that I didn't either. He was interesting. Just not likable.<br /><br />However, I did like Isabelle, which is funny, because she's also not a very likable person. But a lot of the time, she had the sole voice of reason, making the same observations I was and pointing out obvious things that really should be priorities for the other characters. And despite everything Isabelle went through in the first book, she was surprisingly non-angsty and down-to-earth. Yes, there was the weird thing between her and Cole, which was kind of out-of-the-blue, but it wasn't a central plot point like the Sam-and-Grace relationship. For the most part, the Isabelle chapters were my favorites.<br /><br />The plot for Linger is, in my opinion, more interesting than the one for Shiver because there's a bit more mystery about the whole thing, a bit more of the danger and unknown that makes a story interesting. Also, less focus on the romance (although it is still very much present), which was good because while I love a good romance, I need it to be more sub-plotty and less main-plotty.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Linger was Grace's conflict with her parents. I got SO FRUSTRATED with that whole thing, and it was for three reasons.<br /><br />1. Grace's parents' concerns were totally valid, as were their reactions to what Grace was doing and the way they decided to deal with it. If anything, I thought she got off easy.<br /><br />2. Grace acted like a disrespectful brat, throwing out basically every teenage angsty cliche in the book, driving her parents bonkers, then acting like their reaction was completely unreasonable and over-the-top, and being utterly narrow-minded and self-centered. I honestly couldn't stand her in those chapters.<br /><br />3. Grace's relationship with her parents for all of Shiver and the first part of Linger undermined them when they actually attempted to do some decent parenting, and I hated that that was the case. While I still don't think Grace's melodramatic hissy fit was justified, I can at least understand why she was disinclined to listen to her parents' concerns after they spent most of her life decidedly absent.<br /><br />Everything about this part just rubbed me the wrong way, and while I understand that it makes sense for the characters (because after all, Grace is a teenager in the throes of her first serious relationship, and her parents are uninvolved 95% of the time), it was beyond frustrating. I think this is a matter of perspective, not the writing or storytelling. If I was a teenager reading this, I may have completely sided with Grace. But I'm a parent, so I couldn't. You may think this is the best part of the book, and if so, good for you. I'm glad you don't have to be frustrated.<br /><br />Then there was the ending, which was actually kind of neat. I saw half of it coming, but the ultimate resolution took me by surprise. It's the reason I'm going to keep going and read Forever, because I'm really curious how they're going to work out a solution to this problem. I'm just hoping they don't turn Cole into a deus ex machina, because I could see it going there. I'm also hoping that we get less angst, less brattiness, and more Isabelle-as-the-voice-of-reason.le into a deus ex machina, because I could see it going there. I'm also hoping that we get less angst, less brattiness, and more Isabelle-as-the-voice-of-reason.

B007B6VOG0|3.0|The two hits are really enjoyable - vocal harmonies (with a little Autotune) and lyrics that reveal more over time.  The rest of the album is a bit, ummm, showtuney, enough so that I've only listened to it end-to-end once. The theatricality is just too much.

B007J26P0G|2.0|This barebones box might work for you, but I thought I should share where I had problems:<br /><br />1) The shuttle docs say you are allowed to put memory in only one of the two slots, as long as you use the slot closer to the motherboard. However, the machine would not even POST for me when I put memory only in that slot. So I'd recommend you buy your memory as a pair, which works.<br /><br />2) The video hardware is Intel's GMA3650, which may matter to you if you are installing linux. Many unix OS's do not have drivers for this chipset in the mainstream yet. It was difficult to get up and running.

Initially priced @ $27.98, two hours later it's down to $14.99, don't get that but I'm not complaining. Definately worth your time.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved the book! It was full of adventure and I loved the twist at the end of the book
141659521X|4.0|Have read every Vince Flynn offering and found this to be the better of the last five novels. The Last Man has an engaging story line, at a reasonably quick pace, familiar characters and new ones as well. In this novel, I greatly appreciated the omission of the tired, tired phrases; \\"jet black hair\\", \\"pipping hot coffee\\", \\"his bony finger\\" and of course \\"craned his neck\\"(the latter used only once).<br />  Had initially decided to not read this novel due to recent weaker stories and writing, but was surprisingly impressed. (Still a few typos present) Looking forward to the new Vince Flynn, Brian Haig series in May 2013 and next Mitch Rapp novel in the fall of 2013.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Had fun with this but grew bored after a while. Would have probably enjoyed it more if others were interested or didn't get bored with it.

B008EK91XU|4.0|This book is a really interesting read, to see how easily he climbed to the pinnacle of world swimming and then the challenges of making a comeback after so long out of the water.  I was expecting him to reveal that he is gay at some stage during the book, but it appears he is actually straight.  This book has me looking forward to next years swimming world chamionships and hoping Thorpedo is on the start blocks.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I dont understand why it had to end like this.  The ending was not what i was expecting.  Everyone has there own opinion,just watch it for yourself
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing solitaire especially when I am winning.  But, I took this off my Kindle because of the ads I had to look at every time I played one game and wanted to play another.  Some of the ads I disliked because they were about singles.  Very annoying!
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|If this were billed as a drama, it would have met expectations. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were excellent. But the only \\"comedy\\" came as a result of uncomfortable situations and awkwardness. I agree with the previous reviewers who said it dragged. I found myself pausing the playback to see how much longer the movie had to go before the end. Disappointing.

In other words, awesome.
B0014E9188|5.0|Why Porcupine Tree hasnt garnered the attention of more music fans is beyond me.  It could be PT's sound vastly changes and evolves over time, but that also speaks to their inventiveness.  Steven Wilson is widely regarded as a musical genius, but the entire band is multi-faceted and it comes out satisfyingly so on this DVD.  The title track alone is worth the money, however in my estimation this is one of the best track listings they have performed.  The pieces fit to take you on an amazing journey.  Wilson has become one of my all-time favorite guitar players, and his solo's are so filled with emotion intertwined with heaviness.  Every person I have ever turned onto Porcupine Tree instantaneously falls in love with them, no matter a person's musical tastes.  A high musical IQ is preferred, but the average fan can love this DVD as well.  The full fledged fan will adore it
0345803485|1.0|Why did I read this? The writing is horrible and the book is boring.<br />I'm not even sure how to characterize this book. It's not a romance novel. It's too vanilla, to use her word, to be an erotic novel.<br /> What I find the most offensive is that she makes dominants (and no, I'm not defending them because I am one)out to be a person with some sort of psychosis that has caused them to be that way. Get over it lady! Different people have different sexual taste and desires.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome for kindle fire and it works great and the games are awesome but some are hard.
1476715904|5.0|Loved it!  Read the entire book in one night!  I would love to see another story<br />out for this series!
B005ZMUQCK|4.0|I like the idea of instant movie. But Cars on Amazon instant movie does not provide subtitle, which is essential for my 4 year old boy. My boy kept asking me what's going on and this is quite frustrating to him. He has no problems with movies on DVD when subtitle is available.

B000VECAEO|5.0|you either like Seinfeld or you don't. This is season 9. Just as stated.  IT Comes in a nice box.
B004J4X73K|4.0|While I enjoyed this better than &#34;The White Road,&#34; and &#34;Shadows Return,&#34; &#34;Casket of Souls&#34; doesn't have the same brightness and sharpness of description that &#34;Luck in the Shadows&#34; and its two immediate sequels did. I felt like Flewelling took her time to flesh out the world, and the characters, in &#34;Luck in the Shadows.&#34; This book is much more focused on plot, on just getting things done.<br /><br />Here's the best example I can think of--remember how in &#34;Luck in the Shadows,&#34; Seregil is teaching Alec how to eat like a Rhiminee noble? Remember how he feeds Alec a sea urchin and Alec nearly retches? I was thinking of that while I was at a seafood restaurant recently, and sea urchin was on the menu. It was little moments like that, on top of the vivid descriptions of skulking around and solid characterization, that really made the series for me, but you don't see anything like that in &#34;Casket of Souls.&#34; It's still a good book, and I don't regret buying it, but the color seems to have drained out of Flewelling's writing a little bit.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Everyone, young and old, should read this book. An easy read that stays with you. A perfect present for the ones you love.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I love story telling. I love cats(big one in this case), kids, survival and the human spirit to to overcome any situations like this one!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Doctor Alexander is obviously a keen minded scientist without religious or spiritual sub-texts.  He states the facts of his personal experience with marvelous detachment.  It's an account that anyone can read and get something meaningful from it.  It is true unbiased reporting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My favorite game! Keeps your mind thinking and is nice for down time. Sometimes it's challenging but usually pretty easy.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great blend of comedy and action. Joss Whedon strikes again creating a fantastic superhero movie. I am slightly biased as I love most Superhero movies (some of which I know aren't technically good movies) but this is one that I don't feel ridiculous when I say that I love it.
B009O2XY12|2.0|It's a cute little game--OK for playing if you just need to take a few minutes to unwind.  BUT--after a certain point, you run out of &#34;gems&#34;, and cannot play further until you purchase more.  Not purchase with points, but with REAL MONEY. I won't be playing this anymore...I work too hard for my money to toss it away so easily.  I know many games follow this same format.  I just wish I had known ahead of time; I wouldn't have bothered to download it.
0385720920|5.0|This book was interesting...to say the least.  It was not what I expected, but was still entertaining.  Palahniuk has a unique style of writing and is not for everyone, but if you're up for quirky, kinky humor, I recommend it.
0374275637|2.0|On the one hand, this provoking book is an eye-opener on the flaws of human rationality. It is an exhaustive review of decades of research on the psychology of decision making.<br />On the other hand, the book itself seems to fall in many of the biases it tends to describe, including overconfidence. In biomedical research, the field I am coming from, any claims have to be thorougly supported by countless control studies. In this book, I find many claims to be at best non-convincing. Kahneman describes provoking models to explain complex human behaviors, but the paradigmatic studies that he uses as supporting examples often seem exaggeratly simplistic and not convincing, at least taken in isolation. As a holder of a Nobel prize, I believe Kahneman conducted his experiments in a careful way, and performed thoughtful control studies. Therefore, I conclude that it must be the book itself that was written with little care, somehow with a sense of haste and on a very condescending tone. No need to study psychology for decades to know that condescendence may not be optimal when the goal of a book is to change the vision of reality System 2 has constructed every day since we are born.
0060763280|4.0|Easy to read, and understand.  Loaded with useful information.  Highly recommended, if you are thinking about buying this book move forward and do so.
B00631VJIC|4.0|buyer was great. Very nice just as described. Wasn't sure what exactly u was buying. I love the show and music. However I didn't realize they had done all the songs by there own
B004GVUPFE|2.0|Played foatd for about 4 levels and uninstalled.  Can get similar games free. It counts your moves in an way that makes no sense.  If you like these types of games, go for it.  Don't expect anything great.
B003SHDP4K|4.0|No question : this book is worth reading. What I liked about it is the questioning of our faith and by this asking as what is you believe in.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Equal to the works of Michener.  The growth of Follett as an author is impressive.  The evolutuion of the characters is fascinating and the accuracy of the history makes the entire works an education.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is a port of an older PS2 game to the Vita but has been updated with new features and is a definite hit for the platform.<br /><br />The game starts off a little slow with you mostly jumping from cut scene to scene before you really get to a dungeon.  The game has a multiple layers of development for each character. You have to develop social links, education, fighting, and balance all of these while attending school and rescuing victims before the next foggy day.<br /><br />The graphics are a bit dated but the game play is solid with a story you can follow and enjoy. I picked the game up not knowing what to expect, and 10 hours and three days later I find myself waiting for the end of the work day so I can get home and play!<br /><br />This is not a kids game and does carry a Mature \\"M\\" rating.  This is a definite do not miss game for the Vita.
B001I189MQ|5.0|Love that Joker...so sad that he had to die, so very very sad that he had to die; it was not meant to be; kill the series and start over again...sigh.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Does not seem as much fun as the original Angry Birds.  Maybe they are trying to get to technical or adding to many obstacles but it worth a try.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|I like Ridley Scott and the original Alien a lot and was prepared to really enjoy this movie. I only rented it before buying because I wanted to make sure of my purchase. Boy was I glad I did. What i was not prepared for was the hacked up editing, the unreality of the captain's actions while parts of the crew were missing, the bizarre plot, and the trite ending. This was a major disappointment..
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Who hasn't wished for their very own Mr. Darcy after reading Pride & Prejudice? The movie does a nice job of interpreting what it would be like for a someone from today to enter the world of P&P. It is a little slow at times, but it's well acted, inventive, and true to the book it's based on.
B000P407K4|5.0|What else does anyone have to say; its a great movie, and it was a great price; why anyone would part with it I will never understand.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|Good movie. I enjoyed the action and suspense. They spent a little too much time in the Dark Forest but otherwise the movie kept a good pace. I would watch it again.

B009SQRL4U|5.0|I generally bow (sneak) out of kids' movies, but stayed for this and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not the usual dumbed down Hollywood fare. I don't know if this is a British production, but it felt like it; truly smart. The kids (ages 6,9 and 11) all loved it.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|Corny in an A-Team kind of way.  Good action even though some of it was a stretch of the imagination. The had some big jumps in the plot but otherwise entertaining.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This book has the feel of  full novel in a short but complete novella, enertaining and expertly written Sanderson delivers a small package in a big way.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|If you enjoyed watching FRIENDS the first time around and in reruns, this may be for you.  It was fun to watch specific episodes and then just play, &#34;pick a card, any card&#34; and then randomly select an episode.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|There's nothing I can say about Angry Birds that hasn't already been said.  However, this version (on my Kindle Fire HD, at least) doesn't interface with GameCircle, so there aren't any achievements or leaderboards.  Disappointing.  It'll be 5-stars when it gets GameCircle.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This LP has a little bit of everything. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis put together a high-energy album that efficiently mixes comedy, societal issues and life lessons into one session. There are at least five single-worthy songs on this LP, and I haven't turned back since hearing Same Love on NPR.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Yeah, this has continued to be one of my all time favorite movies so I had to have in Blu Ray.  The Skynet BD Live thing doesn't seem to work anymore.  Not sure I really care.  I bought it for the high quality video and the extras, including the secret version that requires a code to unlock.  Fun stuff.
B00688628M|5.0|We started this on Veterans Day night and it took a couple weeks to get through it. My husband and I loved seeing it again, and now being able to share it with our kids.  Never let future generations forget the sacrifice of our grandparents!

B00005A3KS|5.0|Cool movie about surf gangs and bank robbers I enjoyed the movie! I loved the surf scenes in the movie.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|One of my favorite Blu Ray purchases.  This not only comes with the Animatrix, but also another content/making-of type documentary.  There is also some printed material.  Comes in nice thick stick cardboard box.  Have it sitting prominently in my collection.

1451695195|3.0|The book was okay but had a hard time staying with it.  Was more in the mood for a light novel when I read it.  Might have enjoyed it more at another time.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I couldn't put it down. But for about the first 50 pages I didn't think I was into it. Great series. The first two are definitely better than the third.

1603425381|5.0|What a great collection of borders!  Everything from beginner to a great challenge for the more experienced.  Love having the many approaches on how to make your crocheted piece different and more interesting, just by adding a different border.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Just a lot of fun.  Lots of reminders of &#34;How to Train Your Dragon&#34;.  If you have kids, you'll want to buy it.  Even if you don't have kids, you may want to buy it.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|I have seen a lot of 'hand held' movies - good and bad. I must say, this is one of the better ones. I was entertained. Although, I did not care for the ending, overall, this movie was alright.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Love this movie :) christmas wouldn't be the same without this holiday classic ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1603427244|5.0|Great reference guide for knitting.  Lots of different approaches and excellent suggestions as to why you would use a particular cast on/bind off. Super step by step photographs.  Finally a good discussion on to do Provisional cast ons!  Also liked the heavy duty spiral binding.  Makes the book lie flat while you're trying to figure out a stitch.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Dark read that kept me interested especially at the end.  I will definitely will be reading another novel by this talented author.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|i got this movie to watch on the air plane. it was very good and funny as hell from start to finish
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This film was adapted from Suzanne Collins novel, The Hunger Games, which seem to be tugging towards the same spotlight as the Harry Potter series and Twilight series.  This film is steered towards the Young Adult crowd.<br /> The movie was directed by Gary Ross who is well known for directing movies like \\"Seabiscuit\\" and \\"Pleasantville.\\" Jennifer Lawrence plays the main heroine, Katniss Everdeen, who is independent and acts as the head of the family after her father passed away. Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for an Academy Award for her previous movie \\"Winter's Bones.\\" Josh Hutcherson portrays Peeta Mellark, a Baker's son (ironic much- Pita Bread). Liam Hemsworth plays Gale Hawthrone, a good friend of Katniss. Other big names include Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sunderland, and Lenny Kravitz.<br /><br /> What makes \\"The Hunger Games\\" unique from any other fictional story out there?<br /> Unlike \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Twilight\\", \\"The Hunger Games is set in a future utopia of the United States, where an anarchy rule has taken place. In other words, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. There are 12 districts in the nation of Panem. Out of the 12 districts, one boy and one girl are chosen at random between the ages of 12-18 to participate in the Hunger Games from each district. In total there are 24 tributes. These 24 tributes must battle it out till death to bring victory for their respective district. They battle it out in an arena. Only one may come out alive. Katniss, Peeta, and Gale all belong to District 12. When Katniss' 12 year old sister is chosen to participate, Katniss' sisterly instinct takes over and she \\"volunteer as tribute\\" for District 12. Peeta is then chosen as the boy to complete the tributes for District 12. Katniss and Peeta are portrayed as \\"distant lovers\\" to gain appeal from the masses watching in Panem. The action-packed film, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" will have you sitting at the edge of your seat.<br /> The tone of the movie is extremely vulnerable because at any point a character's flaws may be revealed and therefore ruin their chance of succeeding. Each tribute must overcome each of the hurdles that the game makers throw at them even if it does cost them their lives.<br /> This stunning and unique film is a must see because the bonds of friendship, love, and sacrifice get tested. I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars for the amazing depth in drama and action.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A super logic game that you can start simply to get the hang of things and move on up to get really complicated.  Fun and addictive.  Great game for playing while you're waiting in line somewhere
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book to read. If you love action and suspense driven novels, this is the one to read. Why is there a word limit on this thing.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|a fan since my deployment to Afghanistan. one of their best shows to date. sorry not in a series anymore.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I'm an avid mass-market reader...Connelly, Child, Johansen, Sandford. I don't know how I missed Baldacci. The story was gripping, but even more, I enjoyed the writing style immensely.My favorite reads are ones where I don't NOTICE the writing style...no odd phrasing, no misguided attempts to be clever. I was halfway through this book when I realized the writing style was completely comfortable, and just moved me along through the story.<br />The story teams a likeable US government paid assassin, whose latest assignment goes wrong,  with a savvy teenage girl looking to find out who murdered her parents. I rated it only four, not five, because of one plot line that noticeably did not fit in. Despite that, I really liked the book & will add Baldacci to my regulars.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Great to have this app and the price is right.  Love finally being able to view you tubes on my Kindle.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Movie was dark as the title make us aware, it created balance to the other films prior where humor and romance dominated without enough real shadow. Ending was somewhat predictable, the need to continue the revenue flow is all to obvious, now we have Robbin and Batwomen to lift bills from our pocketbooks.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|I am a Disney/Pixar fanatic and over the years I have come to expect BIG things from Pixar. It pains me to say that this is the second movie they have put out in a row that left me feeling underwhelmed (Cars 2 was the first). It's not a bad movie by any means, let me get that out of the way. It's a mildly entertaining flick for kids, and it's almost a coming-of-age tale, mostly geared towards girls, which is fine, but it was not what I expected. I feel like I was watching a movie I've seen a hundred times, even though it was my first time watching it. The animation is spectacular, I'll give it that. The characters and story are largely forgettable. I can't even recall the main character's name. Or any of their names to be honest. Pixar can do better than this. I have my fingers crossed that Monsters Inc 2 will live up to the original. And to be fair, Cars 2 and Brave are the only 2 Pixar movies I found disappointing. The trouble is, I didn't expect big things from Cars 2. I expected big from Brave, and it did not deliver. Is it my fault for expecting too much then? Perhaps. At any rate, it blows Avatar out of the water. Then again so did Cars 2.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|The order came in on time and in excellent shape . I will order through this company again and again .
1594202842|5.0|A fascinating perspective of the Chinese &#34;Tiger Mother.&#34;  How different the perspectives and drives than most Western mothers.  Perhaps it would be good to find a middle ground between the west and east.  Gives &#34;helicopter&#34; mom a whole new definition.
B0039TAHMA|4.0|I love Amazon; not only they haev the movie I need but, couple of times the movie stop for a fraction of a second and they gave me the money back for those little interruptions.  Great Deal !
B002VPE1AW|2.0|I have a lot of problems with this movie. Let that be said. So I'll start with what I DO like, since the list is much shorter. The graphics and animation are amazing. Some of the best in the industry. Okay, now let's get to the bad. \\"Wait that's it? One thing you liked about this movie?\\" I hear you ask. Yes. This movie is very disappointing. I'll go almost as far to say it's pretty close to being considered bad. My biggest issue (and a lot of other peoples') is that the story has been done to death. Please, no more. Romeo and Juliet captured that story the best and each time the story is revisited in some other skin, it lessens its impact. Avatar is blight upon animated movies. Not only did they steal the name of a much better story (The Last Airbender), but the way the story is presented is just downright boring. Not once did my opinion of this movie go above mediocre, the entire time I was watching it. One of my biggest pet peeves when watching movies, reading a book, watching a tv show, etc is feeling like it was forced to go on longer than it should have. Lord of the Rings was 3 and a half hours apiece but never once did I feel like it should've ended an hour earlier. Avatar, on the other hand, should've ended after about an hour and a half. There was a point in the movie where if it ended there, I could've given it 3 stars and said \\"Okay, that wasn't terrible, but I'm glad it's over now\\". But no. Just as I'm about to take the DVD out, the movie keeps going. And going. And I sat through it...another hour. I thought the movie had to be over any minute, and after that point I just wanted it to end. I can't watch a movie halfway, I want to see the entire thing. And I almost wish I turned it off when I originally thought it was over. One last thing I didn't like was the world and the characters. BO-RING! The blue cat people definitely failed to catch my interest. The world was not very unique, but like I said the graphics were phenomenal, but by the same token I feel we've visited this planet before in another movie.<br /><br />Okay so maybe I was a bit harsh on this movie. It's not terrible. If this was the first movie you've ever seen, then good for you. You might actually enjoy it. But the story's been done to death. The characters are very forgettable, the world is uninteresting, it overstayed it's welcome, and what really confounds me the most out of everything is the fact that this is the new highest grossing movie of all time. No way did it deserve it. Absolutely no way. I watched this movie only to see what the hype was all about, and walked away very unimpressed. Do I recommend seeing this movie? Sure. If only for the beautiful graphics. But don't expect anything groundbreaking (despite what some people might tell you)
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Fits well in the Gairman world view and gives those of a irrevent  bent some fodder.  If you follow this author you will find some gems.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Finally found good ol' basic Spider solitaire.  Nothing dramatic, just a great basic game for the Kindle. the closest to the computer game that I have found.

B009HELT3C|4.0|MIB has been an ok series, nothing too special, but I really enjoyed MIBIII, much better story and I love the job Josh Brolin did playing a younger Tommy Lee Jones. Highly recommended.

B000002GBJ|5.0|Loved this way back when and needed something that would serve as a bit more than background music when I was doing graphic design work.  Great to hear Six Wives again and in great sound.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It has a great timeline and very intriguing! The three books definitely coordinate with each other . You can connect with the characters even if it isn't the same circumstance.
B004L03B3S|5.0|somewhat abrupt ending but it was a beautifully written movie.  Highly recommended movie if you want to try a non-traditional love story.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I like these types of &#34;puzzle/quests&#34;.  This has good graphics, a challenge, but not so hard it is frustrating.  The hidden object segments are sometimes a little hard to see, but overall worth the time and purchase price.  I have purchased Alawar Entertainment products before, and will again.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Have really enjoyed playing this with my friends.  It gets really funny to try and figure out the clues and drawings that they come up with.  Only criticism is how hard it is to get more than the basic few colors.  Do not like the limited palette that you are given
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Started seasons one and two on Netflix and could not stop watching!! Love the storyline and characters. Full of action and drama.

B00005JKNF|1.0|In the special features Mr. Altman says he did not read the script.  That explains why this movie is so bad.
B0060Q962Q|4.0|A great computer version of the original 4 in a Row game and you can't lose the checkers.  Playing against the computer is fun.  Challenging but you can beat the computer which is nice instead of always losing.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was a totally enjoyable book, seemingly created for the geek in me. Mystery and intrigue - typography - and an insiders peek at Google (albeit it a fictional one) - what more could my inner geeky girl ask for?
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Movie was okay.  The picture quality was not good as it paused a number of times.  It paused alot at the end of the movie.  I missed parts of the movie.
B008RTE09S|3.0|In early April of 1967, while visiting Jane Asher in Denver, Colorado (Jane was doing Shakespeare with the Bristol Old Vic company, and April 5th was her 21st birthday), Paul McCartney came up with the concept of filming what was originally to be a theatrical film, but finished as an hour long Beatles television special. He jotted down his ideas on his return flight home on April 11 and presented them to the rest of the band a few days later. Paul enjoyed making movies on his own and essentially, MMT was one of his films on steroids. The first MMT recording session took place April 25 with the title track.<br /><br />  It is interesting to note just a few of the events going on during this period: Finishing touches to Sgt. Pepper were still being recorded up through April 21, Yellow Submarine recording sessions began May 11, the Sgt. Pepper press release party was held May 19 where McCartney met Linda Eastman, \\"All You Need Is Love\\" was performed live on the BBC for the Our World Live broadcast June 25, in late July the Beatles went to Greece looking to buy an island where they could live and record together, Ringo's son Jason was born Aug.19, the Beatles manager Brian Epstein visited the Beatles while they worked on recording \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" at Chappell Recording Studios, the last before he died on Aug. 27. The Beatles met at Paul's home Sept. 1 to discuss their future plans where it was decided to continue with the MMT project and put everything else on hold. Filming for MMT began September 12, Apple was formed Nov. 17. MMT was premiered in monochrome on BBC Television Dec. 26th, 1967.<br /><br />  MMT was released on VHS in Hi-Fi Digital Stereo in 1988 (all songs supervised and re-mixed by George Martin, visual and dialog materials restored and re-mastered by Ron Furmanek), on DVD in Dolby Digital in 1997 (just a transfer of the 1988 production where the film negative was transferred to video at VTR Studios, London on 6/23/88 and the sound relayed from the original mag track and digital audio masters at Abbey Road Studios on 6/24-25/88), and now in surround sound in 2012.<br /><br />Video: The company of Eque, Inc. under the supervision of Paul Ruttan Jr. (Yellow Submarine) was responsible for the picture restoration. Cleaned up are all the film dirt, damage and defects found in the original, as well as the colors enhanced from anemic to vivid. To compare what was to what is now, check out some of the extras, which do not have all the clean-up administered. That's the way the 1997 DVD looks throughout. Understand, this was not a high budget 35mm film and that it was intended for television broadcast in 1967, so the original material was never intended to be seen on the big screen in high resolution. Still, it looks good considering and the clean-up job is most appreciated.<br /><br />Audio: Many people were involved in the audio reproduction of the 2012 re-release of MMT: Sound Producer was Giles Martin (Sir George's son). The soundtrack and songs were re-mixed at Abbey Road Studios by Sam Okell. Project coordinator was Allan Rouse. Assistant Engineer was Matt Mysko. Audio restoration was by Simon Gibson. The original recordings were made by Geoff Emerick and Ken Scott.<br /><br />The audio sounds good with much improved dynamic range and very little \\"flash\\" given to the surround sound channels, which I'm happy about. The DTS-HD Master sounds superior to the Dolby Digital 5.1 as typical.  However, similar to the 2012 Yellow Submarine Blu-ray, though the dynamic range is actually improved by 5.6 dB over the Dolby Digital DVD, the over-all level is set more than 10 dB above reference level, so be cautious!<br /><br />Bonus Features: There are eight, including Paul giving commentary of the whole film, but my two favorites are \\"Meet The Supporting Cast\\", which has many fun and interesting tid-bits, and the big surprise to me, Traffic's \\"Here We Go Around The Mulberry Bush\\". I never knew about this video or that it wasmade to be a part of the film. Fun to see the original Traffic line-up making a silly music video back in the psychedelic days.<br /><br />There is also a 10\\" square deluxe box set, which includes a 60 page soft cover book, two vinyl EPs of the original UK album, and both the Blu-ray and DVD.made to be a part of the film.

B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|Good prelude/backstory to Halo 4 and one of it's NPCs.  Definitely worth a viewing.  The only knock I really had for this was the fact Steve Downes was not the voice of Master Chief.
1451675046|5.0|Isaac Asimov was said to be the \\"great explainer\\".  He has now been equaled if not surpassed.  I wish I had had this book in about fourth grade; it would have illuminated so many things that puzzled me then.  I was an atheist from age eight (totally, and necessarily, \\"in the closet\\"); I was exposed to one Sunday-School teacher who taught us about Velikovsky and pyramid prophecies, backed by the Reader's Digest.  And then a geology professor (otherwise excellent) who ridiculed continental drift . . .  The book is obviously intended for juvenile readers, but for this adult it proved also to be a valuable review of things I had partially forgotten, a recap of others, and entertaining and highly readable throughout - even if I learned little that was really new.
B004TSXUWY|3.0|I  personally found the book to be repetative and rather boring.  It was quite a battle to read it<br />tthrough to the end.

B004GJDQT8|1.0|Be careful what you install on your devices.  I purchased and installed the \\"Tomarket Pro app\\" using Amazon's required appstore.  I uninstalled Amazon's appstore because I ONLY wanted Tomarket.  Tomarket would NOT work without Amazon's appstore installed.  Consequently, I removed Tomarket and Amazon's appstore from my mobile phone but kept the products on my tablet.  Thus, the removal satisfy my concerns over my privacy being extracted from my mobile phone.<br /><br />I would rather purchase apps free and clear of any conditions beyond software usage protection rights.<br /><br />The CONCERNS:<br />I do NOT want marketing and tracking ads targeted toward me without my explicit approval.  In lieu of my explicit approval, a sneaky legal privacy statement, which is, subject to change and without notification, indicates how your private information will be used.  If Amazon's appstore can find its way into my mobile phone, can hackers also find their way leveraging the appstore as a vehicle or trojan?  The mobile phone moves toward electronic payments, credit or debit cards etc., and accessing bank accounts.  What information may be leaving your device without your knowledge?

Amazon's appstore manages the DRM where some software may only work with Amazon appstore installed.  Further, Amazon provides a lengthy privacy protection statement (BS) where Amazon may obtain information from your device.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|Sunken Condos could have been a Steely Dan album. It's that good! To me, it's the best album from either Steely Dan, Fagen or Becker since Gaucho in 1980. I love that they have managed to re-create the sound and arrangements of their 70's masterpieces, but with modern high fidelity.<br /><br />I always missed that 'mellow' 70s sound on their newer productions, where bright snare drums and high-hats are taking up too much space in the mix. Both Two Agains nature and Everything Must Go had this \\"problem\\" and sounded too thin and sterile in my opinion. Morph the Cat was halfway there but didn't have the stellar songs of Sunken Condos.<br /><br />On Sunken Condos, EVERY song is great! The same goes for the production, arrangements and musicianship. I also love the frequent use of muted horns on this album. This definitely gives it a great 70s vibe.<br /><br />This is a triumphant return of Donald Fagen and I'm simply amazed that he was able to write such great songs this late in his career. I can't wait for the next album, which will hopefully be from Steely Dan! And tour please!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I chose to purchase Walking Dead Season 3 for my Kindle Fire because the Walking Dead is my favorite &#34;Zombie&#34; show on TV.  I have also purchased seasons 1 and 2.  With Amazon, they deliver the most recent episode to my Kindle Fire immediately after the episode has appeared on TV, and I can then watch it instantly.  The Walking Dead Season 3, as well as Seasons 1 and 2, are action filled.  I can't get enough of it!!!  The way the series is written allows you to really get involved with the characters and how the &#34;outbreak&#34; of the virus affects everyone in their lives.  It's a show of survival at its most primitive.  Each episode leaves you wanting more . . . . . . . . I would recommend the Walking Dead Season 3 (as well as Season 1 and 2) to anyone who loves a good action packed &#34;Zombie&#34; thriller.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Intriguing, compelling, informative and entertaining.  Gives the reader a new understanding of the complexities of the time politically and socially.  Most of the baby boomers understand little of how a psycotic lunatic could convince an entire country to embrace the concept of &#34;might makes right&#34; and send the world into war.  Follett brings an historical perspective that gives us a far better understanding of how social class divisions and the European and Russian ethnicities impacted the world, and in the process gives us the opportunity to consider the lessons we should have learned and maybe still have a chance to learn from.

B00007KQKM|4.0|\\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" was the naughty book that got passed around American junior high schools in the 1960's.  Little did we adolescents know that the real reasons the book was challenging and controversial had not to do with sex, but with class distinctions.<br /><br />D.H. Lawrence remains an author worthy of study because of his passionate examination of the dehumanization inflicted by class structures, as well as his provocative belief in the subversive power of sex.  \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" in some respects isn't that far removed from George Orwell's \\"1984\\", in that it posits sex and humanity as redemptive forces in the face of oppression.<br /><br />In this film version of \\"Lady Chatterley\\", director Ken Russell (who had earlier triumphed with his adaptation of Lawrence's \\"Women in Love\\") makes his (or Lawrence's) points without being too heavy-handed.  Scenes taking place in the rustic beauty of the Chatterley estate are nearly Edenic, with music supplied by Frederick Delius and other pastoralists.  (It's interesting that when Lady Chatterley embarks on the shaky ground of her affair with Mellors, the score changes to Gustav Holst's \\"The Planets\\" ).  When Russell shows the condition of the lower class miners, he leaches most of the color from the scenes to illustrate the dreary contrast of their lives.<br /><br />It's also instructive to see how deftly Russell/Lawrence reveals the psychology of Lady Chatterley's affair.  Lord Chatterley, physically debilitated, encourages his wife to have an affair in order be provided with an heir.  Chatterley eases the burden on his wife by hiring a nurse (\\"Mrs. Bolton\\"), who we gradually witness taking on the role of a surrogate wife.  Although Mrs. Bolton presents the appearance of being sympathetic to Lady Chatterley's dilemma (her confinement in a loveless marraige), Mrs. Bolton secretly covets the role of Mrs. Chatterley and dreams of replacing her.<br /><br />Lady Chatterley herself is an idealist, who as she gives herself over to Mellors the gamekeeper, gradually changes to a wanton sensualist.  She comes to see her relationship with Mellors as the fulfillment of love in a natural, unrestrained state.  But as a \\"liberated female\\", Lady Chatterley must make the decision to renounce her material and social standing.  Mellors pays a much heavier price for his transgression against class and propriety.<br /><br />At the heart of it is the belief in Darwinian superiority that Lord Chatterley utters, waging war (in full military regalia) on the lower class.  He berates Mellors as a \\"half-animal\\", and proclaims that \\"we are the bosses\\" that are vested with the power to order the slovenly lower class minions about.<br /><br />Unbelievably, nearly a century later, these ugly sentiments are still just beneath the surface of our current political strife.<br /><br />Kudos to the actors/performers in this movie--especially to the ballsy performance by a young Joely Richardson, who seems to have added some pounds in order to play the sensual \\"English Rose\\", Lady Chatterley.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Whenever I see North Korea on the news, I remember this book. I remember the accounts of the every-day lives, I remember the stories of the people and I remember the hunger, the despair and all the lives lost. I would recommend this book to everyone: it is an eye-opener about a country that is typically portrayed as a military state and through its leaders. This book shows you how people live and what they have had to live through.

B008NEMPTO|4.0|I was quite surprised that this book was selected to become a movie knowing what Speilberg had planned for a film about Lincoln.  But as one who loved the book, I wanted this to be a knock out cult status film.  What concerned me the most was that the ending was so altered from the book - the ending is what made the book.  So alas, I have the movie, loved the 3D effects (not as good as the Avengers - but - hey - look at the time difference!)  Read the book and watch the movie!  It is not a waste of your time.
B004GTLFNW|1.0|This book was beyond my level of fitness and thought the author was ego centric - meaning it was all about him. Hard to get into.
1401322336|5.0|First of all, let me state that this review is being written by my wife!!!  She loves the guy - his sense of humor - and says there's just about everything but the kitchen sink in this book! He's very down to earth, and believable, and she thinks his heart is in the right place when it comes to trying to get school lunches to be more nutritional. More power to him.
0679847367|5.0|I have two of these, one for my five year old and one for my one year old. Every year their teacher/babysitter writes a little note and this will be their high school graduation present. So since it must stay in good condition for that long, I am very glad for the hard case the book is in.
B007KAJG3K|2.0|This website is not rotten tomatoes.  If you want to review the movie, go to rotten tomatoes.  People who want to get upset about the seller, should review here.  End of story.  If you're happy with the seller, then don't get upset.  MY SELLER:  AMAZON.COM, LLC - inserted invalid ultraviolet codes.  When I received the blu ray discs (I bought 2.  1 as a christmas present), they were partially opened.  There were ultraviolet codes in them, but they don't work.  Instead there is an error when you enter them.  5001 code that says there is no title associated with the url and code to redeem.  I have since contacted their customer support.  I am a nerd and have never had this kind of problem with ultraviolet before.  Recently I have bought over 3 dozen movies and shows from amazon and their packaging and legality is questionable.  I think that they are partaking in illegal copies of movies and shows.  The things I have received have seemed very cheap and not run of the mill just out of the box discs and advertisements.  There is some serious fraud going on with amazon and their movie sales department.
B006JTIZGM|4.0|I have often found that the GoF book is dry even though the content is vital for all software engineers to be aware of.  The head first book really makes the patterns more understandable. I recommend this book to start to fully understand the most important patterns and have the GoF book around as a quick reference.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|John Locke knows how to 'get it done'. Lots of tips, and he seems to be a genuinely 'nice guy' (from what I can tell from just reading his book - haven't had the pleasure of meeting him in person!)  He's very organized, and totally deserves his success, IMHO. Love his Donovan Creed website too - well laid out. This book is a good, entertaining read. I shall now have to go and read some of his Donovan Creed books, as I bought THIS book solely to find out 'how to make it in the big leagues!'

B003R4ZMJU|5.0|First time when I heard/read about that new show i thought: oh no, not another stupid Teen-Show with beautiful girlie-models etc like \\"90210\\" and \\"Melrose Place 2.0\\" (I mean both new versions).<br />But then I met Holly Marie Combs in 2012 and she told me about so I was bit curious and thought I should give a chance. The first episode was slow? Maybe a little bit. And then... the big surprise came then after. Its: \\"90210\\" meets \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"Scream\\".<br /><br />Story: 4 girlfriens have lost the fifth girlfriend Allison who was murdered. By whom? And then.. suddenly, they got some kind of blackmailing, texts on their cell phones... sent by -A-. Maybe by Allison? She's still living? Where is she? Or its another person?<br /><br />Question about question. And \\"A\\" brings to the group a lot trouble. Aria, one of those girlfriends met a nice guy \\"Ezra\\" (Ian Harding) before the school is beginning. And then, in the first hour of the new school season: its her new teacher.<br /><br />The show as any interesting actors beyond of those 4 main-charaters: Holly Marie Combs (\\"Charmed\\"), Chad Lowe (\\"Melrose Place\\"), Laura Leighton (\\"Melrose Place), Roark Critchlow (\\"V\\").<br /><br />My mind: the show is interesting and the filmmakers (writers) give the characters enough time to expanding a relationship (Ezra/Aria) and not like in trivial/shallow show like \\"90210\\" / \\"Melrose Place 2.0\\". And yes - its breathless thrilling.<br /><br />DVD: picture quality is very good and also the sound. Contains any subtitles (english SDH).<br />The bonus-features: deleted scenes, short-documentaries.<br /><br />FAZIT: Thrilling and much better than I expected.

B004HW7JI8|5.0|DVD: Picture Quality is very good (also in the night/dark scenes) and also the sound is very good for a DVD.<br />Subtitles: yes: English SDH and any other languages.<br />Bonus features: 3 short documentaries + deleted scenes.<br /><br />The Show: A-mazing. After the last episode of season 1: \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (a nice reference to a movie with the same title \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (1943) with Gary Cooper) the body of Ian (Ryan Merryman) is gone.<br /><br />Is Ian death? Or still living? \\"A\\" is back. More lies and more surprises. You think it coulnd't be better after Season one?. No. Its better. Do have the relationship of Ezra/Aria a chance? Who know. Do we find out now who \\"A\\" is? Maybe.<br /><br />Again: the cast is great. Again: Holly Marie Combs, Laura Leighton and as guest: Annabeth Gish (grand-daughter of one of the biggest silent movie star: Lilian Gish), Andrea Parker (\\"Pretender\\", \\"Desperate Housewives\\").<br /><br />Also this season has a nice homage to a \\"famous\\" classic movie (\\"Psycho\\", \\"The Bad Seed\\").<br /><br />FAZIT: Watch it, its by far worth it!!!

0671015206|5.0|I have young people who work for me. Some of them already have habits of saving while some of them do not. If they have no habit of saving, I recommend &#34;The Richest Man in Babylon&#34;. If they have a saving habit, I recommend &#34;The Millionaire Next Door&#34;. This book will not reveal methods or secrets of investing. It will not unlock the method of hedging or options or tell you how Accredited Investors operate; however, it will lay down the principles of wealth management and sound investing that start the path to financial independence. Both of these books are neigh timeless. These two books are the truest personal finance primers available. I think that it is more prudent to aim for a savings rate of more than fifteen percent now, rather than ten percent, but the principles are the same as much as the exact numbers may be quibbled over.<br /><br />If you want to begin the journey to true financial independence, this is a wise place from which to begin your journey. This road map will not lead you astray.

B007ZZKWHY|3.0|Very disappointed.  The acting was fair at best.  The Germans do the best acting of all.  The special affects are there, but not enough of them.  The attack on the earth was done okay - but could have used more interaction along the lines of ID4 or the like.  A believable movie done that was okay to watch - once - but the unbelievable scenes somewhat ruin it.  I waited a long time for this movie and was let down.  Could have been a lot better with more CGI tossed in.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was amazing book and any one who is into fanatical book will love it. It is filled with adventure,romance, and even comedy.  :-)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this series, a very good read. Kept me sucked in the whole time, had me on the edge of my seat!
B000VIPJKM|5.0|It's hard not to have fun with this movie! I remember watching it once when I was a kid, but I didn't understand some of the content back then. Now that I'm in college, I have a better appreciation for it since it takes place at Harvard and discusses various law terminology and adult themes. If you watch this, you shouldn't think too critically of it. It's just for fun. It isn't supposed to be a masterpiece movie.<br /><br />Also, as my title mentions, Matthew Davis is the leading male that Reese Witherspoon's character tries to win back. If you're a fan of the Vampire Diaries like I am, then you might enjoy watching this film to see a young &#34;Alaric Saltzman.&#34; You will, however, learn to hate his character &#34;Warner.&#34;
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This author cannot write. Sure, she can describe sex scenes, but her constant repetition of &#34;clenches, grimaces, lips tightening, lip biting&#34; etc. gets on the reader's nerves after a while!  I haven't even finished it and wish I had never purchased it for my Kindle. A waste of time.....
B00A7CF1QY|2.0|The Bourne Legacy isn't a bad movie and it is worth watching but it lacks the typical Bourne action that made the first two excellent movies.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It is a good read if you're not looking for something very clever. It's an easy read, although some parts are repetative and predictable. I recommend this book overall for an easy read.
B000020617|5.0|This is a gift for someone for Christmas. The CD came quickly and was packaged great. Looking forward to giving this as a gift this year.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun and easy way to kill time.  easy to navigate. wish there were more card types but still a great app
B005LAIGN2|3.0|It was a good story , but hollow wood creations had to over write the true story.  Todays teenagers and 20 year olds would go along with the story
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this series, a very good read. Kept me sucked in the whole time, had me on the edge of my seat!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've always liked John Grisham's novels, but this one is my very favorite!  I can hardly put it down!  Truly a great book!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I REALLY LIKE BAD PIGGIES A LOT.  I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME.  I LIKE THE PART WHERE YOU MAKE THINGS LIKE THE CARS AND AIRPLANES.  I'M FOUR YEARS OLD AND THIS IS A GOOD GAME FOR KIDS.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Great back pack bag many pockets and extra's hidden pockets with in the entire back pack side holders etc wow
B00127RAJY|4.0|The work out if about 25-30 minutes and it kicks your butt!! By the end you are sweating, panting and your endorphins have kicked in and you feel great! Great buy, especially if you cant afford or don't have time to go to a gym.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Great actors and actresses, real life situations, made me laugh and cry. Great movie! I recommend it! Especially if you are a mother to be.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Couldn't put it down  - stayed up into the wee hours to finish this book.  Wow! Keep them coming for all Vince Flynn fans.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Gets better and better...really great storyline.  It's interesting because it feels like something that could really happen.  Can't wait for the next season and the next and the next.
0316227706|5.0|Brought this book as a gift. Its a beautiful book. The pictures a so cute. If you like dogs you will love this book!!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Love this version....watched it 2x in one week.<br />I've seen the other versions, but this one is far superior. Mia, Michael, and Judy Dench are amazing, and this will stay in my library next to Pride and Predjudice (Colin Firth) and Sense and Sensibility (Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ready for book number 2 and the movie.  Not the ending I was expecting for this book but it does leave you wanting to start book 2.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love the way this story has built up.  I love the main character Jax, great actor, great writing...kudos to Kurt Sutter
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|May I start by saying I take my hat off to this great author. The story is so on every girl fantasy that even I who's over 30 can sigh and say yep I always wanted a bad boy even when in real life is not always pink. That said the book captivates you from the beginning when Abby get her sweater splattered with blood, from there on your in for an emotional ride of ups and downs. You fall for the not so perfect Travis and his possessive loove for Abby. There both students in the same college,he fights on the down low if you know what I mean(not legal) to cover rent and other expenses  but for me it really was a release for his anger inside of him. Abby she's the girl who moved far away from home to start over and forget where she came from and most importantly who she came from. She doesn't want to fall for Travis because his trouble and thats exactly what she trying to leave behind. Its a beautiful disaster romance that will make you sigh and sad when it ends.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Hell's to the yeah!!  ;)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The journey is the point of this wonderful tale and I feel my life is enriched in the reading.  You completely enter the life of this wretched boy who has watched the ship carrying he and his family to a new world.....disappear before his eyes.  He carries on because he must and in doing so teaches us much about our choices, our courage and ourselves.  The tiger (his enemy) becomes his sole companion and they lean on and learn from each other in a symbiotic relationship we come to respect and admire.  I love the way Yann Martel superseded the actual shipwreck with the former life of the boy, his unique thought processes and the customs and mores of his family and  culture. He indeed did a masterful job.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|kill bill is one of that classics that everyone should have, uma thurman is an epic actress and beauty one and tarantino as always make nice movies and bizarries ones hahaha xD
B008PNBU30|5.0|Three Days Grace does it again! Love this album and this Band. Like all of their albums i cannot stop listening to it :)
B004OZZ624|3.0|This was an enjoyable movie. It is definitely worth a watch. Maybe a little long, but otherwise a good movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I can't even lie. The book started off VERY slow. A lot of religious talk, which I found pretty interesting although I already knew most of it from taking a hindu religion course in college. Also a lot of animal/zoo filler. Once he gets on the ocean/boat the story gets pretty interesting. Sometimes I kind of got the \\"castaway\\" (Tom Hanks movie) vibe from Yann. There was some dry parts but they're out weighted by the intense parts.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars basically because this twisting conclusion was pretty damn EPIC
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|This movie promotes teenage rebellion, sorcery, and witchcraft.<br />I was very displeased with the whole of this movie and would not recommend it to anyone
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|Once the music starts it takes me back to my old hometown, when I was listening to music with my parents
B0091LS07E|1.0|Not worth the wait. Didn't impress me at all. I returned it.. Have been a huge fan for years but this was not her best to me.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Someone is finally telling Grimms fairy tale the way they were written. The brothers Grimm had some sick minds but the movies come out very entertaining and far from the Disney telling. I have the Disney version which I loved as a child but as an adult I know better tham to believe in fairy tales but this one I keep from the kids. Loved Charlize as the evil witch and the huntsman islike Austraila answer to Brad Pitt. Great movie!
0307592731|3.0|I really wanted to like this book because Oprah rarely steers me wrong...and it was OK. But it wasn't as exciting or uplifting as I'd hoped.
B0083H6AQA|3.0|He is great to watch He did a great job acting but the movie is just not very good it is missing alot to tie it together
0061186473|5.0|Pros is that it was easy to pick up and put down.<br />Cons is that some stories you just wanted to skip.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys anything from Gaiman.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|My grandaughter loves Tull, who wouldn't? I took her to see him October 4th and she actually cried with joy. He's getting up there in age but he finds a way to entertain in a special way, the ultimate entertainer. I bought this so she could see him the way I used to back then. She just couldn't get over him. Best birthday she ever had! Love this man!
1451648537|5.0|Great read. Steve Jobs was a genius. A flawed genius but a genius none the less. His story is every bit as crazy and inspirational as you can expect from a rags to riches story like this. I highly recommend this book, even if you aren't even into technology. Fascinating read...
B003L77G6A|4.0|So relaxing after long work day to just laugh at these funny guys and Penny  I have all the seasons  terrific purchase!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|It is a very slow movie. I would say this is for the over 50 and married crowd. Not what I expected from the two actors at all.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I am highly accident prone and I seem to always have a habit of dropping things. The more expensive they are, the more they fall... But the second I put this case on my Kindle I breathed a sigh of relief. It just feels solid and sturdy and completely me-proof. It also has some great features, such as being able to stand in multiple directions/levels. I have no reservations that this was money well-spent.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Love the CD just wish there were more songs on it. Would probably buy more of Pentatonix' music in the future.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I bought for a Xmas gift got it right away in great shape  I hear this one is good I guess I have to borrow it
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is really something, and I rarely praise books to this extent, but in the case of this book, I really wanted to let people know how good it is.  Here is a portrait of a difficult marriage.  Husband Nick and wife Amy are in a tough spot in their lives, having lost writing jobs as a result of the \\"economic downturn.\\" A move from Manhattan to Carthage, Missouri, changes their relaxed, social dynamic lives into daily struggle.  Though that doesn't sound all that interesting as a plot, trust me, Flynn uses the pressure to put her characters through stress that would cripple a normal person.  Told in alternating viewpoints, I felt compelled to turn the pages, to try to figure out who was telling the truth.  Plotting is exquisite.  Voice is masterful.  Here is a story with no false moves, not an extra word or comma, and blindsides the reader never sees coming.  I really hated for it to end.  This book held my attention the same way The Talented Mr. Ripley did, and I feel secure putting it into that category.  It would (will?) make a great film.  It feels as if it has staying power beyond \\"good book\\" into classic.  If you love mysteries, are not all that fond of gore (like me), and you want a riveting story that will keep you surprised and enthralled, read this book.  Now that I've finished it, I plan to read her other two books immediately.  Terrific writer, talented in a way that produces timeless classics.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Great music.  You get to hear the whole song instead of pieces.  Great mixture of genres.  Reminds you of the scenes in the movie.
B003QSMC18|5.0|I love this movie because it was heart warming and funny.  I gave it 5 stars for the cost and ease of rent through Amazon.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am certain that her success with the Harry Potter series gave her first adult novel a major boost.  I was disappointed in the choice of &#34;bad&#34; language and I did not see the humor at all.
0979019710|5.0|If you ever needed a blueprint, a template, path to mastery, well after 11 months of using the Miracle Morning myself, I can honestly say this process has truly changed my life. I was never a morning person. In fact, I was burnt out and needed a change. The Miracle Morning came into my life at the right timeI have re-kindled the passion for my career, started 2 companies, paid off $12k in debt, lost 15 pounds, developed new friendships, strategic partnerships...Oh, and I LOVE my mornings!!! Thanks Hal for an AMAZING book! If you're on the fence about buying this book?...get the book...NOT splinters!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|No big names in the cast, but very talented, and may soon be.  Special effects, sets, and props are awesome.  An absolute must for a HALO fan.  Is a prequel to the game, so no spoilers to 4.
B005HPQ7IW|3.0|Jean Renoir's first film in France since La Regle du Jeu had been met with almost unanimous hostility by critics and public alike 16 years earlier, French Cancan was a very deliberate attempt to reconnect with a French audience with a populist subject matter. As added security he cast Jean Gabin in the lead, though the results fall a long way short of their previous pre-war collaborations. Based loosely on the creation of the Moulin Rouge nightclub in Paris, offering `the illusion of the high life for modest purses,' and the romantic entanglements of financially insecure and terminally unfaithful impresario Jean Gabin and his latest discovery Francois Arnaul, who is pursued by a prince and a baker's boy but really wants Gabin, it's the sort of soufflé that should be a lot of fun. That it never really fulfils that promise isn't for want of trying: Renoir recreates la Belle Epoque with the kind of colours his father would have used and fills the supporting cast with colourful characters from all stratas of French society (a very young Michel Piccoli among them), and even casts veteran performers who graced the real Moulin Rouge like Edith Piaf, Patachou, Andre Claveau and Jean Raymond in cameos, but the script doesn't really do much with the material or the characters.<br /><br />At times it's hard to escape the feeling that Renoir wasn't really the right director for the film - while not exactly heavy-handed, doesn't seem to have the lightness of touch this sort of thing needs. More surprisingly his use of the camera is surprisingly unadventurous and distinctly lacking in joie de vivre in the climactic musical number, much of which looks like it was shot from the cheap seats to make sure he gets everyone in the frame, proscenium arch style - not entirely out of place for a backstage story, but a rather disinterested approach you doubt the pre-war Renoir would have made.<br /><br />There are hints of the old Renoir in its acceptance of the various characters faults -\\"No better, no worse, just different,\\" as Giani Esposito's suicidal Prince admits - and in the casual merry-go-round of relationships and alliances and the importance of appearances (because \\"Appearances are all that can save us\\"), but this is neither deep enough nor superficially enjoyable enough to offer more than the odd passing pleasure as it inoffensively puts its characters through their paces in a somewhat workmanlike fashion. Not bad, just not nearly as good as its pedigree almost seems to demand it should be.<br /><br />The BFI's Region B-locked UK Blu-ray/DVD combo benefits greatly from the recent restoration of the film, and is a noticeable improvement on the Criterion DVD. None of the extras from that earlier release - TV interview with Renoir, introduction by Peter Bogdanovich, new interview with production designer Max Doury and stills gallery - have been carried over, though there's a good selection of new ones carried over from the French Blu-ray release, but given the English subtitles that version lacked: a 57-minute documentary on the making of the film, a featurette on he restoration and a booklet (but not the additional 51 minute documentary on Renoir's legacy or the original trailer from the French release). As with the Criterion release, this is the uncut French version of the film rather than the heavily censored US release.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great Grisham novel--always a twist at the end.  Read it when you have spare time, because you won't be able to put it down until you're finished.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The beginning was fascinating as the Pi discovered the value behind three religions.  Then the author lost me on the ocean.  Too many days, too much detail about ropes, fish, etc.  Rather strange with the Merrcats, the island, the final interview.
B00005JKG5|4.0|Good moive to watch with very good value. Missed seeing when it came out. happy to buy the DVD and enjoy
B0038AL7M4|4.0|NB - As is their wont, Amazon have unhelpfully bundled the reviews for the various different releases and formats of this film together. This review refers to Arrow's UK Blu-ray release.<br /><br />In the Sixties it seemed you could hardly move for Continental `portmanteau' films - collections of short films by major directors sharing a common theme like Paris Vu Par, Ro.Go.Pa.G or Love at Twenty, which offered marketable but cost-effective international co-production possibilities that could attract big stars for a week or two's work. Spirits of the Dead aka Histoires Extraordinaires was one of the more intriguing ones, offering three of Edgar Allan Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination (one of the film's many alternate titles) directed by Roger Vadim, Louis Malle and Federico Fellini with an all-star cast. Despite being similarly less than faithful to their source, the result is a world away from Roger Corman's remarkable run of Sixties Poe films with Vincent Price (and might have been even more different had original co-directors Orson Welles and Luis Bunuel stayed aboard), though that didn't stop the US distributors adding an introductory voice over by Price to forge a link in audience's minds. Critics weren't kind to the first two stories, alternately hating or being bored by them, but absolutely loved Fellini's, and that acclaim has cast a pall over the rest of the film ever since.<br /><br />Despite the general disdain meted out to it, Vadim's take on Metzengerstein is surprisingly successful on its own terms. The then-Mrs Vadim, Jane Fonda, stars as a perverted and sadistic countess who, when her cousin (Peter Fonda) spurns her advances, burns his stables for revenge only to inadvertently burn him as well and unleash a black stallion that no-one else can approach and with which she becomes ever more fatally obsessed. Neither Fonda is exactly taxed in the acting department, Peter particularly monolithic and wooden, but Jane at least, still in her bimbo days,is suited well enough for her part that it's less of a problem in her case. The opening but far from explicit depravities, with Jane wearing even more outrageous costumes than Barbarella as she has her wicked way with men and women alike, gradually gives way to a convincingly dreamlike dread that may not actually chill but does summon up the spirit of Poe in its restless way, with Claude Renoir's cinematography of burning buildings and thick black smoke blocking out the sunset heralding an increasing feeling of a pending storm about to break. It's the kind of thing that'll either lull you along with it or bore you into hitting the fast forward button, but it does create an atmosphere.<br /><br />Louis Malle's involvement was purely pragmatic: unable to raise the backing for Le Souffle au Coeur/Murmur of the Heart after both Viva Maria! and The Thief of Paris failed to set the box-office on fire, William Wilson with Alain Delon and Brigitte Bardot probably seemed like a good way to raise his profile without taking all the blame if this one flopped as well. He never made any secret that it was work for hire rather than a personal piece, and it shows in a solid but uninspired bit of storytelling that runs efficiently through the plot without ever really conjuring up much in the way of atmosphere or the growing paranoia the tale demands. Even the perversion and sadism is fairly matter of fact, though that sometimes works in the episode's favour as Alain Delon's thoroughly nasty sociopath casually bullies and debauches his way through boarding school, medical college and the army - his idea of bullying involving pits of rats and his idea of debauchery involving scalpels and a whip - only to be constantly plagued by a double with the same name who spoils his fun and destroys his self-confidence until he can bear it no more. It's an elegant production, but, like its blithely monstrous protagonist, it lacks character.<br /><br />The third story was originally to have beena composite of The Masque of the Red Death and The Cask of Amontillado directed by Orson Welles, but when that fell through Federico Fellini, heavily in debt after a science fiction film collapsed in pre-production, filled the gap with his very loose adaptation of Never Bet the Devil Your Head as Toby Dammit, and took what critical praise was going. When the film was subsequently restored and screened as a solo short, it was proclaimed as a lost masterpiece. It's not, but it is a remarkably stylish fever dream - or rather nightmare - that could only possibly have been directed by Fellini<br /><br />Terence Stamp is the self-indulgent and obnoxious movie star jetted into Rome to make the first Catholic Western, haunted by the image of a malignantly grinning child playing with a white ball and consumed by pain and pathetic self-loathing which he expresses with a variety of infantile expressions caught somewhere between a grimace and silent laughing at a dirty word as if never knowing whether to laugh or scream. He's every untalented, selfish, immature and self-destructive egotist who thinks living the rock'n'roll lifestyle and behaving badly is their full time day-and-night job rolled into one manic-depressive bundle of nerves. He knows he's squandered his talent and that he's not just impossible to work with but impossible for even him to stand anymore. He's beyond redemption and working his way down to damnation one infernal circle at a time, from the surreally sun-bleached airport arrivals lounge to a grotesque awards ceremony before driving the new Ferrari that's his only reason for making the film straight into the mouth of Hell. And Fellini films it all from right inside his fevered head as his disorientation at finding himself the centre of attention in an increasingly nightmarishly strange world is mirrored in a visual and editing style that's like you've been spun around the room despite having a drunken headache and can't make much sense out of what's aroundyou.<br /><br />It's easily the trippiest and most visually striking of the three, with Giuseppe Rottuno's vividly stylised photography far more ambitious than anything his two predecessors in the film cooked up, while Nino Rota's signature Fellini sound stamps the master's signature all over the proceedings. It's an exercise in excess and atmosphere that creates a very Felliniesque phantasmagoria that may not be something you'll hold close to your heart but certainly leaves your senses assaulted in a way the other two episodes don't.<br /><br />Arrow's UK Blu-ray release is a bit problematic - at once a clean and pin-sharp restoration but at times looking too clean, as if it's had some of the sin scrubbed out of it and the brightness boosted. This is particularly noticeable in the first story that looks far more atmospheric in the unrestored French version also included on the disc, which shows some signs of color fading but at least looks like it's been graded with an eye for the decadence of the story. No such problems with the other two, though the multi-lingual soundtrack curiously doesn't include Terence stamp's opening narration in English but uses an Italian voice-over artist instead before reverting to Stamp's voice for the remainder. The English dub track is also included on the restored version. Extras are a bit lighter than the packaging makes it seem - the international trailer and Vincent Price's voice-over narration from US version, though the initial copies also came with an impressive 60-page book reprinting the original Poe stories.
B002CIMKHO|5.0|Missed this one when it first came out few years ago and was flipping through<br />Amazon when I came across it. Glad we decided to watch it because it is another<br />great movie for Eastwood's director/actor belt. The story is really good and the cast does an excellent job.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|If you like dance and can get past the really bad script and acting, it's great fun and there are some wonderful dance sequences. Very creative - just skip past the melodrama
B002GJU54E|1.0|perhaps the worst book i've read in years.  at one point the main character is pumping gas outside atlantic city.  um, you know you don't pump your own gas in new jersey, don't you?  juvenile mistakes like that everywhere.  they go into the pine barrens.  they come out of the pine barrens.  they go back in.  they come back out.  again and again.  not much else happening.  sloppily constructed.  poorly developed characters.  very disappointing.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Very funny movie. Alot of adult content, so not one for the kids. Channing Tatum is also always fun to look at!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because it held my interest and was a touching story.  I very much enjoyed it being written from the perspective of the dog, Enzo.  Loved him!  Such a loyal creature.  I would recommend this book to all animal lovers.
B0099G3I96|2.0|I know bands change overtime, but this is just hard to listen to.  I bought it and only listened to it once.  Guess I want some faster rock/reggae style from these guys.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Great present to the Hunger game tributes(Fans).It's a collectible for those fans so buy them for any fan and you will not regret it.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|These movies are so cute and funny! one of my favorite series. I cant wait for more to come out,
B0011MRKHW|3.0|They wan me to say more than,&#34;it's okay&#34; but I am at a loss to add more. Maybe the acting was a bit overdone.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Came in time was what I expected one of my favorite Xmas movies and we are enjoying , I would recommend buying from this company
B000005DQQ|4.0|Great album but where are the mp3 downloads? Each track has a unique flow. Reminds me a free jam jazz, but with samples.
B006AN78XS|5.0|A truly magical movie. Very Wood Allen. The central argument is about nostalgia. Is it better to live in the present or dream  about the past?
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I found it to be very helpful in hearing the TV.  I can use it for two nights before I have to recharge.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have only read two books by this author but I have enjoyed them both a great deal. The sign of a good book is when I turn off the TV and read the book.
B005I547ZG|4.0|... also if the first two stories of this collection seem to be written as some kind of first or max second draft, to be - maybe - elaborated later...<br /><br />I like Michael Connelly and the way he writes and I love Harry Bosch, and so I would buy also a shopping list of those two long-time friends of mine.<br />But this time, because of some missing pieces, only a 4-star rating.<br /><br />In SUICIDE RUN I had the feeling that the story came absolutely to an much too abrupt end...<br />There was far more potential in the story than has been utilised by the author. Hollywood, a young, very beautiful \\"Marylin Monroe\\" - called like that because of the way she - apperently - chose her exit out, the search for similar cases - there should have been more. But it's an easy read and got my interest.<br /><br />The second one CIELO AZUL is the one that has a more of humaneness inside than the usual crime short stories...<br />Harry Bosch drives up to St. Quentin to ask a killer awaiting to meet the Needle ONE question - only that a killer is always a killer for some reason. And that a man of his kind hasn't one shred of humanity left in his flesh, blood and bones. A very gripping but sad, sad read.<br /><br />The third story is the longest of the three and also the most elaborated. In ONE DOLLAR JACKPOT Harry Bosch has to find the killer of a beautiful poker player, shot dead without even register that fact. And there will be our hero Harry who has learned a trick or two from his now estranged ex-wife - and that will nail a killer for good!<br /><br />I am not too angry about the excerpt of [[ASIN:0446556696 The Drop (A Harry Bosch Novel)]], I have read it and the latest [[ASIN:0316069434 The Black Box (A Harry Bosch Novel)]], too. Best Harry-Bosch reads!!!<br /><br />Try also the collection [[ASIN:B005SDPHM0 Angle of Investigation]] - a full 5-star read!

B0070Y46UY|2.0|When i read this book for summer reading in high school i was shocked by the graphic nature of the violence portrayed while pi is marooned on a life boat with several animals, or at least sveral animals for a time being. The book goes into such detail over the deaths over these animals i was sickened for the remainder of the book and could not appreciate the underlying meanings. However, if You take away those chapters you do have a decent book on your hands. I reccomend you skip those chapters when you come across them as they truly are sickening. And this is coming from a guy whose favorite show is the walking dead...
B005COO1X6|2.0|I didn't realize the book was a short story when I purchased it, and I am not a fan of his short stories.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I had only heard a few songs on the album before I decided to buy it. I am glad I did. It is simple, yet beautiful. I've listened to it repeatedly foe about a week now. One of the best albums I've bought all year!

B003U51G4G|2.0|I'm late to this party and just recently started watching Lost on Amazon.  Season 1 was GREAT!  Season 2 became a boring soap-opera.  By the time I was done watching season 2 I honestly didn't care if all of the characters died, and actually hoped they did.<br /><br />Note to writers--  piling on multiple layers of confusion into your screenplays is not storytelling.  Even the actors look bored reading your 500+ subplots and back-stories.<br /><br />I started to watch the first episode of season 3 with hopes it would get better, but after ten minutes I was rooting for Jack to go on a hunger-strike and die on camera.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I had to wait ages for the second book.  I decided not to read it when it came out since it was so long in the publishing that I felt I would have forgotten the beginning of the story, however I broke down and got the book on my Kindle.  I expected it to be (frankly) a disappointment but it was as if the writer continued the writing and story exactly where he left off book one.  I got absorbed again.  When a book is this long, I expect that some parts of it are going to be rubbish.  This is not the case.  Now I have to wait for the next one.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|Great silly movie!  Perfect for kids and grownups!  more words to describe how wonderful this movie is. A++ watch it!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I like watching Tom Hardy puch people in the face.  Also, female nudity is generally appreciated as well.  Worth watching.
B0058VW36U|3.0|It wasn't awful but a bit of a bore after playing a couple of times.  The only thing I really liked was the cute voice that says &#34;awww&#34; when the little cutie doesn't get to eat the candy.  That's adorable.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|it arrived on time and was packaged well, hoping that is will be received well....and I would love to have my own copy
B0000501C3|5.0|This is a superb anthology of the Best of Lully, beautifully played and interpreted. 'Plus j'observe ces leius' from 'Armide' with solo violin by Florian Deuter, is one of the most moving pieces of music I have ever heard, ever. I can listen to this CD over and over in the same day without tiring of it. Bravo Reinhard Goebel!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I need more Angry Birds - I am addicted.  The Star Wars version is very well done.  Great Graphics.  I am stumped about getting those golden thingies - it's driving me mad trying to figure out how to get at them!

B009VB97EY|3.0|Girlfriend's choice (Obviously)..  Wasn't a great cinematic experience but an entertaining watch.  Movie is obviously eye candy for the femal audience so from that perspective it does its job.  Not really for me but not aweful.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I was only able to print the Test Page with this app.  Documents and e-mail messages would not work.  I ended up deleting it.  I am willing to pay $12.95 for the PrintShare Mobile Print app, but I want to make sure that works before making the investment.  Someone let me know if you have used the PrintShare Mobile Print app with the new Kindle Fire HD successfully.  I have a fairly new Epson Workforce 645 printer so that is not the problem.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|It is rare to see so many action adventure stars in one movie.  Of  couse the basic plots are always far fetched but that isn't why you watch those kind of movies.  Long on action and no shortages of amunitions or exposives as well as a lot of dead bad guys makes it anything but a sleeper. Worth the prce and entertaing too.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great end to a fantastic trilogy.  The production is top notch and a fitting end to this great Nolan trilogy.  I was hoping the movie would be in 3D but that has nothing to do with this Bluray release.  Amazon had a great price to go along with the release.<br /><br />My one complaint was that this did not have many extra features but a minor gripe.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I love this book and think its great. BUT there is a mayjor problem. About half way through the book it freezes and tells me that its not responding. I noticed there was an update so I placed that on my kindle fire but it only let my read a couple pages further before freezing.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|If you liked the two other MIB movies then this one won't diappoint you.  there some exelent performances by some of the actors doing one of the other actors in their earlier years.  worth checking out and is a winner for the price you pay through the Amazon link.  My cable company charges more and still doesn't get newer movies as fast as Amaozon.  So pull up a coach, grab a snack, and enjoy....away from the maddening crowds.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Come on people Minecraft in your pocket! Tons of fun packed in a small package, it is a bit limited compared to its big brother on the computer but still tons of fun. Can't wait for more updates for more to build and do. Make sure you have some real estate on the screen as it is quite hard to play on a small screen.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|kids love the story line about sisters meeting for the first time along with the colorful scenes.  The plot kept them interested to watch the whole movie.  Glad they enjoyed it since the requested this when they heard it was available.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|I don't mind mindless violence, but the whole thing was mindless.  Too much of everything.  Nobody worth rooting for.  The guys were cute, but worthless.  The girl cute, but worthless.  I stopped it several times to do other things.  And all you could say for it is that it showed what the Mexican Cartles are doing now as we speak. Savage animals who do anything for money.  To be specific, it's about two guys who grow exceptional pot and share the same girlfriend.  The Mexican cartels want to learn how to grow the exceptional pot and kidnap the girl friend. The rest is disjointed crap about getting her back.  Two scenes were good.  That was it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|this book is on the best seller list, but I did not like it. Did not like the fowl language and hated the ending.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I didn't realize how large this pool actually was. That makes it difficult to dump the water out after use because there does not seem to be a valve at the bottom. Other than that, my 1yr old loves it. Sometime, we just fill in the enclosed portion and he has just as much fun in there.
067144901X|4.0|I like that the book goes over animal sounds and is a bit silly (pigs saying la la la!)  My son is slightly interested in it and likes turning the pages more than anything right now.  I think it's good to read to children, no matter how young, but I think 2 and up would get the most enjoyment out of this book.

0385344333|1.0|If this is the best that Lee Child can do, maybe it's time to end the series.  The next novel should be a one page ebook that reads: &#34; an unknown assailant put a bullet in Jacks head and he died alone&#34; ...The end.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Having enjoyed the film The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I began reading the trilogy.  The first book was spectacular and the second one was equally spectacular.  Just when you think you know what is going on in the story, another curve is thrown in.  The book will keep you on the edge of you seat, so you won't want to put it down.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|this game is great when it works properly. It freezes very frequently though. I thought maybe it was a fluke so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it did the same thing.
B008PSPNFG|5.0|first time i heard of this guy, was 2 months ago when he was playing on a live performance show on cable TV never heard of him before that. i kept thinking how some of his music reminded me of a style that Frank Zappa used to play, i though  hmmm new guy in the block... then he mentioned at the end how it was the 30th anniversary of when he started a tour  playing with Frank...  my son knew this guy and he is 18, so now i see he is actually a prolific artist  i had no idea existed until recently.<br />  Great stuff a few i like more than the others, but it is like a fusion rock with a blend of style and sound that is pleasing and adventurous!!<br /><br /> ROCK ON!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the game is enjoyable and easy to learn.  I haven't encountered a bug yet which I appreciate.  It's a quick,<br /> fun diversion.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. Wish I would have loaded it sooner. Would have been nice to make this 10 words not 20.
B0086700CM|4.0|i wouldnt suggest using it when connected to the internet though, it lags. the only way it wont lag if youre connected is if youre with the amazon game circle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of those books that make you feel so attached to the characters that you miss them when it's over. I find myself wanting to re-read it to reconnect with them. This is a wonderful book- not at all what I expected from a book about a bunch of kids with cancer. The characters, the storyline, and the writing are terrific. I laughed. I cried. I loved every bit of it.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Good movie without the wait in line at the rental store or theater.  Decent plot with amazing action sequence and special effects to boot.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Never thought I'd get into a series about zombies. The writing and actors are suberb. Love it.  I'm. Just sad I have to wait until February for the second installment.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|This offers a different view of history. Loved the characters and the story. I couldn't put it down towards the end.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|As soon I started to read this book I found that I could not stop until I was done. I purchase this book thinking it was probably going to be more for my twelve year old than a 30 year old like me but I was totally captivated by Thor's character. Thor is someone who is courageous and knows he wants to be a somebody in life and not only dreams but he actually goes out there and proves he can do it. Can't wait to find out how Thor's character will develops into the hero I know he will become. Please Ms. Rice don't take to long to write the next book, I love all your work.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was actually my first Stephen King book I have read.  It was written very well, and kept my attention.  I can't say I'm a big reader, but this book gave me not only something to look forward to reading in my down time, but I also finished it in a couple weeks!  The story line was entertaining for multiple reasons.  It had the perfect balance of suspense, love, comedy, and all story lines came &#34;full circle&#34; by the end of the book, which I always appreciate in a good book.  There were no loose ends.  I have to say when I was finished this book I wished that there was a part two so I could keep reading about the character's lives!  I hope you do purchase this book so you get to experience this story.
B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|The Mini-builds inside are almost no specialized pieces.  The few minifigs that you receive don't come with accessories.  Because it's a licensed product, you pay extra for less.  Not worth it.  Buy individual minifigs with a starwars theme and get a better value.
B004U8ZH8S|1.0|I rented this movie so my grandchildren could watch it on my Kindle HD while we were flying to Hawaii.  Once we got in the air we were unable to watch it because we had not Internet coverage.  When we got home and tryed to watch it, we were required to re-rent it or buy it.  I'll never rent movies again from Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well chosen actors, willingness to kill off favored characters to maintain a realistic story line, and progressive societal development and social clashes ----- all make for a great story!
B009LRE040|3.0|As much as I had hoped and prayed that The Dark Knight Rises was going to be the \\"bomb\\" ...I was terribly wrong! First, the story was all over the place, certain events that took place weren't believable, the very strong storytelling which made the first two films so good, because they carried a sense of realism, a realism that made you believe that what was happening was real, or could happen. For instance; Bruce Wayne, according to the comic book, is suppose to be a man past his prime. They attempted to exemplify this in the film, I suppose that's what the few gray strands found on Bruce Wayne's head was about? Whatever! Also, Batman suffers a back injury that left him unable to stand, how is it he was able to have his back \\"repaired\\", afterwards, do a few sit-ups and push-ups, and then all of a sudden he climbs out of a possibly 50ft. pit, and now he's ready to get back into the fight? Whatever! The entire story was all over the place, the story/movie felt crammed, as if it should have been cut into two films like a Part I & II (like the comic book-duhh!).<br /> After I had watched the movie, I began thinking to myself, \\"is this it, tell me this isn't it!\\" I felt let down by the movie. I'm not implying that the movie is horrible, but for it to be that last one, the director and producers went out on a soft note. I don't care to watch the movie again as I love watching the first two, I don't want to buy it on Blueray, I don't even care to watch it if it just so happens to be on my cable lineup for the evening. The bottom line is this, there isn't anything spectacular about this latest Batman film. So, whenever I decide to watch Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight in succession, I believe that I will complete the series with watching the anime, The Dark Knight Returns: Part I, and experience a much better ending to my beloved Batman franchise.
B005DOKK7Q|3.0|I like the case but it did not fit my new Kindle HD for which it was ordered.  When I went back to check the order I saw in small print that it did not fit the Kindle HD.  I will use it for my old Kindle.

B006TVQTHW|4.0|great deal more case here than with the Antec one.  it works great and I don't have any problems with the quality.<br /><br />The fans have high and low for the back and top.  The case has a great design with the harddrives easily accessible with their orientation.  It was quite a stretch to get the second motherboard power up near the top from the bottom with a cooler master PSU.  it worked but dang it was tight.<br /><br />The fan filter is so much nicer on this case than the Antec one. it is very easy to push in and out. This is the filter for the PSU that is at the bottom of the case.<br /><br />there were some features that I like about this case but I still prefer the Antec One.

Know about the movie was not long or too short perfect run time it did not overwhelm us with too many characters story was as great as the SFX great ending to a trilogy. hoping the nolan reconsiders not directing another batman movie and if they make a justice league movie he directs it
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is great, but my multiplayer doesn't work. It just needs some more feautures and the game would be better. And the sky and lighting could use work.

I have one for myself and gave 1 as a gift.
B007V65R54|4.0|In the 70's, I actually taught Social Statistics in a minor state university.  The only thing I knew then was Fisher's &#34;Frequentism&#34;. I retained interest in the subject long after leaving academic life.  This incisive exposition has taught me concepts I should have known long ago.  Chapter 8--Bayes Theorem--introduces the interested student to a controversial idea now becoming accepted.  The author writes in a personal style with frequent anecdotes.  For example, he briefly played&#34;Texas-Hold-em&#34; professionally. Despite that, and whatever the author implies, this book is aimed at an audience with a college-level understanding of statistics, mathematics, and risk-theory. No doubt, it will incite heated replies.  I suspect that this is the author's intention.
B00466HNHM|4.0|Kevin at his best, Whitney being herself, great songs, at $7.99 I could not beat the price worth owning at that price.

B000EYK4KI|1.0|This movie is billed as a romantic comedy action film. It's not romantic, it's not funny, and if action means gratuitous violence, then it has that. One of the worst pieces films I have ever seen.<br /><br />It probably goes without saying, but neither Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie can actually act. If spouting your lines in an expressionless monotone is acting, then anyone can be an actor nowadays.<br /><br />Nothing in the movie is plausible and if this film doesn't insult your intelligence, then you don't have any. My wife and I turned it off about 3/4 of the way into the movie because we just didn't care what happens to the two main characters. Hopefully, they are killed off.
B0058YPL66|4.0|I got this as a gift for a friend who didn't have the time to follow the show. I got it for myself on Blu-Ray
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a glorious book.  Well written and held the interest from page one to the end. Although it is a Very sad book about the awfulness of orphanages in the 1900's. the characters are well thought out and displayed in such a way they can be clearly envisioned by the reader.  If I could have given it higher than a five star I would have done so. I would like to read more like it.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I heard everyone talking about how great this show was and then in 2011 it was on sale for 9.99 per season, I said well if I don't like it I can give it away as a christmas gift as I had bought all 3 seasons at the time. By thr forth episode I was hooked, then found myself watching whole seasons in 2 to 3 days (while working a 11 hour a day job) great show just finished season 5 and I do watch this when it's on AMC, but there's nothing like Blu-Ray and no commericals.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This series by George RR Martin is one of the best fantasy series I have read in a long time. He has a compelling writing style, and his decision to write about dynasties instead of a certain group of heroes makes this much more interesting than the standard fantasy plot. His characters feel real, the descriptions of their surroundings are rich enough that you can picture them in your mind perfectly, and the plot is consistent and moving. The five stars are for his writing.<br /><br />The e-book bundle I would have rated three stars. I think the e-books are a bit overpriced, but the format is okay. All five books are in one document, but you can move easily between them. For some reason this bundle started on the title page of GoT, and I only found the table of content with the links to the single books when I accidentally moved a page back. I almost returned it, thinking there were no links to the single books, which would have been a major annoyance (I wonder if the same thing happened to the reviewers who gave this only one star because of formatting?). Also, only GoT has real page numbers (misleading advertisement!), which means if you are reading one of the later books, if you jump to page 100, you will be back in GoT. Also, if you go to table of content, you will be on the page with links to each book, so it takes you a few clicks to get to the toc of the book you are currently reading. I'm rarely using this feature, but I can understand it would annoy those who do. It would be nice if the titles of the chapters were in the table of content, that would make it easier to jump back to a certain chapter, or follow the viewpoint of a single character. Like in many other e-books I think the publisher does not see the advantage of the format, and many improvements (e.g. X-Ray) which would make for an easier read were not done. But since I prefer this to reaching my luggage limit with books, I have to live with it. I also think e-books, which have no paper, printing, storage or shipping cost, should never cost more than the paper copy (the paperback version of this bundle was $7 cheaper when I bought the e-book). I realize the publisher set the price, which is a stupid policy. E-book prices should be flexible and subject to discounts just as paper copies are, the seller should set the price (and pay the publisher just as with paper books). Hopefully, e-book quality and prices will improve in the next years.storage or shipping cost, should never cost more than the paper copy (the paperback version of this bundle was $7 cheaper when I bought the e-book).

B0085RQLXK|5.0|This album truly rocks!  It's got a little bit of everything from the hard rockers to the stunning ballads.  It's classic Aerosmith, but still current, modern rock.  There are a lot of reviews on here complaining that this doesn't sound like \\"Toys In The Attic\\".  Really, you don't say?  It's 2012.  As great of an album as \\"Toys In The Attic\\" is, you can't be the premier American Hard Rock band by making the same album for 40 years.  The songs on here are well crafted, all of them.  The ones the boys pulled together all on their own, as well as the stuff from thier long time collaborators, Diane Warren, Jim Vallance, and Desmond Child.  None of whom are \\"hacks\\" to quote a previous review.  These are some of the best songwriters out there.  I love what Joe Perry and Steven Tyler do when they get together, always have.  But if they work with others sometimes, so what?  They've been making Rock N' Roll for as long, or longer (in my case), than some of us have been alive.  And, as a current music professional, I can tell you that songwriting is something that everyone collaborates on at some point in their career, and for some, constantly throughout their career.  If you love Aerosmith, I can assure you, you will LOVE this album.  Steven Tyler's voice is as good as ever and the guitar riffs are crankin'!  Just listen to the samples on this page.  It was enough to convince me to give this album a shot, and I couldn't be happier that I did.

B0017SWPXY|3.0|my co-worker  recommended this book. I bought it but was not totally impressed. I was expecting the book to be more thrilling.
B001NIAQ9I|1.0|Every time I try to watch this movie on Amazon Prime I get audio, but no video either on my TV via a Roku box or on my computer.  For the life of me I can't find anywhere on the Amazon site to report this problem to anyone.  Do you think anyone from Amazon reads these reviews and can help.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Mr. Follett doesn't disappoint in this great novel about the build up of WWI. Each major country has a character in the book that is so real in their day to day interactions with the other characters in the novel. He makes the war human and shows how good well intentioned people can fall so short in the diplomatic arena.
B004IQ78HA|4.0|I have been a fan of all Disney animated films since my childhood and hope to own them all but then they came up with the Disney vault -_-  anywho I was watching the version with Whoopi Goldberg and I couldn't remember the last time I had seen this one I definitely missed it the others just don't compare.

B0086700CM|5.0|This is loads of fun. Really. A challenge. Disappointed there is no end of game. But can 't put down!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great, great series.  The actors are wonderful.  Thomas & O'Brien you love to hate.  Anna & Bates are the great romance.  Carson & Mrs. Hughes are my impression of the perfect people to run Downton Abbey.  Mrs. Patmore is caste perfectly for the cook. Daisy struggles with life but seems to be catching on.  Dame Violet Grantham is the star of the party with her matter of fact dry lines. Lady Cora Grantham & Lord Robert Grantham are a great couple.  Isis is a well bred, class act dog.  I don't see how they got her to walk down the stairs with Lord Grantham in the season 1 opening.  Mary, Edith, & Sybil are typical sisters.  Mary has matured quite a bit since season 1.  Will she & Matthew ever get married? Only time will tell. Edith is even mellowing out. Will she ever find true love? Who couldn't love baby sister Sybil. She has quite a bit of Cora & Violet's spunk.<br /><br />Highclere Castle (Downton Abbey) is phenomenal.  If you have ever read the story of Howard Carter discovering Tutankhamun, you would know Lord Carnarvon, who owned Highclere.  I hope to be able to visit there some day.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase Season 3 & 4 and any more seasons that are produced.  I will watch this saga again & again. Much thanks to Julian Fellows, & all the people who have made this saga what it is!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a big Grisham fan and always look forward to his latest legal thriller novel.  Grisham tells the story from perspective of a convicted felon, the main character.  Usually the lawyer is the main character and storyteller, so this book marks a departure.  I think it works well-- you see the legal system, often its shady side, as experienced by a prisoner-- with an engaging storyline and Grisham's always appreciated style.  While some may pan this novel, I think it is a great read!  Looking forward to the next book!

1455527475|1.0|A good book should provide pleasure or information that is constructive and this book has neither.  It is not a rant that will make your blood vessels pop in your neck nor will it contribute anything whereby you come away with a feeling that the book was worthwhile.  People come and go at businesses for a variety of reasons.  Butning your bridges is never a good idea and to do it in public is a no, no.  To sell a few books and to then be a pariah that nobody wants to hire is worse than shooting yourself in the foot.<br /><br />The greatest damage is done to the innocent families of those who work at Goldman Sachs as their livelihoods could be affected.  Goldman Sachs is still standing and will probably continue to stand as one book is not going to bring down the house.  Greg Smith should have moved on and the book should never have been written.  This is coming from a person who has been in businees his whole life and the last nineteen as a business owner.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|Things I look for in a band.<br /><br />[X] - Fun Original Sound<br />[X] - Not Creed.<br /><br />This band meets both of those criteria. More in depth review follows below.<br /><br />When I was 12, growing up in the late 90's, a friend of mine....actually, not really a friend more like an acquaintance...really, he was more just someone I knew and tolerated. Actually, If I'm perfectly honest this guy was a complete imbecile and I hate his filthy-harloten guts. What happened was, this guy talked me into buying Creed's new album \\"My Own Prison\\", telling me things like \\"they're so good! Totally original, and have a great underground sound!\\", well, I was young and this guy didn't seem like he was a masochistic servant of Lucifer ... So I bought it! it was $15 (because the RIAA was price fixing back then, the internet didn't exist in it's current form, so I had to pay exorbitant amounts of money for terrible music). Upon purchasing this album, and giving it a thorough listening to, and really doing my best to like it and trying convince myself that what I was listening to was music and not, as it seemed, the sound of cats being privately violated with cattle-branders. After listening objectively to Scot Stapp gurgle out what I can only imagine was his attempt at singing for a solid two minutes, I vomited violently in my bathroom sink, vacated my bowels and was in bed ill for the remainder of the day lamenting the loss of $15 and my childhood innocence.<br /><br />Why the story about Creed? Well, one, I'm too cheap for Therapy and Amazon reviews are a great outlet for suppressed childhood scars. The other reason is that I want everyone to understand that I know what terrible music is, and I've spent my hard earned baby sitting money on awful music that made me bleed FROM MY EYES before. So when I tell you that Megalithic Symphony is amazing, and one of the best purchases I've ever made, I want you to understand fully what I mean when I say, this band is the opposite of Creed.<br /><br />Save the world from bands like Creed, buy this Album today.

B0083P1QUM|2.0|Patricia Cornwell has long been one of my favorite authors. However, her last few books have had me sighing impatiently, wanting the book to come to its' whiny end. Kay Scarpetta has become a shadow of herself, moody, having dialogue with herself constantly about her deep feelings and anxieties. The story line takes a second place to showing Kays personal angst, worrying about her niece, her husband, Marino, and constantly revisiting the past with each character. I doubt I will buy another Cornwell book, which is sad after years of enjoying her.
B001RPIYV4|5.0|I love how this is the classic romance story. While it still uses the exact script that Shakespear wrote and the wonderful words we all had to memorize they brought the story itself into modern times and amoung the modern world.

B000W796OM|5.0|I love this series of books, and enjoy the movies as well.  The earlier movies in the series are definitely closer to keeping true to the books than the later in the series, which is understandable, since the books start to have too much detail to portray into a movie.  Either way, definitely my favorites!

B0098VYCCE|4.0|Right off the bat: I'm not a teenaged girl.  I'm neither impressed by Chris Hemsworth's muscles, nor rabid over how Kristen Stewart's affair with director Rupert Sanders screwed over her \\"Twilight\\" co-star and ex(?)boyfriend Robert Pattinson.<br /><br />That said, I hope I've just established my credibility when it comes to reviewing this film.<br /><br />And I liked it just fine.<br /><br />\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is an interesting, well-acted, enjoyable yet violent take on the Brothers Grimm tale, and one can certainly do worse than sitting down to enjoy it.<br /><br />Though Stewart and Hemsworth and competent in their roles, the real stars of the tale are Charlize Theron and the CGI effects...both accomplishing their tasks splendidly throughout the film.<br /><br />Theron does a stellar job--as is her habit--playing Ravenna, the Evil Queen.  Her quest to be the most beautiful woman in her kingdom is so malevolent even plant life perishes throughout the region.  And Theron seems to relish the role, thoroughly encompassing a cold, heartless woman who maintains herself by quite literally sucking the life out of every fair woman she encounters.  It is safe to say that it is Theron who \\"owns\\" this film, and it is she whom you will recall longest after the movie has ended.<br /><br />As for the CGI, as always it ran the risk of overwhelming the film.  Here, however, I felt it performed its task of embellishment the movie with the technique necessary to tell the tale, and when it did draw attention to itself it was only to marvel how well this was accomplished, much in the manner of beautiful scenery or great acting.  As in, say, the \\"Harry Potter\\" films, it seldom drew away from the experience of watching the film, instead enhancing it in a necessary and stunning manner.<br /><br />Chief among these moments would be Ravenna's magic mirror, to whom she makes the well known chant of \\"who's the fairest of them all?\\"  Instead of merely reflecting her or invoking the image of the spirit within it, the mirror turned liquid, gloopily oozing down from its perch onto the floor only to rise in the evocation of a being under a shroud--a very eerie image indeed.  (I would have enjoyed seeing it get back upon the wall, but the movie did not supply that moment, alas.)<br /><br />Additionally, the seven (initially eight) dwarves were quite effectively performed by normal-sized actors (including Brian Gleeson, Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins) whose faces were melded upon the heads of smaller actors.  It was seamlessly accomplished, though I did hear it created some resentment among \\"little\\" actors who felt slighted by their seeming exclusion.<br /><br />I felt that Stewart and Hemsworth were fine, though I felt that their roles could have been performed by any other actors--in particular Stewart, whom I have never really felt is that accomplished an actress, nor certainly the \\"beauty\\" who would drive Theron into any jealous rage.  As for director Sanders, for whom \\"Snow White\\" was his first feature film, I felt the movie was nicely balanced and paced, and made for a very enjoyable afternoon.<br /><br />All in all, a pleasant movie, and satisfying.  My only statement of caution applies to parents of  impressionable youngsters: you might be wise to take the tykes elsewhere, as the violence may unsettle them.image of the spirit within it, the mirror turned liquid, gloopily oozing down from its perch onto the floor only to rise in the evocation of a being under a shroud--a very eerie image indeed.

B001KVZ6FW|1.0|Well, everybody has to jump the shark sometime, right? The A-Team had Stockwell, MASH had Alan Alda as a director, Firefly had the entire fourth disc (The last four episodes have their moments, but let's be honest: They're not anywhere near as well written as the episodes on the previous discs. The Bounty Hunter and the Brothel villains were so 2 dimensional you could use them to split atoms and not initiate a nuclear event.).<br /><br />And Pixar has Up. WARNING: THE FOLLOWING WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.<br /><br />Savvy credit-watchers will note that Up does not boast the involvement of John Lasseter at all, and Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird except in the role of \\"Executive Producers.\\" \\"Executive Producer\\" is a Hollywood term that means \\"I'll give you some money and take the credit for your success, but I'm not doing any work.\\"<br /><br />This is understandable. Lasseter, Stanton and Bird have been practically living in the studio since Toy Story. They have families, and they've made a pile of money. I don't blame them one bit for wanting to spend more time with their kids. Unfortunately, like Jim Henson's death, they took all the magic with them and what remained was only someone trying desperately to imitate what was uniquely inimitable.<br /><br />Like all Pixar movies, Up is technically impressive. The visuals are stunning in some places, and the animation is exquisite (whoever researched the dogs earned his money.) Unlike Pixar movies, however, the writing leans too heavily on sight gags and shies away from character exploration almost entirely. It's like a Dreamworks movie got lost and Pixar kidnapped it. (Hey-yoh!)<br /><br />There are a lot of things wrong with the movie, but I think the fundamental problem is the lack of empathy. Every other Pixar movie has been the manifestation of some passion or affection that men like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton or Brad Bird had for something. Toys and Finding Nemo were about their kids. Cars was about their parents. Ratatouille was about their own passion for creation. No matter what the movie, either Bird or Stanton (or both) were speaking through the main characters. It's why the movies were so good, why the characters rang so true. They were honest.<br /><br />The creative heads behind Up not only fail to empathize with the main character, they don't even seem to like him at all. Let's have a look at what happens to the main character through the course of the movie.<br /><br />1) He meets the love of his life in a decrepit, run-down old house, and falls through the ceiling and breaks his arm. (They later buy the house and fix it up as a married couple)<br />2) He marries the love of his life, and they attempt to have children but an apparent miscarriage leaves her barren. (I say \\"apparent\\" because that scene is part of a musical montage of their relationship that takes up about 10 minutes of the first reel.)<br />3) During the musical montage, they decide to follow their childhood dreams by setting up a savings jar to go exploring, but on three occasions, they have to use the money in the savings jar to pay for emergencies.<br />4) During the musical montage, the main character buys plane tickets to the Amazon so they can fulfill their dreams of being explorers in their retirement.<br />5) But before he can present the tickets to her, she has a heart attack and dies. During the musical montage.<br />6) The neighborhood around the house he and his wife rebuilt from the ground has gone commercial. Surrounded by glass and steel monoliths, he is the last holdout and won't sell to the developer.<br />7) A construction worker backs over his mailbox, which he and his wife hand painted during the musical montage, and though well meaning won't let the old man repair it himself.<br />8) The old man gets evicted from his house after hitting the construction worker who wouldn't let him have his mailbox over the head with his cane.<br />9) The old man flies his house to the Amazon, followingthe footsteps of the childhood hero he and his wife shared, and the reason why they wanted to explore the amazon in the first place.<br />10) Only it turns out that his childhood hero is a homicidal lunatic who sets his house on fire and subsequently tries to kill him.<br />So in the course of the movie, he loses his wife, his house, and his childhood hero. But it's all okay because he helped a small, annoying kid rescue a large, annoying bird.<br /><br />Furthermore, nobody in the movie listens to the main character or seems to care about him at all. The land developers won't listen to him. The guys from the old folk's home won't listen to him. The annoying kid that accidentally tagged along on the trip to the Amazon won't listen to him. His childhood hero won't listen to him. The talking dog, who is the lone bright spot in the movie, won't listen to him. The only person in the movie who gave a rat's rear end what the main character thought about anything was killed off in the first ten minutes.<br /><br />His character isn't even well written. When we initially meet him, he's shy. Almost timid. Under his wife's influence, he's happy. But after her death, he turns into cranky old coot stereotype number 7, Asner variant. Sure, his house is surrounded by skyscrapers and construction workers, but his transformation from mousey balloon vendor to crusty old fart is so sudden that I can't help but wonder if the only contact the writers had with old people came from watching Abe Vigoda and Wolford Brimley movies. Memo to Pixar: Not every old person living alone is perpetually cranky.<br /><br />And he's not the only character who's taken directly from the Saturday Morning TV School of Character Stereotypes. The other primary character is a chubby boy scout who is seeking his \\"helping the elderly\\" merit badge. He's your standard annoying, wise-beyond-his-years preadolescent whose innocence will show the old man the error of his ways. At one point, the kid is talking abouthis estranged father (Aww! He lacks a father figure. And look! The main character lacks a son! I wonder where this is going...) he remarks that what he really remembers is the little, boring, everyday stuff that he did get to do, not the big, important stuff that he didn't. That thud you hear is the message being delivered like a sack of tainted meat into a dumpster. Pardon me while I gag myself with a screwdriver.<br /><br />The villains aren't particularly fleshed out either. The land developer has no dialog, and exists primarily as a man with a cell phone who stands in for corporate soullessness (lessness... lessness... lessness.) I won't harp on him, because he's not really supposed to be a fleshed out villain, though I will point out that Pixar has done the Corporate Villain so much better in both Monster's Inc and The Incredibles.<br /><br />The other villain, which you could see coming from the start of the movie if you pay close enough attention, is the main character's childhood hero. A celebrated explorer, he is disgraced when scientists dispute his findings of a seven foot tall bird that roams the remotest regions of the Amazon rainforest. He sets out for the rainforest, vowing to return only when he has positive proof that he's not a liar. When we find him next, he is not merely bitter at his mistreatment at the hands of the press, but downright bat-guano insane. It is strongly intimated that he murdered any explorer/archaeologist/botanist who he ever encountered in the rainforest because he suspected them of trying to capture his bird and steal his glory.<br /><br />The main problem with the villain is that the writers think that \\"bat-guano-insane\\" is a substitute for personality. Every other villain in a Pixar movie has had human motivations, and has been sympathetic to some degree. Even the Aussie dentist in Finding Nemo was more clueless than evil. This guy is just completely inhuman, and not in the \\"I believe what I was programmed to believe\\" way that the Wheel was in Wall-E. He's just... one-dimensional. It's like someone said \\"Oh, let's just make him a hunter who kills people. That's good enough, right?\\" and everyone just nodded.<br /><br />The one character, or group of characters, that are well written and fully realized are the dogs. The villain has an enormous pack of dogs at his command, and he has outfitted them with collars that translate their thoughts into English. This opens up the inevitable \\"I would like that ball!\\" and \\"SQUIRREL!\\" jokes that actually work. They're the only thing in the movie that does.<br /><br />I'd be more willing to forgive the cardboard characters if the rest of the movie wasn't taken whole cloth from the cliché factory as well. The whole denouement is so laughably derivative I would accuse it of being brilliant parody if they weren't taking themselves so seriously. The villain sets the main character's house on fire as a distraction, because the main character is defending the large bird. Seeing his whole life go up in flames, the old man rushes to extinguish the flames, leaving the villain open to waltz off with the bird. How the main character was supposed to stop the villain, who at the time was flanked by his army of vicious dogs and carrying a rifle that acts like a shotgun, isn't discussed. But the annoying kid is very disappointed at the main character for just letting the bird go.<br /><br />After the kid yells at the old man for acting like a human being instead of some paragon of selfless giving (+1), the old man reverts to full on grouch mode and takes his house to finish what he set out to do in the first place. And he does it, by jiminy. The house sets down right where he and his wife planned to build their retirement home.<br /><br />But it's all hollow. We know this, because as he puts the furniture back where it belongs and rehangs the pictures on the walls the score plays sad music, and the color scheme is just slightly muted, even the photograph of his wife seems to look down on him in disappointment. All that was missing was him looking at a mirror with a melancholy expression, only to turn away in disgust at what he had become. And quite frankly, I'm not altogether certain he didn't. By this point in the movie my eyes were rolling so much I'm sure I missed some things.<br /><br />When the kid shows up and steals some balloons so he can chase after the bird himself, the main character finally \\"gets it.\\" He expunges the house of everything inside, so the withering balloons could lift what remained skyward once more. The last we see of the furniture, as the house flies away, is his chair sitting neatly next to his wife's chair on the ground as the triumphal music swells and eggs the old man onward and upward. (Yeah! You dump that old crappy symbol of the life you had with your wife. Forget her, it's time to go save some kid you don't know and a bird you don't like!) He chases after the villain, who has captured the annoying child and left him tied to a chair and ready to drop from the loading dock of his blimp to the ground so many thousands of feet below. The villain and the main character have a climactic battle that employs a clumsy version of the \\"I threw my back out\\" joke that was so much better in The Incredibles. See, it's funny because they're both so old. Also old people smell like prunes.<br /><br />Seriously. That's how the dogs find him as he sneaks aboard the villain's airship. They smell prunes. They couldn't even spare the cash for some additional syllables and use the word \\"liniment.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, the kid is rescued. The villain was dispatched through the use of a high-fall the likes of which I haven't seen since I watched every movie that ever came out between 1985 and 1999.<br /><br />Finally, we're treated to a scene where the annoying kids finally gets his helping the elderly merit badge, with the main character standing by his side because the kid's father couldn't be there (all together now: Awwww!) and then they go share ice cream and count different color cars, just like the kid used to do with his dad (and again: Awwwwww!) and apparently the court order remanding the old man to a home has been rescinded, or at least it's unenforceable because he now lives in the villain's airship.<br /><br />Oh, and just to throw a bone to those of us who understood why it was important to the main character to keep a promise he made to his wife so many years ago, the last we see of the house, it just happened to land right where he wanted to put it. What a coincidence.<br /><br />I suppose Up was an accurate enough title for the movie, given the infatuation with flight. But if they wanted to make it more accurate and a whole lot more descriptive they would have called it \\"Trite.\\"<br /><br />That's not something I ever thought I'd be able to say about a Pixar movie. Usually they come right up to the edge of being trite without actually falling off the precipice. This one just points the car at the edge of the cliff and lays down rubber.<br /><br />I have more complaints, like about how this movie is a violent departure from Pixar's classical themes about how nostalgia is a good and fundamentally human emotion, and the fact that it's not only okay, but admirable that people have attachments to physical objects. Heck, if the people who made Up had done Cars, the residents of Radiator Springs would just pack up and move to California, because it's just a road, right? Move on.<br /><br />But I'm running long, so I won't. In conclusion, I just want to say that I will no longer buy a Pixar movie on DVD just because Pixar did it. It was my last vestige of fanboy mentality, and Up snuffed it out. I don't know whether I should be angry or grateful.

B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I was so looking forward to this movie with the great actors.  It was horrible.  I don't think there was more than one funny moment in the whole movie.  It left both my husband and I almost depressed.  We then loaned the movie to some friends of ours and she called and just said that was terrible!  Don't waste your money like I did!

B008COII1Y|4.0|Blah Blah Blah, people are complaining the movie is too slow, and there aren't enough zombies.<br /><br />I had no problem with the pace, it worked with the story. As for the zombies, you're talking about a rural area in the 1800's, of course there aren't going to be massive hoards of zombies all the time.<br /><br />The movie is not JUST about zombies, but about the relationships developed between fellow survivors. I thought there were plenty of zombies, and makeup was simple enough, but executed very well. The zombies had a creepy voodoo kind of vibe going on, rather than just rotting flesh.<br /><br />The animated scenes and illustrated chapter titles were a nice touch, the artwork was awesome! The music was also perfectly suited to the film.<br /><br />All in all, the movie combines two of my favorite things: A Civil War era timeline, and zombies.

0061537969|5.0|Dean Koontz was right, this book is awesome.  It was on his list of favorite books in The Reader's Digest.  A lot of books that have dogs &#34;talking&#34; in them don't sound realistic.  This one is incredible in it's perspective and emotion.  It truly sounds like it's from a dog's perspective.  It was hard to put down so I read it in just 3 sittings, a record for me.
B003L20IJM|4.0|It was a very nice movie to sit down and just enjoy and I will watch it again.  Outstanding cast.

0385342063|4.0|Poppy Wyatt is in quite the fix. Just a few days before her pending nuptials, she's misplaced her ring (she was passing it around to her friends who were trying it on, when a fire alarm was pulled); someone (riding a bike) has stolen her cell phone; and she fears that her fiancé's family may not like her! And when things couldn't get any stranger, she finds a cell phone (in the trash) and begins to communicate with Sam Roxton, an executive with White Globe Consulting Group. Meanwhile Sam is not only dealing with the desertion of his PA Roxie (who decided that a modeling career was more important and ditched the company phone in the trashcan) but Poppy's insistence that she must keep the company phone so that she can keep in touch with those who are looking for her ring. In the end, Sam has no choice but to communicate with Poppy in order to get his email messages and texts because she doesn't intend to give it up without a fight.  As luck would have it, the two grow close after a series of misadventures and misunderstandings and find that they have more in common than they initially thought.<br /><br />What I liked about the book? There were some very funny moments, and I thought that Poppy's misgivings about joining Mangus' family were somewhat realistic and typical of how a woman feels coming into a family that is different from their own. And while I thought Mangus (Poppy's fiancé was a jerk and his family condescending (although some of that ends up being a misunderstanding), I did like the introduction of the family dynamic into the story. The mix-up with the gift and the scrabble game...one of my favorites....was a hoot. I also liked the fact that this book was quick and easy to read.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the book? Well, it was VERY predictable and you could see the ending coming one-third of the way thru the book. It was the traditional cookie cutter chick lit storyline with nothing real new or different. You have the jealous friends, crazy wedding planner (with an ulterior motive), a possible cheating boyfriend, all with a wedding looming in the near future.  There were even times when Poppy, while well meaning, seemed to border on irritating. I thought that her continued intrusion into Sam's life (via responding to some of his personal texts and emails) was intrusive, bordering on being stalkerish (ok, I don't think that's a word but you get my drift).  I liked her, but I didn't love her and I think that's when you know that a book is great...when you connect with the main character.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Probably for those who want some light reading and enjoy chick-lit. While there was nothing earth shattering or new, it wasn't the worst book that I have ever read either. And while peppered with some humor, I would still say that the story was just mediocre.
B001BW02B8|1.0|I have not received this album. I am waiting for it to show up on the cloud player so i can enjoy the music. It normally is a quick process, what is wrong.

B003WMX3SY|3.0|This is THE case for my i7 Sandy Bridge system for home-recording/multimedia. I am a bighanded IT lout and the space inside this puppy was a great relief to work in. I am only using the 5 stock fans, but they are quiet enough that I can do reference vocal takes and acoustic guitar noodling right there in the same room. After two weeks, there was a lot of dust built up on the exterior of the fan meshes, and this apartment is pretty bad dust-wise. After suspending another HDD (that makes 5) I found that there's a lot of dust coating all the componenets inside. I have moved the unit up off the floor and onto a small riser to see if that helps. I wanted to side mount my optical drive like my hard drives are oriented, which would necessitate switching the front panel with the side door panel so as not to have to leave the whole side open for the DVD tray to emerge... but the hinge configuration prevents that because it is not &#34;modular&#34; and able to be reoriented. Dust and missed &#34;modular&#34; detail = 3 Stars
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This is the first book I have ever purchased and could not get myself to read past the second chapter. If I were looking for something about animals in a zoo, maybe I would have kept reading. I would recommend this book back to Yann for a re-write.
B000J5XS3C|3.0|I can't say I'm too happy about the Behringer Chinese-Dormitory/Factory set-up this company decided to tout in accompanying literature with the product. I thought I was buying German-made. The full color pamphlet celebrates their 20-something Anniversary of the Chinese Plant and notes that they suspended the 9 pm curfew for the dorms so that everyone could celebrate the momentous occasion. I kid you not! Buy one and read it! But the unit performs flawless, the build is solid and me likey likey!

0525423656|3.0|~3.5/5<br />[Also available on my blog.]<br /><br />This book was quite a bit different than the first, and I did enjoy it quite a bit more. Most of it was much more exciting. The ending, however...<br /><br />So, in this book, Cassia has been working in some camp thing outside her Province, and Ky has been `fighting' the war in the Outer Provinces. This is told in alternating points of view, which I really liked and worked really well for this story. It made me like Ky a lot more, and I even enjoyed some of his chapters more than Cassia's.<br /><br />The first two hundred pages consist of Cassia and Ky separated, whereas Ky has snuck away from his area and is trying to find a way back to Cassia, and Cassia has been put in the Outer Provinces and also snuck away and is trying to find Ky. That was probably my favorite part of the book, as it was very exciting and different and I learned a lot about both of them and the government. Then they met up and the next maybe hundred pages are also really good, where they're getting to an empty area and deciding to either go to the resistance or the mountains where they'll be with the lone farmers. Cassia wants the resistance, and Ky wants the mountains, which Ky's decision at first surprised me but later made sense.<br /><br />The last bit of the book I did not really like. First of all, I agree with Cassia going to the resistance; I would want to bring down the government as well. But Ky's agreeing to go with her didn't make sense to me. Throughout the entire book, he made it clear that he did not want to join the resistance, and even said that that was something he could not do even for Cassia. And then, without showing the reader any thought on him changing his mind, he goes with Cassia to the resistance. That just didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />Also, I don't like the resistance, and I already guessed this would happen. I just didn't think it would be so obvious. The resistance is pretty much exactly like the Society. They take data on their people, test them and then decide where they get to help out, and the people still have to hide things and aren't allowed small items because they like them, and the people aren't given information that does not pertain exactly to their job. It sounds pretty much exactly like the Society, if you ask me. I don't trust them, I don't like that Cassia was sent back into the Society, and I just don't like it.<br /><br />Now, the romance. I like Cassia and Ky together more than I did in the first place, although I think there's still a bit too much angst over Xander. I love Xander, and what we found out about him in this book only makes me like him more, and I hope we get to see more of him in the next book and find out more about him, but Cassia just needs to accept what she did to him and move on already. I mean, I get that he's hurt by what happened, and she's upset that he's hurt, and I understand Ky's worry over her feelings for him, but just move on already. I don't care for more angst.<br /><br />We also met a couple new characters in this book. I like Eli, who reminded Ky and Cassia of Cassia's brother Bram. I liked Vick and feel bad about him. Indie is alright, and rather interesting. We also found quite a bit about the Society out, and what they haven't told their people about, like the blue pills' actual meaning and what they're doing in the war. That was really interesting, and I look forward to finding out more about that.<br /><br />Oh, also, there's a map at the beginning of the book, which I found really helpful, although it gave away where the resistance was. And I wanted a bigger map, one that included the parts of the Society.<br /><br />I do plan on reading the last book in the series, since there's only one left, and I want to find out what happens. I just hope that it's exciting, and that more happens page by page than in the first two books. And I'm thinking that a lot is going to have to happen, since not too much toward arevolution has yet.revolution has yet.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Bought this on recommendation from my Son as I was in the USAF.  Super movie and most likely will watch it again and again.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Wow!  This was a fantastic production of Emma.  The actors/actresses performed with depth and subtlety, breathing life into their characters.  Emma is one of my favorite books by Jane Austen because the characters are so human and fallible.  This movie does the book justice.<br /><br />For &#34;kicks,&#34; I attempted to follow up this production with the Gwyneth Paltrow version of Emma, and had to turn it off.  It seemed so shallow in comparison.
