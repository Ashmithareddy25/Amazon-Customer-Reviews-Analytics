B00U8695HK|1|Product worked great for a month then it started this really annoying click whenever it was on. After this clicking starts if you try to unplug the purifier it shocks you
B0018LPJSS|5|Great fit
B00M8I0Q8S|5|Cute key chain that costs way less than at the dealer....of course.
B001RMV0BS|4|Great product, easy to install with simple and clear instructions.  Do yourself a favor and buy butt connectors with shrink wrapped housing to make a watertight install of the wires.  My only gripe is the pigtails coming out of the lights could be a few inches longer.  Way brighter than traditional bulbed tail lights.  buy some!
B0049Z8X4C|3|Great, but it ended up coming apart like all my other BMW keychains.  It was a bit too heavy too.
B00NTCVADM|3|It really looks nice, but a bit over priced I feel. Wish it was bigger then I would have LOVED it.
B00QVLQHAO|5|I purchased this for my husband who hates to siphon out gas the old fashioned way. I watched him use this and it worked great. It's amazing what this battery powered unit will do. It siphoned out the gas in his golf cart with ease and really quickly too. He was really thrilled with this unit. I highly recommend this if you don't want a mouth full of gas.
B0073MF67K|4|Fit fine in my Nissan quest
B000EEU0IO|5|Tricky install, but once you get it on its great. I have it in my 2014 chevy silverado crew cab truck, maybe thats why it was tricky.
B007ACZW1I|5|Installed easy and is working great!
B0002M701S|4|I rigged this to hold an Andytach speedo for my BMW R65LS. The mounting bracket was almost made to bolt up, by pure luck. I shimmed the tach and things work fine. The screw for the pivot really need to reefed down good though.
B00VDQNELW|5|Excellent fit and finish.  Easier on the elbow!
B00NECCX88|4|I just needed to replace some mirrors on my 2001 GSXR600 that I'm rebuilding. It got the job done and it arrived quickly.
B0000AXRH5|5|A neat little tool that will transfer any automotive liquid of your choice from point a to point b. For the price the build quality is strong, I just wish it was a little wider at the entry point.
B00PGRGSH6|4|Replaced older LED replacement bulbs with these.  Much brighter and nicer looking as well.  Great product,  They are pricier than others however, which is why I gave only four stars.  I removed the resistors at time of install and replaced the flasher relay with a LED relay from DiodeDynamics.  This combination made more sense.
B00AJEX1U8|5|as advertised. found the same one for $20 less at Ebay
B00LW2Z4FQ|5|Instantly felt the difference. Smoother idle. Quite surprised me how much better this is than stock cdi and coil, you won't be disappointed.
B000JZURAE|5|works great
B00BD4SK0Y|4|Seat covers were it little more thin than what I expected.  They went on easily and look good.
B00M78820I|5|It was for my wife. She says its very easy to use and put away. She loves it. She had trouble with the twist shades and did not like them. So far she is very very pleased. ”
B010G34RHC|5|Looks great on my back window!
B00V1002WO|5|as advertised
B00312B5B2|5|Easy install worked great
B000CQOIR8|5|As stated and timely delivery.
B0010GI2KS|5|Thank you works great got here early
B00BFIINLE|5|Fit like a glove great product
B000BXKYW0|4|Tester is rather large and does not fit in smaller places in my fuse box<br />Must be wired to work
B00NLMQW88|5|great cover.  using it right now as I type this.  Keeps out the rain and is breathable.
B00QMKYYYK|4|hope they work as intended
B000KPYBBO|5|Had to return the first set, driver's side kept slipping down when the window was opened. Found out the corner was cracked. Weathertech was useless they wouldn't stand behind their product because it wasn't purchased directly from them, that's bad customer service.
B00KQXKG46|2|Its Bright but the first time I ran it thru a car wash it was full of condensation.  I had it about 6 months when that happened.  You can take it apart, dry it and then seal it however unless you are perfect when sealing it happens again.
B00XXOCFWQ|5|My twelve year old daughter found this set and begged me for it so I added it to my wish list and had planned on buying it for a Christmas present. About 3 days later I was given the opportunity to review this set of ten sylus and jumped on it. There are two of each color and they have a beautiful metallic gloss. We have a good variety of phones and tablets in our house (iphon 6, iphone 5, Samsung 4, Samsung Note 4, Samsung tablet, iPad, and a Kindle Fire) and the stylus fits in all headphone sockets perfectly.<br /><br />My kids love using the stylus pen for playing games on their devices. They say it is easier then using their fingers on some because they can accurately pinpoint what they are trying to do. Their dad liked the stylus because it is easier for him to text with it then using his fingers since he often hits the wrong key.<br /><br />If you do not want this attached and dangling from your phone, you can clip it only your shirt, pocket, or something close by. Keep fingerprints off of your screens with the stylus and treat your friends or family to one...they will thank you.Needless to say, I did not wait for Christmas to give this to my daughter. It became a returning to school gift and she graciously shared with her family. I received this set at a discounted rate to test out and provide my personal experience.
B00335RDH2|3|This was a replacement for one that flew off while we were going down the highway.  The left-hand one stayed on just fine, no problems, but the right-hand one kept jiggling loose and eventually we lost it in the middle of our cross-state trip.  Since we installed them both the same, we assume there was a defect with the right-hand one.  This new replacement is staying on just fine.
B00PSPSC20|1|This hitch lock is solid and well built. I love the design. Unfortunately it did not fit my 2015 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab truck. It is short by about 3/16 of an inch. If only the shaft was longer by a fraction of an inch I would have given it 5 stars. I guess I need to find another receiver lock. I'm really disappointed that it didn't fit.
B00EW1969O|5|It would be helpful if it was in the description that this window decal goes on the inside of your window. I was expecting it to stick to the outside, my windows are naturally tinted and you can't really see it. Other than that it's great!
B003OMBF6E|5|Great for my granddaughter things
B00ECU18UA|5|exactly what I needed to fix my speedo... no more 45 mph freezing... works perfect with little to no install issues.
B007WMY64A|5|Wanna get robbed? Slap this bad boy on your ride.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I converted my car into a camper and needed a way to block out the front and back windows, both for privacy and to keep the sun out. This fit my Honda Fit perfectly and folds up super small, making storage a non-issue.
B00J00X7PQ|5|Works well with my car. that is reaching 90k miles.
B0090ZJPMK|2|didnt work right
B000C1HK0A|2|No good!!!
B00O3PYA7M|1|Product is cheap paper thin leather that when lacing it the eyelets tore out and ripped nearly in half.
B000WKHVF0|5|Worked perfectly.
B0010DZZPG|5|Fits! and easy to install
B00A8RWNZA|5|It was exactly what I expected and installation was simple and quick.  Looks great!
B00RUEM6G0|2|Rubber is fraying and looks ugly.
B00AW1JVGG|5|It's exactly what you would expect... sticker quality seems to be good and hoping it lasts a long time on my vehicle.
B00657LQZK|1|Not as pictured.
B007P5V8MW|5|received fast, great product
B005OKXU94|5|Fit perfectly in 2mins
B006GVH61I|5|Easy to install, increases the overall appearance of the vehicle! Great addition!
B00I5058AY|5|Great product, a little extra work to fit onto vehicle but kept the good ride and gave it the level look I was after..
B00UBUMWE6|1|Not  worth the price.  Cheap plastic dollar store junk. Dont waste your money like i did.
B003ZYS8UW|4|Works perfectly, has a huge charge that lasts for many jumps. 4/5 because you need to buy a separate outlet charging cable and it was not mentioned in description.
B00YI3IGA6|3|EDIT 2/28/16: We don't use this shade anymore.  After a bit longer trying to drive using it, the visibility issue became too concerning to me.  While I CAN kinda see out the window, it definitely feels like it increases my blind spot, and I have to be much more vigilant driving to remain aware of surrounding cars.  Not worth the stress and risk.  However, the product is still well-made, and it may be a good option for some others.  I'm lowering my rating to 3 stars.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />My toddler fusses any time the sun gets in his eyes while we're in the car.  The little shades I've used in the past to suction cup to the windows never seem to be in the right place, so I was intrigued by these ShadeSox.  They really are just like pantyhose for your windows.  They were easy to install on our Honda Accord, and one of the doors I got it stretched out just perfectly so it fits tightly without any sagging.  For some reason, the other door has an odd baggy spot.  I don't know if I just need to try shifting it around, or if the two shades are dimensioned slightly differently.  It's not a problem, just looks a little funny.  But do they work?  Yes, absolutely!  They do reduce visibility a little, but I'm used to driving a big van so don't rely much on the back windows anyways.  Time will tell how durable they are, but for now I'm a fan!<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B000GVAAF8|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00LSTH5H8|5|Excellent cover fits very well. Time will tell how it survives the elements.
B005E3GOO4|3|I needed a spare key and decided to order this instead of going through the dealership. It was easy to program and cranked the truck without problems. The only complaint I have is that when I use it to unlock the truck it sets off the alarm.
B00MJDTLAG|4|I love the way the sunroof visor looks on my car but I wasn't very happy with the window visors.  Shipping was fast and no damage to the products.
B00M250FNI|2|It's not clear in the pictures but you can't just mount these flat on a surface without cutting a large hole to clear all of the wires.  The ones I received had a large blob of epoxy where the wires exit the light housing and were not &#34;completely flat&#34; as indicated in the text on the pictures.  To clear the wires and the epoxy blob I would have had to cut at least a 1/2&#34; wide hole, run them behind the surface they're mounted on then pop another hole for the wires to come back out.  For my application I just needed the lights to mount on the surface with the wires exiting the side of the housing on the surface. To be truly surface mount I'd expect a reveal in the back where you can notch the edge of the housing and have the wires exit on the surface.<br /><br />Brightness was acceptable when tested but these aren't super bright.
B007R0X4J0|1|Wont stay black for very long the finish wares off and turns gold
B0006IX85K|5|Just what I needed to connect my water filter to the spigot. The couplings work well. I am very satisfied.
B004IU240M|5|Wonderful  chair, quick shipping. Love it
B008A5GRHM|5|This is the only thing that fixed faded cladding on my 4gen 4Runner. Made pretty much anything plastic/rubber look new.
B00M9DCMNE|5|Very bright,and easy mount, you could use these for back up lights.
B00P0UHN64|5|They're great I get compliments from all my friends and they're a great little brother repellant! Lol hasn't asked me for a ride since I've installed them.
B000CI3QSI|4|Starter works great and with a two year warranty it gives peace of mind.
B004131NEY|5|Worked well in my Pilot.  Took me a few hours to install...  :)<br /><br />Still working after a year....
B00ZZO01Z0|5|Super bright. Great upgrade for interior of my jeep.
B00VE1C3OK|3|Got this June 4th 2015<br /><br />It did not take long for the strap to come completely off. Out of the package it did seem like the strap didn't get properly placed during manufacturing. Where the strap connects to the actual ring there are two holes and those holes are anchored onto the ring by two little nut things. On the key chain I received only one of the holes was actually secured. On day two one of the nuts started coming out and eventually the other did as well. Then, a couple weeks later of being as gentle as possible with it, the strap completely came out and was lost. I don't buy key chains often this is actually the only one so I don't know of any other one that is better.
B000CSGT1Y|4|Fits perfect!
B00KYS2WYA|5|Love these products. Car looks awesome. Suggest spraying the interior protectorant on a sponge before applying. The spray pattern is large and will get into many places.
B00BAZBYTU|2|Just for looks not made to get great receptions
B005OVJVWI|5|Just wanted to say the item arrived in speedy time and fits and works perfectly in my 1999 Cadillac DeVille Concours. Of course I had my mechanic install it and took approx 1/2 hour.
B00KEYKUXO|5|excellent
B000HI0PUK|5|Costly, but did it's job as needed
B002UC6VGS|3|It took the streaks off easily but when I sprayed it on my boat and brushed it around with a soft boat brush and then hosed it off, you could see the streaks where it had dripped down and taken some of the wax off as well.  You need to spray on a cloth and wipe the streaks off without drips to avoid this result.
B0081SAPO4|5|Starter cranks like a champ once again.<br />This kit supplies bushings where bearing used to be and specialty tools would be required to pull those bearings out to install their bushings if required, I reused my bearings and added some high temp grease to them as well as sanded smooth the surfaces of the contact area on armature.<br />Inspect that armature to insure all windings are coated, magnets are not cracked, clean oil from inside if seal had failed.<br />You have to pull smaller side cover and remove gears to pull this starter, keep them clean and take pictures of the disassembly if you haven't done one before so ease with installation.
B007636KGC|5|Awesome decal!!! Ordering another one for my other car.
B00247DI3I|5|Good product i start using this in my new car and it makes a wonderful job keeping your leather seats clean and smooth.
B00029WYVW|5|The oil you treat the filter with is in an aerosol bottle which is nice and easy to apply. Not sure how many cleanings it'll last but it's easier to tell when you've applied enough vs. the older dripper bottle.
B004OOJ9RI|4|I bought this because it had scan capability for airbags. I have a scan tool that I paid $600 for several years ago but it won't identify ABS or Airbag Codes.<br />The biggest complaint I have is that the product advertisement says it works on &#34;most domestic vehicles&#34;. That isn't helpful since it doesn't say WHICH vehicles it work on and which it won't.  But I took a chance that it would work on my 2005 Chevy Silverado 2500 HD and fortunately, that was one that it does work on. It pulled the code for the airbag and led me to the front sensor which I replaced. Problem solved.  his product cost 1/4th the price of my other scan tool and was able to do the job.  After I fixed the problem, it cleared the code as well.
B002T4C3LE|5|I installed this KYB kit on a '69 CJ5 ranch Jeep easily.  The old Sears shocks that came with the old Jeep were done.  This Jeep is not expected to be ridden in any particular rough terrain, so I'm not expecting something these shocks won't deliver.  The price for these shocks was great and they arrived promptly.  I would recommend them.
B001B7E05W|1|Installed per instructions and both ends broke off at the welds the first time I used it. Other Kolpin products had defect that had to be repaired before I could use them. Won't be purchasing Kolpin products in the future.
B00DSD58DA|5|I saw this sticker on a car one day, and it made me happy to pass by another fan of the show, so I thought I'd get one, too.
B00AIJY2ZM|1|Comes up as blown bulb on 2009 R1200GS.  Going back to conventional bulb.
B010MHUQYK|5|Very good product happy with my purchase
B00SNZZE0A|2|arrived dented
B0012TZ2CE|5|Exactly what it said it was. Gets the job done.
B001T3Y8XW|2|I don't think I purchased this from Amazon.  On the plus side, it is a &#34;keep it simple, keep it fun&#34; easy-to-use/easy to read tool.  On the minus side, as another reviewer notes, the testing cables are flimsy.  Within a year of purchase one solder connection broke with no unusual strain applied. Just to see if I could do it, I fixed it well enough to work in a pinch but it took more &#34;minimum wage&#34; time and money than the product sells for retail.
B001GPZ6Q6|5|looks great on our car -
B00N31IYTC|5|K&N makes fantastic products.  This is not as tall (thick) as the OEM filter, but it doesn't need to be.  In fact you DONT want it as tall because it'll make it that much more difficult to clean down in the folds.  So go with this!  It pays for itself on the third service.  Speaking of the service, if you have it serviced and are not a DIY type, make sure you check behind the knucklehead mechanic who might have thrown your K&N away!  be SURE to install the stickers that come with it, and install them on the airbox and not on your back window.
B004HMBK5G|4|Works for me -- keeps the seatbelt from tightening up while driving.
B001EWYC8E|5|What can I say except....NINERS!!!
B001KS2PXQ|2|Does not sit flat against the glass. It leaves streaks.
B00GHT8NM0|4|Seems to work well on my 09 Silverado.  Good solution to a broken latch problem.  Dealer wanted $250 for new lid assembly.
B00NVI8FPU|5|Factory fit, easy to install.
B00A8WCR38|5|Bought it a week ago and so far it's working great! Will update in case something happens.
B0031I9KUY|5|Great product.  Such a good feeling to know your vehicle will stop when you push the brake pedal.
B00DBENBXU|1|I had bought these for my 2000 Ford mustang and it said on here that it fit and I just got them today put them in and they are really loose with the slightest touch they shut off,had to put the stock ones back on,waste of money
B005N53AM2|4|Good!
B00B7GC50Y|5|Kept the battery charged and ready to go all Winter.
B005UQQ74C|3|Worth the price but not HD
B00H1I5T6O|5|fit and finish excellent
B001OCVBGA|5|Everything I expected. Installed very easy.
B0009TAOBC|5|Worked Great  Simple
B0029TQDLA|5|It works, what else does one need to know.
B000Q0VCC4|5|exact replacement, confirmed through the match page
B004D8KH4O|3|I reserved these lights very quicky and tested to make sure they worked and they were very bright. Only problem I have is the bracket they come with is to big they fall out going down the road. I had to put a bead of clear calk down one side if each light to keep them from fall out.
B00JPLCN64|5|best price around and works without issue, far cheaper than what toyota wants.
B000VDCZVS|5|good
B00877SL2M|5|they all work perfect so couldn't have asked for anything better!
B0012PL8FI|5|OE - fit perfect - fixed my problem
B007NQ6P8U|5|Great quality decal. Arrived on time and was very well protected in the packaging. Looks exactly as pictured and described. Just bought one for a rear window decal in my Durango and it looks awesome. Installs on interior side and almost looks etched when viewed from exterior on tinted glass. *****
B002OR2FIW|4|Was able to make it work but the battery connections are not located exactly the same as the old unit.  There was no slack in the wires so I ended up running one of the wires in front of the fuses. Not a recommended solution but I will address the wires later.  Functionally worked as intended but I used the on-board mode indicator and included cable.  Most people apparently order the external monitor. I did not and the instructions did not cover the connection of the cable.
B000WG4CQU|5|Fits great. Nice and sturdy.
B002T02R00|4|Great struts at a reasonable price.
B002XMWAS8|5|great tool. well made not cheap like at auto stores
B00F9LPJ8S|5|For the product and it's purpose, it gets 5 stars.  I was a little caught off guard when the battery showed up with two of the sticky pads already on the battery.  Their location didn't suit my needs for how I mount my battery and it led me to believe that I received a &#34;returned&#34; item.  If that's how it comes from the factory then okay but just thought it was weird since not all applications will suit the location of the pads.
B00O0YZR9G|5|It did the job.  My car is the snowflake white pearl.  It's the legit Mazda paint, so I got what I needed.
B002TMM136|5|Fits great and works great dosent slip around
B001QULXYU|5|Fit and finish were spot on for my 87 Dodge Dakota 4X4.  I can finally put my truck in 4 wheel low again without it sounding like the front end is ripping apart.  I would buy these again (hope these will last and I won't have to).  took about an hour a side to put them on (with power tools).
B00JZSQWK0|5|Very nice Key chain.  It's attractive and well made.
B000BNZ5BU|5|Cuts down drying time when you wash your own car.
B00UYMENT8|5|Excellent.
B00ABW6DO4|2|The product fits great in the car. I just do not like the finish. It seems to slick for my taste. My feet always want to slide forward. Needs work I think.
B00A7EPZI6|5|Great
B00C2TEWOM|1|doesnt work. hooked it up to 1995 S420 and a bluetooth OBD2 reader.  Used Torque and it cant connect to computer.  Returned for refund.
B00KY8E734|1|Was not as pictured. They are also making me pay for return shipping.
B000E7SY02|5|PERFECT FIT, EASY TO INSTALL, AWESOME PRICE!!! ULTRA FAST SHIPPING, ALWAYS GO AMAZON, IF IT'S WRONG THEY WILL MAKE IT RIGHT 100% OF THE TIME!
B001N8C80S|4|These are nice thick carpet floormats for my 2011 Toyota Sienna. They fit great and seem great quality. The front drivers side mat fits well on the hooks and the nubs on the bottom of the mats hold them in place. They are not as pictured, however, and a guide to where they go in the van would have been helpful. The two front ones were easy. Then there are two long, narrow ones and a shorter, wider one. I finally figured out they go from front to back with the wider one in the middle, but it does not cover the entire area.
B00BL50IM8|5|Great
B004WO1RKC|5|These do work for the tracker boots as well
B0009KNOSQ|3|Clean plastic
B005H7DARG|5|Genuine Ford Part. Replaced one that was ripped off my CVPI.
B000WK9EG4|4|Nice chrome touch to replace my gloss black headlamp.
B000S2UG18|5|Works good. Weird that old ac delco wires from 11 years age were still reading lower resistance on my ohmmeter than new wires but they work good no problem.
B004GXWJQU|5|This is a nice heavy duty lubricant.  Heavier than WD-40.  I have not been able to get the bolt out yet, and so will post my review again later.
B00BITKUUM|5|Easy to install, works good.
B00BVL7ZBY|4|Had to modify the width of the tooth  to fit the nut on my mountain bike suspension
B0091B5338|5|good price
B00JVIIMGG|5|Cat lady here. I love this sticker.
B007U9EXVQ|5|Item arrived in perfect condition within the shipping date. Also came with very clear introductions.
B00H9S71LW|5|This item work flawlessly, just plug and play (am kidding) but it was easy to setup, and is working with all software i have (torque, dashcommand), even have a free software that works very nice too, this product exceed my expectations!!
B00HRZVC6W|4|Great mats. Good soft rubber. Holds dirt and minor liquids well. Good fit.
B0034RKJD4|1|My rearview mirror fell off and I thought it might be better to buy from the manufacturer since this holds quite a bit of weight (like many vehicles today- not just the mirror). I didn't need the &#34;cleat&#34; but I thought their adhesive would be superior. In this case that is not true. It fell off after one night attached. Another thing was that it came in a small plastic bag with no instructions. Although I knew that the spot that I would place it had to be extremely clean and when I pressed it onto the glass I held it in place for a couple of minutes (typical of epoxies) and even taped it on over night before hanging the mirror. After returning it I went to NAPA and picked up the mirror adhesive for $3 dollars and using the one drop as instructed and it did the trick. The mirror is still in place.<br />If you do need the cleat to mount on your windshield- this is the exact part. But if you have your original- just buy the adhesive and follow the instructions.
B0027M3A1U|5|Works great !! Saves a lot of hard work
B002ZBWKAU|5|Amazing and so easy to use! This has saved my life so many times.
B00OP9QE8O|5|Exact and acurate product as stated in listing, but I was a little disappointed in how much &#34;protection&#34; it actually provides
B00HJCJDRS|5|Bought both front and rear.  Front uses existing fasteners on truck and went on very easily and tightly.  Rear uses a clamp system which was a bit more complicated.  You need to look from underneath to make sure the clamps are horizontal so they clamp onto the fender well edge.  Both front and rear fit well and seem secure.  I expect them to stay on and last.  Good product.  No drilling needed.
B00EJSNC5E|1|For the price you would expect a decent quality product, but they sell you otherwise. Sure the rubber it's of decent quality, but will start to de-laminate from the adhesive after only a few hundred miles. Install was done precisely and in clean room conditions...not the issue. Don't buy them! Haven't tried any other brands yet but these blow. Waste of time and money.
B0050E3SK0|4|A good replacement radiator for my '69 el Camino, just a little different placement of the lower hose connection, had to do a little rearranging of my transmission cooling lines.
B00EZC2BBU|1|The holder melted in the heat of Louisiana summer. I checked the fuse and it was still good inside.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Other than the fact that this shade tends to pop out very quickly when you unravel it (which is mostly funny), this has been a great shade that's easy to undo and redo, and helps greatly with keeping things cooler in SoCal.
B008UYVSRM|5|Excellent Service, Excellent Products.
B00860GQZE|5|Perfect fitment for my 2005 WRX 4EAT.
B00W2MOGCW|5|Product arrived in perfect condition..fits perfectly on my 2015 Chevy Silverado
B0009IQXFO|5|Makes your car shine
B0041TQURS|5|strong and solid
B009AA2IAG|5|Worked great replaced the part and I'm up running.<br />The part was a direct replacement
B00BITI66C|5|Arrived when promised, easy to install. No more rolling down my window to get out of my vehicle.
B001NCHVK6|5|QUICK DELIVERY, EASY TO INSTALL
B004C4448O|3|Jacket smells. Not a leather smell either<br />Ill give it a couple days in the garage<br /> I will return if the smell does not got away.
B001TZBB3K|5|They do a great job
B004JBQ44W|5|I have regularly switched between Mahle and Mann filters on my M3 and M5 over the years.  I'm equally happy with both makes as OE suppliers.<br /><br />I do like the end caps on the Mahle more than the Mann eco-top design, though that may just be cosmetic. You can't go wrong with this or a Mann filter though
B00KIZQRSG|5|I was able to fix my television with this kit.
B001K2Q20E|5|Best car cover in the world, I have bought  a Coverite car cover for over 15 years because they are that good!! The zipper on the driver side is one of the benefits  and the lock on the front in addition  to the lock under the car !!  You can't get  anything  better!!
B005R4L23S|4|Carid.com has them but the focal point is still there.. sadly they have to much chrome for me and im looking for ones with much less chrome. Ideas let me know. Also you have to sodder the running lights in the actual headlamp not the corner lights not hard but thats why only one set worked for some.
B007SXU03Y|1|The piston and not even announced in the picture, missing parts and the piston came with some scratches, delivery was on time!
B00CNV2OW6|5|Fast shipping and the product is great i got alot of compliments with this on my car
B000BZL080|5|Easy to install
B00OL2HC8G|3|Did not fit properly , only had 11pcs. Not 15pcs. 😐
B00ISCOU5S|5|Amazing siren and pa, really worth the money! The soaker is slightly larger and heavier than expected, but I found a spot for it. Comes with plenty of wire, and connectors! I would suggest hiring someone to properly install it if you do not have knowledge on basic wiring.
B00D329DI2|5|Love them!
B00P6ZNJUC|3|I thought the decal was going to be larger. Everything else was good.
B006K8YVLU|2|These things are awesome! Fit my application great.
B00BLPSLPO|5|Well thought out design..
B001KP2UKW|5|Perfect
B00XIMJG84|5|Item works great!!!!
B000GU5KOA|4|Look awesome, functions exactly as described.
B00T4TEWBQ|5|Exactly what I wanted. Shipped quickly
B00BAZCPW0|5|These are brighter than OEM. Also cheaper than OEM. They were asking 10 bucks a bulb at oreilly auto for the stock ones. I went this route hoping it would turn out ok and they are very bright and dont have the blue tint to them. Very happy with that too. Highly recommend and install was easy in the fog light housings.
B000BUTD9S|5|As expected at a really good price.
B00DBEO8Q4|5|Awesome bright white color, much better than OEM incandescent .
B0009H52BG|5|going to use tomorrow
B004PBCCQ0|5|Looks great on my silver wrx wagon. Easy install and definitely helps my car stay cleaner, longer.
B0041RU044|5|LOVE IT THANKS
B000AM4ZOU|5|need instructions
B000GKD5NI|1|Suction cups poor quality and don't stick well. Idea not bad but really cannot use product. Looks good in the trash can.
B000VUC566|5|Fits great, only complaint is the mat is so heavy you can't open the truck and leave it up so I simply roll the mat back before opening.
B0001UZUW2|2|Nothing more than a novelty.  The &#34;swatter&#34; part will not hit the surface you are aiming at flush, so unless the fly is occupying the small bit of space the edge of the swatter happens to hit, the fly will remain alive and well laughing at you all the while.  Could not hit a fly at 6 inches.  You are much better off swatting flies with a news paper or old school fly swatter.
B00WZM8L1Q|5|Awesome product.  Much cheaper than the dealership.  Watched a couple you-tube videos, and had no issues changing the boot myself.
B009S69UJ4|5|I bought this control arm for my Honda CR-V 2006 LX AWD and it worked perfectly! I was able to finally get the camber fixed and now the rear tires are completely aligned. REMEMBER: This is only ONE kit for ONE wheel, so you have to purchase 2 kits.<br /><br />I'll try to keep this review updated in case something goes wrong in the future, but so far so good.
B0010DXYHW|5|Perfect fit, cheapest price found for a name brand air filter.
B010TRDB68|3|Do not fit right in a 2001 f350 must make adjustments to make it fit not sure on light quality yet
B00913L1HI|5|Well worth the cost
B00DBEMZPK|2|These are not as bright as a standard 2 filament bulb. I did not use them in my motorcycle.
B00JHN1W7G|5|Good filter, and good value.  Buy it.
B00GWEQZ5M|3|Pros: The price of four of these is the same price I paid for just one filament bulb from a marina.  They seem to be sufficiently bright.  Somewhat of a challenge getting them to fit inside the nav light housing on my pontoon.<br /><br />Cons:  First one sparked and kept blowing fuses.  Second one worked fine.
B000IDUW5C|5|As advertised  great product
B006EGAIII|4|Does not lift as high as I would have liked, but got the job done.  2014 Toyota Prius.
B009I6BEDY|5|Nice!!!
B001NZXH2E|5|These were a perfect fit for my 2007 Hyundai Entourage Limited.  They came with all of the required parts, instructions as well as a small package of lube.
B001KRF05M|3|Radiator is well made but the drain in plastic tank was damaged/small crack and leaked, it seamed from factory or warehouse. Shipping box was not damaged. Opt to receive replacement and second radaitor core was only as wide as a stock one at 1 inch. was advertized at close to 1.5 inch so I went for a refund. Very disappointed after waiting 4 weeks.  Well made but quality control SUCKS
B00FC22N06|5|These worked great! Had to do some slight modification to the headlight cover piece but VERY easy to install, wires were all short and easy to tuck away! They are very bright :D The H7 kit was nice because of the slim ballast, I got 6K and it didn't match the third light on my 07 CBR600RR, I believe the 5K would have matched perfect! But good product overall!
B003YYMM1E|5|Absolutely LOVE.
B001B5EEZA|1|it did not work on my KIA optima 2006 like they said it would and was poor quality. i had to buy another one from a different brand and replace it again. and replacing a clutch is a lot of work! pulse i am out 200$ because i can't return it.
B00J1C23G2|5|didn't have all the mats. Sent back
B00V5B3PRS|2|Red color actually looks more like a pink one....I had to put it to trash after applying it since i got lots of &#34; hot Pink comments&#34; by everyone..... they need to work on accurate color....... the item doesn't look like whats shown in picture..
B0041E207M|5|exelente
B001JT16LS|2|I purchased this product before and was satisfied. It is an inexpensive briefcase and I didn't expect it to last forever. The last one lasted about 10 months, which was really good considering the treatment it received. This one, however, after one day was coming apart.
B00FFGP8SS|5|Nice product and quick delivery
B0051PJWQW|1|This stuff is nothing but garbage it dont dry on your headlight I put it on my headlights and let it dry for 24hours and soon as I washed my car it came right off this is nothing but tire shine save your self your money and DONT BUY IT........to tell you the truth I want my dam money back
B007V2E3CG|5|Fits perfectly.<br />Very good quality.
B001FAK28E|1|DO NOT BUY!!! If you have a 2011 or newer wrangler the passenger mirror is completely obstructed. This is something they really should mention before you buy it, but instead, they only mention that it &#34;might be block if the full doors are on&#34; in the instructions. Well we didn't even have doors on the jeep and we could only see less than half of the mirror which you might think is enough to get by, but trust me, it isn't. In addition, the product was missing a plastic insert on the driver's side. I had this garbage on our jeep for less than a day before we returned it.
B0023UXPPW|5|We have a Care Free add a room for our awning as well as rope lights in a track. This allows us to have all of it at the same time. Very easy to install and remove. Nice product.
B00SIAAUAY|5|Better design than the valve originally on a train horn.  It also allows for air flow as well.  Works great
B000N3W8J0|5|This grit guard actually does its job I recommend this product,  to save your paint job from scratches...
B0031GYOYI|5|As advertised
B000Q0K5SQ|5|great products/quick shipping
B00JFHLYMW|5|great
B00OKPE0IY|5|This piece is the perfect addition to any 2015+ Mustang in a state that requires front license plates.  The bracket prevents the need to drill holes in the bumper, however you will need to drill holes in the plastic panel that runs underneath the car.  The only issues I have with this piece is that it does not fit as well as I would like for it to without modifying the air dam.  That being said, it still looks much better than drilling holes in the bumper cover and with enough patience you can get the bracket to fit well despite the air dam being in the way.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this piece reduces ground clearance by approximately 1/2&#34;, if you have a lowered car you should take this into consideration before purchasing.
B004C6Q46M|5|Perfect easy installation for 2007 ford edge awd
B0042Z0XWY|1|Would not fit properly on my 2015 explorer. Threads to short to screw all the way down. Fit great on my sons f150.
B00KTIUID2|4|Very quick to setup. Took all of 10 seconds. Though the range isn't the best, maybe 15 unobstructed feet.
B00IWNKK0M|4|For the price it's built rugged and very well, just like the factory one only much cheaper.
B00FCLFJUI|5|Thanks
B00Z7TRG06|2|Took almost 2 weeks to get and one was scratched bad on one side but did fit the car
B004NL01H4|3|Looked like a great product. However, it did not fit Jeep with Rock Sliders..
B00IKPEDZU|5|Worked for my car as listed
B00MPAJ4CS|4|It's perfect. Very easy to install.
B000FQ7YB2|5|Excellent fit... No problems . My 1968 CJ5 is running like new !!!!
B001OMPJGS|5|Buy with confidence! These lights are great! Fast Shipping
B00JXZKIW8|5|Very pleased  it was a perfect fit
B0059XCVVO|5|Used this as a bug guard for my truck. looks good, sticks good.
B00766HFR2|5|Good size,  great price,  very happy with this.............
B00JINPJKG|4|Works great
B00JKSP41S|5|Thank you for excellent service and product.
B004I8O7J0|4|Great price and quality. Fit was perfect and easy to install. Came with standard bulbs, but did not use. Shipped quicker than expected.
B005CWA9RU|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B00N2P3KJS|5|Great product and price!
B004N82BBQ|5|Exact replacement for my 2006 Dodge Magnum SRT8. Black background exactly like the picture shows. Came preloaded with light bulbs. Bolts right into place with no issues and can't tell the difference from the OEM part. Bought left and right and each was individually boxed and package inside of another box and arrived without any damages.
B00K87V0T0|5|Awesome
B00OX03CXU|1|Did not work, no pressure reading
B00UUAUEM4|5|cool
B00VLGG3EO|3|It is ok...
B002TTOI08|5|Hubby got this for back of motorcycle when he rides; never run out of gas!  It's great.
B00M250FNI|3|Pros:<br /> Very inexpensive.<br /> Very bright.<br />Cons:<br />The wires come out the back and require a relatively large hole to keep them from hitting the frame and shorting out.<br />The color codes on the wires don't make any sense, and there are no instructions for their function provided.<br />The plastic is somewhat brittle- you have to install it carefully if you don't want the lights to eventually crack at the mounting points.<br /><br />Not recommended for a boat trailer or anything that is going to be parked outdoors continuously.
B00U7SUZ64|4|WORKED WELL
B004O3WBYW|5|OEM product and good price!
B000BYB1Y4|1|didn't fit and had to send back for refund.  Was recommended on website as the part I would need for the specific engine I was searching for parts for.
B005VVR3BM|5|Thank you
B00GHT6SF4|5|Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome
B00TUNSV2W|2|We have a vinyl shower stall and some decking on a boat that is not that old, but yet has started to show some stains from skin oil and dirt that is on bare feet.<br />I really had high hopes that this cleaner and degreaser would take care of this problem - but this did not. In fact I was left with orange stained rags and had to use elbow grease to get the orange tint off of the flooring.<br />There are 2 different spray nozzle adjustments, but surprisingly there is no ingredient list which one would normally want for allergies or medical attention since it warns that it is both a skin and an eye irritant - I'd prefer to know exactly what I am using.
B0009IQXFO|5|This is a great soap and smell terrific. Why pay more for other brands (Griot's Garage) when this performs better in my opinion.
B009YLE02K|5|Along with this wonderful sticker several other small stickers were included. The application is very easy, the product is lovely, and the experience overall was very nice.
B00B8KGD70|5|grate
B00EECLY64|5|I ordered 2 HID headlight bulbs. One bulb did not work. After reading my review,Kensun sent me 2 replacement bulbs . I am very pleased and would purchase products from this company again. Thanks!
B000GVAA8K|5|Just what I needed. Thanks
B004LF3HQO|2|Way to expensive for what it is. I got caught up in the marketing ploy. Lots of cheap ways to clean area's to be treated. Try voom RV cleaner it is awesome. Acetone works good to.
B002BHRXJ6|3|Works O.K. But not as well as we thought
B0024E5XOS|4|Not an exact drop in replacement, but I was able to make it work.  The slide is right at the height of my kid's eyeline so this makes it much easier for them to see out the door when the screen is shut.
B000221M94|5|Easily mounts to garage wall but hardware not provided...I used screws with drywall anchors. Tested it a few times and found that with the shape of my infiniti door, mounting just above the baseboard was best but mount it where you think your door will contact it.  holes are recessed to prevent screws from touching door.  I'm very happy with it.  If it were longer, that would be even better but it works just fine for what it is intended.
B0006O17TS|5|Good fragranc3
B00FJUEO12|5|good cart
B0099IAN2Y|4|They fits and looks very well, but just need some adjustments at the front door's beacuse they hit each other when opening the car
B00UXK4CMY|5|My new favorites. Using them for drying my card and love them. Remember to use microfiber soap when washing. Definitely going to rebuy.
B00W9C3XY2|1|Not satisfied at all. Product is junk
B00CBTRMZ4|5|a++++++
B000E4COMO|5|useful for RV
B00ZDZ03VS|5|My order was processed and shipped quickly,  items were exactly as described and work flawlessly, even better was they arrived sooner than expected.
B008OIQEG4|2|Not nearly as easy to apply as advertised.  The color was more matte instead of Satin.  I heated and stretched and it still left wrinkles.
B0042L7DZ8|5|No problem so far . it is a beast
B009FREAGO|5|Great item
B008G3IKKK|5|Great product
B00ABYVT64|5|Pleased with these high quality sprayers u pomrobably will too - sprayers dont leak on hand yet - good
B0013RLL1G|5|A++
B00E1ETJFS|5|Very sturdy and well constructed.  They are exactly as advertised and fit my Virginia license plates perfectly.  No rattling.  If cleaned/polished periodically (like the rest of an automobile should be), I have no doubt they will last for many years.  They certainly improve the appearance of a car.
B00J2N4L7E|1|Broke after less than a week. Gle holding the two pieces together did not hold.
B000CQHUHS|5|Very good quality gasket
B001EOWPOA|5|simple, works just like OEM
B008CLNYPC|4|Fit can very well, lockable hold down could be heavier, wouldn't take much to pry off and swipe the can.
B003ZWHLCU|5|rock solid better than the car original ones
B00IVKYOE4|5|I get lots of positive comments on this sticker. People seems to like it.
B004361AFQ|3|be aware, opening doesn't fit into ford mustang's gas tank opening...
B000V8QVX6|5|This is the best thing they have come out with to keep you warm in the car.  The first one I bought the silver piece came off the piece that you plug in to the lighter so I had to buy another one but they are wonderful to have in the winter time.
B00N5UBQHS|5|If you are switching to one of the Battery Tender lithium batteries you need this, as the standard battery tender will NOT work with lithium.
B004INRNTG|5|Excellent Product
B0053P69IO|5|30 min install. Perfect fit. Impressive QC.  All holes were perfect.  Their are a few YouTube videos that give really good install instructions that allow anyone to do this with minimal tools.
B000CIIAT8|5|Perfect fit
B0009OMYCO|5|Good tool.
B006YTTV4W|5|I use it on air cooled VW engine case...no leaks
B00LTXME5Q|5|good deal
B007J7G07E|5|Works great, used in an RV replacing regular bulbs.
B00077WFXQ|1|ONLY Fits with the Cargo Shelf &#34;UP&#34;  .. in other words, this does not cover the Cargo Shelf when it's down, it fits on the floor below.  Returning product ;-(<br />Does not cover the &#34;wing storage&#34;  and is 4&#34; short of reaching the rear seat.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Fit great and great deal!
B007W57YP0|5|This bracket / drink holder worked out perfect.  I also put some blue loctite on the thumbscrew threads and tightened it down with pliers.  Thumb screw never worked loose on our way, and back, from Sturgis.
B0082365AQ|2|Did not work with the kayak we purchased
B0136I3S4C|5|[[VIDEOID:5e7d049c4cfbcbecdcf201b3fcf3b9f]] This thing works flawlessly.<br />Seriously, I expected to run into some issue or another, but literally every aspect of this car jumper works exactly as it's described and without any technical knowledge required to use it whatsoever.<br />The added features really take it over the edge and make it useful for far more than jumping your car, if that wasn't enough. It feels extremely solid and well constructed, the cables are tough and the alligator clamps are have the perfect balance of tension between being strong enough to grip the battery leads without slipping off, and not being too tight to squeeze without hurting your hands.<br />One unexpected bonus was being able to charge multiple things at the same time, that is seriously cool. After having tested this thoroughly for several days, I have no problem whatsoever recommending this product to my friends and family. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an unbiased thorough review.
B00KAN52ZU|5|Quality item.  Love it
B006FUT09G|1|Total waste
B0002Z9QO4|5|Worked very well although a bit noisy. Used a pavking rug to help keep it in place.
B0009XXM0S|5|👍👍👍
B0014Y82VK|3|It's okay, but noisy.
B000CCM3JC|5|Great stuff to have around the house, works well on any screws that are not going to be getting too hot (like a car engine).
B00D5FNARW|5|smells great and cleans dirt and grit off with ease.
B0076I2LP6|5|good quality replacement
B00W1VHESC|4|It is clear and light weight.
B00E5OUOCQ|3|Great product but the jumbo size does NOT fit a Toyota Corolla well.  Much too small!
B000A0EIOY|5|Fits perfectly in my 2000 C280 V6 engine air filter.
B00MOQ3KIM|2|With the wireless remote I can only use two functions on and flashing The light bar that I bought also has a spotlight feature that I am NOT able to use because the harness Does notLet me use that function
B012AGX46I|5|Love the product, it is extremely bright and is simple to install. The only issue I had was they sent me screws that were too long to screw into the side of the light bar that attached it to the brackets.
B000BZ545U|5|Timken Quality!! Rear Outer Bearing and race. Installed on a 2002 F250 srw. Exact fit.
B000BUTD9S|5|Made popup step much less slippery during rainy weather.
B00L9VWAUC|5|Product fit properly and working great so far.
B00S0O02HE|4|Worked great, but the wires were not long enough so I had to add more wire.<br />The picture shows a green light and a red light on the switch, but the switch I received the lights were behind the button so it lit up the around the button. ( you don't know until it is hooked up).
B00VEW34LU|5|items work very well.
B000BKIH8Q|4|Not bad...
B006QH56GO|5|excellent battery w/ excellent shipping protection
B001TK7CYM|4|Cheap foam, but the optics are good (for plastic). I got these on sale for $12 or $13 (~50% off), which made them a killer deal. Adjustable from around a size 8.5 hat (maybe larger) down to child-size. Does the job in a pinch.<br /><br />Good enough seal for riding in/on an open vehicle at high speeds. I've tested them at up to 130 MPH, and they held up great. My hair got restyled a bit, but my eyes didn't water, and the goggles stayed where they should.
B002ERDT6Y|5|GOOD PRODUCT, NO HASSLE, I RECOMMEND.
B00CYGUZCQ|5|Exact replacement fit for Ford Taurus, easy to install and works great. Good price on this filter and good quality product
B001BL6TYS|1|I did not buy this unit.
B002UCAFXI|5|This stuff is amazing.  Excellent cleaner and removes mildew with using bleach.<br />A major plus for boat vinyl that gets dirty and has mildew constantly.<br />Does a great job without being rough on the interior.
B0078SZRQO|1|Way smaller than pictured, real cheap plastic, not easy to mount anywhere.  Save your money.
B002R105L4|5|The light was here as promised and it looks and fits great on my 4Runner!!!
B00PIMJLQ4|5|FANTASTIC
B001RLRTGE|5|Nice plugs
B00Y5FJ7LY|5|Absolutely love these! Vibrant color, quick ship, easy to install. Would definitely order from Sickspeed again. They even included a sticker and biz card! :) Very Happy customer here.
B00556MPCU|1|we have not been able to get this programmed
B00M76FSH0|5|😍
B000XEBI9K|5|Great product! Don't leave my car parked without this down.  A necessary addition for any city driver
B00153CXKQ|4|Easy to setup/install. I had to assemble it, the parts were loose in the box. I used a little lock tight to ensure the cables stayed in place. I only wish you could use cable lugs with it instead of bare cable. 4/0 cable fits snug, but worked without issue - just in case anyone was wondering...
B00KQGPEQI|5|A+
B007VRFCLC|3|Does not make the coiled hose straight. It gets most of the coil out but does not make it actually straight. It gives it a slight radius and you will need to do additional bending when the tube comes out the other side.
B00M5WYWPU|1|The black letters did not line up with the white tape on the back. I had to throw the set in the garbage.. Waste of money.
B006QMIJKY|5|I love the cargo cover. I'm just disappointed that it was not sold with the car.
B00NP60URE|1|What a joke.  Adapters and pump just a joke
B00TXI0JT2|5|They were just what I needed Thanks
B00YB5GAEA|5|I'm loving this very bright lite. I already have something similar attached to my rear gear bag and adding this much more visible lite onto my helmet sure makes me feel safer.
B00KXO04L8|4|OK
B009FU77ZM|5|Made my TRD Sport look like a TRD off-road. Awesome shocks look nice too.
B00753S8CC|5|Worth the cost.
B00MJDX5OE|4|looks good on my 2002 Mitsubishi galant.
B0018OBG3C|2|The screws that hold the lid on just pulled free and I barley use it.  The idea that you can use the underside of the lid to take notes is a joke.  It claims reinforced hinges which is true but the super strong hinges are screwed into plastic and so as worthless.<br />For $45 what can you expect though.  It does hold drinks...
B009RCBKZG|5|great
B0028JQYSS|1|did not work
B000C9WK84|5|Quality part
B00PP6CE3K|5|Fixed my '00 Jetta door! No more random alarms! Woo!

B001P11SCM|5|Perfect gain settings and easy to adjust for the trailer brakes.
B00RASCC5G|5|Good decal that gets lots of attention
B007QWLPUY|5|Pretty. Well worth the money.
B00V3JQXGC|3|It was a welcome surprise to get this device and it worked without any problems. The only thing that I did not like was I had to go to the Internet to get instructions on how to program it.  Works great!!!
B00WU3ECZY|1|Bought 2 of them and both will not charge past 80 % not sure if this is common but may not buy again in the future
B005UGKC1Q|5|We have used this a lot in the last months, is very sturdy and very good quality. We have a Mazda BT50 2008 and it fits perfectly
B00B7RPVXQ|5|If you got a 60s truck you need to have these
B005FNKFZ2|5|Work as described! Great product! No more looking for the key to the hitch!!
B007SZ11LC|5|This tool helped me with my job on my 97 E420 I'm glad I bought this tool best purchase yet!
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great with torque app on android and Dodge Charger hemi.
B006NOFLQA|4|works good
B00S5JNNRK|5|Thank you .
B00HO9MLGQ|5|I absolutely love these. They look awesome, and I get so many compliments!
B000COS0GU|2|Do not mach 2013 Honda Accord wheels. The need a spherical end on the nuts.
B00EKQ3OC6|4|Easy to install, but you will need to buy a Plastic rivet gun, I bought one from Harbor freight cheap.<br />They look good and definitely help protect the body.
B000T9LZDI|5|love it
B00Q1JXJSE|5|Excellent product & fit
B00R1LP3B2|2|Works ok but the male to male 12v connector was broken so I can't use it from my car
B007L4HMZE|5|Solid
B00K8D9Q36|5|This is a great marine radio. You turn it to Bluetooth and it instantly starts playing. Replaced a kenwood with this was the best move I made on my boat.
B0087PE682|5|Great hardware for rackbed trailer and sturdy
B003V9TC10|5|Does exactly what I purchased them to do.
B000C5O1VW|5|Works great.
B006LPOCHA|5|These work great for the pollen season in the north east.  Love them and also bought more for gifts!
B00QI7FPM2|5|This fit my 2012 Murano perfectly I did not want to put screws in my car so I used existing Hooks with zip ties For the price this is a great buy
B00H3CCU42|1|Poor fitting, poor hardware, bad service.
B00KWNEQJG|5|Got fast, just as listed.
B005ZZOODE|1|Returned item was not what I was looking for
B00R19G8RW|5|Price is right; shipment was quck; worked as expected.  Would recomment to a friend.
B009P7694K|5|Worked great on my well used saddle
B00U7SUYG0|4|WORKED WELL
B0126YHORE|5|A wonderful product for the car. I saw no fault in this. It worked the way it was supposed to. Perfect lighting. Simply put the product does everything it was supposed to do. I highly recommend this LED light. I think it's ultimate plus is a how easy it is to install and also for something so small, how amazingly bright it is.<br /><br />A top quality product that's worth the money.<br /><br />&#34;Brightest little thing I ever saw.&#34;
B00GJKNN40|5|Met expectations
B001LC73GU|5|The product is as described. The install is simple and quick.
B0027XY5YK|5|Great replacement, fits just like new and cheaper than having the dealer change this out.
B00Q7QY9IA|5|The color is beautiful and fit perfect in my Scion tC.
B000VJJGWI|5|It's an umbrella......
B00PHWBQQS|1|THEY DID NOT FIT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RETURN THEM
B00158SFNK|5|thanks
B00GB7EPG6|5|Love it.  Holds pressure until you clear it.  Allows you to let air out of the tire.  Face glows in the dark.  Feels like good quality.
B000GS1JV0|5|Much better than the stock skinny pegs and were easy to put on.
B00UY5NPFS|3|These look good on out truck but needed more bolts and had to go but more that why I gave it 3stars
B00KHUQ9NK|5|Good product and good customer service, the only problem is the smell of it, at first it let a strong smell on the car that disappears little by little, and then it stays only a little bit on our hands after driving.
B00HC16AP4|5|Excellent quality. Adds style to my boring keychain
B00MP40N4C|5|Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
B00AQTNN22|5|Perfect fit
B000IYNR0I|5|all good
B0002JMLQU|5|Solved the problem almost instantly!!
B006RGRAOK|5|So far so good! We have a 32 inch tv at the moment and it seems to hold it just fine. It was easy to install and feels very secure on the wall. I love that we can adjust it with the arm. We are planning to upgrade to a 50 or 55 inch in the next 6 months so we will see how it holds up that one!
B00ZUR5JEK|5|Works like a charm. Easy to use and I don't have to check my tire pressure in the dark corner of the gas station any more.
B00FSG3DTG|5|A great light.
B005GDZPCY|4|Yup.
B004A6OB64|5|exelente
B000P411WM|5|great product fast delivery
B003SWNVI0|5|This is so easy to use, and it holds alot. Very Pleased.
B007XWU50S|1|I got these to replace my stock muffler on my 2006 Civic LX 4-door sedan when they rusted out. It's way cheaper than replacing them with stock mufflers, and since I like to autocross occasionally I was able to enjoy a small performance boost. Installation was easy, after I spent hours getting the stock setup off that is. Rust is a pain. These are stainless steel, so that should help prevent having to go through that ever again. Also, FYI, the stock tri-bolt flange that the long straight pipe connects to has welded-in studs. You will have to grind these off and drill out the remainder. This will likely be torturous. You have been warned. Or you could buy a new downpipe to supplement this system. This system does not include what I've seen others refer to as the downpipe, which is the first pipe after the catalytic convertor and runs the length of the engine and hooks over the front axle. This system is only from the front axle back.<br /><br />I kept the silencer in because I'm not a teenager and I don't live in my parent's basement. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being the stock exhaust and 10 being a rusted out muffler that no longer works, the volume of these range from about a 2 to a 6 with the silencer in, depending on how hard you give it gas. I momentarily listened the the exhaust with the silencer out, and I would say it was closer to a 5 to 9 range. This is just an arbitrary assessment, I didn't measure the volume levels.<br /><br />The large, mirror finish exhaust tip does seem a little out of place on a very standard looking and unwashed Civic. I painted the silencer insert black to help reduce the contrast. I may paint some more of it to hide the muffler canister some. When taking off in first, there is enough vibration that some part of the exhaust is rattling against one of the heat shields, I think. I'll have to get back under it to verify and adjust. Luckily the heat shields are thin aluminum, so they are easy to push back. UPDATE: I got under, and the connection between the straight section and the resonator was hitting the heat shield. I used some tin snips to cut away at the shield a bit (very easy) and haven't had any rattle since.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with the fit and the installation. This kit does come with all bolts and gaskets needed. It does not come with rubber hangers - you'll need to keep your originals. I do feel a little silly about the look, but then I look at my bank account and remember how much I saved over OE replacements.<br /><br />10/28/2016 UPDATE:<br />Well, I'm much less impressed now. While the tubing is stainless steel, the welding is not and has rusted through. I no longer have a working muffler. See attached image. So this was a nice solution for a year at a cheap price, but this is where it fails - durability. Granted, I live in Cleveland and drive through a lot of salt and snow, but I think a weld should last more than a year. You can see how thin the sheet metal is, too.<br /><br />Actually, upon closer inspection, I'm not sure that it's a rust issue. I think it was just a bad weld. It looks to be a pretty clean separation, and it doesn't look like the weld bonded to the sheet steel very well. Little to no inclusion - that's welder-speak for it didn't melt well enough. So now I need to replace it, and I won't be buying this again.ight section and the resonator was hitting the heat shield.

B0002Z9O8C|5|works great
B007IW09UE|5|very good
B001EAQTRI|4|I don't hear any background noise etc.
B0024G49G4|5|This product worked very well to take the oxidation off the front of my RV
B000BYEKCY|5|WORKS GREAT IN MY MOTORHOME
B00JO9ZIA0|5|Great product...
B000IOO4KK|1|I bought this item as it was advertised as re packaged at a small discount, the switch itself was good however it was missing parts witch I had to purchase on my own. Do not buy repackaged items at discount it is not worth it. I ended up spending more money over all. I should have just bought the brand new item
B0061FY004|5|Useful as all get out. They do what they are supposed to very well in most situations. I really like these. Recommended!
B008427D88|5|clips fit perfect
B000C5HSP8|5|I use to change a lot before i bought the original, it works  great and i havent had any problem since i bought the motorcraft
B005J59A3E|5|These looked like exactly what I wanted, priced right too.  I am not disappointed, they are very well made, fit well, look good, and are smooth texture, allowing sliding in and out of truck easily.  Like the pockets too, didn't think I'd use them but I do.
B004C433D6|3|Looks great but did not fit my 2010 impala
B002VV8JPY|4|Good and quick service surprisingly! Even on international purchase
B000C036T0|1|I have used many Centric parts in the past with great results. I have used Centric rotors, calipers, brake pads, and a brake master cylinder. They all worked great. I bought this part because I considered myself loyal to Centric. The part was defective right out of the box. Again, I installed a Centric brake master cylinder on my car and it worked perfectly. However this clutch master cylinder was a paperweight. It would bench bleed but it would not hold pressure when installed on the car.<br /><br />Since it bench bled with no issues, I was convinced the issues were related to air in the line. I spent an entire week, wrenching on my car after work every day, unbolting it, bench bleeding it, bolting it back up, and bleeding it with the clutch pedal. I was in denial that the part was defective out of the box because i've never had a defective Centric product.<br /><br />After giving up on bleeding it, my friend convinced me to go to my local parts zone and purchase a second clutch master cylinder, just to rule out the part being defective. After bench bleeding it and bolting it up, the parts zone part was worked flawlessly. For the first time in over a week, my clutch pedal returned under its own pressure.<br /><br />I want a week of my free time back. Centric makes decent quality brake rotors/pads but their hydraulic products are garbage.
B000CFCUKG|5|Same as other review, buy new, only few dollars more, don't destroy your ball joint boot, torque nut and do not use impact.<br />Hopefully you will never need to replace that part again.
B0000AZ9KS|5|Excellent product that performs exactly as expected.
B006BCRNYM|5|Works excellent! Saved me SO much money by not purchasing a new from the dealership.
B004IYQVDE|1|Total junk! Do not buy!!! The spline doesn't fit and the gear is mis designed such that the window does not roll down completely.
B003L643KS|5|Great
B00GUD0YPM|5|Good so far
B0016IJML8|4|Just like OEM.
B005C59E96|5|Works great
B00A0RARCE|4|I'm happy with this purchase. Gives me peace of mind .
B008A5Y4DG|5|Just exactly like factory.
B004BGN0L0|5|It works better than I thought
B00QMDY6BS|4|Simple install. Took me 30 minutes. The only idea that I would consider is that ....wiring should stay under the vehicle. Instructions have you bring wires in trunk area which makes no sense. If you buy this kit think before you cut a plastic body plug in the trunk as everything can be neatly tucked under the hitch and everything will be simpler.
B000CPAOMC|5|This clutch assembly said it would not fit my 1995 Jeep Wrangler, but after reviewing the comments of others I decided to try it.  After returning 2 other clutch assemblies that said they would fit, I now have a reliable clutch system that works.  Thanks New Generation.
B007RW2WUU|5|My local oil change place wanted too much money for the filter so I decided to order this one... Fits my 2013 Hyundai Tuscon just like the stock filter.
B00D8KXOU2|5|This looks great on the front of my ride....love the half size. Very thrilled I ordered it.
B00YC4BZAY|5|Great product and fast shipping!! A+++
B000XTHUHE|5|It's finally good to see clearly through the window again. An excellent product, will be purchasing more soon to replace the old ones. Defiantly recommend.
B00P90BKOG|5|I was skeptical at first, but this detector works quite well.
B0002SRG4S|5|These save a lot of time if you are a alignment person.
B009YAMVUY|2|Decent and comfortable. Backs are made of a light mesh instead of leather. &#34;Velcro&#34; started coming off the glove after 3 months and were pretty much unwearable after another 6 months or so.
B00P1TDM28|4|Very comfortable and my back and legs are feeling much better. My legs were going to sleep with the cushion I had before. So far not a problem with this one.
B00ESLBT6G|1|It fell apart with in a week.....I was hurt.
B001LQLTNE|4|I like it just wish it didn't cover part of the tag
B00GYDBPL0|5|looks so much better in person.
B00HUM5EWU|4|Shade fits and works well. Only negative, it's stiff and doesn't roll up to store easily. Should come with a band to secure it when stored.
B005DUUT0I|2|First of all the color is great!! Except two of the eight LED did not work what so ever!!! I made sure the year make and model were correct! The LED that goes in the trunk was too big and did not fit the two connectors and wasn't allowing the switch on the light to move from the off to the on position!!! idk if it was a mistake during packaging or whatever!
B007QBGS9I|5|Oem piece  perfect fit
B00KGSCTYG|5|very handy,keep rain gear and water
B00G620ZVU|4|very good
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I got this for my girlfriend. I was tired of seeing her reaching in the back seat to get her purse. She loves it a lot!!!!!

B00DYXTO9S|5|great!
B00OGN87DY|5|Great fit.
B0032J1KAK|4|Good.
B00A15X2WC|4|Product itself was nice and sturdy, but it did not fit our 1993 Jeep Wrangler as stated.  The seats pushed too far into the middle console.  It is possible that the seats we have are not the original seats and if they were then I'm sure the console would have fit.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|Awesome towels.  We use them to clean our cars and they work great.
B000IOJ496|5|nice chroming and worked as needed.
B0002JMEJ4|5|THANK YOU
B002QGVW3K|5|Look great, I just ordered the wrong batteries, I needed 12v and somehow bought these.
B00LD1F5ZK|3|This was not an exact fit, I had to cut off the last 6 in and weeks it to the old muffler tip to not it on. I have a 2002 subaru outback impreza.
B0001WW37U|5|Quick delivery,  super useful, and not bulky!
B008NA49II|5|This product was as advertised.  I love it.
B001DRH7TQ|5|These were a perfect fit for my wife's 2007 Hyundai Entourage Ltd.
B0043AV4NK|5|Good
B00MJLCV5U|4|Good fit and finish
B007SKAKPU|5|It works well on KIA Spectra EX 2008
B00P022BDM|5|bought this for my salesman hubby, who keeps his suit coat on it behind the drivers seat.  Works great and keeps his coat unwrinkled and clean!
B005ZI1D5I|5|Great kit for the money, but has to be installed professionally. You have to remove the front bumper to install the lights and run the wiring to the correct hot wire.
B00DO3AC1C|5|I've only used the stand 2x now.  I can't speak for longevity, but this stand has great quality and the price is right.  I've only used the rear stand thus far, while using the swingarm pads.  Overall, it worked great!  Lifted my CBR300RA perfectly and easily.  The pads tighten down & the stand feels sturdy!  It was my first time lifting a bike, and I felt confident with this stand.  Easy to assemble, and easy to use.  Couple tricks for the rear stand.  Always have your kickstand down, make sure the wheel is straight when lifting it.  When putting it back down, make sure your wheel is turned toward the kickstand (kickstand down!) that way when you let it down, it will naturally lean towards the stand.  This will avoid having your bike tip the wrong direction.  I don't think I would only use it as a front stand, I would only lift the front while already lifting the rear.  So if you want a stand for the front + rear, I'd buy a combo set.  This one however, has been perfect for me just lifting the rear.  I can use it for oil changes, chain maintenance, etc.  I definitely recommend this stand!
B00CA5POM2|5|I have a 2008 dodge caravan and my key was broken and i purchased the new key and it came on time and i called a local locksmith and he activate my new key , i truly recommend this key for anyone that have a dodge caravan.
B003RV48ES|4|not too bad
B0057FK08A|5|It work perfect on my 2011 Sonata.
B007JYYPO2|1|missing two of the nuts that hold the casters on when i opened the box. is there anyway to get replacement caster nuts?
B001DBBTO6|3|too big
B000P3WW12|5|Very solid USA made product. Good value.
B001PO9DY4|5|A very impressive modification.  Makes my Hayabusa shift smoothy for the first time in it's life.  No more riding around feeling like I'm shifting gears in a Mack truck.  Just bump the shifter and it falls right into gear.  Makes for quicker shift too.  As poorly shifting as my 2011 Busa was, I couldn't recommend this product enough.  Such an immediate and noticeable improvement.<br /><br />Installation was pretty straight forward and takes a couple hours.  But it can be done with basic tools and done with the engine/trans in the bike.  There's an excellent install write-up on the Hayabusa.org, and can be found with a Google search.<br /><br />FYI:  The arm shown in the image is not included.  You simple reuse the existing arm on the bike.
B000BZ6YRM|5|Fit perfectly for ford edge 2007 awd se. Front bearing
B00BITJZUI|2|Poor quality breaks easy as I've gone through 4. You end up having to change the latch assembly only available throug Toyota at $176!
B00IJMA56A|4|I was hesitant about purchasing these gloves at first because I have large hands. After reading reviews, I found that these would be suitable for what I wanted. They are great gloves! Good quality and material. They are a bit snug for the size but overall a great purchase for the money and quality.
B000CB2MNA|3|These were stated as a fit for my vehicle, but they did not fit without quite a bit of modification. These types of wiper refills do not seem to be available easily so I had no choice but to make them work (or send back and keep trying for a fit).
B00SZK212M|4|Could be a little brighter but over all good fit and quality.
B012N2NMSE|5|Product installed very easily – 45 minutes from unboxing to driving. It will help you to assemble everything with beforehand, such as cutting the trim pieces and fitting them on the heat shield. Also, be sure you have the tube through the shield and filter fitted before popping the hood. A little WD40 helped the tight rubber fittings go on perfectly. It's much easier to attach the rubber coupler to your turbo inlet first, then you can move the intake tube into place before fastening everything down fully. Very clean install.<br /><br />There's really only one thing you need to know about this intake aside from the HP addition...it sounds AMAZING. This thing really brought the factory blow-off valve to life, as well as greatly increase the turbo sound. At full throttle in Sport Sharp mode, this thing makes your '15 STI sound like a 747 taking off. Then, when you shift, a very audible &#34;PFFSHHHHHHHH!&#34; from the BOV...it sounds like I have an aftermarket blow-off valve, but I don't. You will absolutely turn heads with this intake.<br /><br />This unit is built extremely well with red crackle powdercoating to match your STI manifold, and has perfect fitment of heat shield. Performance wise, my butt dyno detects better turbo response with decreased lag and more top end power. No complaints whatsoever, no check engine lights, no hassle. Just a great intake that brings HP and great sounds to your 2015 STI.<br /><br /> Important to note that this one of the few intakes for the 2015 STI that does not require a tune. It could benefit from a tune, sure, but it will not make your stock STI throw a CEL or run poorly.
B002PQW6NG|5|I cant beleive that I spent all that money over the last couple of years on those &#34;as seen on TV headlight restoration products&#34;....Save your money, No, DON&#34;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  Buy the headlights. Super easy to install! I actually had a friend ask me if I got a new car !!!!! (I have a 2005 Volvo XC90!).<br /><br />I did have a quality control issue w/ one of the units..the passenger side headlight bulb was misaligned...the bulb pointed practically straight down. But these guys made it super easy to return for replacement...can't beat that!  Now go order ya some new headlights!!
B0002UEPVI|5|Great item
B00GTXSB9Y|5|Genius!  Much lighter than the original and makes it so....much easier to identify which set goes to which model.
B003ZWJF3I|2|WE RETURNED THIS ITEM DIDN;'T FIT HER CAR.  BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF IT DID.
B00KTHWXH2|4|Works fine but it can be pricey getting a locksmith to program it. I paid half price because he wanted cash.
B00E3EWNVS|1|These things are worthless, first time I took them off they ripped !!!!!!! GRRRRRRR
B004I16A6U|5|Fits and works great.
B0083SL82A|1|These mirrors don't hold up during spirited acceleration. I ride a '06 Kawa Z1000 and accelerating with 60% or more throttle makes these mirrors droop down to an unusable level. Instead, I think these mirrors will work better on slower sport bikes or cruisers where rapid acceleration isn't an issue. I will need to replace these with something else very soon. I should also mention that the vibration is ridiculously bad.<br /><br />The design (shape and geometry) of the mirror and the mount is cool, it won't make your handlebars stick out much longer (for tight situations), and the blue tint on the mirror itself is useful at blocking glare during the day or headlights at night.<br /><br />Unfortunately these mirrors obviously aren't &#34;heavy duty&#34; or made for all &#34;street bikes&#34; so the product title is a very misleading. I would say this is for small and vibration-less street bikes. The aesthetic design gets 3.5 stars, but the function gets 1, and it's useless if it doesn't function. 1 star from me.
B00KTICEZ2|5|This was one the best products I have bought off Amazon.
B000C5GAQQ|2|used  amazon garage to match up the part to my car, 2005 ford focus zx4. its ill fitting. i've heard it click when i put it on but the check fuel cap light is still lit. i guess it's the bargain you make when you buy online.
B00JGQM1WO|5|If your looking for 10K between changing out your engines oil then this is the stuff for you!!! Great oil at a killer price. Thanks Castrol!!!!!
B00Z515O5K|2|These jumper cables weren't able to get the job done for me.  I needed a heavy duty set.
B00FMONAJC|5|Looks real. Nice.
B00SS3UUGA|5|Just perfect as described. Love them.
B0009H51YY|5|Fram is just the best at the best price.  What more do you need?
B0058KYUWQ|5|no problems
B006WQSL8Y|1|Do not buy from Detroit axle the WORST , WORST PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AND JENNY IF THATS HER NAME WAS THE MOST RUDE AND WAS UNPROFESSIONAL  , both bearings went out after 5 months of having them on and like other reviews all problems are the same with this , as a consumer I work hard for my money , do not buy this junk And when you see these other people rate this product 5 stars don't believe  the hype it's people working for the company  giving them the rating because of all the BAD feedback
B001EOV40Q|3|The vehicle has a 4 pin connector and the trailer has a 6 pin round which matches this pigtail cable.  The white wire is not connected inside the wire bundle.  I crimped the two white wires together (so that the white has a connection in both the 4 and 6 pin sides(.  The cable works great now.
B00AEI7Z88|1|Does not fit
B000OAG2DK|5|The slide on and off is the best. Also shower head almost did not fit in my exterior shower box but with manuvering GENTLY! It fit. The shower head delivers a strong stream of water. Not a dribble as the push button.
B0012WHBSO|4|can't wait to try it, seems well built
B005GVU7UG|5|Good quality. Used on my wastegate for a external screamer pipe.
B00769SBMM|5|Awesome product easy to install
B00IO952ES|4|Mechanic provided correct truck specs and back breaks were not the correct kind. Front breaks matched up perfectly and were top quality.
B0049W2XFK|5|Just what I expected !
B000C5DUN2|5|Ford branded and the instructions I found elsewhere for installation were accurate.
B00AQJYF2E|4|Wish I had a second key so that I could program this myself, instead of blowing $50 at the dealership
B00FRM7ETQ|5|Denso manufactures most of the Japanese and Asian OE wiper blades, hard to find at the auto store, they really last as the one that the car came with. All Denso products are high quality
B0030311FC|3|Capacity not even close to how it was advertised. Purchased to load motorcycle weighing 800 lbs. The first thing you find when opening the package is a sheet of paper with a disclaimer stating the the advertised load has to be evenly distributed through-out the length of the unit.  You can't just place 750 lb onto a ramp.  Just walking to the center of one ramp with my 150 lb causes a lot of flex.  My guess is at the center the ramps might support 220lb each. Also the platform width is 2&#34; shorter than stated because they include the protruding bolts in the measurement.  I have to use 3 ramps covered with a thick sheet of plywood in order to better distribute the weight and stabilize the motorcycle.  The mesh surface however is very nice.  The product is ok but in my world when a ramp is rated at 750 lb you shouldn't have to be thinking 100lb on one end of the ramp and 100lb there and another 100lb there.
B00E9L574K|5|Great addition to a JAWS themed party! Many didn't realize what it was for until we watched the movie and the tiger shark autopsy scene happened. After I received a lot of, &#34;Nice touch, cool plate, I was wondering why you had that etc..&#34; Perfectly packed, arrived in perfect condition!
B00BCRMA9Y|3|Seats covers were great. Just did not fit like instructions said. So currently they are collecting dust under the bench seat in my truck.
B001NAUBU0|5|Always an excellent product and prompt delivery via Amazon.
B000BUU5T0|4|I use this to flush out the hose and valve area, every time I drain the tanks. It is a must have, and being transparent, you can see when things are clean. I keep it hooked up to the tank(s) connection, 100% of the time. I Carry a spare, because I don't want to be without it....and if you get a tight hose connection, one can (have done it) break off the garden hose connection, if you hold it there (no place else to hold) when you are trying to disconnect the tight hose. Anti seize helps at the connect to keep this from happening.  Still, this could be a little bit stronger in the vulnerable area.
B00LNJI1KI|5|For the price you can't beat it
B000IYNVKE|5|It's a great replacement for the original AC fan to replace in your 98 Toyota RAV4, it can be a bit challenging to wiggle out to replace but buying this fan I saved over $650 over having a mechanic replace it.
B00KE89PRC|5|Great stickers but I should have found a little smaller ones.
B00DP3MFQ6|5|Surprisingly deep and delicious for such an affordable cat-back :)
B005N53C9I|4|Fits a 2002 Hyudai Elantra nicely. I don't think this will work for newer vehicles because of the side airbags.
B00JET1NRW|5|lightweight and comfortable. perfect for hot weather!
B009TB66OA|5|These mud flaps fit very nicely on the front of the vehicle.  I installed them on a vehicle without fender flares and all three inner screw holes can be used to secure the mud flap. The shape of the mud flap fits the front very well.<br /><br />The back is a different story. I mounted the rear mud flaps at the same height as the front and the most inner screw hole doesn't touch the fender so it couldn't be used.  No biggie. I believe the two holes that are there will provide enough support.  If not, I could always add an additional hole in the mud flap.  The shape of the mud flap doesn't match the shape of the rear fender as well as the front. But it looks just fine.<br /><br />Despite a few small complaints I would have no problem recommending these to a friend.
B00KA0VOBY|5|Excellent product
B00BERR4C0|1|Fell off right away
B00JDPQ7AA|5|Extremely comfortable helmet and the design is amazing!
B00WJOG4BO|5|They look great and make my jeep look tuff!!
B0071I2OGC|1|It claimed to be an ORM part but, it was not. The whole reason for needing it was to put a blinking turn signal behind it but the tint much to dark to even see the light. On my passenger side (the original) mirror it works perfect. It's almost like looking through a window when looking through it from the back side off the mirror.
B000K0080W|5|It was perfect
B000C9GYTA|5|Worked perfect at a great price!
B00EECLMWK|5|I was a little skeptical St first buying these but I read some good customer reviews and decided to try them. Can't beat it for the price of 2 bulbs compared to just one from the dealer was over 100. Not to mention when replacing just one HID bulb they are different colors which annoys me so the 2 pack is perfect
B00JG3OIFU|5|fast shipping fair price
B00CJJ48OY|5|LOtta noise...good/excellent horn
B00B4XBQPU|4|It worked fine and was what I expected
B00KTHXLIC|5|Using instructions on the Internet for programming the key, we were able to make a dup key for our 2002 Toyota Camry.<br /><br />The biggest problem was finding a place to cut the key. All the marts and home improvement places refused to cut it- they wanted us to buy their transponder key, at about $80+. We finally had a guy at one place cut it, even though he was not supposed to, and it worked fine. Before buying this key, you might want to check around for a place that will cut a blank you provide- our next one will probably be cut at a local flea market since no store will do it.
B00NALMLPS|5|Installed on the underside of my dash, lights work great ! I will be using this company for future lighting purchases.
B003LS15XY|5|As expected as usual.
B00C566JSY|2|Somehow is just as loud as the stock muffler, which had a hole rusted through it. Fits and looks fine, though no indicator of which direction it's supposed to flow through on product or packaging.
B00SH0SS3G|5|I needed some support for my neck and shoulders while I drive and this is perfect. Very comfortable.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Used it for Bmw 335,  Used the Bmw Carly app, working good so far. Biggest thing is getting connected once you are it's ok. I'm able to retrieve codes that my regular scanner wasn't able to retrieve. I'm also able to code, it. I brought BMW data cable to use but it was to much hassle trying to download files and other things, plus direction was in Chinese.
B000CPHXS0|5|This fit my 2000 Toyota, rear wheel drive, 4 Runner! It does NOT have pre-drilled holes in it, but it is easy to make holes in. It DOES come with 8,  3/4&#34; Phillips head screws and easy to understand instructions to install the splashguards. I did not need all of the screws, and you probably won't either, but it is nice that they include so many, rather than just enough for the job. The set comes with both the right and left side.  Looks nice on the car and does it's job.  MUCH cheaper than the $109 afterparts replacement for 1 splashguard it would have cost me from the dealer!
B00EQ1IOS4|5|A high quality set from Smittybilt.
B00ZDWAGVI|5|Easy to install and does what it is supposed to.  No complaints here!
B00JR066FM|4|Covers fit well
B004SJS9E8|5|Made in japan not China and five minutes to install
B001O28622|5|was a good price, seems to be working good
B000GU1XOQ|5|Gracias
B00YUXVC1Y|5|Looks good feels solid. Have to cut plastic to install any of these.
B007MAYUYI|1|I ordered a 2.5&#34; front leveling kit, I was sent a 2&#34; leveling kit, I returned it for replacement. I was sent another 2&#34; kit. I'm not happy, I have to use the 2&#34; because I got to get truck back on the road, can't keep waiting due to incompetent personnel
B000Y8YL1W|4|Great dryer for limted apartment space, large quilts may take a second round of drying. The only problem I found was that the cord was too short.
B00HG7G7SO|5|Works great
B0038B49AA|5|Great fit 99 prelude
B00B4ZFGBS|5|Only complaint is that it did not come with instructions.  Thankfully there are many videos to watch for installation.
B000FQ1LKW|5|This save time not having to use RTV  I would buy again. Just check which differential you have.
B000YC6QCK|4|Like this item. It is light weight and flexible.  Would take a lot to penetrate it.  My only complaint is that the outer lip is low.  It would not contain a spill of any volume.  If I need it for anything it would most likely be a spill.
B000TYQ9GQ|5|Easy to install! 🌟
B005HJMX4U|5|Does what it's supposed to hides the key.
B005CDNCQO|5|Perfect
B008X02RK0|1|Ordered two at the same time, they showed up on different days, I'm glad I didn't buy tires from them, product is too firm for Buick, wouldn't order again.
B00GUCI7MA|1|Does NOT come like photo shown. I expected the item to be exactly like the photo shown and was told by customer service that it would come looking the same as the one in the photo. Instead, i got the older Chevy emblem, the plain flat piece of gold colored plastic, and not the newer logo, the gold and metal bordered emblem.
B000CF8W1W|5|Fits my Tacoma nicely.  Easy to install and they look sharp.
B00ANWV6C6|1|Flimsy.  Cover broke when I tried to install it.  Not worth the money, time or effort.
B007VRCTIQ|5|very quick delivery and awesome product
B003L2ZQ9E|5|The Royal Purple filter is one of the most efficient automotive filters on the market. I spent my whole career in industrial hydraulic systems and the top hydraulic filters always used the fiberglass mat as the filter media. The heavy duty construction is a great additional feature. Having been using them for years and would never use anything else. I would recommend anyone considering this filter to watch the video on the Royal Purple website.
B00E9FPY3U|5|Just what I wanted thanks
B00860PK4M|3|Cross Bars fit and it appears that they will work just fine, still waiting on my Kayak carriers so I can put everything to use.
B00P2D3VZG|5|Installed these as both parking/DRL lights and license plate lights. So much better than the cheap Chinese junk I had before. Immediately out of the package you can tell that they're much better material quality and construction. The color temp is right where I want it to be (cool white). We'll see how long they last, but so far it's been a few months and they're still going strong.
B008QPTV2E|5|Great product.. good quality...
B000KL3AJW|3|They do not stay put, move around to much
B00B8ZDRFG|5|This was perfect for my son's car and loved the price..
B00ZM9LANA|5|I bought this backseat organizer to put in my Toyota Camry for my 7 year old twins.<br /><br />They constantly are leaving their belongings on the chair , only for me to find them weeks later stuffed in between the cracks or behind the chair.<br /><br />This solves that problem , giving them a place to put  my Ipad, which fits great, and a place for all of the other things  i need to keep them from fighting in the backseat with each other.<br /><br />This was easy to attach and had an adjustable strap to keep it all securely in place.<br /><br />I noticed lately i don't have as much unbuckling of seat belts to grab their dropped items as before.<br /><br />This does also come with a cute complementary trash bag , great for throwing unwanted receipts , or wrappers from the kids candy.<br />It has a Velcro bottom that makes it super easy to just open and dump out.  No work involved.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. However I don't just give glowing reviews to a product just because i received it free or a discount. If my review helped you in any way please click the &#34; LIKE &#34; button!
B0010DZZSI|1|I just found out that this is incorrect fit for a 2010 Toyota Corolla. Fram CF10285 is the correct one. I ordered this Dec 2014 for my spare. When was about to install it today found out it's to big. Trying to figure out how to return this filter back. I guess it's to late now. Hoping some one from Amazon can assist or help me how to return this item.
B00E3UM2RC|5|My husband loves these glasses. He said he tried to break them but wasn't successful.
B0002JMDFO|5|If you like the exterior of your vehicle to be clean & shiny this product is a must !  Wipe dust off first.  Then  you spray, wipe dry, and you have a shiny, smooth surface. It's so easy you'll be coming back for more.
B00GV8K2HQ|1|It's a normal sticker.  I would have given it more stars if it weren't for the huge typo.  The Pegasus is in the 62nd Battlestar Group, not the 63rd.  As a huge Scifi fan, I can't stand this, it's terrible.
B00BCRMBSO|1|Did not order this!
B00JOHYK7Y|4|got these they r very cute try them !
B0002JMLQU|5|The number of times my transmission has shuddered since applying this 'fix' has greatly reduced.<br />It was occurring nearly every single time I used my car, now lucky if it happens once a month.<br />Going to install the transgo kit to try and correctly fix the issue, but this product has done wonders to my 4T65E trany for the last 2 months of use.
B00DSR466G|4|Better than I expected loved it really matched my car
B000E2CVDI|5|Used one of these previously on my bike. Easy install and removal! I like it.
B00008RW9V|4|helps clean quick
B009FUF6DM|5|Cheap and good quality
B001JT5OGG|5|Perfect
B000VU57YS|5|Fits great. Great product.
B000C5UFK8|1|Product was defective, throwing a circuit error code. Reinstalled the old one & code went away, Cannot return cause its over 30 days. Very disappointed and out $50.00
B000EQLCU2|4|The graywerks exhaust header arrived in good shape. Some of the welds were a bit sloppy and burned in to deep but they will hold. I have installed dorman exhaust headers on various jeeps that I have owned with no trouble but this one wouldn't fit properly on my 99 Jeep Wrangler with a 4.0 engine. It was crashing into the intake manifold at port six as others have mentioned. I had to put a small dent in the tube coming of of cylinder six in order for it to fit. After it was installed I notice that the throttle seemed to have a quicker response and the jeep had a bit more pep. The engine had a deaper tone to it that was vary noticeable. My exhaust turns down just past the muffler so it can be a bit loud but not bad. I'm interested to find out how it sounds when I get an exhaust pipe ran. Only time will tell if or when the header cracks as so many do. So far I am pleased with it.
B004W4OG0U|1|Do not by unless you are willing to change out the bulbs continuously. I am on my fourth set of bulbs since I bought them a year ago.  Horrible purchase
B00LMF0ZY8|5|Nice speskers. Sounds good.
B00B0QA22E|1|was missing a part not able to use it
B000CAINDE|5|Item as described delivered.
B005FNKSMW|1|Didn't fir the car it was supposed to
B00B7RBDMO|5|Fairly easy installation. I noticed a huge difference after installing this on my 98 Silverado. No more steering wheel jerking when you hit a pothole and my steering parts have lasted much longer once this was installed. I would recommend this to anyone who is running larger than 33&#34; tires.
B00YOC99HU|5|I just received these window shades yesterday...I love them...being that I live in Florida...they are a wonderful addition to my front windows when riding down the interstate
B00823FSRC|5|Super fast shipping, I have a 12' kayak weights about 80lb I also load the kayak with chairs and beach towels and other things that we used wile at the beach  and this cart handles all the load very well. The beach I use the cart has somewhat of hard sand haven't use it in soft sand yet but I believe it won't be a problem.  I defenetly recommend the cart, I have the one with the solid wheels and theirs no smell at all and for the price I payed compared to other places I sure I wouldn't mind a little smell.
B00T6GG0T4|5|as described
B00IKKS4W8|5|Purchased these to add two more to our travel trailer now there is no more rocking when people are walking in the camper. Husband says these are better quality then the ones that came with the trailer
B00480J4PU|2|Just 20℅ more light than regular ones.
B001HBWKC2|1|After buying this item once and having the bmw emblem on the pin break off after almost no use and buying a second one and having the same exact break occur (obvious design defect), I can affirm first hand this item is complete garbage.
B00LOCCSKS|5|works as expected
B00AM1Z67O|5|Worked great!
B006CRT72W|5|Worked great, programmed easily with included instructions.  What a bargain!
B001FIDNGO|5|wish i had seen that they make these a few years ago.  keeps my belt right in place, no issues!
B0068C3ACO|5|This stuff is fantastic!  Purchased some to clean the hideously large cat and headers of my BMW S1000R and it worked like a charm.  I've used other metal polishes before that required either tons of elbow grease or a powered buffer, but for this I just used the included sponge and very little effort.  Of course, this isn't going to turn your rusted carbon steel into a finish of gleaming mirror-like chrome.  It's not magic dust, people.<br /><br />A little goes a long way, in fact, unless you operate a metal polishing business out of your garage, this is probably a lifetime supply.<br /><br />The residue afterwards does take a little more than just running a hose across it for clean-up, especially if it has dried.  Just a little rubbing while rinsing removes it easily.<br /><br />If you've been procrastinating cleaning that filthy metal you have laying about, your worries are over.
B004UQIUKW|5|Works good. Reusable.
B003P64XU4|5|Works as advertised.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Love this organizer. Very study and perfect to hold grocery items as well as smaller items purchased. Keeps everything from sliding or rolling around the trunk space. Would highly recommend.
B0058EHH18|2|The color is exactly as shown. The mats themselves I guess you get what you pay for. The mats already have the material/threads balling up and coming off, it looks like big fur balls all over my car. They will not stay down on your floorboard at all, they slide all over, even on your carpet. They obviously do not have hooks to hook them on your floorboards, which was fine with me as i expected them not to have those, but because of the way the bottom is made, you don't stand a chance of them staying in one spot on the floor.<br /><br />These just really seem poorly made all the way around. I would not recommend these to anyone unless you just cannot afford to get better ones.
B000P7O5DG|5|Works.
B00S7BJ0U0|5|Excelent, Great product on time!
B005JU5VH8|5|I went through several Goodyear blades from Costco on my 2003 Cadillac Deville, and always had the same spot on the driver's side windshield that wouldn't get dry.  As soon as I installed the Bosch, the problem disappeared, and I can see well in the rain for the first time in years.  This is a great product, and worth stocking up on when they go on sale.
B00VNBDWPK|4|It is bright alright, but not far enough. I like it! I replaced my old Opt-7 HID kit that throws far, kinda miss that one but this one shows a solid light with no dark spot, designed well, but would be better if it throws a little further. If my Prius is happy I am happy.
B000C92MSC|4|went right in
B00DCZXA7K|5|These wer kinda a pain in the ass to install without removing all the plastics... you will wants a pick set for sure!  Also the white wire that comes unplugged is what leaves the light on when you turn your key on.... leave it unplugged and it will only come on when you use the blinker. The risistor works great, no fast blinking is nice!
B0065FRBZ6|5|It is larger than expected but a fabulous bag. I wish it was 4 inches smaller
B000VB8F32|5|It is a little crazy to me how excited my husband was to receive these, but he was thrilled. The mats fit perfectly in his car and he is a very happy camper.
B000GOG3QK|5|Blows like a storm
B00B8QFMZ8|4|GOOD FIT!, only problem is that sometime connection comes loose with car vibration, needs to be taped so it wont come loose.  No need to cut holes on bumper like instruction says.  You can insert the cable from one of the cover openings in the bumper.<br />Remote only works when you are with in 4 feet.  Looks great.  Its a little pricey.. but does look very nice.. so nice treat if you are into your cars.
B0016GRTVU|1|The handle would not extend. I had two other people look at it. The handle was bent and therefore the pole was locked in place.
B001TLC12E|5|I got these seat covers because I recently bought a used car and the seats were beyond dirty. After trying to clean it over and over again I decided to get covers. The difference is amazing. It was a little hard to install the back seat bucket covers but i got it.
B00JC8I2M4|1|Product does not come out of wand well; it doses not come out or go on heavy enough to cover a gouged out metal scratch on surface of car.  Dries lumpy, terrible...scratch looks worse now than if I had done nothing to it.
B00LTL0VX0|5|I have air in my crv again. Saved $ too! Thank you!
B006WQSD1O|5|Thank you it was perfect. .
B005XOVOUI|1|Junk wouldn't waste $.50on this item again
B00E16XFMY|5|Nice Product, gonna upload pics when installed.<br />The down side is that the instructions are in korean
B00MB01NKI|5|Worth the price.
B000CQI1X0|1|I don't remember where I first bought the entire Wolo 2-horn set (Hi-lo), but after honking perhaps 5 times, the high tone horn failed. So I replaced it 8 months ago with the same hi-tone Wolo 385 horn purchased here on Amazon. This high tone horn has also failed after honking the horn 5-6 times in the past year. (I live in the country, so don't have to use the horn very much. But it should not be failing in 8 months). Why the high tone continues to fail, while the low tone still works is beyond me. But I'm going to find some other product.
B0137OJISU|5|Fast delivery, exactly what I needed to secure my tractor on a flat bed trailer. Great price!!
B002FDGTD2|5|Awesome  slip on exhaust,  instructions were clear and easy to understand  and to install. It's sound great just what I was looking for. It is a head turner!
B002095DIS|5|Smooth application.
B0012GTVVA|5|This works great. No more pulling on the small door handle to close the screen door(or both doors when connected). Installing was easy and the instructions are included. I don't foresee any issues with this product in the future. Camco did good on this one.
B00KDRDVU6|4|The hub caps arrived as ordered. Installation was easy and they seem very secure so far.
B001B57J5W|4|Fit perfect and drivability is great
B000E7SY16|5|Great assortment of good quality bungee cords.
B0009IQZH0|5|I live in an old house with large, single pane windows and high humidity. I attack the humidity problem on several fronts, but when it's really cold outside in the winter I get a lot of condensation on the windows. These towels are great for wiping them down. They absorb an amazing amount of water and leave no lint on the glass. I then wring them out and hang them outside to dry. I've had them for at least two years and they've held up well. To keep them absorbent I don't use fabric softeners in my laundry--instead I add a half cup of white vinegar to the wash and a half cup to the rinse. This keeps towels soft and absorbent without any scent or residue.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Great scanner, did just what I needed and at the best price I could find.
B00L8BM6FC|5|I like pretty and these are pretty
B00H03GBSA|5|nice size and color nice
B008032NJK|5|Was exactly was i wanted,and showed up quick.absolutely would order again, if i needed anything.
B00RCKB10E|5|Very cute!!!!
B007S0LDME|5|Have only had an opportunity it to use this a couple times because I don't camp much in the summer in AZ!! But based on other reviews, I think this will meet my needs well.
B001COAS78|5|Fit my 2004 ML500 perfectly and solved the crank but no start issue.
B004QEKGA0|2|Poor quality. The 2&#34; adapter does not fit a 2&#34; receiver to hold the carrier properly. The entire unit wabbles from side to side.
B000C13UF4|5|Exact fit, worked as it should.
B00K6L79K2|5|Fir my 1991 Toyota Dolphin perfectly!!
B002UZEC9I|5|Once again great delivery and price.
B004AIDK50|5|fixed my 2005 chevy tahoe from blowing hot air all the time.
B008E7QWQM|5|It didn't work for my car, but the seller was amazing about the return.
B000BQMGTG|4|Since it is summer I've not had the opportunity to push snow from my vehicle to date.  However, product appears to be well made.  If wishes came true, then I wish to never have to use this snow pusher.  But living in Penna, we will get plentry of snow come this winter.  Oh well, I can still dream and hope.
B003YKXTSI|4|Everything works and appears to be of good quality, the item is larger and heavier than I anticipated though.
B00GRHRTEU|2|Solid mirrors...but not good if you want to see out of them!  They work for light traffic, but you'll be head checking if you don't want to hit anything!
B003YKXTSI|1|Bought over three of these.  All broke within couple days. Very cheap
B001Q8DMC8|4|It will be too short if you have a fancy sports car..
B00OHZ20X4|3|It serves its purpose for  protecting the garage floor. It is a bit bulky.
B0007QGT1G|5|Lubricates the engine. I like.
B00IO4EYMY|5|Good product at a good price. Very quick delivery.and packaged nicely
B0015PI7A4|5|Great tester!! Worth every penny.
B0049ESKAU|5|Great product
B00BD4VT0M|5|One of the best chargers for the money, even if you think you don't need four slots you will eventually. Buy nice or buy twice
B00F6BBY8A|4|Fit just right! Love them
B0081KM6Q2|5|exelente
B00N4GZ8NQ|5|It better than I expected( the turn signals work and I didn't have them before), and they look great, and yes they fit a 2005 half-ton Avalanche.
B002KR85Y4|1|Igot these shocks and installed them March of 2014 I rode my 2010RZR 4times and one of the shocks start leaking with less 130miles. I got the shocks from Powersport Superstore. I call them about problem and they said for me to call Progressive Suspension with no satisfaction.  Iwould advise any to think twice about dealing with shocks. You cannot buy a single shock so you are struck with having to buy them again because I have them on the front.
B008IK507W|5|Great
B002XL2IBS|5|This was needed to blast/break-up the sediment out of the bottom of our water heater.  I also replaced the drain spigot with a 3/4&#34; ball valve.  required a 3/4&#34; nipple, 3/4&#34; ball valve, 3/4 nipple to 3/4 hose thread - $12 at Home Depot for these parts..  Huge difference in access to drain the sediment.  The chunks could not exit the tank through the factory installed drain spigot - hole was too small and clogged often.  The 3/4&#34; drain allows stuff to flow freely out of it.<br /><br />I had to go this route after my water heater kept popping when heating indicating there was still significant sediment in there.
B00HXCD5G4|5|Awesome Sound! A+++
B001NG8I8G|5|As for as I can tell by now I think it is working very well, little early to know for sure
B00QW271SY|5|good
B00BDVNEGM|5|Great parts and a fraction of the stealers prices. No problems...cool runnin!
B00QSLNGEW|2|These would turn on and blink, but they would blink fast just the way the car did when the factory build was burnt out. This happened on two vehicles. The vehicles can't detect the new bulls is there, so it still thinks the light is out or blown.
B0007TQWK6|1|Don't buy. Does not work. Coloring will not cure . Rip off.  Should have headed the other reviewers. I am surprised that Amazon would sell something that poor.
B0017ODSAW|5|Received as promised.  Just what I was looking for and a great price!
B00CODHRYS|3|Okay for a $20 set. I had to buy a 2nd set because 1 of the 4 hubcaps fell off.  Now I have three back up.  Not the greatest quality but good for the price.  Looks nice on my car and I dont think anyone would know it was a $20 set unless I told them.
B001DKRF2M|4|just installed, too soon to know how well it works
B0012S9A5U|5|Awsome tool and well made as well.
B00PV6TVZI|5|Was exactly as advertised and it works great! They even sent extra lights in case some didn't work.
B000MK2CD6|5|Excellent product
B00267PZUK|5|as advertised
B0051NNI1Y|5|received this cover today, and it FITS perfectly, was easy to install and looks great on truck.  with all the help from the seller this event was nothing short of great, easy and perfect in every way.
B002MB57UI|5|It is only 10 oz. Tell your mechanic to add this product when you change your ATF fluid, conventional or synthetic, AT has to be protected as much as your engine, there are many clutches inside.
B007VOI1WW|5|After searching everywhere for a Sunshield that would fit in my 2015 Chevy Sonic Sedan, I finally found one!!!  The dimensions of my windshield are roughly 33 in by 44 in and most of the shields I've found only go up to 29 in tall. This, understandably, was a problem with my car. This covercraft one; however, fits amazingly. Yes, it is custom!! It has to be for the amazing fit!. Furthermore, the material of the shield is the most sturdy I've ever seen for a sunshield. It seems like it will last as long as the car without any problems of falling apart or getting black dust (like some others). I got the silver color, but the other colors are probably just as great.  I love it and will consider this brand for any future vehicles and recommend it to all of my friends!  I'm not sure what was wrong with the other reviewer who gave it one star; perhaps he/she ordered from someone other than Amazon as the merchant. I ordered direct from Amazon in case it didn't fit and I needed to return it. It came fast (2 days with prime) and it was in excellent condition; not folded inappropriately and boxed well.
B000HI0UK0|5|Works great.  No complaints.  Used it to suck out clutch/brake fluid.  Since brake fluid is caustic I don't expect the seals to last forever.  But for the price is but another one day.
B00W3HHYNO|1|I purchased this item. The package arrived on time in good condition.  They produce no headlight beam at all. Only glare. They light up the sky and the bushes right next to the vehicle. There is no visibilty down the road as is required of a head light high beam. They are therefore dangerous. I removed them 1 hour after installing.  These bulbs are not safe, are most probably illegal in the USA and are ineffective. I don't recommend this product!
B004YK4S1O|5|Received quickly and just as shown.
B003JHDVJS|5|Pricey but does the job.
B00IWGL7ZQ|4|Little bigger than expected,but nice good material.
B005A3YCDS|5|Perfect fit. Five minute install. Great product.
B000OQHS8M|1|Ordered these from 3 different suppliers and none of them matched this picture. Returned them all for refund. I needed pliers shown in the picture to get a snap ring off of a 01 Honda Civic LX  air conditioning compressor.  The skinny long fingers and the 1-2&#34; shaft diameter made the tool in the picture perfect for the job.
B000PMBW78|5|Fit my 2006 Yamaha 150hp 4-stroke perfectly. Had no problems with bottom plate at all. Set even came with new woodruff key<br />and o-rings. I would recommend this set for anyone that has this model engine. Did run into one problem with my model engine. It had a impeller retainer on the shaft just above<br />the impeller. Did not take me long to figure it out though. Had to carefully remove stainless steel cap off of nylon compression sleeve by prying it upwards with a screwdriver. Then nylon compression sleeve has slit on one side where you can pry it apart just enough to slide it upwards off the shaft. Be carefull not to damage this part because kit does not come with one. Just lay everything out in the order you removed it then reassemble in reverse order. Hope this helps someone. Thanks for reading my review.
B00FQJUZK0|5|Seems to be identical to OEM heater core tubes on '02 Frontier V6 XE Crew Cab.  Does not include new mounting screws but does include new gaskets.
B00GSAUHB8|5|The product is excellent. Great quality, light weight, fits both my SUV and my van perfectly. Works as described, but that is not the best part. The customer service provided by AutoFXProducts is by far above and beyond. They are so proactive in ensuring you are satisfied with the product and even provide tips and tricks to use and maintain the sun protector. You can tell they have pride in their product. Price was perfect as well. Thank you!
B00EQCVQ4M|1|The item description says that these brackets will fit on 35mm to 43mm forks. That is a complete lie, these things won't even fit on 37mm forks. The only way is to bend both pieces heavily, but by doing that you miss up the whole bracket. DO NOT BUY THESE BRACKETS!!! Do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more on better ones, so you don't have to deal with this crappy seller.<br />Thanks and I hope this helps others not to make the same mistake I did.
B00QW2A60O|5|Got a 2nd pair and tinted them yellow! Since I opened it I decided to add a layer of silicone in front of the rubber gasket to make it more waterproof.
B00ISEOM7C|5|Very good.
B000IYISY8|5|Great fit.
B00PX7YTF2|5|Solid feel. Hope I don't have to use it.
B00CXUHNXW|2|They don't seem to accept other light bulbs
B003U830OC|5|Very nice replacement.
B001F7CF32|5|Replaced the downstream O2 sensor on my 2006 Civic LX 4-door sedan. Works perfectly. No errors thrown. No wires to splice. Direct fit and clips into the existing harness. Even comes with thermal anti-seize paste.
B001DHHN3Q|5|GREAT
B007USCMJM|4|I've been against DIY A/C repair because a leak is a leak and it needs to be repaired before you refill the system. This changed recently<br />when the A/C in my 17 year old Sebring JX convertible stopped blowing cold, even though it worked fine the week before. A trip to a local<br />repair shop brought the news it would be $97 alone to diagnose the system and check for leaks. I was even willing to pay that but I would<br />have had to leave the car there all day. Since the compressor was still running and thus there was still pressure in the system I decided to<br />try A/C PRO, and it actually worked as advertised. After a month the pressure reading is still the same as it was when I refilled it, and the<br />temperature of the air coming out of the outlet is 55 deg F ( which is in the OK 45 to 64 deg F range at 80 deg ambient temp according to<br />the Chrysler manual ) so I must have a very tiny leak or the &#34;conditioning&#34; agents sealed system the o-rings.  I purchased this refill bottle to bring the system up to 40 psi from the 35 psi that the ACP-100 kit filled the system to. If it stays at 40 psi when I recheck it next spring<br />it will have been worth the money and effort.<br /><br />Update: It is now nearly one year later and the system on the Sebring Convertible is still running perfectly.  :)
B000CFUBBQ|5|Perfect Fit
B0089YEGAO|5|Worked perfectly.
B00NT5U52Q|3|Fabric has more yellow in it than any other color.  Bought it for the blues and lavenders. Also fabric is like cotton-not very thick at all.
B00CPL8PSG|4|Didn't really notice anything different but I trust liqui moly
B00IIWCIIO|2|2nd set of MAX brakes. Bought a set for my Lincoln LS and gave em a second shot on my MKZ. Both sets squealed, not my first brake job, replaced the pads and squeak went away. Rotors do look very nice but the squeak was unbearable.
B00LT1Z3FG|5|great
B0094MG0VI|5|Just cool
B008G3KG70|5|These fit perfect and can't be beat at any price  . why waste hours cleaning your old lens when in about 5 minutes your riding with brand new nice and clear super brite lights
B000CQOIOG|3|returned ,didn't recieve item as pictured
B00VGPJB3U|1|Top metal  WAY TO THIN!!! screws went through top plate. Not to happy thumbs down. 1/4 star
B007GMHTQ8|4|Need better gaskets at the connection points to avoid water getting into the pipes and rusting. Until then, just make sure to take it off in inclement weather.
B0049TVI1I|4|good quality good fit.
B004GC1CEG|5|Thank you, product works well, use it often!
B00JCGZI2S|5|worked well and very reasonable
B00Q6DNVCE|3|Typical Chinese made plastic RV part. It would not surprise me if the spring was mild steal only to rust out in a few months. You get that feel with these. However, unless you spend double (or more) for the metal ones, this is what is typically available to RV owners.
B00NTOJU28|2|Extremely bright, but poorly constructed.  The heatsink popped off while I was trying to install it.  I had some heatsink paste and put it back on, but a hassle.
B000NW8CXC|5|Nice heavy duty unit. Said made in USA which was a real bonus for AC Delco lately. Works excellent. Great price. You don't realize how worn yours is till you replace it with a good one like this
B00Q7GEUW0|5|Awesome, these will fit a 1995 Jeep Wrangler, but, what we found cool was that they will also fit a bench seat in a large truck as well! The cover comes with panels that simply zip in in about 1-2 foot increments that allow you to make the cover fit whatever bench seat you have. We were really impressed. They arrive faster than scheduled and are better quality than we found at the local auto parts store and fore so much less!!!
B00XP74RXG|4|I needed 2 of these but just accepted the fact that every 2pk came with a &#34;Rose Red&#34; cover (I wanted a blue & a pink to match my phone case), so I just settled for this set. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the &#34;Rose Red&#34; is actually a vibrant pink (kinda what I suspected given the fact that you can see the flash in the pic). The shipping was also VERY fast seeing how it came from China. I got my package within a week from shipping, well before my expected delivery date of Sept 10th...Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase!
B00M6INHGI|4|Installed this in my camper as an alarm clock and can see temps and battery level, which is very important when camping off grid
B00WE0YIX4|4|Fits great.  My wife had a little problem installing at first. I took over and got it attached.  Looks great
B00306YG3S|5|They are thick gloves. I was thinking 4 stars because of the price but I don't think I could get them cheaper. Nice product if you need protection. I use this for mixing my nicotine which could be hazard. They are difficult to work with same things due to thickness.
B001TAFX6Q|5|The old faded tarnished lenses are gone and the 2001 creampuff looks 5-7 years younger!
B001G7HXF6|5|Perfect fit for 1987 Mercedes 560SL. Good price and fast delivery
B005C6546M|5|Worked great !
B004GDFE6M|5|Great product!  Looks as good as the OEM handle.
B009IJ85TC|5|thanks excellent work and very good quality, thank you for your interest in its products
B00BD5GW26|4|Hi
B00E9HWS9G|5|i had to make some cuts along the prefabricated lines and it fits perfectly in my 2010 Toyota Highlander.
B000C9PA54|5|Good one
B007HRHGQ0|5|Arrived on time, installed easily with floor  jacks.
B000RSTXG2|5|Good product!
B0009VD0XE|5|just like u said the product would be...thanks
B00D9BFR8M|4|fast shipping, item was as described
B004JBXJEK|5|Arrived VERY fast, even 3 days before the estimated arrival! Very vibrant, and larger than expected. Love it! ♡♡
B00CMT7A32|5|Works great as an IR remote replacement in our 2005 Chrysler Town and Country
B008BLFHS0|3|Cheap tint. Hard to work with. Had to have a professional install this because I couldn't stretch it to match the shape of the headlight.
B00UIU50KM|5|I purchased this kit to upgrade my stock halogens for my car. Needless to say the difference is AMAZING!<br /><br />I will be honest, When I first got everything I wanted, I decided that I would plug everything in and make sure it works. My luck, they didn't work. I emailed them letting them know. This is where some may think of it as a bad thing, the support. I contacted them on a Saturday, I knew they would not get back to me until Monday. Not a big deal for me. When they did, they promptly solved my issue. So if it doesn't work for you try reversing the polarity, that worked like a charm. So it may save you some time to try that first.<br /><br />After I got that issue out of the way, my next hurdle was plugging everything in and getting them installed. Turns out one of the ballasts were bad. Not a big deal, I know it's life. I contacted them and let them know the issue, they sent out a replacement issue right away.<br />.<br />After I got the new ballast it was time for the install. I took my time to make sure that I properly did things the correct way. The install time was roughly an hour. The  quality of the product itself is fantastic! The color of the bulbs is accurate. My last set was was 6k and it had that blue hue to it. The 5k color is perfect and BRIGHT! When you go brighter than 5k-6k you will actually loose lumens. The 5k is the brightest you can get  It was just what I was looking for. I will definitely purchase from OPT7 again.
B000M65PM0|4|cart was not right but let me trade it out for another
B002UC6W0S|4|was exactly what I needed and the new bolts and nuts were really nice to have instead of the old rusty looking ones.
B00U2VS1BM|5|Made my car the cutest car ever
B00KSXW04S|5|Nice but returned because it was wrong
B00M0TLQ66|5|this sh!t works awesome!!! wow years of rust on tools, bolts, springs, etc just gone like new! i will definitely buy again. fast shipping, item was as described
B00093CL3M|4|fast shipment and fits perfect.
B003BZCZZE|4|I bought some quick connects at lowes .. big mistake.. turns out they were aluminum coated to look like brass.. after about 6 months they just almost fused to the hose end.. had to damage the hose to take them off.  So did some research and decided to buy the camco at Amazon.  the weight of these feels heavier than the aluminum ones.  Also these have a shut off valve.  considering it is brass and has shutoff valve, it is a much better bargain than the ones at lowes or HD.
B00ICVWY6M|5|I removed the steering column from my nephew's S-10 last week, spent half of a day laying in the floorboard with my rear end balanced on a roll around seat that was perpetually trying to throw me off. ;-)  I remember years ago a mechanic friend had something similar to the Dash-Surfer, basically a wheel less wooden creeper with a support leg on one end. The memory (and the backache from the above) prompted me to find something similar as the week's project is finding the issue that's keeping my Montero's brake lights from working. I ordered the Dash-Surfer middle of last week, it arrived this morning. Assembly was quick and easy, and it made a huge difference in comfort for the time I spent under the dash of the Montero. I especially like that the support is height adjustable, the one I'd used before wasn't and you ended up with a headache from your blood pooling in your brain. The padding is nice too, add a pillow and I could take a nap on it. Seriously, it's a well made piece that should hold up to the rigors of life in a shop environment for a long time.
B009W4QPN6|5|These are perfect for protecting the axle bearings. They are high quality and will purchase again if I need to replace these again.
B00BEVZD38|5|This thing is awesome. Makes me happy when I drive.
B00ZLPABGC|5|This was simple to install and provides a perfect clean view.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works great.
B006GJYOL0|5|This stuff is great!  Removes even the most stubborn water spots.
B00CPKV8JU|5|BEST BUDDY EVER. Seriously, this thing made a night and day difference ladies!!!!!
B00QW3KIHO|5|so sorry to rate this as 1 star. the one I got is not all metal. I don't know why... reading all those 5 star reviews, I decided to buy it (even if I don't need it at the moment) because it promised to be all metal... including the lever that usually breaks off. I read carefully the product description and its says even the lever is metal... IT'S NOT! IT'S PLASTIC (tried the magnet test). so frustrating.<br /><br />I made a mistake...was about to return the product but decided to e-mail seller first. they explained to me why the handle and lever don't adhere to magnet - its zinc coated.<br />now I can say that after close scrutiny, it is indeed. sorry for the 1 star rating- my bad. if I can give more than 5 star rating, I would. now 5 star rating more for prompt and knowledgeable customer support! thanks. all you people on the market for this handle, this you outta get and not those plastic craps I got from other sellers.
B00JA3BMDW|2|Was working on first day. However, it failed about ten days later. Got it returned and refunded.
B0009IQZH0|5|It's a towel, and it works well on my cars without leaving any marks.
B005FKR12K|1|TERRIBLE CHEAP  DANGEROUS BRAKES, I MELTED MY SET TO DESTRUCTION
B012CVQWEC|5|These work well in certain landscape fixtures.
B0088P06AS|5|Really improved the adhesion of items you try to use stick tape in cars. It makes 3m double side tape hold adhesion even in extreme temperatures. I use this when using two way stick tape in my RV.
B004TMHF8K|5|Best damn light for the money
B00L9FPHPS|2|This keychain looks awesome, and I received it very quickly.  However, the &#34;Don't Tread On Me&#34; piece is not attached very securely.  It broke off the first day I had it.  I kept what was left; one can't have too many bottle openers.  I am sorely disappointed overall, however.
B00FPDV3WG|1|Poor quality.
B00IOFW55Q|5|Excellent
B01092IEEM|5|Good quality
B00D8E0SRA|2|Missing back caps on one of the fuse holder. decent quality.
B0080DSXDK|1|2011 Honda odyssey has had these on for about 1.5mos now and they have started to squeal very loudly when taking off from slow speeds such as backing out of parking spots. I completely replaced rotors and everything when I replaced so its definitely the pads. front and rears both do it.
B001ET4XA4|5|I just installed these today in my LS400. They fit so well you would never know they were not the factory item, besides the obvious fact that they are really bright blue in color.<br /><br />The plug caps are larger in the area you grab them for removal/install, and everywhere else the fit was as good as factory.<br /><br />The only thing I can complain about is the cylinder markings. These wires do have markings, which is a major timesaver when doing a routed install such as the LS400 (A place for everything and everything in its place), but they are just a numbered ring in one place on each wire. By comparison, the factory wires have cylinder number markings, printed right on the wire itself both upside down and upside right every couple inches! This might sound like a frivolous detail, but it really helps routing the wires and checking your installation to have those markings all over the place. So I have a solution: install them one wire at a time, one guide notch at a time. It's slightly more work then ripping them out en masse, and when you are done there is a very very slim chance that any wire wound up in the wrong guide notch, and basically zero chance that you have a cylinder mismatch.<br /><br />On one of the wires I had to trim back the protective poly helical sheath that is wrapped around select areas of the wires. In just one place out of many the sheath was about 15mm too long and interfered with the guide notch. I just unwrapped it a couple turns and snipped off the excess with a pair of shears. Otherwise, problem-free.
B0028OJAIY|5|Brought it based on all the great reviews.  It works and I don't have anything bad to say about it.
B004OXPDC4|5|Exelent!!!
B000AUQYYG|4|Every thing was fine.
B005LRDHW0|5|perfect fit, great product
B008E7QQRC|5|Installed exact fit great value
B005NLQAHS|5|Amazing little device.  Got the Torque App for my Galaxy s3, and it is amazing what you can do with it.
B00KWDR3JQ|5|Fits great and works...many thanks
B004TGVY38|4|Works great....
B00TQ0S7QE|1|cheap hardware and blocks the parking distance sensors
B00SXKS9FW|4|Will it fit 2004 odyssey?
B00BJ4F1A0|5|Improved my ride quality and handling immensely compared to my old struts with 160K miles on them. Was easy to put on the car just took a bit of time. Took it to a mechanic for an alignment and I asked for the report, everything was perfectly within OEM specifications.<br /><br />There is much less body roll, the car feels much more like it should. It also no longer bottoms out on every bump in the road, and it doesnt bounce on the highway. If I ever buy a car over 100K miles again, replacing the struts will always be in the plans. It is completely worth it!<br /><br />KYB makes the OEM struts for toyota, so these are pretty close. If I had to guess though these are closer to the Corolla S struts than the Corolla LE struts. But that will matter little to most people, they are just a tiny bit stiffer than the OEM LE/CE/VE struts.
B00KBBL4H6|5|Great product with absolutely fantastic follow up by the seller.  It is NOT small so make sure you understand what you are purchasing.  But it was exactly what I wanted.
B00BFU7WLY|5|Good product. Exactly the same as motor I replaced.
B002M492CO|5|They are amazing, would recommend to anyone,  the price was great.  Such a great deal
B000M5Y720|5|Works as advertised and a v ery good price
B000RFUF12|5|Makes filling batteries on the boats a breeze.  I really like using this as you don't have to look into the battery and it prevents splashes of water all over the place.
B000YQ9NZI|4|Well made, but not large enough to fit on my 2006 Jeep Wrangler LJ Rubicon with a roof rack and large spare tire swing out rack.  I kept it and used if for my wife's car.
B000VU56Z8|5|Awesome product! Fit perfectly, just by unrolling it. It is heavy, but that is what I wanted to stand up to the abuse I expect it to receive.
B000C5FLFC|5|Made for a Ford, fits & works perfectly, made in USA, what's not to like?  I'm satisfied.
B0099XII7G|5|Perfect fit to my Chevy Tahoe 2Dr 4wd 5.7L Vortec! Saved almost $300 in labor, and took about 1 hour to complete!!  I opted the easier route and decided after removal of all the bolts to cut my old set of pipes for easier removal over the chassis' cross-frame member.  I cut the old exhaust pipes just ahead of the old catalytic converter...Used a saws-all (from Harbor freight for $29) with metal-cutting blade and sliced like butter.  Installation of the MagnaFlow was a breeze - just make sure you align the angle properly to the exhaust manifold connections and tighten each of the three bolts one turn at a time to maintain alignment of the ring which will keep the attachment of the new pipes from binding on one of the bolts due to improper angle. Only issue I experienced was the right side pipe fitting for the oxygen sensor only allowed for a 3/4 installation of the sensor...threads bottomed-out prior to fully turning in the sensor leaving about 3-4mm of threads exposed.  No big deal as the sensor was fully seated and sealed and caused no issues with the monitoring system...just a pet-peeve on the manufacturing side for QC.
B0031I2SMG|5|Installed Today ! Excellent Product and Pricing ! Would Buy Again From This Seller.
B00YDDT9IO|5|Good price, and works as advertised.
B00SMX8FCC|5|Really goood!
B005MZVEPI|3|This magnet is adorable, but NOT the size indicated.  It's only about 3.5&#34; by 4.25&#34;.  It's definitely not 4.75&#34; x 4.75&#34;
B001R9597C|5|This sticker was really just as pictured. It was easy to place on my car and it has lasted since January of 2015. Still looks great!
B00G1BXINI|3|I should of bought the original BMW 1s
B00KTUY1IS|5|Great to have in the  car or to blow up bike tires quickly
B00T0XQSMW|1|Why they don't have a instrumental video blows my mind. The back glass.... HA good luck with that! Put it this way, I went ahead and ordered a second set because I messed up on the first one. &#34; got it down by the 3rd window tho!&#34; Well I had the first films on my windows for a week, and they came off in one piece easily! Good you think?  No I didn't need to use anything to peel the cheap things off. The second set also took forever to reach me! My fault for ordering through the company instead of Amazon I guess.
B00192JGN0|5|They fit perfectly. They weren't so expensive that I wouldn't buy them again . Thank you.
B0059HJFU0|5|used for pumping ATF into differential.  Messy but it served the purpose.
B000GZBZOE|4|Looks great!
B0028PJ10K|3|These are OK.  Mostly we use them for stacking up underneath the stabilizing jacks.<br /><br />As for as leveling the tires, we LOVE our new Anderson 3604 camper levelers http://www.amazon.com/Andersen-Mfg-3604-Andersen-3604-Leveler/dp/B001GC2LVM/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1440516848&sr=1-1&keywords=anderson+leveler.  No guessing how many blocks to stack.  Just put them under the low side tire and pull forward until you are level.  I usually go just a smidgen past level so when you chock it, it settles back to perfect.
B001AH7GSQ|5|These are the real deal. Truck idles smoother and has slightly increased throttle response.  They are genuine MSD although they do not say it on the coil like the picture shows.
B007KLXQJY|5|TYC create a much better cutoff than OEM , the UFOs are completely cover and gone. Love it
B0009IK4D6|5|Great product! Shipped quickly. Easy to replace on rear windshield.
B001AGP5Y4|5|Great price. Prompt delivery.
B005F9JZUW|4|As advertised. Went time YouTube for easy installation instructions.
B001KQB61K|5|worked great, perfect color match too
B00HFHMUAO|4|Great looking mirrors but they do not fit my motorcycle (09 ducati monster), other than that they're fine.
B004J10QIW|5|Fit perfect in my 02 buick century, great price too.
B0018CWEXU|5|Fits right up great product
B000CPZZQM|4|At this price I find this tool excellent for what I needed.  Crimping spark plug wire connectors was easy and smooth. As others have stated it's not a wire stripper (many other tools available for that; and for spark plug wires all you need is a box cutter with a new blade). I crimped 8mm spark plug wires by stripping 1/2&#34; of insulation, folding wire under, with pliers squeeze ends together slightly, slide into crimp slot, and squeeze handles (key is to use both hands, a hard surface, and really crimp down with one hand on the handles and the other on the tip off the pliers). They work just fine, and will do many sets of wires if you treat your tools with respect.
B0000AXRH5|4|Good cheap funnel. Worked as expected.
B001KS6FPA|5|Fit my Suzuki Sx4 back window perfectly!
B004QEJ6UQ|5|great product for the price
B001PYNWUU|5|fits perfectly to my jeep cherokee xj 4x4 1995, i am very satisfied with the product
B007UIWQ0W|4|verygood
B00HWI7NT4|5|Great fit.  45 minute installation for both headlights.  Attached photo shows before, left headlight, and after.  Looks Like a new Truck now.<br />Installation tip:  When small panel below headlight is removed plastic body clips tend to break.  I found that using a zip tie in place<br />of body clips secures small panel even better than the stock clips
B00842A7F4|5|work great
B001G7GAXW|5|Great product as expected for a great price!
B00B1SKATQ|5|Just a perfect replacement for the analog thermostat I had.  Easy to install.  If I was going to suggest something it would be to label the cables with their colors as installing this in a dark camper (no electric) was hard as the green and gray looked a lot alike in the darken camper.
B000GD5FMY|5|They work very well!!!!!
B000Q9BV5S|1|Save your money... You get a better watch out of a claw machine. Not worth the price.
B004IU7LZK|5|Really impressed. I'd put it up against Yakima any day. Low profile allows me to park in the garage as well.
B00REJXHIM|3|Decent for the ptice but not as high quality as others that are a little more.  Spend the extra money and buy name brand.  It also needs two more &#34;clips&#34; to secure the cover to the bed behind the cab.  There is a gap between the top of the bed and the cover reguardless of how tight you adjust the other clips.
B00P05CJ54|5|Great for any type of lights
B007ZLLS9Y|5|Mechanic installed it.  No problems.
B00J3YCCXM|5|Is exactly as described.  Love that it is a &#34;cling&#34; and not a sticker or magnet.
B0006H938M|5|Great price. Fast shipping
B0026N92Q2|5|Part was perfect  and as good quality  as factory
B009DIWCGA|5|Works just like K&N without the $$$$.
B0002JN56A|5|I used this product to reattach a mirror and it worked as stated so I am happy at least for now.
B00CQD4BUE|5|This is product MUST for anyone who cares about their Mini!  The plastic OEM dispstick is terrible at telling you the oil levels in in your Mini and should be replaced immediately with the CravenSpeed variant.  The quality on this piece is top notch, although I must admit, I was not expecting it to be so flexible.  Can't say if anyone has actually described what you are getting with this &#34;upgraded&#34; version, so let me briefly explain: the entire dipstick is flexible, like a very tightly wound slinky.  When unboxing it, I was a little apprehensive at first about the design...I mean, have you ever seen a dipstick that can wrap around your finger?  But after installing it in my engine bay, it worked soooooooo much better than the OEM version.  On top of that, the fitment in the downtube is superb!  Determining oil levels in my Mini will never be a mystery again!  Thanks CravenSpeed for a fantastic product!
B00HIDHR94|5|Satisfied with the purchase
B00B2ATV8O|5|excellent
B000C55LC0|5|installed easy and made the jeep ride much better.
B00BGJBPSA|3|Somewhat cheap looking. I should have also looked closer to the actual size (very small).
B0048J4ZBO|5|Working perfectly. Easy to install.
B000IY9I1A|5|looks and works great
B000C9GC8I|5|fit my 2005 chevy tahoe perfectly
B00S75A5KA|1|Great lights easy install bright but no where near as bright as my hid lights i had a little disappointed  Update august  27th both lights growing dimmer and dimmer to the point my factory halogen bulbs are brighter
B00G6KGPFM|5|Worked Great went on easy.
B000CPCKTC|4|nice assortment
B00CLDXGNC|3|Comfortable, but could use a little stronger material for outer rim string, to make connection more durable.
B001ATZ8U2|5|Well made!!!
B001CF1A6U|5|Very sturdy d-rings.
B001TYJOG2|1|If you own pets don't bother. It's a magnet for pet hair. No animal has been in the car. But I do own cats. It collects any lose fiber and pet hair. It won't even vacuum off. I tried with a lint brush with zero success. After having these for less than 3 months they are garbage. Waste of money.  No to mention was difficult to install.
B00MDL099Q|4|Good product
B0062EHTRK|5|I have a Mercedes 2013 E350 with light beige color original carpet mats...I bought these mats to go over existing ones to protect and  keep them clean. The mats came soon after placing order and I was pleasantly surprised how nice they look as well as fit in my car. The fit is like a custom mat and the Mercedes insignia details are accurate and nicely done. The seller also had the mats very well packaged and delivery was super fast. Don't hesitate to order, dealer prices are way more higher than you will get here.  ~Thanks

B0002MBKUK|5|Love this
B006DUJTYY|5|Worked great
B00E3YI0DS|3|Excellent paint job. The grill part is bent I guess maybe from baking the paint. Not really sure. Just not right.
B000K0045G|5|Just what I expected, perfect fit and sound great! I was a bit hesitant at first as I thought the price was too low to be real, but they are original equipment.
B00J6990A2|5|WOW!!!  These are BRIGHT and were easy to put on my cycle!
B000YCAM8Y|5|Great! Great! Great! Weathertech products are always the best. This is no exception. Now I gotta get the floor mats next.
B000HBGKWE|1|Did not work at all and I followed the directions!
B0001EFSTI|5|Great tool to have.
B00T36VC7W|5|Great
B00HXXBISA|5|Arrived on time and easy to put on my back window.
B00MOWJLTI|3|Very small pictograms.  Good idea for very small lists or something, but for labeling large areas, use something else.
B000S8DN1M|5|Excellent! It was on time!
B0039XKKNC|5|Great to have this wand. It worked for us when we needed it to. We would buy from this seller again.
B00PFQDNBC|2|They fit.  But are cheaply made, seems like the sensor was hand crimped onto the nut. Returned and bought Bosch instead
B00YM8JC1O|5|Prefect fit. Original part and easy to install.
B000IY829O|4|Seems fine
B007ROUBYC|5|Worked fine.
B00OUM8GLY|5|Fits perfectly in my ford ranger. Easy to put up, take down and stow. Definitely cooled down my truck.
B00P9OEZR6|3|I'm still figuring out this product, and will likely rewrite this review as I get more experience with it.  IMO this product, unlike most Meguiar's products, is more for (or best for) NON-enthusiasts, such as: people who hate waxing their car, people with low-value cars which sit for a long time, or cars with oxidized paint. Nu Finish, rightly or wrongly, seems to dominate this last category, and there really should be more products which target low maintenance/heavy oxidation + extreme ease-of-use. NuFinish is a controversial product, made by a company which doesn't specialize in auto care, where experts say it's okay but there are &#34;better products available&#34;, yet on the same pages never mention how their alternatives fare with heavy oxidation or even longevity. I tried Paint Protect as an experimental alternative to NuFinish and other dedicated sealants/waxes, but also an alternative to having to use a rubbing compound and mechanical buffer on an old car, something I'm too lazy and scared to do, as I've messed up easier things.  I think Paint Protect is most-useful for neglected, bare paint, especially for those whose next-most-likely option would be to continue to neglect it.  The WORST reviews here seem to be by people who already had a history of RESONSIBLE paint maintenance (and also perhaps people who used it thinly, and that's probably the experienced folks, too). This feeds my feelings that this product is counter-intuitive and odd, but seems to have its place.  For me, it started as a quest to find the easiest way to do away with the hazy look of oxidized (dry, &#34;thirsty&#34;) paint, with the least work possible. I'm all about the EASY on this, and on the 'Easy' account, this product delivers, say whatever else you want. I did 2 separate attempts with paste waxes long ago, both with disastrous newbie results (used too much, wax hardening beyond what my fingers could rub off, leaving a nearly unremovable white haze all over my car). That caused me to give up waxing--also with bad results.  This product's consistency is like grenadine syrup. I'm not sure if &#34;curing&#34; is the right word either; the mineral spirits have to evaporate, and then the feeling changes from oily to more of a buttery waxed feeling. I guess mine was thicker than normal, as it took more than 24 hours to get to that state. But I would still say it doesn't 'harden' like a glaze, it's just stuck on with molecular adhesion. It doesn't haze! No dry film. Makes it harder to screw up, and while results can look streaky depending on how you apply it, at least you don't risk ending up with a haze-white car with wax you can't buff off. If on too thick, it looks and feels like an oily residue, which is easily remedied (but I think can be an advantage with a subsequent wash, which I think is important: read on).  It goes on easy, and off &#34;comically easy&#34;. I recommend using an applicator, using fairly liberally. I tried squirting lines across my car, but on areas I let it sit for more than a few seconds, I somehow got streak lines (visible when it's bright sunlight) where the product was and dripped down, even though I spread it out pretty soon (weird). If you do squirt it on, do small sections, and rub it in IMMEDIATELY. Where I got streaks is lines of product which hung around as I was busy spreading it out on another section. I'm still trying to figure out which application techniques worked best, and so far it was my hood, where I laid it on thick, smoothed it out quickly, smoothed out the excess again few hours later (wasn't quite &#34;wiping it off&#34;--just the lightest, straight strokes with a microfiber), then washed very gently the next day (I think it could be sooner with this technique. After initial thick application, the excess (or solvent?) actually beads up a bit on itself after awhile (looked a little like dew on the car, only there was no dew), which is what I'm talking about smoothing out/wiping down a 2nd time. When I say 'wipe', I mean almost no pressure. I then washed VERY GENTLY the next day, but feel it could possibly be straightaway, and that was it. I used that well-reviewed turtle ice wash-n-wax, but doubt the 'wax' part did much (it sure didn't do much on my bare paint section). Car car videos say to not use pressure washers or dish soap, as they remove wax, and I want this stuff to stay on as long as possible. Anyway, after washing, the results were better than I expected for the effort, but then had those streaks in some sections a day or two later after it was fully dried out. I will now use a &#34;wax it dry&#34; products on top instead, to complete a super-easy routine I think I'll actually do.  So what do I know. I'm not really into this as a hobby, but if you're reading this far, you probably aren't either. Please realize I'm experimenting to find something of maximal ease for people who don't want to do this. Although I'm thinking now that a simple &#34;wax-as-you-dry&#34; product may be easier (it's basically 1 step, this is not), but those probably don't last as long. Now that I have this, it remains to be seen if it's synergistic with other products like wax-dry's; I assume it will be.  The reason I wanted to try putting Paint Protect on thick, was because it seemed to me that people who had bad experiences with this, seemed to be using it thinner. Plus, who doesn't want more protection, right? The fact mine took more than a day to dry out shows me I either used more than the directions specify, or didn't take enough off. Again, that was basically of on purpose, and so far the thickest part (my hood) actually looks the best. YMMV.  As applicators, I tried using a virgin foam bonnet, a virgin microfiber applicator (the puffy kind with foam inside, both from wally world), and even tried a clean plastic bag over my hand. I think anything works, you just have to smoosh it around and get it fairly even, but the bag didn't stay on my hand well enough. I write this to point out you don't have to have skill or special equipment to use it, though I do think microfiber towels are huge advancements for car care. This product is easy enough that women, children, and even elderly I think could use it, with some instruction (included instructions are inadequate IMO). I would say washing a car (properly, and by hand) is actually significantly HARDER, and more time-consuming, than using this product. And I think that is the purpose of this product. So if you can wash a car, you can use this. There are &#34;better&#34; products--but perhaps not ones easier to use which are more forgiving. (When I say &#34;forgiving&#34;, I mean not ending up with an irreversible disaster like my hardened wax episodes, I do not mean consistency of result.)  I agree with reviewers that the product is a dust magnet, though I haven't used products which &#34;repel&#34; dust either.  WHAT I'VE FOUND When the results are easy and gratifying, you actually want to do it more. I never thought I'd say this, but I now see how some guys can get so into it that they look for excuses to wax their car/try a different product. Also found that bare paint is harder to wash and keep clean. If washing my car needs less effort, I'll do it more often. I also suspect now that what paint care products mean by &#34;UV protection&#34; may actually be that having a coating on the paint is protecting it from oxidation, which may be catylized by UV rays. I saw a video of a lab worker with a UV meter trying several popular products, and with his technique anyway, none actually blocked significant if any UV. But I don't think that matters. It's keeping the oxygen off, especially if exposed to sunlight.  I was raised to believe Wash-n-wax and wax-it-dry products were the devil, but after reading a review of a retired 30-year detailer, who only uses such products on his own car due to physical limitations, it opened my mind. Maybe &#34;Easy that you'll do&#34;, is better than &#34;Best that you won't&#34;.  I'm not looking for the best cosmetic look. There are plenty of flaws in my paint, and they're still visible up-close. But from a distance, it actually looks great, and we'll see how easily I can maintain it, or how long it'll last if I don't. Most importantly, I need any solution to be easy on my hands & wrists.  I left a small portion of paint uncovered, and this was a very good reality check as to what the product's doing, and to monitor if it's really there.  TRIM & RUBBER This product is awesome on non-glass surfaces like faded plastic trim. Some people use things like peanut oil to darken oxidized trim, which is stupid, because oil degrades plastic. This stuff acts similar to what I imagine peanut oil does, but I hope will not be harmful (there is petroleum in it, I just hope it all evaporates). People have reported good results on rubber. I plan to try some 303 protectant, followed by this stuff, since 303 is water-soluble, and Paint Protect really isn't.  I gave this product 3 reviews over 4 because of how different the results can look, depending on how it's applied. When it works, it's great. When it doesn't work, it looks pretty 'fail' up-close in bright sunlight, although the protection is definitely still there. I'll continue to experiment and update here if I learn more. Attractive or not, application is EASY, the tough part is just knowing which application method will look and protect the best.
B00WTPY8F2|5|Installed as replacement for back-up lights on my truck.  Very bright!
B00EUN9KP4|5|very happy with the product and it's not plastic
B00GRHTDL2|5|Reall cool and works great.
B00838SCKQ|5|Nice
B0062WC9IQ|5|I hope this one last longer than 1 year
B000CQI202|4|This knife switch is pretty good quality and a decent value at the $25 that Amazon charges.<br /><br />I bought this switch to disconnect the batteries in our travel trailer from the built-in charger.  Like most non-computer controlled battery chargers, this one puts out too high a voltage (13.7 to 14.1 volts) for it to be good practice to leave it connected to the battery at all times.  That will over-charge the batteries and &#34;boil&#34; the water out of the electrolyte.  That causes battery sulfation and shortens battery life.  Instead I keep a small Battery-Minder float-charger-desulfator connected to the batteries when the trailer is parked for a longer term.  This device only puts out 13.3 volts when the battery is fully charged, which is a good &#34;float&#34; maintenance voltage.  I used to have to disconnect and re-connect the leads from one battery terminal many times a year.  That isn't a terrible chore, but I decided to treat myself to this switch installation to make proper battery maintenance easy.  I open the switch to the battery terminals and connect the clip leads from the &#34;Battery-Minder&#34; and know that all is well all winter long.<br /><br />The weak part of this knife switch is the insulated plastic base, which is too light and flexible.  I threw that piece away and re-mounted the switch halves on a small block of 3/4-inch thick oak board.  Otherwise the switch seems quite good, but I don't think it would be worth the $43 that is shown as the suggested retail price.
B000E28MTA|5|NICE !!!
B009FUF6DM|5|cheap and works great.
B000C5SG86|5|perfect fit for my  99 corolla. these cars tend to burn oil so the o2 sensor has a shorter life. my engine light was on. gave codes p0125 and<br />P0171 together, not separate . this fixed it. codes have not returned.
B00353PWAW|5|This is the best car wash, goes on soapy, rinses easily, and gets all the dirt off.
B000CF8W1W|5|Perfect fit 10 minutes to install.
B00HZBRRVM|1|Sent Wrong Sticker - Seriously low quality, dull color, grainy, streaky product.  Refused to provide return postage or full return (20% &#34;restocking fee&#34;).
B00IMPEWHM|4|worked as expected.  A+
B004RNOVTM|5|Perfect for my small patio and watering plants, love it!
B00TD31R4S|4|Went on a little screwy and took some time to get it worked out, but eventually got it on. Came with everything needed and it all worked except the scraper/smother. I would HIGHLY recommend finding something else to smooth out the vinyl / remove bubbles with. The stiff plastic card they send will damage the vinyl. I also wish the vinyl was a little thicker so it was less likely to stretch out.
B00XKY89AG|5|I had purchased a longer trunk organizer, but realized I really didn't need all the space it provided, so decided to downgrade to something smaller.  This organizer is a champ!  It holds all my emergency roadside supplies, along with work call-out gear, and still leaves me with plenty of room.  I have this placed in the rear of my SUV, and though it doesn't have a grippy bottom, I haven't had it shift or slide around at all.  Seems very well stitched and sturdy.<br />I'd definitely recommend.
B009HL6O6C|5|I believe this is the exact same belt as the OEM unit from Polaris at a much lower price. It's the spare in the cargo box. I chose the standard over the carbon fibre unit to save the sheaves in the transmission. Personal preference.
B000CN9376|5|Tight clean shifts made the old civic feel like a new car was in my right hand till i opened my eyes lol great buy
B000RFUF12|5|Sure makes adding water to batteries much easier
B004QEQIN4|4|Works great and arrived early
B009D42ZDO|5|great product
B00K55TJ5W|5|Absolutely love it
B00C3NA4AI|5|perfect gift
B000A0EJ9S|5|received fast, great product
B004002CS4|4|Installed this on my Mazda CX-5 hitch and I love it.  Have only done one trip so far about a 3 hr drive but bike did not move at all.  I used the adapter to install in 2&#34; hitch and if you do it as instructed there is no wiggle at all.  Love that it sits low enough it doesn't block my turning signals but I can see where a very bumpy back road may cause the bike wheels and/or hitch to hit the ground in low spots. Like anything you are towing or carrying on a hitch you just have to go slower over large bumps or dips in the road.  Because it sits low it makes for very easy installation of the bike on carrier.  I simply lift one wheel up at a time with all the weight resting on the other wheel.
B00G2U0LHY|1|One bulb shorted out and the circuit board separated from the mount.  Other bulb functions fine.  Not a happy customer. Will be requesting refund.
B001P25NHW|1|Came with huge dent in the end. It wont fit over my current exhaust pipe. I will have to modify/cut it to make it work but that is better than paying to ship it back. Overall looks good quality but I am very unhappy that a damaged product was shipped. And the box is in perfect shape so it did not get damaged in transit.
B00PJX549A|5|This fit perfect on my car. Great clarity as well.
B00PA6TGSQ|5|quickly arrived and was well packaged.. would definitely buy again. thanks so much! :)
B0001XPC04|4|a wee bit flimsy
B000C9W2W8|5|no issues
B00PJ67AQW|4|no issues
B003YJLAIK|2|Overall, it works just fine.  Second season using it the brass broke on the inlet side.  The casting is of very poor quality.  I broke it tightening the hose by hand.
B002SSEWD8|5|Works great. Fast delivery. Thank you!
B00PBWSDL0|4|Overall good.  Only downside was the key ring.  It's too thick where the key doesn't freely move around.
B005C57OQ6|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 Yamaha V-Star 1100.  OEM quality.
B000NSN78Q|5|WORKS WONDERFUL
B00XB2EVF4|4|Larger than I thought, but it looks awesome on my car.
B005VLM8AS|4|Amazing!!
B008RAPM7G|5|Works great great price . thanks
B001RK54EY|5|Great product, works as advertised.  Recommend it for fun and sound.
B00F0QAOOG|5|Well satisfied
B001NZMBV2|5|Fits the truck like it said
B00JUX1DRW|5|This is a great mount!  Holding my case-less cell for navigation on my Busa, this survived speed bumps, potholes, railroad tracks, hard acceleration & braking, and everything else I could throw at it! I was a little leery because the top grips land right on the phone's buttons and operate functions, so I must mount it off-center, barely on the bottom edge.  There's also considerable side to side movement with the way the x-grip is designed. Yet it performed flawlessly and allowed me to move my display from the tank bag to over the key so I barely have to take my eyes off traffic.  The written instructions it came with were challenging to follow in my opinion, but I took other reviewer's advice and watched the YouTube video which made installation a breeze and I had it securely mounted in less than 10 minutes.  Also nice is that it detaches from the base easily to stow in the trunk when not in use.  I'd buy it again and have recommended it to others.
B00R6RQFTA|5|As described.
B003KRF15O|4|Good quality.. Did not include a oval type screw to mount and the mounting hole was obstructed with chrome or casting residue had to be drilled out.
B005CLNV3K|5|Great Quality would purchase again! Fast shipping
B00ARUTX24|4|Reasonable price, Prompt delivery. Good product.
B00192HPOC|5|These work great and fit right into the openings!
B001DCKTRI|5|This Key ignition works like from the factory. Have used this in my car for about 7 months now, with no issues.
B000FPYAAG|5|Must have if you own a Jeep with a Dana 300!!!  One of the easiest mods you can do!!  no more rattle and easy to shift!! Priceless!!
B0077UEUQ6|5|Loved it
B000C53RGC|5|These are the best low price shocks for a firm ride...
B00GWSLS4G|5|Good fit
B005FI5BBA|5|Gift for a friend.  Everyone that drives behind him is now jealous.
B00QGT1VIY|5|I am all for using factory replacement parts when is comes to the outcome performance of my machines. This Carburetor met my satisfaction even being a aftermarket part from china . my Single stage 3.5 horsepower 2 stroke snowblower runs very strong with this part. I am very pleased with it.
B00ASB7Q6W|4|First set came and both didnt work. Had to smash em and take pictures then send it to their customer service. They promptly sent me a new set which worked great.
B000SBTQG0|5|Finally had a chance to use this on 0.120&#34; steel. It worked great, made a perfectly flared hole that looks much cooler than just a 1&#34; hole, plus adds some strength and stiffness. Need to add more sizes to my collection now.
B004XONYBQ|4|Saved $20 instead of summit racing and received it the same day free shipping. I already have one of these fans. Ive been running it on my supra for a few years. This fan FLOWS! It also draws a lot of current. (1) 40/60 amp relay is not enough. It kept burning up the wire and fuses. I finally made my own harness using  dual 40/60 relays in parallel controlled with my haltech. Im sure this one fan will cool my car on a normal day. I just ordered a 2nd one so it'll cool efficiently without a pusher fan on my Condenser in the summer with ac on.
B00NB8SXLG|3|Nice bright colour for accord 2013 in the map lights but lamps are bigger in the place to fit in the lights in the front mirrors
B000BPSWFY|5|Living in Texas you would think I would never need one of these.<br /><br />But the ONE day a year I need it, I really need it.  We get crazy ice here from time to time.<br /><br />Don't be the idiot that tosses a bucket of hot water on your windshield, scratches your windows with a butter knife, or ruins plastic items trying to chip ice off your windows. Save $$$ in gas instead of idling for 30 minutes trying to warm you car up enough to melt the crap off.<br /><br />Buy yourself this decent and sturdy scraper, and be ready for Mother Nature this winter.
B001P2HWC6|4|Does what I purchased it to do.
B00C2DSLRM|5|Fit perfectly, came as described! Good buy!
B00KYHKDC4|5|Great product, no hassle and went on smoothly. Sands smooth.
B0012TROMU|5|Always an excellent product and prompt delivery via Amazon.
B00P03NOKA|5|Great quality used for backup and brake lights on a headache rack i made would recommend to anybody
B000CMHTU0|4|Fit is good. Looks are good. Seems to be wearing ok. I'd get them for other cars or trucks.
B00B0B441Y|1|Not-Good
B004VA3G9C|5|Works like a charm!  Thanks
B000C739V8|3|its ok ,it fit
B0007VANGS|5|I was very satisfied
B004M7HMDK|5|Work great. Real happy.
B0058SH6YC|4|Solid rope that functions well for an anchor.<br />My only complaint is that the clip could be a bit stronger/more durable.<br />Had to use the rope to tow from another boat this past week and it handled the job well.<br />A slightly stronger clip would earn a 5 star review.
B000E4JLM0|5|Nearly same as factory! Much better price.  Anyone who has a Chevy with this type of tailgate will know these always break, this is a good, cheap replacment.
B000CNNF8Y|4|This product was hard to find but once I found it, I was glad I bought it.  I will need to get the recharge kit.
B001DHJ9WY|5|Included were complete instructions for how to not only install the unit, but what was specifically required to assure warranty would be in place/honored. No guessing around; loved it.
B002XRODX8|4|I bought this for my 2000 vw golf and everything fit! It looks awesome and came on time. Only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because the steering wheel cover and the seat belt pads were missing.
B004QJXX00|3|Bar on right side is not level.  Higher in front than rear😕
B003YD0YTM|5|works well
B00BW81C10|4|I love the sound but i would not suggest this for anyone who needs to be quiet .
B00GQ2TC14|5|To start off... IT WAS DELIVERED ON A SUNDAY! Which is awesome.<br /><br />Really easy install. Pretty much plug-and-play once you find the positive and ground wire.<br /><br />I used these on my LED turn signals to stop the hyperflash. Worked perfectly. Only took about 30-45 mins to install mostly my struggle to find a mounting spot for the resistors in such a small area.
B0049Z66O6|5|Works great for my 2008 GMC Yukon XL
B000CMJPNE|3|Fit the Jeep as advertised!  Not as thick/heavy duty as expected though.
B0071TT50O|5|great
B000C7ZO2A|5|Great product
B004W34IUY|3|Okay for the price but don't think it will hold up for an extended period.
B0026A5AIE|5|Great light for the price. Really bright and good flash patterns.
B004BTBUXC|4|Drivers side slides up...dunno how to fix it. Other than that they are sturdy and easy to clean.
B0039O1UWQ|1|The rack was very big and bulky  for a car. The actual rack was aluminum but the bolts and washers were not. I assembled the rack and went to put it on my car and it did not fit. The rack was left outside 1 nite underneath my covered porch and the bolts and washers started rusting overnite.
B00P67O2U6|4|Did this fit the Le/Le Eco model? I contacted borla rep and they said it doesn't and only fit S Models.
B000KWDMZI|1|It has a capacity of 2 lbs (0.9 kg) What a joke!
B00407TVTK|3|One can of 'absolutely red' is red pearl. Make sure you know this when buying it.
B002UWK4NE|1|This didn't last one week! Less than one week after I installed this motor mount the top popped off and all the oil leaked out! This is a terrible product!
B0096CREDO|5|I used this helmet comeing back from Sturgis in the worst rainstorm Ive riden in in years. Along withh the bubble shield and stayed dry. The helmet fits great. Well worrh the cost.
B0041MEBYO|5|Fit just like they said it would
B002BFY7II|1|the 8'' x 20'' mat mysteriously turned into 8 feet by 20 feet.  Is there no one working there with any responsibility??  read what your selling...
B00AYPM9HI|5|One of the best tools I ever bought.
B00KTJ8AIG|5|Amazon said that this did not fit my 93 Toyota truck but it did. No problem at all but did not come with the gasket. These are getting very hard to fine. There is none in any Toyota parts warehouse in the country. Also I check the junkyards NAPA autozone etc etc. But Amazon had it!!
B00MQFWTGU|5|I loved it.  I want more for friends.
B00C4VC3X0|4|Good.
B00YMTJ6R8|5|Exactly what I needed and worked as expected.
B009FTLR2M|5|Simple plug & play into my 2013 Honda Civic Si sedan's brake lights. Once you plug them in, if they don't work, just flip the bulbs around and they should work. There is no bulb-out warning when using these. They are much brighter than the OEM filament bulbs, both when the lights are on and when you hit the brakes. With LEDs, you get that instant-on reaction when you press your brake pedal. Also, there's no hot spots like there are with other LED bulbs - these bulbs evenly fill out the entire housing. Great upgrade for your buck.
B00J52R3LS|5|great product will reorder from Winegard again.
B001IKHPSG|4|Fit perfectly on my 94 accord. I'm going to paint baby blue maybe.
B00CFL9058|3|Little itchy on your skin because it's rough but love the bright colors.
B005J6JRMM|5|Good
B0030ICO3U|5|This works very well, and should be in every garage. This will save you a bunch of money from the paint shop. It only took about ten minutes to install and program.
B00ZPDQGHI|5|Love the quality and look of this sticker.
B00G8WLX78|5|has socket cover and fuse is a must
B00545QT6K|5|Awesome value on a great product.
B00AAMFBCK|5|Low beam gave whiter light and the Harley Dual halogen headlight allowed it to be reflected wider from ditch to ditch. Was priced right and easy to install.
B003CUHXD2|5|great product but you have to have a 20 amp breaker

B00GX4Y9AY|4|Amazon and the box says it's 15000mAH, but the sticker on the device itself says it's 10000mAH.  I like everything better than the Powerall I had before.  The power button is easier to press and the power indicator lights are brighter.  I love the case.  There is no point in having all those accessories if you have no place to keep them.  I will update this review after I get a chance to try it out.
