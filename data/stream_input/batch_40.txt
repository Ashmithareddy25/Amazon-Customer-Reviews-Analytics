B00BAXFDLM|5|A ground-breaking novel that deserves all the awards it has been given. Breq is the sole survivor of the warship Justice of Torren, and is seeking revenge for its destruction. This means taking on the supreme leader of the vast and thousands-of-years-old Radchaai Empire, like a bee planning an attack on the bee-keeper.  The outcome is not what you might expect.<br /><br />I loved the language, and have now read the book several times.  I anticipate returning to it in the future with continued pleasure.
0780020685|5|After many years of only seeing this timeless work on VHS tape, to finally have and to own &quot; The Seven Samurai &quot; on DVD presented in 1:33:1 format, presented by the reknowned Criterion Collection...it is indeed a true pleasure for this film fan. Plus the bonus of the additional audio commentary by the Japanese film historian, Michael Jeck, provides a much deeper insight into the history of the production, it's messages and themes, Akira Kurosawa's directorial style, and the attitudes of Japanese film making in the early 1950's.<br />From the very first time I watched this film I was spellbound by it's power and glory....Kurosawa painstakingly assembled a team of actors with wonderful synergy and expression that are at the core of this unforgettable tale of hopes &amp; dreams, death &amp; revenge and honor &amp; trust. Kurosawa's explosive and dynamic battle sequences, some filmed in driving rain, are equally balanced within the films context by the sadness and emotion of the heartfelt scenes, such as where Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune) reveals his upbringings to the rest of the Samurai.<br />This moving, provacative and challenging film is an epic that still stands head and shoulders over many others nearly 50 years after it's initial release...and a film that you can watch time and time again, and uncover another gem within it's rich tapestry upon each repeated viewing. I've shown this movie to many friends who were either not interested in older black and white productions...or not keen on subtitled movies...and they have all enjoyed it and remarked how they never knew that they could relish a 50 year old movie so much !!<br />This film truly belongs in any persons movie collection who considers themselves a true afficiando of cinema...an experience in emotion, energy and vision that will not be forgotten by those who view this wonderful work.

B00GRHVIGU|2|So what do you think of David Crosby's new recording \\"Croz\\" ?<br />Mapmaker: It's just another disappointment. There's nothing in this collection of recordings that is of any musical value.It's totally artless.<br />But this is of no surprise,he hasn't composed anything musically decent in years!!!!<br /><br />What about his son James Raymond?<br />Well he appears to be a very talented musician.With that said, there are millions of talented musicians<br />all over the united states (or the world for that matter).But just because he's the son of David Crosby does not make him any more important  than any<br />of the other great musicians across the country who's fathers are not famous.<br /><br />He's written some of the songs on Croz.<br />Yeah and there just useless. You see, creativity by it's very nature requires individuality.  What James Raymond has composed is not original -<br />he writes and composes and records songs that  sound just like everything else out there.Theres millions of writers writing songs just like his.<br /> However this could be his objective,  to not create anything original- Not to take a risk and create anything that sounds different in the global musical neighborhood.<br /><br />Well why do that?<br />My guess is there is no reason to do anything of integrity? It's not like its 1968 and  his contemporaries are Simon and Garfunkel,Beatles,Peter Paul and Mary ect.<br />Theres so much musical garbage out there, that by comparison, his stuff  sounds great.<br /><br />What about his father- David Crosby.<br />Well to understand his demise you have to realize that he is part of that ilk, who started creating music in the 1960's and whose musical<br />image dissolved into helping make immediate gratification fashionable. A perspective that is based on the believe that whatever your feeling inside is the true voice of nature speaking<br />-if something feels good, then do it.<br /><br />Well whats wrong with that?<br />By itself -it relieves one of a sense of responsibility by giving up one's conscious.<br />And the consequences of what happens to one who lives there life by this principle is-<br />Well all you have to do is look at the decedent hedonistic life and musical talent decline of David Crosby.<br />He's navigated his whole life by this philosophy as well as advocated it to others. Sadly he also composes with this philosophy  and it shows in his lousy songwriting.<br />In addition there are generations of jaded people who relate to this philosophy-just look at all the positive reviews regarding this useless gormless CD.<br /><br />Well if you were going to produce David Crosby- how would you go about it?<br />First lets go back-the last producer he worked with which was Rick Ruben. Now I don't know who the chowderhead was who thought of putting David Crosby and Rick Ruben<br />in the same room together-but they aught to have there head examined!!!! There both cut from the same block!!<br />Graham nash has been reported saying they've (CSN) have been making records for over fifty years, and they think they know what there doing and who is anyone to tell them what to do!!!!!<br />You  would think that after 50 years they would know what there doing, BUT THEY DON'T!!!!!!!!!! It's obvious \\"you can't tell\\"  an arrogant self centered character like Graham Nash (Stills or Crosby) what to do. For example just  listen to his lousy last solo recording \\"Song For Survivors\\"<br />The cover has a blurred picture of him-and that 's just what he's become, a complete blurr-there's no identity ( Graham has been a talk show host, tried to run for president,<br />nows he's out promoting a self indulging book focused on himself,-it's only a matter of time before<br />he has his own game show). And the songs he's been recording are so dull,lengthy and boring  you feel like you've been financially  ripped off when you buy them.<br /><br />Getting back to producing David Crosby-<br />Well if I was going to produce David Crosby I would start out by telling him that he was going to produce it( he knows how to produce)!<br />With conditions:,<br />1st -no synthesizer (of any Kind) or percussion programing, there would be his son on piano, a (preferably Jazz)bass player and a cello,saxophone,trumpet player Thats it!!.<br />2nd-all songs must be 3 minutes (with two being no more than 4 mins)<br />3-None of this lengthy verbose crap that he and his fellow group members have been writing for 30 years.<br />4)No more that 10 to twelve lines to each song.<br />My goal would be to remind him(of If Only I could Remember My Name ect) how to write a good song-he use to know how to do that-in addition he sings like he's angry and frustrated with a bitter tone in his voice. It's like listening to some angry news commentary.<br /><br />You seem to have trouble with song length-<br />Among other things. But yes i do- lets look at song length- what happened is back in the 1980's the CD format came along and seemed to demand more space to fill.<br />Well, if there is one profession that is filled with self centered ,narcissistic,arrogant, opinionated people, its the music business.<br />And if there given the opportunity to ramble on,thats just what they'll do and thats just what happened! Since then the music industry has been inundated with songs of lengthy verbose crap!!!!!!<br /><br />Is there anybody out there who can write good lengthy songs?<br />Yes, there is only one writer who has had the ability to consistently successfully write lengthy songs and thats JONI MITCHELL!!!!!!!<br /><br />Are there any redeeming qualities regarding David Crosby?<br />Musically NO! But imagine a society that was not obsessed with award shows and and hall of fames.Were the idea of a Rock And Roll Hall of fame would be considered<br />a mental illness diagnosis. On the other hand, imagine society were there was a  Father hall of fame for those who were successful fathers.And if there was such a hall of fame, then without a doubt, David Crosby would definitely would be inducted with honors.<br />You see, his son James Raymond came to him after years of not being in Davids life and David did not only welcome him into his life,<br /> he  has successfully established and has maintained a long term relationship with him.<br /><br />Whats so big about that?<br /> All you have to do is ask any social worker,psychologist, welfare worker<br />and they'll tell you, that what David Crosby did with his son, as a human being, is without a doubt the greatest success of all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B005COO1X6|5|My main reason for purchasing my kindle was to put Stephen Kings mamouth 1200 page books on a 9oz reading device.. I have 2 full shelfs of his heavy books..,All of his new books will go on my kindle., which is the only way to go. This book for Stephen King was another master piece... simply awsome, as always...
B0021L8V1G|5|I don't know why people comment on this with such opinionated reviews, in my personal opinion, it was great. But now let me give a more valid description. If you watched the first one, this is a good sequel explaining the missing details in the first one, and bringing it along, enhancing the underlying plot with Samuel Jackson and the league. It can get slow at times, but when action comes in, it PACKS in. With moderate violence, and other elements, it is not necesseraly a movie for younger kids not in their teens. Although, in certain families, it might be appropriate according to the rules of the house. With the plot, it becomes both a personal vendetta, and a redeeming love for starks father. When the twist comes, and once again as in the first one, the general enemy's of stark turn against each other, it really brings up the climax, peaking with the final chase, and slowly accelerating until the final moments of the movie. Although it comes to a quick conclusion, this is a worthwhile watch, and if it's in your tastes, buy it. If not, then don't. It simply comes to that.
B008Y5NO5G|5|It's a classic and about the 100th time I've watched it.  Now that I have it memorized I watch mostly for the dancing scenes.  It is a interesting film in that it shows American life at a very different time.

B009IEXKXI|5|This was one of the most interestingly entertaining books I have read.  Having the main character continually work at problem solving through out his very difficult circumstances made for<br />an excitingly fun book to read and one I hated to have end.
0060392886|4|This is a pretty cool book, but if you are not a fan, I don't think you will really care about this stuff.   The only problem I had with the book was the truth.  There is some stuff that seems it was added for entertainment value.  None the less, it was an easy and entertaining read.

B00007AJF8|5|I already know Charlie Kaufmann wrote this, but still. I seriously think this is one of the only movies that I enjoyed enough to watch all of the credits. Great story, great cast, great soundtrack, great writing; you get the hint. Everything about this movie blew my mind.  Craig... something or another works in a cramped (to say the least) office between the 7th and 8th floor of a big corporate office building. He is a puppeteer at heart, but to make ends meet he takes this job, and loves it! He works as a filing clerk, but two factors heighten the working experience. He is smitten with his co-worker (Katherine Keener), and he discovers a trap door that leads him into the mind of celebrity John Malkovich (John Malkovich)! Holy Wow!   But what does a door into the brain of John Malkovich mean? Does Malkovich know? Is it a hallucination? Is it something else? Believe me, I really want to blurt it out, but I won't. See this movie, it's great.
B0017KP93U|3|Music's fine - can't really quibble with the song selection. But where's the deluxe packaging promised in the advertising blurb? And the \\"essay/liner notes\\" are a load of pompous, posturing drivel that provide minimal insight on the band or its music - an opportunity wasted.

B00006CXSS|5|To &quot;A viewer from San Diego&quot; ... to answer your &quot;So I bet there were many 'bands of brothers' on the German side too&quot; comment, of course there were, and nobody with any sense thinks otherwise. If you'd actually watch the miniseries you'd realize there are some quite vivid scenes describing just that (toward the end where the German officer is addressing his troops -- exhausted but still standing straight -- following their surrender, and calls them a &quot;band of brothers,&quot; for just one example). This isn't Star Wars, buddy, and Spielberg and Hanks know that.<br />Are you sure you aren't Neville Chamberlain speaking from his grave? To respond to your &quot;It is a shame that war becomes gloryfied [sic] in a miniseries in this way when it is really the worst thing that man has created&quot; comment, I'd say yes, war is terrible indeed, terrible almost beyond measure, but then what's your alternative? This miniseries is based on a true story, so should the script have been &quot;adjusted&quot; to more accurately portray &quot;the worst thing that man has created?&quot; Or should a 10-part movie be made about a company who died to a man and didn't do a single heroic thing (I think you'd be hard pressed to find one, but just for the sake of argument)? Or would you have us ignore the history of war completely and try to forget it instead? I think not. Defeatists and pacifists are what got our world into the mess in the first place.<br />&quot;Those who will not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&quot; - George Santayana.<br />As to &quot;glorifying&quot; war, without the courage, valor, determination, and fortitude of the Allied soldiers and their leaders the entire world's history since the 1940s would be absolutely unrecognizable to any of us today. And, again, if you'd actually watch the miniseries you'd realize that it does not try to &quot;glorify&quot; war in any sense -- this story is told without the gloves on, and the horror and pain of war couldn't possibly be clearer to the viewer. <br />Here's my review: for the entire planet World War II is the single most important human-driven event of our time. Stephen E. Ambrose's book is truly amazing and is also highly recommended, but for visual learners and people raised on television this mini-series is, hands down, the best and most informative medium I've ever seen for learning about WWII in Europe. Watching this DVD set will make you laugh, cry, and appreciate, but it will mostly make you learn more about the Allied soldier's perspective of the war in Europe than you ever thought possible. Buy it today if not sooner.

B00000294R|5|Big L, <BR>Is by far one of the most clever MC's ever grasp the mic. He resurrected Harlem in the early 90's. A time when Harlem had very few hip-hop artists, some of whom were ashamed of there own area. Big L and Kool Moe Dee are probably the greatest MC's ever to rise from the Harlem streets. What kills me about this, is how so many folks jumped on Big L's jock after he was brutally murdered. Let's face it, a large majority of these reviewers only became interested Big L overnite. Why do you think his posthumous album &quot;The Big Picture&quot; is certified gold? Why couldn't everyone see this raw talent when he was living? It's become a redundant trend in music to all of a sudden pay close attention to dope artists after they pass away. If you weren't down with the underground from the jump just stay out, and keep supporting that garbage you call hip hop. Quit trying to pay your respects to the soldiers you know nothing about. Some of these people in these reviews go on and on about how L was so great, but don't probably even own any of the other DITC family albums. God forbid if O.C. dies...I garauntee will see some more bandwagon dikridders up in here, talking about how great  he was, when they didn't know squat about the man when he was alive. Personally when L died that was my worst Valentine's Day ever in life. He was truly an inspiration that taught us that being underground in hip hop can still be simplistic as hell while using witty punchlines, instead of complex as hell... with deep metaphors. If you add Lifestylez to your collection, explore the entire D.I.T.C. catalog as well, peep the classic albums from Lord Finesse, Show &amp; AG, O.C., Diamond D, and Fat Joe. Don't be a freakin tourist....support real underground hip hop. Quit coming around after somebody passes. The reason why hip hop is so screwed up right now is simply because it lacks the balance of underground and mainstream...when you have an equilibrium it provides the audience with more creative outlets and alternatives. But if the balance is gone and its shifted too far to the mainstream or too far towards the underground, you have a world of mimicry, lack of inspiration, and no creativity. Think about that....That's why hip hop was at its peak during the Golden Era -1987-1994.<BR>Big L RIP.

B0074D3CAQ|5|You always know you like a book when you care about a character. That's how i felt about Harold, the book's main character. I rooted for him; questioned his actions; tried to get him to talk when all he could do was think about his answer, then sat back along for the ride. Easy read and a lovely journey.
0142000671|5|I read this book with my 17 year old son for school.  He was reluctant to get started and the dialect in the book was challenging for him.  However, the author's word choice, symbolism, and snapshots created through the words provided excellent learning opportunities for my son.  We journaled each chapter writing a summary, reaction and predictions.  I enjoyed watching him grow throughout the book of friendship and the infectious power of dreams.
B00I5RZIIO|2|In this album, if you haven't heard all the songs straight through, the music to me seems more like pop music. I have been listening to Within Temptations music for a long time now, and I have never been dissatisfied with their music. I think that this album shows how much they have changed, but I don't think it was for the better. One resin I love WT so much is not just because they sound so beautiful, but their lyrics spoke to more of the &#34;darkly inclined &#34; such as myself. I personally do not like pop/rap music at all, and this album is just that. If you love the old WT then I do not recommend this new Cd of theirs. Although, if you like the style that they are going for now, then I'm sure you will enjoy it. There are some songs that I like, such as Silver Moonlight, but otherwise, I wish I never bought it. Good luck to everyone, and make sure that you like the songs before you buy it, unlike me. I hope this was helpful!

0451169514|5|Easily my favorite story in 25 years of reading, IT is the penultimate moment where childhood and adulthood diverge.  The story explores the difference between kid-beliefs and grown up-beliefs, and the advantages and disadvantages of each, all set within a terrorized town.<br />I found the seven main characters to be nearly alive, and I missed knowing them when the tale was told.  At a thousand pages, it is hardly a light read, but once you look into the face of IT - of Pennywise - you will not want to close the book.<br />IT is an experience in terror I have never come across again.  It remains the sole novel able to make me laugh aloud, cry, cheer.  Even now as I think about it, I have the urge to look behind me to see if the clown is there.<br />I've read IT five times.
B0014Z4OQG|4|*** IMPORTANT MESSAGE ***<br />The origin of the Cloverfield monster is indeed hinted at,<br />during the  final scene of the film!!<br />The scene where the two main-characters are on the ferris wheel.<br />Before the camera pans to the girlfriend, it's shooting the ocean horizon,<br />If you look closely (of if your television is the size of a space-station) you'll notice a comet/meteorite/satelite/something crash into the ocean in the distance.<br />I've extensively debated the point of origin (space or the ocean)on the horror forums,<br />and so far all signs could point to either.<br />(I personally believe it came from space,<br />because scientificly, the ocean wouldnt make sense.)<br />Here's why I believe this:<br />1. A satelite/whatever only now disturbing something that huge is implausible,<br />as underwater eartquakes would have disturbed it millenia ago.<br />2. Any earth-based creature breathes either air or water, has either lungs or gils, not both,<br />and the creature from Cloverfield was clearly breathing air,<br />which implies that it would eventually have to surface for oxygen.<br />And something that huge would be nearly impossible to miss once it surfaced.<br />3. There would have to be multiple creatures, for activities like...I don't know...reproduction.<br />Making their presence all the more obvious.<br />4. Not to mention that EVERYTHING that comes from the ocean requires fins, while this creature was clearly walking around on giant legs, a trait common to land creatures.<br />5. An alien origin would nullify any earth-based logic.<br /><br />That being said:<br />The movie's characters are soo believable,<br />and you get so immersed in their initial conflict that you forget you're about to watch a monster flick.<br />The shaky handi-cam adds to the realism, as does the lack of creature footage.<br />You see it, but you only get a vague sense of what it looks like.<br />You do however get a much better sense of what the spider-like flea-creatures that come off the behemoth look like,<br />though again, you only get a vague sense of how their bites work.<br />The character that is bit, is quickly ushered away before you get to see the outcome of the obvious infection.<br />It was a really good monster flick, but it definitely felt incomplete.<br />I know there's gonna be 2 more movies from different angles,<br />and knowing that makes this one seem all the better.<br />But all in all, very enjoyable.<br /><br />MORAL OF THE STORY:<br />The bigger they are, the faster you should run!!how their bites work.  The character that is bit, is quickly ushered away before you get to see the outcome of the obvious infection.   It was a really good monster flick, but it definitely felt incomplete.  I know there's gonna be 2 more movies from different angles,  and knowing that makes this one seem all the better.  But all in all, very enjoyable.    MORAL OF THE STORY:  The bigger they are, the faster you should run!!

B003UYUR10|4|Don't let the mediocre reviews and underperformance at the box office fool you. This movie is worth checking out. I have played all three games (numerous times) and I actually was surprised at how much I liked the big screen adaptation. It's a good popcorn movie, that's for sure.
B009K0P10K|5|Great show, written well and very good choice of actors,  I am always telling others to watch. I have it on Amazon so that every series is there for me when I have time to just enjoy something I want to watch and not channel hop the TV guide.
B006VRDZ44|4|Seaon 1 was very good. Kept me wanting to come back for more episodes.
B000068IEU|2|My folks wouldn't let me go to see this when it first came out, so I finally got my chance.  I can't say that I liked it and I certainly can't say that I enjoyed it.  The acting is atrocious.  The production values put it on the same level as a filmed-in-a-basement-apartment '70s porn film. (Not that I've ever seen one!) It alternates between being deathly dull and repulsively violent.  A curiosity at best.
B0089LOG02|5|This was so well written, I couldn't put it down.
B0091WNK8M|1|This was a low budget poorly made movie. Supposed to be for kids, but movie starts out with a male statue with too much focus on the statues penis. Gratuitous. No reason for this kind of stuff to be in a kids movie. Also the pirate named &#34;one eyed Willie,&#34; wow if we didn't know what that joke was about. They could have left out the penis stuff and references to drugs. Of course that is Hollywood for you.
B004EPYZUI|4|Great story telling... Great visuals... Dragons. Steampunk, awesome soundtrack, what more can you ask for!? Snyder had won me over with his first film (dawn of the dead remake ) and every film since. Cannot wait for man of steel.

B0007MWZEK|5|I love my swivel sweeper! I bought the two pack for $19.99 each plus shipping and handling from the main website which I think was $14.99 total. So overall I had gotten two for around $60. This thing does every thing the company says it does even though I think it's a bit pricy. I am so pleased with it! If you want it made right,go to their website. I've had mine for 3 months and gave the other one to my parents. My dad loves it and has taken over the vacuuming for my mom! My mom loves their old vacuum but she always wanted an upright cordless, now she has one.     When I say this thing does what the company says it will this means I've tried every thing the commercial says and it lives up to the commercial's garantee. This thing even picks up:    *Cat hair  *Kitty litter  *Kitty food (my cats are messy eaters)  *Small pieces of paper  *String (although if it's too long it'll bind up in the gears. It'll switch off automatically at a certain point. Then all you do is pull out the string then turn it on and keep on going.  *Dirt/Dust Bunnies (duh)  *Some different types of cereals (cheerios), etc.  *Food crumbs    You need to clean out the compartment after every two or three rooms because the only downside is it's a small compartment to hold the crap it collects. But it's easy to dump out and snap together and keep on going! My house is 1,000 sq foot so I can wait till I'm done with 90% of the house then clean out the tray. It's very easy to do.    Just do not forget to put it back on the charger for up to 8 hours. I've had mine for 3 months and love it still! My dad loves theirs and he asked his best friend and he said he has his for two years now and still loves it. Also, if you over charge it you'll wear out the battery, I haven't done this yet but I read up on it first before I bought mine. If you use it enough you'll know when it needs to be charged up again. The gears start slowing down to a hault fast.    This isn't a girly vacuum, it's for guys too!
B000GWE44U|5|It was an excellent story. It was hard to put down. My husband had never read a book, except in school. He read this and loved it. It has been more than 20 years, but I still keep it in my book case.

1881273989|4|Chapman has done an excellent job at coming down to the fundamentals of the ways people feel loved. The love languages he describes can be in any relationship, not just dating relationships, but the book focuses on these types of relationships. He gives EXCELLENT examples of people he has counseled regarding how to show interest and affection to the one they want to develop a deeper relationship with. The book help demystify and clarify some of the communication gaps that go on in relationships. It is an easy read, and a book that I highly recommend for people look to improve their relationships, platonic and beyond.

B00005YXZH|5|Reduced to simplest terms, Wilco, the brainchild of Jeff Tweedy, has embarked on a tour of our You-Knighted States as it wallows in the beginnings of a new decade. \\"I Am Trying...\\" appears to be about a relationship made fragile by tension and uncertainty, but a line here and there could easily refer to a terrorist. Not knowing when the song was written, I can only guess at Tweedy's antecedents. \\"Kamera\\" treats the themes of internal and external vision, how we see and are seen, and the tag line \\"No, it's not OK\\" tells us, as does the spelling of the title, that we don't see as clearly as we imagine. The sweet string intro to \\"Jesus, etc.\\" belies the dark poignancy of the lyric: \\"Bitter melodies turning your orbit around.\\" I especially like the parallel images of stars as setting suns and lovers as burning suns. \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" is a perfect deception, a song about illusion and loss, masquerading as a calliope theme. In the final analysis, Wilco has crafted a marvelous assembly of tunes, bright and dark, light and heavy, poured out for us to drench ourselves in.
B00B0LPWU6|4|Another good performance by Denzel.
B009UNGYHG|5|I love the Plantronics Legend bluetooth.  I have 3 of them. They have great sound quality & they are easy to pair.  I have had one since they first came out.
B00BMR5HOO|5|This app is awesome check the weather where ever you are just type your location it will tell you I enjoyed this app it is five rated
B00H99DBFQ|5|Bought this to charge my Samsung smartphone while traveling. It holds about 2 full charges for my phone. Plus it works to charge the kids' Samsung tablets, basically will charge anything with a mini usb port.
B00CRMX53S|5|I, as many others, absolutely love this song.  I put my two cocketiels on my shoulders and and we all rock out!

B0097PW7H8|5|This app will show you everything you need to know to keep your battery performing at peak.  It will manage the charging cycles and battery usage if you set it up correctly.  A good solid app.
B007TNQ7EY|5|Dude, this one is a hit. I am a huge fan of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto Series, on the PSP. This is much better. I am a big fan of the gyroscope. However the game comes by default at low sensitivity. I guess to make you look a fool... LOL it works. It could be a little smoother in the cut scenes, but vehicle control is Awesome! I love the one touch drive by! All I am missing is the cheat codes!
B000002IZ4|4|Each STP album sounds a little different than the other, yet somehow they all sound the same. Interesting. Anyway, &quot;Purple&quot; is a fine album. Songs like &quot;Meatplow&quot;, &quot;Lounge Fly&quot;, and  &quot;Unglued&quot; are awesome, and they keep that hard rock feeling  essential to their first album. Other songs, such as &quot;Interstate Love  Song&quot;, and &quot;Big Empty&quot;(one of their best)are great and are  very straight-forward tunes, and some of the most memorable of the 90's,  and &quot;Pretty Penny&quot; displays a little classic rock in it, possibly  a little CSN? As for the other songs, they are also good, and the album is  very eclectic. Also, the secret song is pretty funny: I think it's called  &quot;12 Gracious Melodies&quot;, but it's from some other artist, I don't  know, now I'm just getting confusing oh, well. Buy the album anyway, it's  worth it. Later.
B007GCY8FS|1|Not a book reviewer, but a casual reader. All that I can say is that as an avid Jack Reacher fan, this book was more than disappointing. As others have pointed out, having become familiar with the Reacher character, it seems that this book was written by someone unfamiliar with him. If it was, in fact, written by Lee Child, he either forgot what made this character great or  has no interest in sticking to his characters and is just satisfying his publisher.<br /><br />Either way, I am sad to say that I am done with Jack Reacher and am looking for a new fave.<br /><br />Recommendations are always appreciated!<br /><br />Save your money and thank me later!
B002HJ9PTO|3|This lavelier mike is a good deal. Very well build and with all needed accessories. The only negative point I could find is that it picks up too much ambiant noise. But for the price, I'm willing to deal with it as really good professional wireless lavalier mikes start above 500 $ per unit and I needed 4 lavalier mikes!
B00F1BFRA6|1|Love the series.  It was great to watch, but I got to the last dvd and it was broken...a real drag when it comes to finishing a series.
B00DHHFKE4|5|A very well read book, I didn't want to put it down and at the same time I didn't want the book to end!  Brilliant, must read book!
076115728X|5|When I saw this book, I thought it was the perfect gift for all the perfectionist children out there, including (and especially) their parents. Here's a gem of a book that finally celebrates everyday spills and paper tears and turns them into \\"happy accidents.\\" I bought it for my four-year old who went wild with it, as well as for my niece who cried last time she was drawing a line that didn't turn out \\"straight.\\" This book can turn a tear into a smile.  It's a lesson for kids as well as adults.

B0007GAERG|4|She is definately back with the voice! I have to say that I have really enjoyed listening to this album. The only problem for me are the tracks with Nelly and Shake It Off but the rest is great. Who knows these songs might grown on me.  <br /> <br />My favourites are Stay The Night, We Belong Together, Fly Like A Bird, I Wish You Knew.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this CD.
0007119550|3|It was not part 2 of storm of swords but the American edition of A Storm of Swords so I was more than happy with it.
0307887960|5|I've been on the Dukan diet for a couple of weeks now.  I've lost 7 pounds and feel great!  This book is very well written and readable, as if Pierre Dukan was having a face to face conversation with you, encouraging you and urging you on.  His explanations are excellent, the diet is clear and easy to follow, and each phase is clearly recapped at the end of the chapter for that phase.  The recipes that I've tried have been delicious.  I strongly recommend both the diet and the book!
B00FAPF5U0|1|Was okay my grandchildren loved it. I prefer puzzles,books,coin games. I was happy it was a free app. Not my type of entertainment. But it is a good game to have offered for others who do enjoy this kind of app.
B004ZZS4CC|4|This book was very moving and provided the reader with a real insight into how a young child survived a horrific ordeal (emotionally, physically and socially).
B000G0O5N2|5|Movie is great, its based on a true story. Shows how much our military does to help others as while keeping our country safe. definitely recommend buying this movie..
B00HYTLY64|3|This would have been a great Sunday afternoon...rainy day movie with nothing else to do.  Robert Redford does a fine job in this movie.  It's just no more exciting to watch that Open Water was.  Calking my bathtub would have more excitement at times.
0061849901|4|How depression feels to a young woman trying to make it throught the obstacle course of life.  Imminently readable but a heroic tragedy just the same.  An intelligent woman who left her mark on the world while a disease attacks and confuses her at every turn.  Note that she concentrates on the negative and ignores most of the positive--classic symptoms of depression, in additon to frequent crying and sleepiness.  For a brief moment she stood at the mountain peak--the toast of the town.  Very sad.
B004FRX0MY|5|You can find everything you desire with fast download time!
B003DZX44I|3|I did not like this product at all. Unless I don't understand what blu-ray is but it was mostly advertising to me even on the DVD itself. I will read the information on blu-ray and then decide if it is worth buying anymore of it is waste of money.
B00DPM7RJW|5|Colleen Hoover must be quite wise. She seems to understand love so well. Many people write about love, falling in love, acts of love, but few write about it with the deep understanding of it that is evident in her books. She also seems to understand the hearing impaired. I found that aspect of this story to be pretty realistic.<br /><br />This story is fraught with heartache and happiness, laced with reality, and glued together with humor and passion.<br /><br />Another home run, touchdown, goal scored! If you've liked any of her other books, you'll like this one. If you've never read one of her books before, this is a great one to start with. And then I highly recommend my personal favorite of hers (and my second fave book of all time) -- Hopeless. And then the sequel, Losing Hope. Both are brilliant.<br /><br />Colleen is one of those authors whose books I will always buy & read. She's never let me down yet!
B007IXWL2C|5|I was plesently surprised reading this book, it is not all about sex. It's about redemption, love, healing. But it does have a lot of sex !!!!

B00003CXE7|5|This movie is both one of the finest mainstream movies and finest DVDs ever.  The action of Ben Hur and fine writing of a great epic film screenplay combined with up-to-date, understated digital technology and a wonderful ensemble cast - this film is a   visually spectacular and sonically intoxicating.  Ridley Scott manages to put the viewer in the middle of the Roman Empire the way George Lucas hurled his viewers through outer space - but with Gladiator I didn't even suspect half of what I was seeing was digitally generated background scenery and backdrops until I saw the &quot;making of&quot; featurettes on the DVD.<br />In addition to Russell Crowe's great performance, both Richard Harris (Camelot) as Marcus Aurelius and Joaquin Phoenix (Parenthood, 8mm) as Commodus, his son and heir to the empire, turn in Oscar worthy performances.  The late Oliver Reed (Oliver, Tommy) also does a wonderful job.  The costumes, the special effects, the cinematography, and the sound are something to be experienced at home, in DTS, on a good surround sound system.  <br />This 2 DVD set is PACKED with special features, including quite a few &quot;Making of&quot; featurettes and an interview with Hans Zimmer, the soundtrack composer.  <br />My only criticism of the film - and I am a Lone Ranger on this point - is the musical soundtrack to the film sounds to my ears like other soundtracks (Bram Stoker's Dracula, for instance) and classical pieces (Mars from the Planets by Gustav Holst) that have been thinly disguised and re-arranged by the composer.  I honestly don't know if this is coincidence or intentional, but only devout ST and classical music fans will notice this.  Thank God it doesn't detract from the film, and in some places the ST is quite effective.  It is a shoe-in for an Oscar nomination.  Sonically - the film is superb.<br />Congratulations to the studio on the common sense to release with several different audio options - Dolby 5.1, Dolby 6.1 EX, and DTS - all on the same DVD.  Nothing more a consumer could ask for at this or any price.  Thanks.
B000FA57RG|5|CD Review:   The first cd is a first ever live production of Madonna's Re-Invention concert. The tracks flow one after the other and although the album is live content, the beats hit just as hard as any studio album! It grooves and thumps its way along the highlights of the concert!My favorite tracks are Nobody Knows Me, Vogue and I Love New York, but don't worry they all rock!     DVD Review:   First off, this look behind the scenes of the tour is twice as good as the original tour documentary. This is the best documentary I've seen EVER.  I watched it with great enthusiasm and extreme admiration the female pop-star. She -once more- proved that she really is the Queen of Pop, a tremendous trend-setter as far as fashion, politics and religion are concern. Her show was clearly provocative but was extremely inspired and glamorous. Madonna stands alone between two worlds... The stage and her family. There are numerous juxtapositions inside the film...Madonna is spectacular on the stage, but she is also a woman with political and ethical values. Madonna shows that she pulls out all the stops and never fails to push the envelope in any department, in this case it's political. \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" chronicles the events of her 2004 \\"Re-Invention World Tour\\" and Madonna showcases herself as a pop sensation, devoted Mother and Wife, political warrior, and most of all, her true self and her devotion to the study of Kaballah. From the beginning with the opening of \\"The Beast Within\\", Madonna begins with her partnership with music producer Stuart Price and having a very candid conversation about God and her beliefs and throughout the documentary, voices her opinion on the political and material world we live in today, yet she never comes across as preachy. There are several clips of her performances from the concert and her views on life off stage. It's genuinely touching, making us realize that we all have to be grateful for the blessings that we have in life and to not take them for granted. Want what you have and not what you don't is one of the most important messages. Her rendition of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" is absolutely mind blowing. The images depicted of the poverty stricken countries during the song is enough to make the toughest of people cry their eyes out. She delivers many important messages with her dancers and states that we all enter the world as better people than who we are and have compassion for all mankind and take into consideration the pain and suffering that is going on in the world. Without taking responsibility for your own actions and watching what you say to others makes your talents useless. This is so true. Madonna never ceases to amaze and impress and expose the world to closeted issues that must be tackled. In her own words, we are all responsible for making the world a better place. You could not ask for a better documentary. Even the if you're the least bit involved in her art/music and not an aficionado, anyone would appreciate this masterpiece. It is highly recommended.

B00DRPVE3M|1|I downloaded and tried to use tge app. I used facebook to lo in and tge app said I was banned for suspicious activity and I had got the app from an unauthorized third party. Ummm, I was just trying to play the game and I downloaded it from amazon. Lame!
B000088E6M|5|Album from decent rapper with some of the best production out there right now (Dr. Dre).  This will end up being an essential recording, unless 50 Cent can make one better and more media friendly than this one.  The only bad thing about the album is the violence.  Rap music needs no more violence.  Get this album for its musical quality, but don't do the things that the album talks about.
B0086700CM|5|its fun and u can play it any where u can do alot with this game u should get it no mater what.
1451666179|5|I love her honesty.  I read it in one day.  My husband bought it for me and read it first after he opened it to see what it was.  I found her when someone posted a link to her blog with the part about depression to explain it.  As someone who has been depressed and tried to explain it to loved ones, I bookmarked her link.  But it is so much more than that. Just her raw honesty and willingness to be true is great, but then it is entertaining too.  It's nice to know I am not alone.
B00AQL8VU4|5|When it comes to having apps like this available, especially when you are an Amazon fan, what is there not to love?
B003UESJJC|4|Really an edition made for the fan, all is there. the documentary is a pearl, and the quality of image gives an exceptional realism.  I am French and only regret that there is not under subtitles on the second disc , but without that this edition is perfect .

0312243022|3|This is a novel in which its author enters the minds of the characters and shows step by step how they go through a day in their lives. Possibly, it is the author's going back and forth in time and going from one woman to another or his jumping from inside one head to another that give this novel its troubles.  The story opens with a prologue, showing the suicide of Virginia Woolf.  The next chapter in in New York City, at the end of the twentieth century, and it continues with Clarissa Vaughn, getting ready to give a party for Richard Worthington Brown the noted author who is dying of Aids and who Clarissa loves. Richard has nicknamed Clarissa, Mrs. Dalloway.  In the rest of the book the novel goes back and forth in time between three women: Virginia Woolf, while she is writing Mrs. Dalloway during the 1920s; the pregnant Laura Brown who is bored with her life and her sons, one of them Dicky, and escapes to a hotel room just to read Mrs. Dalloway, during 1949; the fifty-two year-old literary agent Clarissa Vaughn toward the end of the twentieth century.  All three women have deep insights into things around themselves and are greatly introspective. They are also connected by the novel Mrs. Dalloway, in some way. Richard the author is a troubled man, despite the award waiting for him and he, too, is connected to all three women in some way. Throughout the novel, the details in the scenes and of a character are used to show the specific aspects of another character.  Although this book has won 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the 1999 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, and was later made into an Oscar-winning 2002 movie, it is a difficult book to enjoy. I first listened to it from its audio version. Thinking I missed something, I borrowed it in hardcover from the library. Granted, I liked the printed version better, but I still think it is a dark, difficult story, regardless of the perfectly wonderful prose, exquisitely written scenes, and the multifaceted plot.
B0035G0U2O|4|Movie was action packed but would be much to long for the little ones that would be watching. Good Movie!
0399224459|5|On the first review this was an average to good child's book, but after multiple daily requests for readings for over 4 months now I have come to believe this is a great book for the young ones. My 16 month old Granddaughter can read this book. She knows where every balloon, moon, and banana are. She knows all the animals and what they say. And she is getting the humor of having a bunch of animals talk to you in the dark of your bedroom.
B003M696QS|5|I was impressed how Van Lommel backed up his theories with scientific research, facts and studies. It puts NDE on a level that gives it a sense of measurability. It's the kind of books that needs to be re-read more than once. I highly recommend it for those who need science to back up the theory that we existed before this current life, and will continue to exist after.
B0095ZMMCK|4|I enjoyed this doorstopping, 835-page book and think most thriller enthusiasts will - if they can suspend disbelief that the President's son is running dangerous operations, including one in China that is unsanctioned. Some of the subplots come together predictably, but overall it holds interest with well-constructed and exciting scenes. I thought the dogfighting chapters were excellent. I also thought Adam Yao was more interesting than Jack Ryan, Jr.

1607747308|5|I purchased this book wanting to see the difference between this and Karen Kingston's Clear Your Clutter With Feng Shui.  I liked this one even better!  Kondo doesn’t go into all the placement of things in your house that to me was a HUGE relief of pressure I was feeling after I read Kingston.  My biggest take away from the KonMari Method is to discard all of your things BEFORE you organize.  And make sure you collect all like items from around the whole house before you do so.  Like the Feng Shui method, she says it is important to ask yourself if the item brings you joy.  I am currently in the midst of the first step.  She suggests tackling clothing first because it is to clothes that we are least attached.  So I gathered all of my clothes.  It makes sense not to organize until you purge because if you start in one area, you realize that there are similar things in another.  This is why she says that tidying room by room does not work.  Instead, she recommends keeping like items with like items and once all things that do not bring you joy are discarded, you have space and can figure out exactly where items can be stored.  I have already made a run to the local consignment shop and packed 7 bags of clothing to donate to Big Brothers/Big Sisters.  It is amazing how many things we keep thinking that we should because they were given as gifts or because there is some sentimental value.  However, the KonMari Method teaches that many times the item that has sentimental value has served its purpose and it is time to let go and allow new things to enter our lives.  Or the gift was to be received and it was the idea of someone choosing something with us in mind that really matters.  If we purchased something that we never even wore, we have to think of it as if the item served its purpose by providing us pleasure at the time we bought it.  If clothing remains folded up at the bottom of a pile, what good is it serving?  I have run out of time in this day to organize theclothes that remain in my room, but already I am seeing how much space I now have and realizing that I will not miss the jeans that I saved from 30 years ago just because… or the sweatshirt I had in college that I haven’t worn in years.  I will not miss the turtlenecks that I’d collected in case it got really cold and never wore them again because I no longer like the way they feel around my neck.  Getting rid of the excess that we never use or really do not love does, indeed, have a magical effect.  I am excited to start folding my clothing the KondoMari way so that instead of having piles on top of piles, articles will be arranged upright like papers in a filing cabinet.  Then I can actually see at a glance what I have in a drawer.  I was thinking that I should be ashamed of myself for having so much when there are so many who live with just the clothes on their back.  However, I will look at this as a lesson in gratefulness and I will no longer bring anything into my house unless it truly brings me joy.  I look forward to continuing discarding and cannot wait to get to one of the last items on Kondo’s list—sentimental items.  Why have I kept those letters from old boyfriends in high school?  Do I ever look at them?  Do they make me feel good?  No!  I can’t wait to go through all that stuff and purge… purge… purge!  I am by no means a hoarder, and if you came to my house you wouldn’t know that the clutter haunts and taunts me.  I am always thinking that I will clean it up next weekend or during summer vacation and those times come and go.  The book has awakened something in me and I am looking forward to tidying my house once and for all, thus freeing myself from the constant burden and allowing myself time to do things I actually enjoy.
B00FN5ZFOS|5|I absolutely love the Walking Dead series and I bought this blu-ray set, as the UK sets of seasons 1+4 are censored and have had some minor cuts to them and missing exclusive extras - 2+3 are uncut.    But a word of warning to Zone B+C importers - I have tested this set on my PS3 and IT IS NOT ZONE FREE - so make sure you have a ZONE FREE or modified blu-ray player, as I do, before you buy it.    Other than that - 5 STARS for a brilliant series and an uncut/uncensored boxset!
6304240554|3|DAWN OF THE DEAD follows the story that began in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Dead people are coming back to life as flesh eating zombies and no one really has any idea why. A small group of survivors, including a mall cop and a couple of news reporters, finds a refuge from the terror by boarding themselves up in a shopping mall. Zombies begin flocking to the mall in droves, but have no way of entering. Giving in to their every whim and desire, the group settles down to a fairly comfortable existence until a roving motorcycle gang finds out they have a helicopter. The motor gang has no desire to move in and live in the safety of the mall, but wants everything for their own. Their invasion of the mall brings about the film's climatic finish.<br /><br />Though the movie is fairly graphic and is a zombie flick, it's actually more of a commentary on materialism and consumerism and how it affects and infects all of us. As a commentary, the film is almost brilliant. As a zombie movie, DAWN OF THE DEAD set the bar for almost every other zombie movie to come. However, DAWN OF THE DEAD is also a movie and as a movie, it has a lot of faults. Like a Charles Dicken's novel, just about everything interesting or worthwhile that happens, occurs near the beginning and end of the movie. The middle, which should be the meat of the movie, doesn't contain much substance and the long commentary on our culture goes on too long. Nevertheless, even though the film isn't for the squeemish, DAWN OF THE DEAD is worth watching if your a fan of zombie or horror movies. Also, it's a movie that film buffs should watch just because there are very few horror films that are made that have a social context as deep as a Romero film and DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the best.

0307463745|5|Much of ReWork is memorialised common sense - but that kind of common sense that gets glossed over every hour of every day in every organisation in the world.<br /><br />It is written in a brutally economical style, consistent with its underlying message: everything is overcomplicated: simplify, simplify, simplify. It is also a manifesto for those who want to start their own business. For those who dream fitfully of pulling the rip cord on the corporate treadmill - and let's face it: in these miserable times, we are many - this might be just the firm push between the shoulderblades we need.<br /><br />Rework is funny, too, and it contains many quotable quotes. My favourite: \\"Policies are organisation scar tissue. They are codified over-reactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again\\".<br /><br />Beautiful: and so true. (I should know: I work in the legal department!)<br /><br />You'll be through it in a day, but you'll read it again.<br /><br />Excellent stuff.<br /><br />Olly Buxton

B007FG9LIE|5|Good luck trying to figure out what's going on as you read this book. Not just as you begin to read it - right up almost to the finish!  Yes, it will make sense in the end...but then all of your &#34;buts&#34; will start up.<br /><br />I never saw &#34;Twin Peaks&#34; but if it was comparable to Wayward Pines, I can understand why Crouch mourned its cancellation.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book, and I am looking forward eagerly to the rest of the trilogy. You will not want to put this down.
B004SBX112|1|This latest &quot;update&quot; (5 December 2012) no longer runs on my original Kindle Fire. It certainly used to previously. I already paid for this a year ago and refuse to have to pay another $3 for the Kindle-specific version. Whether this is Amazon's doing or Rovio's, I don't know but either way it's crappy practice.

B006885EFE|5|Wonderful series.  Made me appreciate what the WWII vets had to go through.  The only negative was the language.  No need for all the F bombs.  Although I am sure there was rough language among our soldiers, I highly doubt they swore like that.  There was really no need for that kind of language to show the severity of what they experieced.
B00DQC2FPM|4|item arrived in time frame, Nice car, child is able to make three different cars. Packaging was good, I will buy again from Lego
B008AK8FHM|4|What made it intriguing was the credentials of the author.  I would not have spent any time with it otherwise.  But as a scientist who had clearly \\"debunked\\" the notion of consciousness and of another, eternal realm in his former life, Dr. Alexander had enough credibility to cause me to read it.  I believe he experienced contact with a spiritual world.  The title, \\"Proof of Heaven,\\" may be a little overdrawn.
B00WJ2MP3C|5|Loved it
B00006NSGX|5|This album is between the  \\"very best\\" of Clapton!There are just 2songs \\"weaks\\", Tears in Heaven and change the world, but all the other 18 songs......are powerful and superb!One more car, one more rider....is a must for a eric Clapton fan!

B0098VYCCE|1|Charlize Theron was excellent and everything else mediocre. The dwarfs had some character and talent. The screenplay was actually pretty boring and predictable. I kept watching in hopes of improvement in dialog or character or relationships. Very superficial.

B00000IMTF|5|As far as I'm concerned, this is the best studio album that Rainbow ever made.  It featured the second, classic Rainbow lineup with guitar hero, Ritchie Blackmore, super-talented singer/songwriter Ronnie James Dio, drummer Cozy Powell, bassist Jimmy Bain, and keyboardist Tony Carey.  While the following \\"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\\" album with Blackmore, Dio, Powell, Daisley, and Stone was also very good, I think this album is better.    What really makes it an outstanding album is the pair of related songs, \\"Stargazer\\" and \\"A Light in the Black\\" each of which clocks in at over 8 minutes, even in these studio versions.  They're related because the narrator in the second song is clearly one of the freed slaves who helped build the tower for the stargazer in the first song.  Taken together, these two songs form one of the great epics of 1970s progressive rock.  In my book, they rank up there with Rush's 2112 and Hemispheres.  While the other songs on this album are also good, it is these two songs that really make this album special.    This is the album when Rainbow rose to greatness.  And they knew it.  It also has a beautiful and distinctive painting on the cover, one of my favorites from any rock album.
1435248244|5|This is what young adult fantasy fiction should be: imaginative, clever, philosophical, character-driven, exciting, deep, and poignant. In Tally's post-apocalyptic world, those ages 12-16 are referred to as Uglies as they wait to turn Pretty through surgery at the age of 16. Then they live lives of mindless partying and pleasure. When Tally's best friend, Shay, decides to run away from their totalitarian city and into the wilderness rather than become pretty, Tally is forced by the Specials to follow. But will Tally be able to betray her friend when she learns the truth behind her beauty-obsessed world? Being pretty might be more than just trying to make everyone equal and create peace. This book is a brilliant, clever, and imaginative fantasy allegory of our own beauty obsessed world, one that is particularly significant to early adolescence. There are no easy answers, but certainly the awful danger of conformity, especially in the case of physical appearances, is powerfully and refreshingly highlighted. The allegory goes further, as well, as it tackles the very issue of moving from the world of childhood and into adulthood (from late high school to college). The book wonderfully and powerfully captures the psychological world of the early adolescent, trying desperately to understand the changes not only in their body and world, but also the daunting future that lies ahead of them as they move out of adolescence and into early adulthood. A great book, absolutely perfect for ages 10 to 16, an easy read, but one that is deeply engaging and meaningful. This book definitely deserves a place on the shelf beside The Giver, and is one of the best fantasy books written for young adults, particularly to capture the psychological world of the twelve year-old. Grade: A
B00SI7GCJK|1|I could not wait to see this film, as I really enjoy good science fiction. What I witnessed was slow, bloated, poorly acted and directed by the overrated Mr. Nolan. It would take too much of my time to point out all of the absuridities of the plot. I am all for suspension of disbelief, but once you suspend disbelief this new world still has to make sense. A classic example is Independence Day. Aliens invade earth, could happen, what could not happen is disrupting the alien mother ship using a laptop to send a lethal virus. REALLY? Their technology is thousands of years advanced and they use what? Java, Linux? Now for Interstellar, Matthew McConauhey saves mankind by surviving a trip though a wormhole that transports him behind his daughter`s bedroom wall so he can transmit information that would fill the Library of Congress via binary morse code using the time honored tactic of tipping books off her bookshelf like a ghostly apparation. Instead of fleeing her bedroom screaming \\"poltergiest\\" like any normal 10 year old, this odd child, of course, assumes it's a message from her interdimensional father and is able to dicipher the book tipping and save mankind. . If you're in the mood to watch an intelligent, imaginative and entertaining sci fi film with a warm father daughter component, skip this mess and watch Contact again.
B000002AGN|5|This was my first exposure to The Dave Brubeck Quartet. My dad had this album in his record collection. As he bought it just for Take Five,and that was the end of him playing the album, so I kind of inhereted it. I enjoyed the album right away, and began collecting albums by Brubeck one after and another, week after week. After listening to this album, I was also introduced to drummer, Joe Morello. And now, after looking for albums by Brubeck, I only get albums by Brubeck with Joe Morello on it, and others with Joe Morello as a sideman. Anyway, this album starts off with one of the three most famous DBQ songs, (blue rondo a la turk, koto song, and take five). I had no idea about time signatures when I first listened to this album, being about age 12. But somehow I managed to play along with on the drums, no problem. For some strange reason, I was able to play all of Brubeck's odd time signature songs like Eleven Four, Castilian Drums, and of course Take Five, as most kids struggle with odd time signature songs, but I picked it up like that! The next song, Strange Park, was allright, displaying some 3/4, 4/4 techniques featured on the next side. The famous Take Five, which I new nothing of its signifigense was cool, especially with the drum intro. I almost instantainiously picked up the 3/4 brush patterns on 3 to get ready, Kathy's Waltz, and Everybody's Jumpin'. This album sounds like a real late night album. It's echo and coolness, sounded like backround music for a cd store, or a coffee shop. Most other Brubeck albums are not like this. Albums like Southern Scene, Gone With The Wind, and Countdown remind of sun, and the outdoors! I dont think there's a jazz fan in the world who doesn't own this on record or cd, or hasn't heard Take Five. Any young kid or an adult who is just getting in to jazz, will love this album, or jazz, for that matter, after listening to this!
B003VANOFY|1|Replaced 4 times now, and I need to have this set replaced, as well.<br /><br />Worst quality headphones I have ever owned or even heard of.
B00I3ULXBY|3|It was nice for the price but I thought it would have looked better.
B004SD5GZ4|3|Text reflow mode is excellent for reading PDF documents on the small screens of phones and even some smaller tablets.  Until version 9, I loved this app, and its reflow capability.  In version 10, this functionality is broken.  Reflow mode is still there, but it breaks words across lines.  Makes smooth reading completely impossible because you have to stop at the end of pretty much each line to figure out that last word.  Given that reflow worked correctly (words that were too long to fit on the previous line were moved to the next line in full, not broken across lines), this bug seems to have been introduced due to poor quality control.  This app would be worth 5 stars if this issue is fixed.
B00F30S0Y0|3|Unusual music. it was not displeasing to me but it was very different.  the lyrics are sort of religious/historic in nature as well. i found that a bit surprising. More like rock ballads instead of just a &#34;song&#34;.  I may not be describing this well.  i enjoy so many types of music that this was surprising to me that i couldn't really categorize it.  A good thing?<br />listen to the snippets online first before you try.  like i said i like it, but not enough to purchase another by this group. They are English and i normally enjoy English groups as they are more to my taste.
B005ZOBNOI|5|The title of this review is an oxymoron because I felt it was deep enough to at least come close to accurately representing this book.<br /><br />Let me start by saying this book is a tear jerker but meaning full and definitely a good one.<br /><br />Its more challenging then most things I've read (I'm 14) but I really enjoyed it. It challenges you enough to make you really think, about life, death, everything in between, and if there really is much in between...or if it even matters.<br /><br />The main characters are unusual and peculiar but they make you laugh. Not cheap humour but pure unadulterated comedy. Yet it still manages to portray serious topics in a way that makes you really care.<br /><br />The book has a spectacular plot. Unique and extremely creative! Rich with love and honestly creating a characters life that makes you marvel at the depth of some peoples (John Greens)imagination.<br /><br />To put it simply I loved it but I cannot describe it accurately . It wouldn't sound right. You must simply read it and form your own opinion !!
B000S81MHY|5|Surprised at how compact this X-Y Axis Table is.  I added it to my small Dremel Drill Press by making a simple adapter 'board' that secures the Proxxon X-Y Table in place.  Plan on using it for small projects, mostly hobby stuff.  BTW, the price on Amazon was the best I could find anywhere; shipping was extremely fast too.  Fully satisfied with this item.  Cheers!

B004MC8CA2|5|Love it and all the features as well as the variety of versions there is. I do wish king James wasn't the only version available to read aloud because I do take advantage of having it read to me while driving and such. I am happy with it.

B00BAXFECK|5|Excellent book with lots of twists.
0380789035|5|What a ride! This is a book when you start reading it, you don't want to stop. It is a work of genius in the fiction/mythology realm. Mixing truth, legend & the author's imagination, this story comes alive.<br />The story unfolds with a man named Shadow.(a former prisoner) He is hired by an older gentleman named Wednesday. Shadow is his &#34;go to&#34; man, to do what he wanted done. Shadow is followed by his dead wife Laura. Being dead doesn't stop her from helping her former husband.<br />We find out that there is a war going on. America is made up of<br />people who came from distant lands. Countries where Gods/Goddesses were worshiped there, for centuries unending. These Deities continued to live & be strong in the Americans who brought them over with them.<br />Sadly, there are other &#34;Deities&#34; that take the devotion & especially our attention & time from us now. These new &#34;Deities&#34; are the internet, computers, phones with connection to movies, games & other people. We have replaced our &#34;worship&#34; to these new gadgets and spend our time in these things.<br />The Old Deities needs us & our way of life needs to be different. Which of us can exists without the other? Who or what type of life should we, as Americans choose?<br />Read along, and decide for yourself.
B00HXYKYIE|2|I didn't like this book, but finished it anyway.  I had read one previous by the same author, and it was marvelous, so I know she can write.  And that writing talent shows in this book as well. But the plot, storyline, structure, and characters are unbelievable, unlikable (for the most part), and undeveloped.  As other reviewers have noted, she uses the (gaining popularity) method of jumping from one character's narrative perspective to another. The result breaks the flow and frankly is a mess - you're just beginning to get engrossed in one storyline and perspective, and then it changes to another character.  Alice and her Husband are unlikable - Alice has terrible judgment for being such a 'smart' woman, and her husband is a nut case.  Jenna, her left behind daughter (there's a pun in that line re the ending) is unbelievably precocious for a 13 year old. I could go on, but trust me the other characters are thinly developed and don't add much to the plot - you even tend to forget who is who. Some criticize (mildly) the Elephant angle.  I liked it, but then again, I am fascinated by Elephant behavior.  If you REALLY want to read a wonderful book on the subject read &#34;Elephant Company,&#34; a true story based on one Englishman's life in Burma working for a Teak company where Elephants were the lifeblood of the industry from the early 1900's through the second world war.  This book barely touches the surfaces of Elephant behavior.  Read 'Elephant Company' (a great story as well) and you'll fall in love with Elephants forevermore.  I can't recommend this book, and I will be more careful regarding ready Jodi Picoult in future - i.e. download a sample.
0374105235|5|This book is a must read for anyone. Boys soldier is well written, keeps you in the story and paints a picture that concludes like a fairytale.
B007MNV5WU|1|this app is too expensive for what the game is like I mean 3$ coming it should be 0.99 or free
B00N3AYP4Q|3|Ben Howard's &#34;I Forget Where We Were&#34; is my introduction to his music.  I saw it in new releases, looked at some online videos and decided to pop for the set.  He's got a wispy delivery.  This is more mood music, not rock & roll, which is fine.  I've spun the disc about three times.  So far it as neither really grabbed me nor really made me cringe.  It's good, but not a disc to which I'm going to return repeatedly.  Two stand out.  &#34;In Dreams&#34; sparks some energy with Ben's pretty acoustic guitar & a brisk delivery on the lyric, &#34;In dreams I have watched it spin, seen the violent crack of atoms where all light comes in; In dreams I have lain in sin just to be the cracked and the cared for.&#34;  &#34;Conrad&#34; meanders sweetly with its whimsical guitar line and Ben's vocals dreamy, &#34;Life lasts, only one thing left to roll, last year to learn.&#34;  Howard excels lyrically more than melodically, but like good poetry his lyrics are thoughtful and unique.  Enjoy!
1430308001|5|Having looked through a dozens of tactic puzzle books I see something extraordinary in this one.  while many books include interesting, witty and clever puzzles with varying amounts of hints, this book actually teaches you HWO to think through the tactic.<br /><br /> this guy works with your thought processes itself, breaking into a conversational style that I expect to be highly effective in teaching better chess.  I also find the idea of increasing complexity and the very methodical size and scope of the book to be very useful at well.<br /><br />I'm OLD (40) and without tons of examples its just hard to learn new tricks. LOL.<br /><br />right so disclaimers.  I've only had the book for a week, so whether this book can bring my tired class E game up is an open question.  Also no One thing can do everything;  since its methodical and complete- there's tons of hints.  There's still a need to do better at recognizing, when to look for tactics.  ,.
B00EHMFC78|5|Good book....Love the author
B004GJDQT8|3|have used a couple of times seems ok works well simular to website so is easy to use no no
B00E257S86|4|Interesting how dramatic innovations don't fit the successful business principles mold. Ok to fail getting out of the chute, start small, find a market, and then let it evolve. What is missing is there is not much emphasis on needing creative visionaries surrounding you so complacency and tunnel vision doesn't overtake successful companies. Stay youthful.
B00BAXFECK|1|Actually, it is less than one star.  I thought it was terrible.  Unnecessarily long, (Did she have an editor?)  too much depressing detail about the drugs and alcohol, and for what purpose.  I kept looking for the redeeming value in it all, how was she going to pull it together for a good reason.  I actually only got to 70% on my reader, and as the book club thought the ending was less than satisfying, I don't think I will finish it.  I've NEVER done that before, and I am a voracious reader.  But really, it was a waste of time wallowing through trash accompanied by constant foul language.
B008JMKN4Y|5|I loved this book. I could not put it down. I hope there is more to come for Travis and Abby!!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|5|I loved the series!! The first two books were so amazing I hung on every word and couldn't turn the pages fast enough. The third book has a few spots that aren't as exciting but over all I really enjoyed the series and all three books!
B0036S4CTS|3|This is just another typical loves story between friends who can never really seem to get the timing right on their relationship.  I expected great things after hearing rave reviews from my friends, but I think the book fell a little short.
B0064MGU98|5|Really enjoyed it.
B00001OH7P|3|Now I ask you, how can you rise and fall when the world's about to be blown up? And where does it actually say Ziggy is an alien? I challenge anyone out there to give me PROOF that Ziggy Stardust is an alien. A starman is mentioned, but he doesn't appear to want to land. Ziggy could be a car boot salesman from Dulwich for all we know. I mean, aliens don't say \\"wam bam thank you, ma'am\\", they say \\"take me to your leader\\". At least, the one in my bedroom did the other night. He always seems to show up when I forget my meds. He's Gnome like, and laughs a lot. So we talked for a bit and I came to the conclusion that aliens are likely to be scientists who want to take soil samples or give ultimatums to the UN, not strap on guitars and become rock stars. And they wouldn't get past the medical if they were confused about their sexuality. So where's the evidence, eh? Eh? who started this rumour that Ziggy Stardust was from out of space? Besides, if he was actually the alien, would he say \\"put your raygun to my head, press your spaceface close to mine\\"? No, because he would be holding the raygun himself. And on the eponymous track it says the kids killed the MAN, not the alien! I rest my case. So really, I reckon it's about some guy from East London who is so dumb he starts a rock band in the last five years of planet Earth's existence. I mean, how are you going to collect royalties? Doesn't matter, really, the music's rather fun. 'Soul Love' has rather an interesting lyric which I'd never paid much attention to. Aliens are distracting when you're on the headphones. Medication time.
B00026WU9Q|5|I was skeptical when the remastered Dylan CDs hit the shelves a year ago.  I asked myself, CBS/Columbia/Sony/Bob wants me to buy his CDs all over again  on top of his vinyl/cassettes?  True, some remasters shine: Layla by Derek &amp; The Dominoes, The Beatles Yellow Submarine Songbook CD, the Zeppelin catalogue.  However, others are cynical cash grabs that offer minimal improvement in sound (namely, the Stones reissues).  Only after a year did I finally try one of the Bob remasters, one of my favourites, Bringing It All Back Home.<br />The verdict?  Excellent.<br />Every track gains from remastering.  Each song rings with warmth and detail.  In the original 1990 CD issue, the instruments are lumped into one muddy, joyless mass of sound.  Here, the lead guitar, bass, organ and drums speak are distinct.  You can hear actually hear each instrument, each guitar lick, each drumbeat, each bass pattern and keyboard note.  When blended together into a simple, but exciting mix, the instruments mesh perfectly with Bobs vocals.  In other words, the songs rock.<br />Thats clear from the opening notes of Subterranean Homesick Blues to the blues raunch of Outlaw Blues and Dada juggernaut of Bob Dylans 15th Dream.  The improved sound is also evident on the sublime love songs, She Belongs To Me and Love Minus Zero/No Limit which flow with a newfound grace.<br />The remastering has wiped the grime off of Dylans vocals which are now are pungent and warm throughout, especially on the acoustic B-side starting with Mr. Tambourine Man. <br />Its a cliché, but Dylan has never sounded so good.  It used to be chore to listen to the heavily compressed, flat Dylan CDs from the 90s, but now this music is a pleasure, whether on speakers or headphones.<br />Even the cover is sharper and more colourful than its predecessor.  The booklet is more generous, but it shamefully omits the names of Dylans session players, the men who helped Dylan go electric and revolutionize rock music.  (If anyone from Sony is reading this, why?)<br />My only caveat is to buy these CDs at a good price.  Its fair to say that most customers of these reissues already own the original CDs and shouldnt pay more than say $11 (Canadian) per disc.  At that rate, Ill buy them all.
B00JD0PMCE|5|great book hated for it to end
B004I744AS|5|Works great on Kindle Fire.  Nice User interface you can customize.  The best feature is that you can download the dictionary part for offline use.

B0009MAO46|3|I recieved the movie in a timely manner and it was, as advertised, new and still in it's shrink wrap. I would suggest better packaging for delivery, as the case was slightly damaged. The movie itslef was in excellent condition and I would purchase form this source again.
B008JFURII|5|the old guys still rock!
B00EOARZ4G|3|His earlier books keep a good flow.  This one drags too much.  It is still a good, relevant story to today's headlines.
B00LLMFAAG|5|I grew up with this music. It is timeless and still cant be beat. I hope they have more of the same on the next movie.
0553347845|3|Not quite as good as &quot;Surely you're joking...&quot; but written in the same spirit. Especially interesting was the section on the Challenger disaster. He solved the problem with beautiful simple logic that will have  you saying, &quot;Gee, why didn't I think of that!&quot; Especially  revealing was his encountering government red tape and annoyances, which  goes to show several heads in Washington need to roll.
B00KF2KHYM|5|Great new music!!
160094048X|4|Let me start off by saying that I am not vegan. I am vegetarian, but I am a baker and I like to dabble in vegan baking, as it gives me new challenges and opportunities to try different things. With that said, I am really enjoying this book. Most of the recipes that I have tried have yielded great results, with the end products being very similar or exactly like their non-vegan counterparts. So far I have tried the following recipes from the book:     Chocolate Chip Cookies: Being as Chocolate Chip Cookies are one of my favorites, this was the first recipe that I tried from this book. I wasn't entirely pleased with this recipe. I was sure to follow the directs exactly, but each time I got dough that was so greasy that it wouldn't hold the chocolate chips. What is worse is that once I managed to get the cookies on the tray and baked, there was still a trail of greasiness left behind by the cookies (I know for a fact I did not screw up the measurements, and I also tried the recipe twice adding a little less oil than called for, still no luck).    Oatmeal Raisin Cookies: Good, but I felt like something was missing from them. I think the recipe just needs a little tweaking and then it will be great.    Deluxe Cocoa Brownies: Very good. I made these because I was craving brownies. From what I read in another review, these may be perceived as dry brownies (I guess some may think they look dry in the picture in the book), but there are definitely not. They are moist and so good. I got my dad to try these and he had no idea that they were vegan. My only problem with this recipe is that perhaps they are a bit too cakey for brownies. I know a lot of people who enjoy fudgey brownies more than cakey brownies. If you are looking for a fudgey brownie, this may not be the right recipe for you.    Graham Crackers: Really good, and very similar to store bought graham crackers. I made these and brought them in for my friends in school, and they had no idea that they were vegan. My onefriend thought that I was lying when I said that I made them...haha. For those interested in making them: they are best with the cinnamon sugar on top.    Chocolate Cut-Out Cookies: I liked these, but not enough to keep making them over and over. I didn't think they were anything special.    Gingerbread Cut-Out Cookies: Good, but I feel like they could be a little spicier. Also, I had some problems with the dough being really sticky. I had to add some flour to get it to not stick to everything, so that probably affected the flavor a bit.    All in all, it is a pretty good book. I love the pictures, and the fonts are a fun addition. I also enjoy that it has a section about ingredients and substitutions since some of the ingredients may not be available to people. I would definitely recommend this to vegans and non-vegans alike.
B00GH75V1S|3|another futuristic movie,  ok story line, good cast, exciting special effects and action scenes .  worth the rental to have some entertainment for the evening.

B00003CWL6|5|Great movie.
B0036S4B6M|4|Kerman candidly addresses and discusses typical stereotypes about lesbians, prisoners, and ethnicities throughout her accounts. The most impressive piece of this book is the revelation that we may come from different places in the world, different neighborhoods, different families, different religions, different relationships, but we are women, and most of all, we are human, humans all capable of making mistakes. Those mistakes carve our way through life, the good, the bad, the portions of regret and the times of realizations which bring us to our knees. Kerman delivers A wonderful book full of celebrating our differences and discovering our similarities.
B000W94FE6|2|Sorry to say but I felt this book was overrated. It has a lot of great stories about people in flow but doesn't really talk about how to create the flow yourself and &#34;find happiness.&#34; The entire book can be summarized in a couple pages

0553418025|5|I finished this book, which is not particularly small, in less than a day. It's just that good! Read it, you won't regret it!
B00AGJ4HC2|5|A great starter game. Easy to run through a few rounds before continuing to others in a game night, but still great all on its own. Bought it as a gift and had so much fun I had to get my own copy.
B0052RDHTM|5|Another great Ken Follett - he hit this one out of the park. I always know it's a great book when I contnue to think about the characters days after I finish the book.
B008JFUOVI|4|This is a great movie and is now part of the rest of the series I have..Never get enough of this type of comedy
B008GXHOFW|5|This is one of the best games I own, I recently bought it for my PlayStation and this app is very similar to the console version. I LOVE IT. PLEASE BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO :)!!!!!!

1476727651|5|great
B00GT35G9C|5|Great characters.  Nice full season mystery plus individual stories each episode.  Right balance of drama/feel good.  Veronica is a hero which I like.  Love the father/daughter relationship which is so rare in a series.  The Mars family manages lower middle class with style - a much needed message.
B00000420F|5|Bartoli should really receive all the credit here for bringing these songs to life.  It isn't just the beautiful vocal tone that impresses, but her probing interpretation into the meaning these songs have.  It is almost as  if I have to stop my cd player after each song just to digest what I have  just heard because there is so much emotion, drama, and dynamic intensity  througout.  My favorites are &quot;Caro mio ben&quot; (which is easily  butchered, but sounds so fresh in Bartoli's hands) and &quot;Gia sole dal  Gange&quot; to name just a couple.  I like most everything Bartoli has  done, but this is a very special disc.
B00AZL3PBK|5|This game is really nice it's like a different version of Mario brothers but sometimes it  dose but other than its a really nice family friendly and fun game to play
B000Q76K1A|5|Is one of those movies that no matter how old is it. Is always great to watch at any age.
B008JGSM6G|5|I just cant stop playing this. Its super fun for a simple game. I also recommend pixel twist from the same developer
B00C1BUYX4|5|Daniel Day-Lewis was Lincoln, no doubt. Amazing historical account in all aspects.<br />A must see for everyone! You won't be disappointed.
B00QROI70S|5|I am Groot.
0307454541|5|When I started this book I had my doubts.  The first few pages, I thought, were confusing and boring, but once I got going I could not put this book down.  It's a great story that will surprise the reader!  It's like three different stories in one book.  I usually do not like reading mystery books, but Steig Larrson had me hooked!  I can hardly wait to start The Girl Who Played with Fire!
B004R2DS9C|5|This is perfect for lego storage. It's cute, easy to carry and makes clean up even easier.<br /><br />We have a good amount of Lego sets and this holds them well. I think the size is great, not too small but not obnoxiously large either.
4805311193|5|I've been educated to a very important part of the Japanese Revolution that I didn't know about.  Really very interesting.
B00933JL0A|5|Fun game. A good easy way to mellow out and interesting enough to keep you interested.
B003QP4NPE|4|I liked this book. It started out just like many of the mysteries I have read in the past  but it develops quickly into something else. Daemon takes an interesting turn shortly after the second murder and keeps going from there.  The twists and turns in this book are fun to follow. The technology is interesting and it does raise thoughts about whether some or all of this could happen. I recommend this book.
B003UYUP58|5|Nicely written and engaging. Tells the biology of cancer without getting too technical. Provides interesting analogies. I recommend this book to friends and patients.
1400049628|5|...getting straight to the point, this book is such a fun read. I stayed totally engaged and love it.
1617751588|4|I love the video cartoons for Simon's Cat drawn by Simon Tofield. Getting Simon's Cat in Kitten Chaos from the library was a no-brainer when I saw it show up at our library. While it's a cute book that I enjoyed, I don't think it works quite as well as the videos.<br /><br />Given that I thought I'd like it a bit more than I did, I tried to figure out what the issue might be. I think it's relatively easy to mentally compare this to Garfield, the other well-known cartoon cat. Since Garfield started as a comic strip, the books retain the feel of the character. Simon's Cat started as a video cartoon, and it seems like some of the humor of the character comes from the movement and action. The drawings are a bit random in places, and it's more difficult to capture the story that is normally communicated in one of the Simon's Cat videos.<br /><br />Even with that assessment, Kitten Chaos is still a fun (and quick) read. If you like the Simon's Cat videos, Kitten Chaos is worth reading.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowed

0439023521|5|The movie buzz is what got me interested in the series, but I wanted to read the books as soon as possible. I read them the 1st time a few weeks after seeing the movie and read them a 2nd time several months later<br /><br />I was amused that Stephenie Meyer has a quote on the cover, since she's not one to talk about good writing. Twitter user UncleYo put it as follows - \\"Stephanie Meyers has a quoted review on The Hunger Games' cover. That's like Justin Bieber reviewing The White Album.\\"<br /><br />I felt the book and the movie were both good, just different, they were both effective in their storytelling medium.<br /><br />In both cases, I caught a lot more details the 2nd time.<br /><br />The big difference is that Peeta seemed a lot more impressive in the book.<br /><br />It makes sense that the would-be Mrs. Everdeen met him buying medicinal herbs, but I had remembered the Mellark story of falling for an Everdeen singing voice.<br />Mrs. Everdeen's old nice clothes was another cool reference to her past.<br />Peeta taking Haymitch to task in the morning on the train gave me more respect for Peeta. I liked how Katniss felt threatened rather than impressed by that.<br />Peeta and his father being so nice made it harder to hate them like I had wanted to.<br /><br />Peeta's behavior now seems like obvious foreshadowing of his interest in Katniss.<br />I noticed Peeta wondering if his father wanted daughters. I wondered about that for many parent characters, including Mr. Everdeen and sons. I hadn't remembered the concept was mentioned in canon.<br /><br />It seemed odd for Katniss to mention horse alongside beef and chicken as fancy meat Merchant Section people ate.<br /><br />Training seemed different, more of a struggle/challenge but also more productive.<br /><br />It seemed like a fighting challenge should be solely about fighting skill instead of ability to talk up sympathy. I had blamed tributes/staff for an underhanded tactic instead of the Capitol for setting it up that way. Also, part of me underestimating Peeta was his fighting skills.<br /><br />Because it's dystopic fiction, a lot of it besides the characters' personality traits doesn't seem personally relevant. I identified with Katniss' negative personality traits of excessive cynicism, not wanting any help and underestimating oneself. I had seen Peeta as a loser for being even worse at talking to women than I am, dismissing much of the rest of him.<br /><br />Evne though the setting is extreme, I identified with Katniss' habit of excessive cynicism, not wanting any help and underestimating oneself. Peeta seemed like a great counterpoint to all that. At first I thought he was kind of a loser for being even worse at talking to women than I am (is that possible?). That has caused me to overlook many of his strengths.<br /><br />The rooftop moral stand came off differently. In the movie, it seemed noble. Book Katniss saw it as holier-than-thou. I understood why Katniss was surprised at the crush reveal, but handn't understood why she was angry about it. Well, at first she had seen Peeta as competition, and it took her some time to lose that feeling. That seems why it took her a lot of tiem to fall in love with him and stop being in denial about that.<br /><br />The arena action moved fast, yet was still well described - the dehyradration, fireballs, Rue conversation, supplies destruction, all of it. Cato was reeling form the tracker jacker attack, which is why he couldn't manage to finish off Peeta - I thought that was a plot hole. Similarly, I'm not sure if Clove really waited too long to finish off Katniss.<br /><br />I noticed Katniss talking about her hearing gradually returning. I forgot there were two cave scenes, before and after the feast. It was clearer Katniss not wanting kids was about the Reaping as opposed to some other reason.<br /><br />At the end, it was clear Katniss was scared of Gale's reaction to the Peeta situation. I wasn't sure if the Capitolwould actually have two victors - Katniss and Peeta played that very well. It was a great setup for things really getting interesting in the sequel.would actually have two victors - Katniss and Peeta played that very well. It was a great setup for things really getting interesting in the sequel.
0765325950|5|Waited a long time and very glad to find the ending.  I have been pleased at the Brian Sanderson fill in/completing the series and I think Robert Jordan would have been pleased.  I know there have been complaints but the series had to end somewhere!  I liked it!
B009CG29RK|4|Our entire family was rolling with this one. We all really enjoyed this movie and are looking forward to watching the second.
B00H71PBQ8|1|My wife loved it, not my cup of tea.
B00D8CSVLW|5|It's almost as if it were true! Grisham has a deep knowledge of the law and the South that is evident in the stories that he writes. This one doesn't let him down and it is a pleasure to read.
B00DPM7TIG|5|i thought this book was a great read I never wanted it to end
B00BESIKWM|1|I'm a fan of the video game so I thought I would give it a chance. Not worth the 3.99 we paid. I feel like the studio that produced this movie should reimburse us for sitting through it.
B004HW7JH4|5|This scored for me and was well received. I lived Mad Men - so for me personally - it is OK.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This is The Best Game Ever !!! I Play It 24/7 But If There Was Other Hint Tacticts ... That Would Be Great
B004QX07G4|3|BUT---I found this book lacking in her usual charm and wit.<br />I've not read any of her other books but after reading this I will stick to<br />Ellen in person and not on the written page.  I thought her humor just missed<br />without her quick and fun personal delivery.
B006885LZM|3|Not as good as Band of Brothers, but still worth watching
B005ZUR724|5|This is a good game..Graphics are awesome.. Huge world to explore..Multi player nonlinear game... new content updates regularly.. Worth 7 bucks.

B006VRDZ44|5|Fascinating look into a long-gone time and place, with flawed but compelling characters.
B003UBTX6S|5|This book is a really good !!!!<br />Keeps you coming back for more, it continues where the book Beautiful Creatures left off.
B001BC2ZS6|4|Steinbeck's craft triggers conflict.  He lets us speculate about what we would do, and none the choices are not easy.
B001U3Y5XE|5|Though some of the fun in picture guessing games is seeing how bad people draw and still manage to guess the right answer, this game helps those who are constantly excluded for their poor skills.  Its basically look at the picture card, build it with legos the best you can, and have a blast.  It may just be a chance for the tables to turn on the great drawers!  Kids and adults alike can play and all cards are appropriate (with some funny potty humor but no innuendoes).  Love this game!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I noticed that some of the newer critical reviews mentioned that it doesn't come with \\"alot\\"  of LEGOs.  Believe me, when it comes down to it, you don't need a lot.  And if you do need more(and you are presumably someone who has access to more LEGOs because you bought it), just add more!  Can you imagine how big of a box you would need to fill EVERYONE'S desire for that one part?  The fun is in guessing, not how great of a master you are at making a LEGO masterpiece.  Its supposed to be challenging to guess or it would just be called \\"make a lego design game and then its your neighbor's turn.\\"
B00005JMJ4|3|After reading a good portion of the reviews for this movie, it becomes clear that folks that like it feel so much superior to those that didn't. Any film with artistic aspirations seems to have a built-in ace in the hole: if you didn't like it, you didn't get it. Clearly, if you gave it less than 5 stars, it was over your head. According to the films' many ardent fans, those of us that didn't care for it must obviously fall into that vast, amorphous population so ruined by coarse American culture that a subtle and delicate piece of art like this is lost on us. Christ, Americans are so pedestrian in their tastes. It's rather embarrassing to be one, isn't it?<br />I might add here that this little film did very well in America, did nicely on Oscar night, and the DVD sales aren't doing too badly either. So to say that this film can't be appreciated by the blunt, obvious taste of America is incorrect. I might also respond to those reviewers critical of American film making by saying that most of the great European directors, particularly the French New Wave, learned their craft by worshiping at the feet of the great American masters of the thirties and forties. Still, this film didn't do as well as, say, Bad Boys II. But then there is a good reason for that.<br />I remember reading that Francois Truffaunt was a huge fan of American gangster films, and in fact remarked more than once he considered them the only kind of film that interested him. How could this be? How could the director of such a  tender character study as Jules and Jim get off on James Cagney and George Raft (who were the big-budget &quot;action&quot; stars of their day)? The answer is simple: in an action film (yes, like Rambo, which was a very good film, by the way), the situations are heightened to an unusual level, thus characters in the film are themselves heightened and brought into sharp focus. Action films, in the most dramatic of terms, always have a very powerful conflict that needs resolution. What characters do under the extreme pressure, in action, is very interesting. Thus the experience of watching a good action film can be a very intense experience. You folks that turn up your noses at Rambo are missing plenty of great cinema.<br />What the zealous fans of this film don't get is this: it is very possible to dislike this film while at the same time &quot;getting&quot; every bloody, boring second of it. I mean, c'mon, somebody make me fall down laughing and call this film &quot;deep.&quot; Lost in Translation was a dull, pretensious, childishly obvious piece of filmmaking. It was a long student film about (what a surprise) alienation. Oooh, I bet Sofia Coppola feels alienated herself, much like the young female lead she posed in endless &quot;lonely girl&quot; shots, don't you think? It was not a terrible movie; just immature. It didn't have what a great film like Die Hard had: a great conflict involving great characters. Bill Murray saved the day by adding his talents, which made it worth a rental. The last scene, which was the only gripping scene in the film, was very moving. It just took way too much celluloid to get there.<br />By the way, all you European lovers should go to Europe sometime, or anywhere in the world, for that matter. You know what they are watching? The current blockbusters from Hollywood. You know why? Because Hollywood learned long ago how to make a great movie that keeps butts in the seats. That's why. -Mykal Bantan.

0399160477|5|When you read the book by the time you get to page 57 Putin has just done some of the things written in this book and by page 201 the reason given for his action is also the same and maybe things to come, I don't know if the Russian President is using this book as a playbook but the similarity is so close its not funny.<br />A good read and since this I written before what has happened in the Crimea today, The insight of the writers is spot on with the writing and research for this book also food for thought.
B0095ZQ36G|5|This is a wonderful story about integrity and the importance of staying true to yourself.  The relationship between the two opposing pilots is extraordinary.

B006WPSQVC|5|awesome and spirit filled movie a must see!!!!
B000002ADT|5|...<br />The merits of \\"Kind of Blue\\" have been hashed and rehashed, so I have but one thing to add: if you are a jazz novice, you are likely to play this CD and wonder what the fuss is about.  The modal structure is familiar to anyone with a background in Western culture, and the musicianship, although first-rate, isn't geared to impress, but to envelope.  (Davis, Coltrane, Adderley, Evans, Chambers, and Cobb -- what, they couldn't find Louis Armstrong?)  Consider, though, that you're hearing these incredible sounds from the perspective of over 40 years of history passed.  In 1959, \\"Kind of Blue\\" was a muted thunderbolt striking deep into the heart of what had become a stagnant art form.  The fact that \\"Kind of Blue\\" sounds like what most of us would now call \\"traditional acoustic jazz\\" is a testament to its importance.  And that it continues to captivate so many is a testament to its timelessness.  In other words, \\"Kind of Blue\\" is the rare masterpiece that represents a stark historical transition within a musical form, yet remains accessible and inspiring to new generations, including those who don't ordinarily listen to jazz.  This CD won't beat you over the head, but it is likely to worm its way into your subconsciousness in the most appealing way.
B00CL68QVQ|5|Excellent movie! I loved the way the character's emotional states were portrayed . Everything about this movie was wonderful ! A must see.
B003UY0ZFS|5|Love it!!!!
B00H2EQFBK|5|Love this show! Can't wait until I can watch the third season on Amazon Prime TV!
0783225733|5|Can watch this over and over again!!!  Tom Hanks just makes the rest of the cast better and they work so great together.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Awesome app
B00BF11STU|4|totally worth watching. just remember that its based on facts and isn't an action blockbuster that I guess some people thought it would be
B000E6UWE4|4|First off, let me say I am dismayed at certain reviewers biased ratings. True, Gardens of the Moon was originally released in 1999. IN THE UK!!!!! Erikson has released a new title faithfully every year. They have only recently begun to be released in the US. Tor will be releasing one novel every 6 months, to catch US readers up to speed by book 7. The first 3 novels have already been published in the US, with the 4th to be released in august 2006. To the nitwit who compares these novels to kiddy RPG games, read Memories of Ice or Deadhouse Gates, and tell me how many games have played out like that!! I have read all of Martin, Jordan, Goodkind, and others including Gemmell, and Bakker. Erikson is entirely unique in this genre, and that should be applauded, not shat upon!!! So if you find your imaginative skills lacking, I hear Jordans got a new book full of descriptive passages heralding brocaded silks and coloured tiles. In any case, this series only gets exponentially better as it progresses. If your not upto it , your not up to it. But every serious writer who has reviewed these novels has nothing but praises. So, beware of the haters.
B002BGFUPQ|5|Good movie.
B00INIYHJQ|5|so awesome it is scary  and funny i had so much fun reading it i have to say it is now one of my favorite books
B00APUQT7I|5|I loved all of the ice age movies, very good family entertainment  can be.All the characters are so funny and the storyline teaches children how important family
0316098337|5|I finished ROOM a couple of days ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. Without giving away plot details, it has made me rethink some of my ideas on child-rearing. I've also reflected at length on how unimportant \\"things\\" are when it comes to happiness. Not that these ideas are new, but Emma Donoghue has done an amazing job of underlining these themes with humor and sensitivity. Having 5-year old Jack serve as narrator was a stroke of genius. I LOVED this novel!!

B005CRQ3H0|5|Inherent Vice<br />Bob Gelms<br /> “The sign on his door read LSD Investigations, LSD, as he explained when people asked, which was not often, standing for Location, Surveillance, Detection. Beneath this was a rendering of a giant bloodshot eyeball in the psychedelic favorites green and magenta, the detailing of whose literally thousands of frenzied capillaries had been subcontracted out to a commune of speed freaks who had long since migrated up to Sonoma. Potential clients had been known to spend hours gazing at the ocular maze work, often forgetting what they’d come here for.”<br /> That’s how it starts. It’s 1969 and everybody has become intimately acquainted with Maui Wowie, Panama Red, Michoacán, Acapulco Gold, Boo, Black Bart, Ganja, Thai Stick, Reefer, Colombian, Weed, Sinsemilia, Jamaican, Mary Jane or just plain old Pot.  It’s a book, and the third in a series of unrelated novels about California, by America’s resident professor of American Studies, Thomas Pynchon. The book is called Inherent Vice and our intrepid Private Eye, Larry “Doc” Sportello, is personally familiar with all of them. He smokes so much weed it’s a wonder he doesn’t stumble through the whole book. Well, on second thought, he does stumble through the whole book but not before getting himself involved in a most outrageous and dangerous adventure. The eventual dead bodies attest to the danger.<br /> Doc is a Private Investigator and his ex old-lady wants him to find out what’s up with her current boy friend, the boyfriend’s wife and the wife’s boyfriend. After all it is California and that’s the entrance into a whole rainbow of colors, man, er, um, I mean, interconnected plot lines. Yeah, that’s it, interconnected plot lines.<br /> I haven’t had this much fun reading a novel since I read Kurt Vonnegut’s Cat’s Cradle.<br /> I bumped into this reading Rolling Stone Magazine, “Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood is becoming an essential component to any Paul Thomas Anderson film. After scoring the director's last two movies — There Will Be Blood and The Master — Greenwood has signed on to compose music for Anderson's upcoming film Inherent Vice, according to Film Music Reporter. The film is based on Thomas Pynchon's 2009 crime novel of the same name. Set in Los Angeles in the 1960s, the movie centers around a detective looking for a kidnapped girl. Joaquin Phoenix, star of Anderson's The Master, will reunite with the filmmaker in the main role of Larry &#34;Doc&#34; Sportello. Inherent Vice also stars Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Benecio del Toro and Maya Rudolph.”<br /> This would be the first real movie made from a Pynchon book. There was an attempt at filming Gravity’s Rainbow and an aborted attempt at filming The Crying of Lot 49. Apparently, the screenplay for Inherent Vice has Mr. Pynchon’s blessing.<br /> Trying to describe a Thomas Pynchon plot is like trying to pick up a ball of mercury. It squishes out and runs all over the place. Inherent Vice, as simple as I can make it, is about Doc Sportello investigating a missing person; possibly a kidnapping; possibly a murder. Just when you think you have that down it turns out someone else was kidnapped and someone murders the wrong person. The plot really doesn’t matter. What matters is the collision of all these characters in a plume of drug besotted humor. It’s a very funny book; particularly if you were part of the 60’s and can’t remember a whole lot of it because, well, because, you know. “‘What goes around may come around, but it never ends up exactly the same place, you ever notice? Like a record on a turntable, all it takes is one groove's difference and the universe can be on into a whole 'nother song.’”<br /> Now about the title, most, if not all, Mr. Pynchon’s titles are enigmatic. Until you run across them in the book because he usually explains them, sort of. The term inherent vice is found in a number of his other works but only once in Inherent Vice. “It was like finding the gateway to the past unguarded, unforbidden because it didn’t have to be. Built into the act of return finally was this glittering mosaic of doubt. Something like what Sauncho’s colleagues in marine insurance liked to call inherent vice.” It calls to mind one of Mr. Pynchon’s enduring motifs, that of entropy. Basically everything devolves into chaos, everything falls apart because of the nature of what IS falling apart. Here is an example, the inherent vice of paper is the acid in the paper which will eventually destroy it. Read the book you will see what I mean.<br /> Thomas Pynchon is a supremely gifted writer with a reputation for being a difficult read. His two latest books should not be counted among the difficult ones like Gravity’s Rainbow, Against the Day, or Mason & Dixon. Inherent Vice and Bleeding Edge are very approachable and the humor is right on the surface. They both come highly recommended, especially Inherent Vice.
B004YCKITI|5|A favorite of mind.
B002ZG98C8|4|Danny Trejo as a leading man? it works in this one, Trejo is \\"Machete\\". Desperado director Robert Rodriquez revives this film from a sample trailer on his \\"Planet Terror\\" dvd shown in the extras. The bottom line...this was intended and meant to be a cult film, blood, gore, nudity...lots of t & a, and loaded with non-stop action...how many cult films do you know of really received high ratings in cinema history...low percentage, the concept of Machete makes this film a winner, Rodriquez was never looking for an Academy award. There's also no denying a political statement throughout, this is the plot with an all-star cast, Robert De Niro, Steven Seagal, Jessica Alba, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson...Machete is a matter of taste, it's not for everyone. The dvd format is 16x9 widescreen, the extras include deleted scenes.
0142420891|5|What an amazing sequel!
B00ILHW6AG|4|Typically good book by King. Character development is always exceptionally well done.
B00076RT24|5|Great story, just the begging of the story, of one of the best story ever told in the movies, very classic, the best ever. And you can find it cheap, and fast deliver.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is really fun. If your looking for a game to pass the time this is the game it's very fun,challenging,and awesome
B001DXS4E2|5|Every home should own this DVD. Great movie, we watch it over and over again.
185984054X|5|Hitchens writes with clarity, and an eye for brevity.  This is a poignant look at the way that an image can overwhelm a society so much that it takes an author like Hitchens to point out what should have been obvious to everyone.  It takes Hitchens less than a hundred pages to point out the hypocritical stances, and the cruelty of the one know as Mother Teresa.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Excellent read!! This is one of best books I've read. It will be a classic.
B00FKF0F3C|4|Great story! My only critic would be that it jumped from one story to another too quickly, not giving you enough time to settle in to an area.
B002V9L5IE|5|I first heard Asif Avidan on you tube and immediately was drawn to his style of music.<br /><br />You can hear a little bit of everything as influence in his music.<br /><br />I was a little leary on ordering from Israel, as it did take over 3 weeks to get.  However, the package arrived safely and the seller was very professional.<br /><br />If you are looking for something a little different, but sounds very familiar, I would highly recommend this CD.  Highly enjoyable!
1451683405|4|A short book and quick read.  Covers the subject very clearly.  Probably will not change anyone's mind that believes in free will due to religious indoctrination or personal bias.
B008AK8FHM|5|Told in clear and very readable words, this is a fascinating story of a doctor's near death experience. Because it's told by a scientist, it is self validating. Highly recommended.
B000OVLBGC|5|I watched this movie tonight.  It was very powerful.  It had a tight script and was well acted.  It made me forget about my petty problems and think about what it means to be a good man.<br /><br />I have always like movies that had to do with a person trying to do the right thing risking a lot.  I also have always been interested in movies having to do with standing up for your ideals of what's right against communism, socialism, or Nazism.<br /><br />I am glad I saw this movie and that there are directors and actors willing to make movies that may not make tons of money but make people think.  As well as the director expressing ideas that they have convictions and probably experience with.<br /><br />Kevin
B000FC1MM8|5|always a fan no matter what great story
B009KS4XRO|4|Love!!!! Very entertaining.
B008578PRK|4|I liked the film. It had a twist ending, I was not expecting it. However, I still liked it, a true horror film.
B00EJXX17S|5|love it :-)
1476727651|5|Continued the first story perfectly.  One of King's best books in a few years.  A must read for anyone who's a fan of the Shining.
B0029QRA1U|1|My biggest frustration with this turntable is that the software doesn't always recognize track separation. It will record more than one track and treat it as one when it comes to labeling the titles.  You'll end up with a lot of manual re-recording and titling problems.  Seems like a good unit, but not reliable in consistent performance.
B00CE03UOC|4|It keeps me busy with my hands and brain with enough challenge to make interesting! There are enough different levels to keep different family members entertained.
B00J2VSS0C|4|Definitely enough variety to stay entertained, while enough consistency to practice and get better. Keeps me wanting to achieve the next award/prize.
B00QROH0QK|5|Surprisingly funny. Great special effects.
B00APUYWYA|5|If I could give this movie 20 stars I would.  Absolutely loved it.  Very funny, and I was so surprised by Anna Kendrick's singing talent.  Rebel is amazing.  Great movie.
1451695195|5|Many people have questioned Alexander's credibility to which I say, how can you critique a NDE? It's a great read and experience and only requires an open mind/heart.
B00A7W29BE|5|Seems to work good on my blackberry z30. And I got it free!!
B000CFLFX4|1|I agree with Sherrie, this is a waste of money , it bogs down on pile carpets,and the battery only lasts about 10 min. Go back to the shark.
1451668945|3|MHC has always loaded up her books with plenty of characters so I make a list of names right from the start so I can keep track.<br /><br />The book was disappointing, figuring out the bad guy was obvious from almost the introduction.  That works if you are watching \\"Columbo\\" but it's not the style for which Clark is famous.  Her books are usually full of red herrings and it's almost nail biting to the end \\"Who, who, who???\\"<br /><br />I have always enjoyed her style of writing, the switching perspective and uncovering the bad guy layer by layer.  That is here, what is missing is any true suspect other then the most obvious one.
B006M4F67A|5|Just mahjong.  Nothing fancy, just traditional fun.  Several different boards to give you variety and difficulty challenges with each different board.  Definitely recommend this game app. No problems.
B00KGEQYNW|2|needs to connected to play so you can't play on the bus or so may other places!
B005URRCUY|4|I got this album for Christmas, and I've had it in my car's CD player spinning off and on when I need something other than talk radio.<br />I've enjoyed it, the songs are catchy with a bit of a southern vibe, and I find myself singing along with them.  I don't know if the comparison is a great one, but this album takes me back thinking of [[ASIN:B000VZIOCK Songs For The Deaf [Explicit]]].<br /><br />The only problem is that to me, the songs on this album are not different enough that there is a lone stand-out. I'm not sure if that's good or bad.  You can play it straight through and jam, but I can't even think of one off of the top of my head that I would put on to showcase the band to someone who hadn't heard of them yet.  However, just writing of them right now makes me want to go get the CD, so I'd say have a go at the Black Keys.
B008AIGWVA|3|limited actions and little playing, lots of ads for buying the toys<br />the cat is also OK but ads are there too.
B001UV4XFG|5|This DVD arrived on time, I have had no problems with it at all. Love the movie! Actually, I love the entire saga! Read the books though, you will thank me.
B00B2JSRAS|4|It Reminded me to be positive and ask the universe for guidance, which I hadn't done for a long time.
B0013ND30M|5|What can I say, but my 2-year old LOVES Disney princesses, and with most of these movies hiding in the Disney vault, it was nice to find one I could still get.  She has watched this any number of times and loves to watch &#34;Rory&#34; sing and dance.  Great movie, good price, and glad to finally get a copy to share with my little girl.
0393327345|4|I don't recommend reading this while eating or right before bedtime. Better than the movie, and I didn't expect that. Really skillfully done.
B0054JZC6E|3|games are hard inside of the one game. they can be very tricky and take me a very long time to complete.
0060934913|5|Are you socially incorrigible, substance-dependent, able to curse fluently in multiple Spanish dialects, have a high tolerance for knife wounds, burns, cramped spaces, no sleep, and people looking to stab you in the back at every turn? Well, if you are, and you're not interested in a career in piracy in Latin America, you might want to try being a fancy chef.<br />Anthony Bourdain's \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is a salty, rambling, rambunctious love letter to the world of a professional chef and to the insane people who inhabit it, interspersed with some advice to the general public (such as why you should never order your steak well-done or a fish frittata, and how many knives you REALLY need to make all those hoity-toity dishes you see on TV). Bourdain gleefully jumps from describing his falling in love with french cuisine as a boy, to his experience as a junior \\"know-nothing\\" in Cape Cod, to what a typical day at Les Halles is, to a full-blown food and alcohol orgy in Japan, all at a pace that will leave you gasping for breath.<br />Not necessarily for the faint-hearted, but if you want to know what life is like behind your fancy dishes, this is a must-read.
B001K3K5MO|2|My girlfriend and I watched this together on a whim.  We were disappointed, really.  What we remember as a fun action movie just comes across today as a date movie for frat boys.  The acting isn't all that great, and the writing is at times atrocious and at other times very bland and uninspired.  Sorry, but this movie just isn't that great.
B008P76VP8|5|Outstanding performances by all participants.  Outstanding direction, photography, choreography. Great Blu ray picture and sound.  Can't say enough good things.  Purchase and enjoy!
B00139B39E|4|I like everything combined, but most the good tunes on it were off Octavarium.  One CD seemed like ballads and other one rocked.
B00IZ4YK9U|3|First let me say that this is a really good album. If this group were not a super group I would be more impressed.  I really feel that less Max would be good.
B00JJH254O|5|Awesome
B00QW8TYWO|4|I love this game so much! It crashed once but now Its back to normal and the best game ever!
B00O9SA6I0|5|Noel seems well able to pull another set of compositions that are well worthy a listen. Any album, that has five solid tracks worth listening to is worth the effort in my opinion. It is pop but not bad. Great effort here.
B00KNOXB7M|3|Where's the Blu-ray pre-order?  I hate digital/streaming copies.  Another example of the greed model.  More for less.  Blu-Ray is better.
0553579908|5|This review was first published at M's Bookshelf - http://mssbookshelf.blogspot.com<br /><br />Ah, what a brilliant series this is! I loved, LOVED reading A Clash Of Kings. In the first book of the series, A Game Of Thrones, a variety of characters is being introduced from all over Westeros and the Free Cities - each of them wonderful, amazing and mysterious in their own way. If you thought George R.R. Martin made a lot happen in that one book, be prepared for this one.<br />The amount of conspiracies, battles and secrets is incredible; the amount of detail staggering.<br />The characters all take the next step in the journey that was laid out for them in A Game Of Thrones - all of those journeys are proving to be full of danger and unexpected twists and turns, friends and foes. Even if you've watched the tv-series already, this book won't cease to amaze and surprise you.<br />I can barely stop myself from starting the next book in the series right away, but since I can't bear the thought of having to wait months before a new book comes out, I promised myself to read slowly, and to fully enjoy these incredible books.
B00006FDCD|5|I read the book, Just like the book, Please order!
B007GCY8FS|4|good fast reading if you like Jack Reacher and I do  read most of hthe series.
B0015DROBO|5|This book took me for a great ride. I love the style of Larsson as he guides me through all aspects of the plot and from different perspectives. Allows me to be outside of myself and fully engrossed during the read
B00A85EMVK|4|This is one of the best military fighter aircraft movies ever made.  Tom Cruize is perfect in the role he plays.  BluRay and 3D improve and already great movie.  If you like this type movie, then you'll enjoy this one.
B000AJIF4E|5|Excelente
0307271862|2|Short and sweet.  I have read all the mysteries and think that the translation is superb.  This book was a huge disappointment.  After a quick and interesting start, it bogged down into a long, detailed, and unplausible African venture.  We know that Mankell lives in Africa most of the time.  In my view, this is a book that he uses to write a long essay on Chinese influence in Africa.  Don't buy.  MM
B00005NTNU|5|A dvd collection to watch over and over. It's been proven that noone will match Clint as &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. The other cop heroes will use his style and humor, but they fall short in the &quot;originality&quot; category. Buy it..watch it!!
B008PNBU30|4|Given as a request for brother who wanted this music. Cd was shipped very quickly and properly packaged.My brother is enjoying his gift a lot!
B000BGH22W|1|Williams' scores had magic and grace... this is awful. In fact, it's rather a bit of a joke... it has none of the magic or flair that the first 3 soundtracks had. The movies may be getting better, but the soundtrack is one of my first complaints about this movie.  HOPEFULLY for OOP they will return to the WIlliams' magical score. I'm a collector of Potter merchandise-- I have absolutely everything Potter, even the bedsheets, to tell you how obsessed I am. BUT this I will not buy.  Don't waste your money. You couldn't give it to me.
B00ES278CE|3|I like Phillipa Gregory and she's a marvelous writer or both fiction and non-fiction. I read &#34;The White Queen&#34; first, fully enjoyed it; then I picked up the &#34;Kingmaker's Daughter&#34; as I was trying to keep some continuity in the three books.<br /><br />I am **NO** writer myself, but my head knows proper grammar when I read it; I wish my fingers did. Madame Gregory seemed to fall short of her usual style and out of the &#34;proper&#34; language for the Book and into today's speech.<br />I found at least 12 iffy sentences between the beginning of the Story and page 35. That's a bit much, even for me; and I'm willing to overlook quite a few items. It makes me wonder what else I'm going to find later on.<br /><br />I AM enjoying the books, even though I have read the &#34;White Princess&#34; far beyond it's context in the series and found it to be as dry as a badly cooked turkey. The earlier books are much better, however I'm surprised at Madame Phillipa's lack of wording.<br /><br />If I could find the books either at a yard sale or at a Half-Priced Books I would buy the Series. I'm just perturbed about a wonderful Lay's choice of grammar.
B007IXWKUK|5|Excellent read, put a better insite to volume one. Kept me on edge. Good love story! Must continue on to Vol 3.
B000OVLBFS|4|great
B00005R2M3|4|Shakira was right to call this \\"Laundry Service\\". Hearing the opening number \\"Objection\\" always makes me feel like I just bought this CD yesterday. This my first and only Shakira CD with English and it is refreshing to  hear it every time. She has her fair share of hits on here that I can surely hear over and over, like \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and \\"Eyes Like Yours\\". This is a pretty unusual crossover CD, containing both English and her native Spanish. Clearly, she finds it easier in her own language, evident in songs like \\"Suerte\\" and \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\". Her English is a bit choppy, but people won't buy music from a Spanish singer to bask in their English. Her voice makes it difficult to listen sometimes, as in \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" and \\"The One\\", and I feel that \\"Fool\\" and \\"Poem to a Horse\\" are positioned well yet often overlooked as many Shakira fans are lured to more her scantily clad dance videos than rocking songs about how her \\"heart is sore\\". As for me, I hope that the clothes in this cycle never dry out!
B00AFROVQC|4|I quite liked this book, looking forward to the next one.
B0002Z0EYK|2|Even my kids thought this movie looked \\"old\\" and corny, sort of \\"Demetrius and The Gladiators.\\"   <br /> <br />Yes, the citizens of Troy were called Trojans but the fact is in our culture, Trojans has another connotation and you'd think the director of this film would be out the look out for hysterical lines.  Brad Pitt:  \\"Trojans never hurt ME!\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Where's Helen?\\" <br />\\"She just left with the Trojans.\\" <br /> <br />Omigod we were rolling on the floor laughing. <br /> <br />Orlando Bloom, such a handsome face, manages to look petite and girly-man in outfits that look like they came from a Bliss catalog. <br /> <br />Everyone wore blue and white and it all had fringe on it.  Come on already.  EVERYONE wore fringe? <br /> <br />I've never seen such bad costumes.  And such cornball delivery.   <br /> <br />Julie Christy, Peter O'Toole, they did well, you appreciate how difficult acting truly is when you see their performances against bland bland bland Brad Pitt and the girl who played Helen. <br /> <br />Orland Bloom's performance was good, but not enough to prop up such a huge cornball job like this. <br /> <br />Stick with Peter Jackson, Orlando.  As Legolas you looked taller, better built, and much more masculine. <br /> <br />I appreciate how hard making a movie really must be after watching this laugh-riot.
B00785P2QC|5|This game is awesome,  it is my favorite game I play it every dag and I think you should get it too.
B001NB6IN8|5|It is a rarity that I like an album after one listen, but this one captured me and I have been playing it for weeks now. There is not a single song that I dislike on it.
0307010856|5|I love my book. It reminds me of my childhood. The book came in new condition. I think it was worth the money.
B006TF6WAM|5|I loved this book.  It has one of the best opening first page I've read in a long while. From there i was hooked.<br /><br />It is a wise story, holding the tension of the journey so that you are compelled to read and you can't guess the outcome.<br /><br />I loved Harold.  He just did the best he could.<br /><br />A very touching and human story we can relate to in our own experience.
0634022296|5|A friend turned me on to this book and I've been working with it for some time.  I think it's good for beginners and intermediate players.  The songs are generally in the key of the way they were played on the albums, but some songs may be played easier/better in a different key with a capo.  This purchase was the second time I bought this book for the express reason to bring it to Staples to have the binding cut off and a spiral binding put on so the book can lay flat.  Believe me, it is worth it to spend the extra $10 or so to have this done.
B003YL4LYI|1|The more I made my way through this book, the more disheartened I felt.  While GRRM's world has always gritty, this book tips over into glorifying ugliness.  Seemingly every new character has \\"broken teeth\\" and/or \\"yellow skin\\" and/or boils. Horrific things happen to Brienne that made me want to cry. Other main characters have lost their way and no longer act like the people we knew in previous books.<br /><br />The real world is made up of both good and bad.  Since this is a 12-book series, I am sure that eventually our characters will get redemption arcs.  But at this point, I don't think I'll be sticking around enough to read it.
B005GFPZYK|4|Chris Kyle does not think he is superman. He knew that he just tried harder than others. He was a true hero and put his country above all. I was going to read the book even before he died. He excelled at helping other soldiers during war and after. During his deployments, he saved many soldiers and just felt it was duty.
B000ICZD5M|3|I love the film.  The problem was the audio, always trailing the actual speech of the actors.  This was not due to internet connection problems or computer problems.  The problem was inherent to the streaming itself.
B009T8XBBO|5|Highly recommended.  I've only been playing a couple of days, but it's fun and additive already.  Kids will have a good time playing.
B00FVVR2ZO|5|I have enjoyed playing all night
B001DJ7PQ4|5|I've never seen \\"Doctor Who\\" before.  Based on a recommendation by a friend, we bought this DVD set.  Absolute fun to watch. It's a family event, perfect for all ages. Interesting plot, wonderful actors.  Love David Tennant.  A definite thumbs-up if you're a science fiction fan. After finishing this set, we got the first, second and third series too.
B001AQO400|5|Excellent movie, blu-ray was delivered quickly. It was a birthday present for my daughter. She was very happy to receive it as she had lost her other copy.
B009ZQJ1G4|5|christian bale is awesome!  story is engaging.  acting is great.  bale is hot.  and the puppy is adorable.  love it!
0307593525|5|This set was purchased as a gift and she loved it!  Has NOT cooked anything from it yet though!
B000LXH0AE|5|I couldn't be more satisfied with the price and quality of the used DVD I had purchased .
B00FKF0F3C|5|Excellent
B009JZWYKQ|5|Great movie, top notch cast, well written. Pulls you in right from the start. One of Tarantino's better efforts. Clooney plays a great straight man!
B00CBRAD2A|3|little to much violence then I expected
B000FC1AGG|5|I could not put this down and stayed up until 1:30 in the morning, knowing I had to get up early for work in a couple of short hours. I have enjoyed all of Kinsellas books, they make me laugh & cry within moments of each other. A good read!!
B00J4HO3OO|5|Perfect for my young grandchildren.
B004DLPXAO|5|Works like a charm! no complaints at all. I love the way it syncs so if I go to another device, I'm right where I left off.<br /><br />Droid Incredible rooted 2.3
0061900656|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B0000TB03W|5|Shania's DVD Up Live in Chicago is the best work I have seen by her yet. The only knock if there is one is that she could get a little better at dancing. She packs the DVD full of her music that is fun serious loving and full of great talent. Shania has out sold all the female country singers and most of the male sings. She sings the songs she wants and gives the fans her best.
B00DJFIMW6|5|its so fun when you hit the jumpy things and fly<br />and it is not a rip off like the other games
B001FSDOZO|5|My husband loved this cd. It is among his favorites. It has many of their hit songs. It's a good purchase
B00005ASQ1|4|An above average film about a gifted young man from the Bronx who draws inspiration from a reclusive author.<br />There are several elements which could have been overdone in this film: prejudice, class differences, breaking out from poverty, isolation.  But the film is really about the friendship which develops between Jamal and Forrester, and how it changes both of their lives.  Had the film tried to develop everything else, it would have lost this principal focus, and much of its impact.<br />Sean Connery does a masterful job, as always, and Rob Brown as Jamal is a natural.  Anna Paquin is charming, as is the chemistry between her character and Jamal.<br />A bit less sentimental than &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; if you liked that film, you will like this one.  If you don't like films that don't have a lot of action, avoid this film.  I have always said that character development makes or breaks a film, and this film develops its characters superbly.<br />The music, though different than you might expect from a typical Hollywood production, is excellent and fits the movie well.  Smoky jazz/blues, moody in some places, playful in others.  I especially liked the jazz guitar rendition of &quot;Somewhere, Over the Rainbow.&quot;<br />A final note:  If you have a DVD player, you might want to try the DVD edition.  The camera work is VERY tight, and my wife and I both felt that a lot of the scenes were being cut off by the &quot;pan and scan.&quot; We found this distracting, so we feel that this movie is probably best viewed &quot;widescreen.&quot;
B007TNS6JI|5|the only thing is. It takes long to build up gold should get more for level completion. other then that great game 5 stars really!
B006MQRLSA|5|Good movie.
B00DMK6WN4|5|We love this movie and watch it over and over.  So nice to save money at Amazon.
B004U7JYXS|5|Great camera and film- be sure NOT to put through x-ray at airport
B00HBQWGXK|2|I am sorry to have to write this review. I am a big fan of Mr. Child and his main character Jack Reacher but this book read like it was written by someone else. It was too contrived and unrealistic without any of the charm that he wove into Reacher. I had to give it two stars because I did not want to believe that I would purchase a book that was one star.
1451639155|5|Book number 15 of a 16+ loosely linked series of books with several other short story books.  Note, this book was published after _Cryburn_ but is about five years before _Cryoburn_.  Also note that this book was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award but<br />sadly lost to Scalzi's _Redshirts_ novel (which I have yet to read).<br /><br />I have really missed the Vorkosigan saga which peaked for me in _A Civil Campaign_.  _Cryoburn_, while very good, is not a great story.  Well, I've got a new story for you here about Ivan and I am finding it to be the second best book in the series.<br /><br />When I first heard about this book, I went, &#34;a book about Ivan?&#34;.  Yes, the book is firmly about Ivan and Ms. Bujold nailed it.  It has just the right amount of space opera, romance, intrigue, back stabbing, snarkiness and just all around things that make you stay up until 3 am just reading a &#34;few&#34; more chapters.<br /><br />BTW, I wanted to rate this book 6 out of 5 stars but Amazon would not let me.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is amazing. You can buy cool gadgets, without using real money. It's like temple run. You jump above obstacles, fly on a hover board, fly in a jetpack, and much more. And what's cooler? It's appropriate for children of all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5|Everyone in my family loves this game! My 7 yr old saved up his coins to buy the ninja. My 4 year old can make it very far and gets so excited when she gets a prize box. I like that the game changes so you are not running the exact same subway every time.
B009HEJXFS|3|Definitely better than the second movie, but not as good as the first.  Quality was OK streaming, no interruptions at all.
0788805843|2|Cute but unlikely tale of a child born of a god and mortal woman. Although he performed many heroic feats in life, his greatest miracle was choosing to sacrifice himself in death, thus winning resurrection as a god.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Viel Spa&szlig; mit Leuten von der ganzen Welt
B00555X8OA|5|Excellent research, clearly written even for a layman to enjoy. A real must read for those who are interested in understanding human nature and the art of clear communication.
B00C7DGRL4|5|The movie was very good! Finally a new take on the ever so boring action movies, I loved it! the action was great and the actors are at their bests in this film. Gemma Arterton looks amazing in this movie. Over all great movie.
B0086700CM|5|FINLEY!!!! I've been waiting for this app since christmas when i got my KF!!!! LUV IT!!!!!!!:):):) u should get it!!!!
B00742GBDM|5|Captivating, intriguing, good plot.
B00HEPDGKA|4|Great!
B0071T3Q9K|4|These are great songs from &#34;before my era&#34; but when in the right mood, are great listening. Paul's smooth voice covers them well.
B002WY65VU|4|Item was as described
B0071XO8RA|5|I thought a slow start, but I kept reading.<br />The last half of book was incredibly wild!!!  Breathe-taking!!!!  Very full of suspense.  And it transported me to the scene.  I swear my surroundings would quiet when Jules was all alone.<br />Really good book!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I just hate that you have to wait 30 minutes to get more lives.  Why? Why?
B003PHEIIU|5|Mesmerizing from beginning to end; fantastic performances by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend; a new favorite!
B00009V8Z9|5|I bought Chariot a year ago, only knowing two songs; I Don't Wanna Be and Follow Through. I didn't know what to expect from the album, but after only listening to it once, I was already falling in love with the album. 11 beautifully written songs, sung by a sexy, raspy and beautiful voice, it soon became my favourite album and I am still listening to it regularly.. The songs are all meaningful, soulful and you can really feel the emotion behind his lyrics. (Don't listen to people who call the lyrics lame!)  <br />It's very hard to pick a favourite song from the album as all the songs are beautiful. Overall, Gavin DeGRAW is a sensational singer/songwriter/musician and anyone thinking of buying the album, I recommend you to buy it because you won't regret it!!!!!! <br />
B009AMAGQM|5|Packed great . made great gift
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love this game I could go on about this forever
B00JZK0QNM|5|I didn't think I'd like the game st first but now I play to much lol.
B00127RAJY|5|Jillian knows what she is doing!  This is the second time doing the 30 day shred!  After my first pregnancy I did it and lost 20 + lbs.  I just had my second child and have started the 30 day shred.  I am on day 11.  I only weigh myself once a week. The first week I lost 4 lbs and 3 in off my waist.  It keeps you challenged. If you get bored with doing the same workout then switch it up.  You can skip around the different levels so you don't get bored and still get an awesome workout!
B0063IH60K|5|I love this app! Can't put it down. I put music on in the background and I could play for hours!
B006OCM0G0|4|This game is fun to play and easy too. The only problem is that sometimes It takes at least 5 minutes to load. Hopefully this problem will be fixed
B005HJWWW8|5|I was skeptical at first, but this will really make a world of difference with your headphones, even cheap ones. I always assumed my $25 JVC HA-S200's were mediocre, until I tried them with these. Now, they're my go-to gym headphones. The bass deep is full of body, I'd even go so far as to say the bass sounded better than my more expensive AKGs. It's definitely recommended for headphones with high impedance. I've owned it for a month and a half and have no complaints so far.

B000002GWJ|5|. . . except by his fans.  &quot;Whistlin' Past the Graveyard&quot; has long been a favorite, as well as &quot;Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis&quot; which, for this reviewer,  hits too close to home.   &quot;Somewhere&quot; has a special majesty to it, and &quot;29.00&quot;  and &quot;Sweet Little Bullet From a Pretty Blue Gun&quot; are like tiny  little hard-boiled motion pictures, perfectly realized.  &quot;Kentucky  Avenue&quot; should please most of his sentimental fans.  All-in-all, a  complete package of Waits' inadversarial 1970s musical style.  A fair  representation of his career . . . very smoothly flowing.
B00136RZUI|5|i had originally bought this album years ago when it was first released in 2006 and enjoyed it for maybe a year or so until i either misplaced it or someone took it and i had not heard it since. i remember it being a quality floyd album with a few stand out classic tracks. i finally decided it was time to repurchase it and enjoy it again and boy was i not disappointed! it is better than i remember and is of such a high musical quality i can not recommend it enough to any music lover. most of the tracks are beautiful with gorgeous guitar play, fantastic supporting instruments, catchy lyrics, and still very nice vocals from dave himself even at his ripe old age his throat is still coated in honey. a floyd fan could not ask for a better post floyd album. it stands right up there with roger waters solo classics the pros and cons of hitchhiking and amused to death, both of which i would also highly recommend. on an island is a step above though and is perfect hybrid blend of classic floyd brought into the sound of modern music and production. dont miss this album!
B00004XMV6|5|This is one of my favorite films of all time. Kim Basinger is poignant and astounding. Her wounded eyes that belie the sexual obsession is such an affective contrast.Her performance is impeccable.<br />The plot is disturbing and yet common. I was turned on, infuriated, and -worst of all- familiar with the subject matter. Notice the subtle things that change as Elizabeth falls deeper into this sadistic union. (the darkening clothing and make-up for instance)<br />This nothing short of an American classic and one of the only films I want to own.<br />I also recommend the novel of the same name!!!!
B000BJS4OY|5|Growing up in the 80's, I would constantly hear about how fantastic the \\"Boss\\" was, especially live.  I simply didn't get it.  That guy belching out \\"Born in the USA\\" with a raised fist or flexing his muscles while doing a Belinda Carslile-esque dance with a planted model just didn't seem that cool.  Even when classic rock radio revitalized some of his better, older material, it always sounded simply \\"good\\" to me, but not amazing.<br /><br />The other day I happened to catch the PBS broadcast of the Hammerismith Odeon show from 75.  I was absolutely blown away.  This band was so raw, so tight, so passionate.  Here, Bruce is not the bloated weight-lifter guy I remembered, but this scruffy, funky, wiry dude with a knit stocking cap.  His band is similarly young and hungry.  Even Little Steven, who later morphed into a caricature of himself with all the gypsy trappings, is completely cool and understated.  Well, he's got a pink pimp suit on, so maybe that's not understated, but he looks hip.<br /><br />Now I know why Bruce made the cover of Time in 74 or 75, why people traded his tapes a la the Dead, and why he had such a rabid following.  Anyone who saw this band live would have been a life-long convert.  Man, I wish I had been born earlier!<br /><br />I immediately bought the new box set containing the full show, and was not disappointed.  If you're just a casual Bruce fan, but a fan of music, this is sure to amaze and delight you.<br /><br />Perhaps the neatest moment is when they break into a vamp from \\"Shaft,\\" (I'm pretty sure it's Shaft, anyway) in the middle of, I think, Rosalita.<br /><br />If there is any more footage of Bruce pre-1980, let's hope it gets released!
B00F8F3J2S|3|This is a book I hope everyone reads.  That is not because it is brilliantly written but because it is very important history.  Mr. Gates wrote early after leaving a very difficult job.  His self assessment in the book is defensive.  With time I expect he will gain perspective.<br />I am not critical of him or how he did his job.  And that is really secondary to the importance of the book.  One needs to read between the lines a bit, but his insights into how things worked, or didn't, especially how things worked at the White House under two Presidents is very helpful to us who have no contact with that other than the careful media picture we are presented.  Frankly, it is troubling.
1582701709|5|Life changing! I was skeptical at first so I tried to attract small things like the book suggested. It worked right away. It has worked for everything I've tried. Last year we tried to sell our house for nine months. Nothing. So we took it off the market. After reading this book we decided to try to sell it again and it sold in one week. Thank you Rhonda Byrne for spilling the beans and not being able to keep \\"The Secret\\".

I think this album is worth more than the price you have offered on amazon.  Excellent job done by Susan Boyle.  I am very happy for her.  She never gave up her dream of becoming a singer despite of her learning disabilities.  What an inspiring story.

0439023491|3|(Minor spoilers ahead...)<br />This isn't the extraordinary tale I'd thought it would be, from all the hubbub surrounding this series right now.  Catching Fire is little more than a filler between the first and third books, though it does have its page-turning moments.  Unfortunately, the entire book, up to the last several pages, seems to be leading up to something big; sadly, this big reveal is hastily dumped out as a quick summary with hardly any dialogue on one of the final pages, and we're left with little more than a (spoiler) Empire Strikes Back ending that only sets things up for the third book in the trilogy.  While several new characters (each with a great deal of potential) are introduced in Catching Fire, their development is nearly nonexistent; throughout the entire book, I was waiting for each to meet their own arbitrary end, as has happened with so many other of these blank faces thus far.  I can only hope this character development occurs for those who survived into the third book.<br /><br />Make no mistake--this is an enjoyable read to pass the time, but the plot is tired (apocalyptic near future, corrupt government, oppression leading to revolution).  The characters have the potential to set this tale apart, but unfortunately, Collins just doesn't seem to care enough about them to let us know more than Katniss' own brief mental musings, so it's difficult to care about anyone other than Katniss and Peeta.  Though the ending leaves us with a tiny bit of hope, I'm not holding my breath for any beloved characters to walk out of this trilogy alive, because Collins finds it much too easy to dispose of her characters in a sudden and brutal way, while rarely giving them weight enough for the reader to care.  Yes, this trilogy seems to be the story of Katniss and Peeta, but for all of two books so far, we've been continually prepped for their deaths, only for it to be seemingly postponed a little longer.  In a world where death has reigned for nearly all of the last two books, the characters have been a little too resigned and eager to participate in the Games while their backstories have been kept from us, and the revolution has taken place out of our view (as far as we know?), I'm not sure Collins will have enough time in the third book to add the emotional weight this story needs to provide a satisfying conclusion and stick with me.  If, rather than the story of the revolution of Panem, this is simply the more intimate tale of Katniss and Peeta as it has seemed to be, the second half of Catching Fire is little more than a repeat of the first book, with a few extra blank faces, and all that was done to advance their story and situation was done off-camera and communicated to the reader almost as an aside at the end.  Overall, this was a page turner, but I was a bit disappointed once the pages ran out.f the last two books, the characters have been a little too resigned and eager to participate in the Games while their backstories have been kept from us, and the revolution has taken place out of our view (as far as we know?), I'm not sure Collins will have enough time in the third book to add the emotional weight this story needs to provide a satisfying conclusion and stick with me.

B00004TH7Z|5|From all of Iron Maidens records, this is probably the one I play most. The reason? Spinesending, shivering music that breaks your bones and glues them together again with Dickinsons voice.<br />It was an amazing comeback. One could not want anything else, and even though it was hard to believe, this record put every other comeback albums to shame. This is what they should sound like, melodic hard rockers, with a love for the music they write and play.<BR>It starts of with The Wicker Man, a fast rocker with a glorious chanting ending, that will make you nod your head and probably give you whiplash. It goes over to Ghost of the Navigator and Brave New World, something that sounds like a crossover between Virtua XIII and Seventh son songs, and those two songs are just two of the albums major highlights. Then we move on to Blood Brothers, a song that irritated me a bit the first times..but after listening to it on Rock in Rio, I started to like it more and more. Now I have to hear it. The STAR of the CD however, is the grandiose, wonderful, lunatic/nervous song called Dream of Mirrors. I will go so far and call this one of Maidens top 5 songs ever. It is over 9 minutes long, and on par scale with the Ancient Marineer, if not better. It starts off with this dark brooding feeling, and explodes into a superb chorus, a fantastic solo and drums that will make you wanna be a drummer. It shows Iron Maiden from a side we havent seen in over 15 years, it shows Iron Maiden as the best Heavy band out there.<br />Coming to an end, The cd takes a more relaxed style with &quot;The Thin line between love and hate&quot;, a moody song that leaves us only wanting for more.<br />To sum it up, Brave new world is one of the best heavy records since the new Century, it`s far better than Virtua and X Factor, it`s Maiden back to what we love them as, hard hitting, melodious rockers with a lust for music and a will to keep Heavy Metal Alive. And in the end, Iron Maiden is maybe the only one who can do it, and they prooved it with Brave new World. H&quot;ED&quot;S UP!

0525425578|2|If you thinking about reading this book, then borrow it from someone.  Do Not Buy This Book!  The best description i can give is that this book is all bones.  There is no meat.  john Grisham has to be embarrassed.  He has written some great books.  This is not one of them.  I read this book - all the words - in one hour.  The story is very thin and if Grisham had wanted, he could have created a great character and an intriguing story.  But he is lazy, now.  Reminds me of Tom Clancy, who, for years now, can not be bothered to produce a good book and has allowed someone else to do the research and writing for him.  Not  the same and certainly not the quality. I recommend that you take a pass on Theodore Boone.

B009EELBIS|5|Despite wanting to be on the lighting crew, I was hand picked to play Captain von Trapp in our fifth grade production of the Sound of Music.  For that reason plus the fact that I got to kiss a sixth-grade Maria(!), I have no choice but to proclaim this as the best movie ever made.<br /><br />All prejudice aside, this is indeed one of the best films of all time, not only for its superb acting and immortal music, but also for its top-notch cinematography and set and production design.  Even my ten year old son, who is prone to dismiss anything outside the Star Wars genre as &#34;stinkin' people movies&#34; sat through and enjoyed the story of the van Trapp family and has been singing the songs ever since.<br /><br />I emphatically agree with other reviewers and cannot emphasize this enough:  BUY THE HD VERSION.  Not that I'm an expert in this area, but this is one of the best transfers to digital I've seen and is well worth the extra money.

0743201140|3|The strengths survey was interesting but didn't really tell me anything about myself that I didn't already know.  Most of us know ourselves well enough to figure out what our strengths are.  I suggest sitting down with a good glass of wine and give this some thought rather than wasting a little money and a bit more time sitting through this book.<br />Bottom line, I wouldn't bother wasting your time with this book.  The basic premise is sound, focus on your strengths.  The book basically spends page after page rehashing this theme but not much more.<br />So, think about your strengths.  Are you compassionate, a competitor, a thinker, empathetic, etc.? Look for work that will utilize these strengths.  Live a happier and more productive life.<br />There you have it.

630575067X|4|I like it. It's simply a piece of the puzzle that in the long run will likely fit in perfectly with the 9(?)-part series. I think it looks foreign to many people because the usual cast wasn't (of course) involved. But I  think it's a nice piece of cinema with great effects and good acting. Let's  hope, though, that II &amp; III will shine as much as IV-VI.

B007SGLZP8|5|Took me awhile to read this book, but glad I did. Mr. Grisham's books never fail to entertain, this one is no exception. Enjoyed the various twists to the plot and the narrative by the book's main character, Malcolm Bannister. Recommended.
0393038912|4|I love this sort of book, and it is relatively well written. See the other comments for what's good . . . here's what could be improved.<br /><br />State the conclusion early on. We have an idea where the author is headed, so there's no need to try to pull us into the book to see what the mystery is all about. Just state simply and succinctly what the conclusion is and a brief list of the primary supporting data. Then let us judge whether the book supports these.<br /><br />Don't be so repetitive -- especially toward the last five chapters.<br /><br />Don't gloss over inconsistent data that is not supportive of the theory. For instance, it isn't enough to simply write off the Alps and Carpathian Mtns as insignificant obstacles to the migration of animals, foods and ideas. At least tell us why (easily navigated passes, alternate routes, etc.)<br /><br />Finally, raise and answer (or dispose of) the obvious questions that follow upon your premise: e.g., did the geographic differences and diversity of flora and fauna effect the evolution of the peoples as well as their history?<br /><br />All of the above said, I do recommend the book

1878424319|5|This book s interesting but enlightening:<br />1. Be impeccable with your words 2. Don't take things personally 3.  Don't make assumptions 4.  Always do your best<br />Sounds simple huh? Not so quick!  Rooted in Toltec beliefs, Miguel Ruiz has done us all a great favor to explain and illustrate the above four agreements.  This book serves as a practical guide to how we live daily.  Language:  Words, assumptions, thoughts, pre-occupation can always lead to misunderstanding and a break of relationship.  Miguel Ruiz goes step-by-step, with practicals and examples, to help us achieve these four agreements.  Say what you really mean to say.  Don't circumvent or evade.  Don't make assumptions because assumptions always lead to misunderstanding.  Ruiz has so much to offer in this brillantly written book.  Highly recommended.
B005LAII3A|2|Was really looking forward to this flick, explaining why I'm so disappointed. Had placed too much hope in the film, the letdown ended up far greater had I just gone in without any expectations.<br /><br />What truly bothered me was this wasn't a reboot or fresh interpretation of [[ASIN:0806512091 the source Philip K. Dick short story]]. Ultimately, it was a straight forward duped copy of the [[ASIN:B00070FX5U 1990 movie]]. For a solid sixty-to-seventy percent of the flick, it was a virtual scene-by-scene total rip of the original. They didn't even change the script. Oh, they altered the 'Free Mars' aspect and turned it inward, sure. And the dense CGI cityscapes were very impressive. But making a xerox copy isn't creating art or even entertainment. (Before anyone says it, which would you rather have - the copy or the real thing? I know which I'd choose)<br /><br />More so given that I thought Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel skillfully executed their roles, providing excellent performances to the production. And, as it happens, I like both actors. But even their energetic and sincere efforts couldn't, and wouldn't, salvage this inferior imitation. There just wasn't enough meat on the bone; not enough for the audience to feel empathy toward or engage as their characters. And most disappointingly, the one aspect I expected to play a huge aspect in the film - Rekall's false memories - didn't play a significant part in the plot at all. Wow.<br /><br />Sadly, this production is utterly soulless, lacking even the dark comedic touches of the original. I don't think I laughed once during the entire film. Where was the brassy repartee? The twisted joys of Venusville? The snarky one-liners? If they were going to do a rip-off, why neuter the better parts?<br /><br />It seemed everyone took themselves, especially the director, so seriously.<br /><br />Reboots are best when filmmakers are inspired by the original, revitalizing the old school with a new school vibe.

B000002C1W|5|This album is basiclly the first Floyd album without Roger Waters. It turned out alot better that most people expected. It has a good set of songs that were written by Gilmour, Mason, and Wright. The best songs are 'Signs of Life','Learning to Fly','One Slip','On The Turning Away', and 'Sorrow'. I would recomend this album to any Floyd fan who dose not have Momentary Lapse Of Reason. Buy It As Soon As Possible!
B001EAWMGA|4|The first I ever heard of Outlander was in an ad page in last month's Fangoria.  It looked and sounded like typical straight to video B movie fair.  This is sometimes a very good and fun thing, and other times absolutely dreadful.  From sifting through some other Amazon reviews regarding this film I found that it had a very, VERY,  limited theatrical run and apparently was bashed by critics.  Well, I still haven't read any 'professional' reviews for Outlander and I'm here to tell you that it's totally worth two hours of your life, especially if you're a creature feature fan and, even better, a sword and sandels epic fan.<br /><br />Basically, the premise of this movie is if Army Of Darkness was taken seriously.  We have a space man(from another dimension?  The future?  Antoher planet?) who crashes his space ship onto earth in the year 709 and brings a big monster with him, that of course escapes and starts problems for the local Viking villages and tribes.  That's it.  That's the story.  Nothing monumental or groundbreaking but totally fun.  Hell, this movie has the type of story I would have written myself when I was ten and wanted even more to see it in the multiplex.<br /><br />Don't get mislead by the Sci-Fi sounding premise, this is nothing close to true Science Fiction.  It's a big action/horror/ monster movie on the most base levels.  There's no science or hypothesis of the future or past of man to be found.  Sorry, it just doesn't reach that high above it's B movie roots, and that is not always a bad thing if it's done well.  It's obviously one of those films that has many different producers, most of which are not from the states, but the budget and level of polish on the production could be matched to any of the big summer films coming out now.  The sets are good and have the dirty lived in quality required for anything involving Vikings.  The CGI creature is mostly convincing.  There's a few shots where the beast looks less then stellar but not many.  The filmmakers were even smart, considering budget and suspense, by not revealing the creature in full light until the center of the film.  It reminded me of the old Roger Corman creature features, but he waited until the third act, well, because his monsters never looked that convincing and were always more convincing when off screen.  This could've been a big summer film of 09.  Of course it's not a remake, a film based on action figures, one of several sequels to 20 year old properties, and of course there's no car, fast food or toy tie-ins to speak of, but it still could've given me what I long for this summer, something NEW.<br /><br />The cast is all on spot.  Jim Caviezel(The Passion of the Christ, The Thin Red Line, Frequency) stars, and I've always found him to be an underrated actor.  He's turning into the king of big films that don't get a shot theatrically but become fan favorites on home video thanks to this and Highwaymen(if you haven't seen it, check it out).  The movie even throws us the usual respected older actor in the form of John Hurt to play the Viking king.  He's good as always and brings that extra John Hurt-ness he always brings to his roles, big or small.  If you've read Beouwulf you can figure out where the plot is going and what it's riffing on but the added Sci-Fi trope helps throw you off for a bit.  This isn't going to go down as one of Caviezel's great performances, but he does lend dramatic gravity to what essentially is the typical monosyllobic hero with a past role.  After about an hour his characters comes more into his own and leaves behind the usual action character cliche's thanks to him.  Ron Perlman shows up late into the film as an opposing tribes leader.  He's not give much to do, and I'm not sure why they cast an actor of his caliber for such an nothing part, but it's nice to see him anyway.<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds great.  Plus, it's loaded with special features.  We get some neat special effects tests and animatics of the action scenes, which there are plenty of, and while they're nothing ground breaking, they are done well and leave one feeling satisfied.  There's also a great commentary track by the writers, director, producers and special effects technicians that covers so much ground there is no need for a making of doc.  They also react to their critics and talk about the original forms of the script.  Of course there's also 40 minutes worth of deleted scenes, all of which were rightfully ommitted from the final film.  There is an intersting alternate opening that's worth a look though.  Can't say the same for the alternate ending.<br /><br />At least give this one a shot at a rental.  You won't be disappointed.  Sure, the man from outer space might turn some viewers off, but I emplore you to open your mind and just smile while the B movie ride takes you away.  Don't be scared off by the lack of Happy Meals and Tom Cruise level of star power tie-ins. This is a quality B picture on the level of all the big budget B pictures you'll be plopping down 12 bucks to see this summer in theatres.  Yes, I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and Terminator:Salvation.here are plenty of, and while they're nothing ground breaking, they are done well and leave one feeling satisfied.  There's also a great commentary track by the writers, director, producers and special effects technicians that covers so much ground there is no need for a making of doc.

Of course there's also 40 minutes worth of deleted scenes, all of which were rightfully ommitted from the final film.  There is an intersting alternate opening that's worth a look though.  Can't say the same for the alternate ending.    At least give this one a shot at a rental.  You won't be disappointed.  Sure, the man from outer space might turn some viewers off, but I emplore you to open your mind and just smile while the B movie ride takes you away.  Don't be scared off by the lack of Happy Meals and Tom Cruise level of star power tie-ins. This is a quality B picture on the level of all the big budget B pictures you'll be plopping down 12 bucks to see this summer in theatres.  Yes, I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and Terminator:Salvation.
B001QOOCTE|5|I purchased this cd because I really liked the music. I also appreciated the compassion behind the intention. 93% of the profits go to build music schools in poor areas around the world. Am honored to be involved in this small way.
B0089EHWQE|4|This was a great novel.  Hard to put down.  I purchased it on the recommendation of a friend and once I started reading it, I expected the same trite story we've seen on any number of Lifetime movies - not so!  I enjoyed every minute of it.  So much so that I have added the authors other books to my amazon wishlist!
B00FWLSLJ4|5|Outstanding movie!

B007W8S2MG|5|Persona 4 Golden is an absolute masterpiece, a work of art, and shall never be forgotten. Back in 2008, my dear friend gave me this game as a gift. I had never played a JRPG before in my life. It wasn't till I turned on my PS2 did I realize how amazing this game really was. The game has produced so much legacy, costumes, action figures, a fantastic anime, a fighting game sequel, and now a remake with all new features. And there is still more to come!<br /><br />Atlus is known for some of their great story writing, and this game proves it all. In a fictional town in Japan, named Inaba, bizarre murders are taking place. The question is, who is behind these murders, and how are the deaths being done? The main character, Yu Narukami comes from the big city, Tokyo, to Inaba, while his parents are working over seas, to go live with his uncle and 6 year old cousin. As he enters the school of Yasogami High, he meets some fellow classmen, Yukiko Amagi, Chie Satonaka, and Yosuke Hanamura. The second he enters, a murder takes place. Innocent victims are being thrown inside of a TV. Now the gang is doing everything they can to solve the mystery, and stop the culprit. It is a dangerous world inside the Tv, they encounter something called shadows. As they are fighting these shadows, they meet an unusual bear creature called Teddie. Teddie aids the gang throughout their quest in finding the culprit. The more people they save, the bigger the party gets! I don't want to give away too many spoilers.<br /><br />The graphics are a huge improvement of the original. They are much more crisp, and clear. The backgrounds are much more detailed. The characters are so much fun to watch, there is non-stop humor throughout the entire game. They have various events with each other, events that are unforgettable. The soundtrack is absolutely unforgettable, it is very addicting. It's a good thing I have a copy of the CD. The battle system works great, there are absolutely no issues with how the gameplay runs.<br /><br />Updates to the game: You can now roam freely at night time. You can move around the city in a motorcycle. No longer will the game end on christmas day, you now have access to the month of january, and february. A new character named Marie has been added to the game. You can now have a social link with Adachi. There are more personas. You can watch the persona 3 & 4 live concert. There is a new battle theme song. PS, I have the solid gold premium edition, which includes a hard case, a vita skin, stickers, wallpapers, and a pouch.<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden is a absolutely flawless masterpiece! If you have not played this game, then you don't know what you are missing! This is the reason to have a vita, and the only.meplay runs.<br /><br />Updates to the game: You can now roam freely at night time. You can move around the city in a motorcycle.

0553288105|5|I love the Asimov robot novels and also the Foundation series. What Asimov lacks in character development, he makes up for in excellent plots with good surprises throughout. \\"The Gods Themselves\\" is an interesting book--it's later Asimov and it's not a robot novel nor a Foundation novel. It deals with a major discovery, the \\"electron pump\\" which looks to be a source of unlimited, free energy, and two groups of scientists in parallel universes who each have an agenda that threatens to obscure a dangerous truth.<br /><br />In this novel, Asimov creates a totally believable alien race, complete with three sexes (and he deftly handles their mating or lovemaking with amazing sensitivity and creativity.) A bridge between the alien universe and ours offers something for each side, seemingly for free, but scientists on both sides begin to sense that something is evilly wrong. How the wrong is righted is quite surprising and touching. The alien adolescents Odeen, Dua and Tritt are fascinating together. Dua shines as a conflicted, troubled and unusually intelligent person who turns out to be quite the heroine. (Incidentally the names are sorta-kinda \\"one\\", \\"two\\" and \\"three\\" in Russian)<br /><br />The third part of the novel is the weakest (where the people on the Moon figure out what's happening with the Proton Pump.) It has the worst of Asimov's attempts to write romance. And the first section can be a bit slow unless you have worked in academia, in which case, his characterization of professors and their internal wars is spot-on (you wonder, what was life like when Asimov was a professor at Boston University. Probably pretty acrimonious at some point.)<br /><br />I rate this one of my favorite novels of Asimov, along with The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun--leaving aside the Foundation books, which stand on their own as an achievement in a series form. Asimov deftly creates alternative worlds, and if his characters are sometimes a bit wooden, it's overshadowed by his amazing imagination. This novel may actually be his best, if not his most creative.  I'm not knocking off any stars for the saggy end portion, because the middle of the book in the alternate universe, and the plot is so good.<br /><br />The new audiobook narrated by Scott Brick is excellent. Released January 2014.
B00EL8I8IS|4|Great movie, if you are into zombies.  It was a well made sci-fi movie.    But some of the plot was not plausible and Brad Pitt's character knew a little too much.  His character was not explained thoroughly on how he was a jack of all trades.      However, I really liked the Israeli woman soldier though.  Her part really added to the story but in the end, she just disappeared, without explanation.    The movie finishes with a built-up to a possible sequel...World War Z Two.    I would rate this film, a very good movie at 4 stars.
B008MG1E4A|5|This book gives a glimpse into the lives of America's finest warriors and provides an accurate and detailed account of the operation to kill or capture UBL.
B0013D8LOU|5|Sweeney Todd was a very good musical and drama mixed together to make an amazing movie by Burton, Deep, and Carter.  If you truly love your horror movies and Burton films then you will love what he came up with idea wise of taking a boardway musical and turning it into a motion picture.  I listen and watch the movie with an open mind and ear and even enjoyed each moment of the movie thanks to the great acting of all the actors in it.  I hope Burton makes movies for a very long time to come.
B00005JPO1|4|As the Indiana Jones we all know and love, Harrison certainly did not dissapoint. He looked great, the action sequences were as great as we've come to expect from Indi, and non stop all the way. But the ending ! I could have come to terms with aliens as some contact with the past civilisation, but coming to life, and the saucer taking off ? I didn't get it, and it seemed downright silly.
B009FZFONO|5|This story rocks.<br />Even with how lousy they treated Andrea in this season.<br />I'm still praying they don't blow Season 4.<br />Watch these,  then join me.......
B0052RE4MQ|1|I loved Condie's first novel Matched.  It was exciting to read, and I didn't mind that it was like every other dystopian book out there. Matched set up a great premise for Crossed.  Crossed was UNBEARABLE to read!  I probably read less than half of it and I stopped.  I could not stand how the point of view constantly changes, the story got so bland, and the narrators kept sounded the same.  I will not be buying the next book that comes out.  Condie has lost me as a reader. Hey, at least while I was reading the Hunger Games Suzanne Collins waited until the last book for the let down, not the second one.
B009JZSC9S|3|I watch this series as I watch most series a season at the time as opposed to scheduling my time around them to watch them every week. The Good Wife based on the legal system has nothing that is significantly different from other series of this genre.  It is<br />the typical Hollywood cliches: sex, marital issues and the bickering between partners and employees.  Once in a while you may be educated about technical issues of our judicial system, and that is about it.<br />It is however entertaining enough to compel members of the family to get together and spend some quality time in the family den.
1590710037|4|I enjoyed the very practical approach Steven Pressfield takes towards creating art. He makes it doable - it's just a matter of showing up everyday, whatever form your creativity takes. This book  is a quick read, I don't want to say easy, because it takes effort to make the practice happen. I took pause when he talks about the source of inspiration - a point of view I do not agree with, but to each their own.
B000003N69|5|For all the cowards out there, the way into 'Trane is via the gently sloping avenues of &quot; A Love Supreme &quot;, or &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;.<br />However, those of us who don't mind being  described in the  same terms as Chuck-D's seminal &quot; Writers treat me like Coltrane;  insane&quot;, throw ourselves into the deep end that is &quot;Interstellar  Space&quot;. This is essientially the Horn Stripped Bare, roaring and  howling in a dialogue with Rashied Ali's blood-shaking drumming. A last cry  into the abyss, or a conscious straining to escape the shackles of Earth's  gravity? Coltrane's death, weeks after this monumental recording session,  has only served to enhance his reputation in the minds of those of us  marooned in the new century.Death can inflate an image to the point of  cynicism; but Coltrane's energy on this record will still be blazing  in a  thousamd years' time
B0055S348W|5|I have a Canon wi-fi printer.  The app software found my printer easily and works perfectly with it.  I have printed documents and internet pages.  The app contains printer preferences also.
B008XG1X18|5|love pinterest.  love the app!  new update definitely has some problems, force closing, not letting you edit a pin. to name a few.  like the new press and hold for repinning, though it doesn't need to tell me about it every time i go on it.
B005MMJ84K|4|This book follows Lena who made it into the wilds and was taken in by some \\"invalids.\\"<br />I enjoyed this book after about 30% into it. I found it a little boring and confusing at first but grew to enjoy it. Each chapter was separated into the past or the present. I didn't like the \\"then\\" parts much but I really enjoyed the current parts. There are many new characters-not as much character development as I would have liked on some of them but that is understandable because of the way the book was written. We are also introduced to Julian-the head of the cure activist youth group. He is by far my favorite new character and if you read this book you will find out why.<br />Lauren Oliver writes beautifully, as we have seen in Before I Fall and Delirium and this book is no exception.
044654759X|5|I have read every book by Nicholas Sparks and love every single one.  Safe Haven is funny, romantic and full of secrets.  He makes the people come alive and it is if you are going through the motions right along side them.  I can't wait for his next hit!
B0053VKP8S|3|There was a high pitched ringing sound when I wasn't listening to music. It was a deal braker for me. Too much of a pain to send something like this back to so I just bent over.
B00AMBLXP8|3|This was a cute, very adult movie. I enjoyed it although I thought there were alot of scenes that wouldn't be missed.
B005GHN2GG|5|A. Wonderful Book!  One of the best books I have read this year.  It would make a fantastic movie.  I can almost visualize the Orange Groves and the stunning special effects.  Thank you, Grace Craven for all your &#34;pieces of art&#34;.
B001UV4XHY|5|We were nervous at first before seeing the movie as to whether it would follow the book as well as the prior movies have and where it would be cut off in order to do this last book in 2 separate films.  We were NOT disappointed-man-what a ride!  From the minute it starts you are holding on to your seat and your emotions are in for a roller coaster ride you will not soon forget!  Great film-these actors have literally grown up before our eyes and get more and more skilled in their craft with each movie.
B0074PNCRM|5|Loved this book. it was touching in so many ways, and the characters were so beautiful developed and portrayed. The only criticism is with the age of the characters, both Hazel and Gus (16 and 17) seemed so much more mature and worldly than their chronological ages. Maybe this is how much faster cancer sufferers grow up when faced with terminal illness?? Beautiful philosophical love story - one everyone should read!
B002QE3CTY|5|I loved this book! It was so good I couldn't put it down! James Dashner is like my new favorite author!
B000V8A95C|5|will always be in my top 10 of favorites. funny, touching, clever and ironic- an all time favorite for sure!
0446310786|4|Good piece of literature from a racist, dark time in our history.  Hopefully we can learn from (it).
B00CATSONE|5|Tesla was a genius inventor that did not receive the recognition he deserved in his lifetime of since.  Very interesting history in this short tome.
B0000020C4|5|Overall, this is definitely the best Les Mis CD I've heard. It is a live concert that brings together the greatest actors that have played the roles. Colm Wilkenson's acting and emotion cancel out the fact that his  voice is not the very best. Lea Salonga plays Eponine with a strength that  makes you respect her as well as feel compassion for her. Her voice is  brethtaking as well. Judy Kuhn is an excellent Cosette, although her voice  has deepened slightly from the Broadway recording. Michael Maguire has a  beautiful voice (although his technique is not always perfect) and a  personality that invigorates. Phillip Quast has one of the most beautiful  male voices I've heard and the Thenardiers are very funny. Fantine conveys  the pain in her heart exquisitely and Michael Ball is simply the best  Marius ever. Start your Les Mis collection with this one. Add it if you  don't already have it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|A nice read.  Much better beginning than ending.
0788859544|5|DVD arrived early than expected and presented it to a family with popcorn who's two little girl's<br />excited to view from begining to end and view again.
B00PSLQGX6|5|Best show on primetime!
B002UO73Z4|2|Once again, we are left with the same crappy remaster as the 25th anniversary edition.  Something so easy to fix is apparently beyond the morons at Sony.  A minor detail to be sure but, the bell at the beginning of Koka Kola is screwed up.  Instead of the \\"ding\\" of the elevator bell, we get \\"dowing\\", the sound of some idiot that bumped the tape during transfer.  Buy the old, un-remastered version and boost the volume up yourself.    I would give it only one star, but the music is just too good.  Sony rots, don't buy it.
B00007BH3Y|5|I would highly recommend seeing the movie beforehand as the soundtrack reflects many of the events and emotions experienced in the film, which is a unique and beautiful blending of three  stories. I am first a fan of films, and secondly to the actual score. One may have a good film with incredible performances on the part of its actors, a killer script, but without a magnificent score to back it up, it may not live up to its full potential. This score not only allowed, but made The Hours become what it is (a theatrical success.) I am by no means familiar with Philip Glass, but having viewed the movie, I had to have the soundtrack. His music swells with emotion, includes crescendos and decrescendos in all the right places, and blends the string quartet with the piano so eloqiuntly, making one of the most beautiful soundtracks out there. The main theme stings throughout the 14 tracks, sewing it all together. Philip Glass is most certainly one of the best composers, and with this gorgeous collaboration, you can't go wrong.
0061801313|1|Please read the first few chapters before giving this book to your middle school girl.  The characters (juniors in highschool)  drink alcohol, smoke pot, pick up men (a teacher) in a bar, take their clothes off for boys, steal and do many other things you may not want your child to think is acceptable behavior.  If you want to have a frank talk about sex, alcohol, drugs, sexual identity, stealing and eating disorders you may find the book a good starting point.
1451638450|5|This was one of the best books by Lois McMaster Bujold!  I have already read it several times and plan on reading it again!
B00913P6G0|5|I love this album, it makes me reminisce on my own childhood. His flow is very fluid and advanced. There's some songs that grew on me, some that I find a different thing to enjoy the next listen. His stories are vivid, and I feel relate-able on some level for most. The aggressive roles are understood because he or his character is so mild mannered and sensible. If you love lyricism this is a must-have.<br /><br />First gravitated to: Real, Money Trees, Sing About Me.., Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe, Poetic Justice
B0089LOG02|1|Some interesting and important historical information about the phenomenon of the real Orphan Train, which I never knew.  But after that, the story degenerates into a confusing melodrama that leads us down a sappy path.
B0016Q2D5M|5|The acting is very good in this fun, light trek to the underworld.  I wasn't expecting a major epic and so I could sit back and really enjoy it.  The story line is creative and the extra features on the DVD are enjoyable.  It's not a perfect film; it's simply fun.
B00J924YC0|5|Amazing work. Her sophomore album is even better than the first.  Musically on point and very talented production.  This album is fantastic.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Great fun and a challenge.  Don't be too quick to make moves...you will kick yourself for you will immediately see a better one!
B00006FDCD|5|Clowns.
B00A2GQIHG|5|inspirational singing.  I love the music
B00IRMTTPU|5|Great movies, although it made me sad to think how this kind of thing could happen to another human being. A must see.
B00005LIN0|4|I purchased it because I wanted it either for my self or a friend or a family member. I graded it with the number of stars I thought it deserved from my view point and that is all I'm willing to do.  You are wadting my time and yours asking for more than that.
B0048KXRR6|5|I  choose this movie because it is a movie that that the whole family can watch and enjoy!  Good movie to share with the grandchildren!
1451668945|4|I have never read a book by MHC that I have not liked.  She is the queen of mystery writers.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Fun game, just challenging enough..by  like must game apps I dislike that I have to wait for more lives, or beg my Facebook friends for them or buy them! I'm only writing this right now because I'm waiting  to level up...
0385366450|5|Excellent Grisham. Listened on cd while driving to Christmas celebration to and from California.  Like no driving, just the listening.
0765328321|5|Being a moderate fan of the Halo series I was interested when I heard about the Halo book series. Seeing that the price was lowered to a fairly reasonable price (in my opinion), I purchased it. The day I got the book was on a Friday afternoon and once I started reading it I could not get myself to put it down. The style and voice in the book is fascinating and I ended up reading through entire nights and finishing by the end of the weekend, it was that addicting. I highly recommend this book if you're a Halo fan or are interested in the series. Definitely ready to pick up the next book in the series soon!
B00ATTFGXS|3|This app links itself into Alarm Clock Extreme that is written by the same developer. It is a simple stopwatch function with a flaw in my opinion. If you are going to use it there should be the ability to read out the time in 1/100ths of a second on a single timed event and yet this one only goes to 1/10ths of a second. I rarely use a stopwatch function on any of my tablets or phones. The only time is when I go to the Indy 500 track and clock the car's lap speeds. They actually clock the cars to 4 decimal places. Now I know that with human reaction times you cannot be that accurate but it just seems old fashion to only go to 1/10ths of a second. Oddly enough the timer tracks and stores the time to 1/100th of a second it just doesn't display it on the screen while the actual timing is going on. It does show it if you use the lap timer function. The only problem is that if you press Stop instead of Lap you can't see the 1/100ths decimal place.<br /><br />This is an OK app but to be honest most of my tablets and phones have such timers already built in. I probably wouldn't purchase this app even for $0.99. Functionally it works fine but it is a common app function that comes with most tablets already. I rated it at 3 stars.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage<br />* View network connections<br />* Run at startup<br />* Full network connections<br /><br />The app contains no adware or malware or analytics programs.<br /><br />The app installed 612KB into my device memory. I had to manually move it to my SD card and it left 368KB in my device memory and installed 2.12MB onto my SD card.
B00MNYTWMI|3|Love this game, but the app is problematic when updating. I'm almost at level 22, ready to unlock the next &amp;#34;realm&amp;#34; and it's giving me issues with the update. I've had several people look to make sure it is not my device, they all think it is the app. So sad. I will keep trying. I dont want to give up yet.
B00TLU48N0|5|Superb album!  There is something for almost everyone!!
B0042X9L6A|5|gets the jobs I need o get done ,done . It is a great flash for a hobbyist/photographer like myself.
B005ONTD42|5|I got this for my GF and i to use with our dog and we love it. It was easy to use and charges quickly. the app for the iPad and iPhone work easily & well. Its a lot of fun for you to see the dog swat and chase after it but I would recommend it for large dogs or dogs with powerful jaws. all in all def worth the cash
B0099Y2MYK|5|I love Downton Abbey. I have collected all 3 seasons. First, the quality of this DVD is superior, I believe it has better sound quality than any DVD I own. And of course, there's the content. I hope to own all of the Downton Abbey series as it progresses (hopefully for years and years). it's hard to go wrong here if you are a Downton Abbey fan. (and if you're not, why not give it a try?)
B00BEPVAV8|5|The best ever 'Racing Game', GRAPHICS ARE excellent AND THE GAME holdS your attention - while increasing your heart rate. Recommended; using the tilt device to control the car and put the sensitivity around two.
B00IXF8PLU|4|Enjoyed the movie very much, would definitely recommend--I didn't know what to expect as I hadn't read the book--will be reading it shortly.
B005ZOBNOI|2|I was told that I would just love this book, but it is not for adult men like I was told it was
B002MQYOFW|5|This book is just fantastic.  It is a page-turner that will have you glued to your seat as you read, wanting to know what happens next.  I am an adult and I loved the book just as much as some 12 and 13 years old kids.  I can see why The Hunger Games has been a hit.  Just superb!
B00IVDXAN2|3|Bought this for my niece. Concept is fun but the quality leaves something to be desired. The sounds and motion detection are repetitive and spotty but not surprising for a children's toy at this price.
B00BD99JMW|2|*SOME SPOILERS*<br /><br />I was entertained by the first two installments, but not thrilled with them. &#34;Divergent&#34; and &#34;Insurgent&#34; each had a number of small but jarring issues that made them read like they were drafts rather than finished works. &#34;Allegiant&#34; also has this problem, but has the added flaw of being overwhelmed by the premise, which is revealed to be untenable. The city established in the first two books just doesn't fit with the explanation of the outside world that Roth gives. The genetic damage revelation renders the faction system- the intriguing premise of the first novel- essentially meaningless. The conflicts that Roth spent two books on are rendered footnotes in the new conflict the characters are placed in.<br /><br />I concur with others who have expressed disapproval of the split POV narrative. I generally like reading narratives of multiple POV characters, but I disapprove of its use here for several reasons. I'm a stickler for symmetry and consistency even if the book in question is a multi-volume series. This would be a minor problem if the narrative was well executed. But it wasn't. While I did find some good parallels between Tris and Tobias's separate story arcs, especially toward the end, most of the time the POV split comes off as being born purely out of necessity of the series primary narrator dying before the story ends. And that is why I can't ignore my quibble about symmetry. When you commit to a first person narrative you commit to that character's story being THE story. The Divergent series is Tris's story until suddenly it's not and I don't think that works.
1878424602|5|This book will change your life. It opens your eyes to things that you never thought existed.
B002N5N5QQ|5|I own the whole series now and love every minute of it. Season 2 didnt go over well with some critics but I think it set alot of groundwork for the rest of the series. Alot of bad language and violence but if you can handle that this is a must watch. Lots of extras on the DVD. Give it a try.
1594489505|5|I've read both of Hosseini's books and found this one even better than the last one.  The characters are very well developed and you feel enormous empathy for them.  The story was well told and the twists and turns were great.  I literally had a hard time putting this book down.      I pretty much could follow the Farsi as it was written within the context of the sentence.  I loved the book but am sad that I am done with it.  I hope the author writes more but maybe the Afghanistan setting might need a change for a third novel.
B009AZZEU2|5|wow. back after a 15 year hiatus. not the soundgarden i remember from the 90's, by any means. chris cornell is not hitting the screaming highs he did on motorfinger. and, they are sticking to what they do best, the slow and medium tempo heavy stuff. if you dig soundgarden (and i have all their old stuff and love it) then you'll dig this. just keep an open mind.
B00N6PD3GE|5|As usual Eric Larson, the author, does great research.<br /><br />Lot's of stories about many passengers on this voyage.<br /><br />Also complete history why the Luisa Tania should never have Have been left without escort.<br /><br />This is an incredible story

1451629192|2|Please understand how hard it is for me to give this book such a low rating and that I am not judging what Jaycee went through in anyway nor am I judging her. What Jaycee went through was heartbreaking and horrible and I am so glad that she is now safe with friends and family. She is a truly amazing woman.<br />The low review comes from the really badly written book. It jumps around, is distracting and to be really honest here you can get all the really important parts in her TV interview about the book. That may sound harsh and I don't mean to come off that way, I do understand why she wrote the book and that is a very noble reason to write a book about her story but it does not change the fact that the book is really badly written.<br />I wish you the best Jaycee and hope that one day you do become a famous writer like you wanted to in your book.
B0090SI3EI|5|Saw this with my husband on opening night and loved it. I even went back 3 times to see it again. This movie is amazing and the cast incredible the addition of Falcon and reprisal of Sebastian Stan's character along with others makes this movie a must see for any marvel or Capt fan
B00FRVH3V6|5|Awesome
B000FBFN1U|5|George R.R. Martin is such an amazingly talented writer.  Just when you think that this series cannot get any better, it gets even better.  Martin is so descriptive in his writings that I feel like I am apart of the Night's watch standing guard on the cold icy wall, I am one of the fish wives a.k.a. \\"free folk\\" preparing for a night under bear skins with my lover.  One of Daenary's hand maidens and help to braid her hair as she feeds her dragons.  If you enjoy reading fantasy, historical, action and don't mind missing sleep because the reading is so good, then I cannot stress enough READ THIS SERIES.
B000PTYPAC|5|Riot is a great CD with music that will have you jamming out with a smile on your face.  Paramore is one of those rare bands that never seems to steer their fans wrong with their music.  There isn't one song on this CD that I didn't like.  Give this CD a shot, I know you will like it.
B0078ZDYW6|3|Decent
B00J3ZIGOU|5|Really nice<br />Super fun<br />Good for ages 9+<br />Girls and boys 9+ is the way to go<br />Hilarious<br />I suggest this book strongly

B000S1M9LY|1|I managed to survive only about 150 - 200 pages of this 1000 page extremely tedious boondoggle and finally gave up.  I could find no humor or point to this bunch of gobbledygook.  I tend to read a wide variety of books and consider myself to have an eclectic and accepting sense of taste and humor.  Even if I make it partially through a book that may not find myself initially crazy about, I'll usually tend stick it out and find some type of reward or something of emotional value by the end.  However, I could stomach no more of \\"Infinite Waste\\" and it is one of the few books that I permanently deleted from my Kindle library to never be seen again.  You'll be lucky if you make it through the forward section where they find some poor lost soul to write about how great this piece of junk is going to be....May the Force Be With You!
B00TKNQQHO|4|Love every single song. Love the show, couldn't wait to get the soundtrack. Some of the songs I love most aren't on the CD which was disappointing but I still love the CD more every time I play it.
B001XULSG6|5|Essential Star Trek The Next Generation. If you ever caught an episode of The Next Generation or Voyager this is the movie to see. Best Baddies The Borg.
B0020BUWX2|5|Great book! Cried several times. Can't wait for the movie to come out this fall! This is a must read.
B006MW3UZW|5|We love this series. These shows can be watched by all ages. You are not assaulted by bad language or sex scenes that are an affront to us. Great family series.
1616550414|5|This is the perfect addition to any Zelda collection, and I highly recommend it! The book is big, solid, impressive, and has tons of information on every part of the Zelda universe. From the inception of the original game in the '80s to the modern works of Spirit Tracks and Skyward Sword, this one has it all.
B008M7JODC|5|Love this series!
0143143492|5|Another great book by Eckhart Tolle it was very helpful in gaining clarity and releasing baggage.  Should read &#34;The Power of Now&#34; prior to this book.  Mr. Tolle has changed my views and my life tremendously.  I went from being paralyzed by fear to being present and alive(no fear).  I learned to live in the here and now wow what a relief.
B000OYC3J8|4|The title is Americanized cockney for \\"What the hell?\\" Coincidentally, that's the conclusion I came to when listening to certain parts of this album, namely when the group adds a Mariachi band (\\"Conquest\\", \\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\\"), or when they use friggin' bagpipes (\\"St. Andrew (The Battle is in the Air)\\"), or when they rely on cacophonous rock (\\"Little Cream Soda\\"; \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\"), or when they pull a skit about rag-and-bone dealers in the middle of a song (\\"Rag and Bone\\"). Don't go away just yet, though! It's not like the Stripes are losing it or anything. In fact, the blues-rockers here are easily the best: the Led Zeppelin-like \\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)\\"; slide-guitar driven \\"Catch Hell Blues\\", my favorite White Stripes song ever; the pounding title track; gentle \\"I'm a Martyr for My Love for You\\"; \\"300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues\\", \\"Bone Broke\\" and the Rod Stewart-like \\"Effect and Cause\\" also deliver. Sadly not as good as Get Behind Me Satan - sad because after that album, I was expecting this to be an unbeatable five-star, or at least a solid four-star. A bit of a letdown, then, but nothing too bad.
B0063IH60K|5|I think everyone likes to play solitaire no matter what age. This is a great game to play to pass the time
B0043EV774|5|Excellent in 3d, love the colors , love the acting<br /><br />Best fantasy movie<br /><br />Blu ray a must<br /><br />So funny too
B000E1ZBGS|5|This was one of my favorite movies.  Just had to have it so I can watch it any time I feel like it.  Touching love story.
1439177724|1|Full disclosure: I have decided to stop reading this book at page 50. Why? It is absolutely atrocious. The writing is cliche-ridden and dull with a narrator who seems to have been modeled after a Steven Seagal character.<br /><br />I randomly read some excerpts throughout the book and it doesn't appear to get any better. I have no idea how it garnered such good reviews. I suspect a lot of logrolling in the publishing world.<br /><br />Life's too short to read bad books - and this is certainly one of them.
B005Q1W10A|5|I am addicted to this show and the wonderful characters.  I am looking forward to January for the next installments.
B0000AK7AA|4|Wish it was on bluray.  Love Christina Ricci (sp?)  This is a great movie for kids also.. Even though it is not in their era...
B004SD5GZ4|5|A classic
B0049P1VHS|3|Here is a classic case of a show feeling its way along from a great premise, and some interesting moments, to its much better groove (the succeeding season, seasons). Which could be said for so many other television shows. It usually takes quite a while to get the real creative juices going, doesn't it? Just to offer a few examples: how terrible were the first seasons of Star Trek: TNG, and the X-Files, respectively?<br /><br />The Walking Dead, Season One, really only proves how there is usually a freshman jinx involved with classic television shows. The opening episode, for example, is hardly original: we saw it all before in 28 Days Later, didn't we? A guy wakes up in a hospital only to find the world has become a post-apocalyptic zombie hellscape while he's been away. Some neat twists on the theme do not take away from the fact that it is a stolen idea. From more than one place, it turns out: Stephen King wrote similar scenes as this in The Stand. Remember Stu Redman?<br /><br />The rest of the season is not very surprising; various and sundry encounters with the undead and the presentation of survivors, none of which is particularly interesting. A low budget also meant a reliance on computer-generated graphics, so that the zombie deaths usually resemble something you could catch in a Resident Evil videogame.<br /><br />We never see the most interesting part of the apocalpyse, which is the transition from one world to the next. It's just the next, and you have to imagine the rest. Disappointing. Or rather, it did not have to be disappointing, but it is, due to a lack of originality.<br /><br />Today's audience is also accustomed to zombie horror, so that many of the scenes here, pivotal sequences in the episodes, just aren't very striking -- such as Rick's (the protagonist's) encounter with a hoard of undead in Atlanta. We've seen all of this stuff before, and so it is hardly worth a glance.<br /><br />And the fact is, if this was all the show turned out to be about, it would be terrible. Instantly forgettable. Like a toned-down version of Night of the Living Dead. And there would certainly be no reason to keep turning it on week after week.<br /><br />But it isn't just about zombies, that's the thing. It's about fully-developed, dramatically real characters inhabiting a zombie-world -- and that is new. Basically, what we have is the zombie universe treated for the first time since Romero's original film in the 60's as a serious stage on which the human condition can be played out.<br /><br />We quickly realize that this is less about the scares and the killing, the dim lighting and the horror, than it is about the people involved in it. The interest arrives with the elucidation of character (which does not happen enough here to earn a higher rating from me, but which does happen).<br /><br />Few of the scenes I liked involved zombies, actually. My favorite was the abandoned Dixon brother on the rooftop in Atlanta, his psychological struggle with God/fate/himself as he was dying of exposure. Very well done, a great performance based on the bedrock of a wonderful script. Romero never directed anything so beautiful. Other good ones involved Shane and Rick's emotionally divided son.<br /><br />The stories show glimpses of what they will eventually become, once the writers become fully immersed in the characters. Not great, but very good in certain instances, especially the dialogue. Not a lot of trite lines here, no signs of inexperienced screenwriters ...<br /><br />It's a very intelligent experience, overall, especially in the last few episodes. The lines given to the group's conscience, Dale, are frequently wonderful. Worth the price of admission. The over-arching themes of the series are introduced fairly well, and in a convincing manner. So again, it is not the zombie stuff that intrigues, but the deeper layers. For example, if there is no hope, if this is mankind's \\"extinction event,\\" then what, exactly, are these people plodding on for? And of course the survival of the body/versus the survival of the human soul thing (again embodied in many of Dale's dialogues).<br /><br />I only give it three stars because the setting is given preference here, instead of the characters ... because it is still all being set up. The show gleams wonderfully when it is about the characters and the choices they face, the loves and hatreds they habor. But it sinks when focusing on the \\"walkers.\\" Because again, we've seen all that before.<br /><br />But the writers are clever. They understand that before the viewer can give a damn about who gets eaten or attacked by a zombie, he/she must first become involved in a character's plight ... and in a movie? You just don't have time to do that sort of thing. A few minutes backstory per character, and you better hope you succeed, or the whole movie fails.<br /><br />Here they have time, and they take it. They build these characters brick by brick, and as convincingly as anything you'll find in even Emmy-award winning shows.<br /><br />But again, all is set-up, a finding of the way, a searching through fog-enshrouded trees for a proper path. It's a good start, but I maintain that only in the next season do they really begin to get it right.<br /><br />The final two episodes are disappointing, though intellectually stimulating. A CDC scientist, at the end of his tether, tries to murder the group, or encourage their mass suicide, however you choose to look at it. Either way, it's contrived. And almost certainly factually inaccurate, as far as the real CDC in Atlanta is concerned. It involves the destruction of the entire facility, when only the destruction of the labs (including any stores) would do. And the final blow-up is computer-generated nonsense, almost laughable in its look.
B003B02OOG|5|Once you start you never stop!!
B0063IH60K|5|Fast moving and smooth play.
B0071XO8RA|5|Loving this series..very interesting ,can't wait to continue the story. I wonder if we'll all end up in silos , might happen someday the way we take everything for granted these days
B00BSB2AE4|5|So freaking hilarious! I cried laughing so hard! Easy to relate to some of the author's crazy situations! Wonderfully refreshing.

B002U6CJCE|4|I never saw the original ones but this one was good action packed. Good to see Van Damme coming out with many movie lately.
B003O86FMW|5|Could not put this down!
0321934318|5|Scott writes so anyone can understand. I have all his books and refer to them often. Photography made easier to process.
1476770387|5|I see a lot of comments about the story dragging, and I understand where they're coming from, even though it wasn't something that bothered me in this case.  Not everyone enjoys a slow pace and long build-up in their fiction.<br /><br />If this had been an unknown author and I had less faith in the outcome, maybe it would have been more annoying.  But I usually like the way King tells stories--especially when he's in his &#34;serious novelist&#34; mode, as with Bag of Bones, and now Revival--and I enjoyed the ride, just for the quality of the storytelling, before the horror payoff arrived in the third act.  (Incidentally, the climax was the only part of Bag of Bones that felt weak to me; by contrast, Revival hits its strongest notes there.)<br /><br />When I picked up the book I didn't have any idea what this it was about, or whether it was supposed to be particularly scary at all, so maybe it helped that I didn't even know if it was going to be anything more than unsettling and creepy.  If I'd heard the ending hyped up in advance, I'm sure I wouldn't have been so taken aback when I got there.<br /><br />As it turned out, it was a lot more disturbing than I was braced for, and I honestly hope that I don't remember it too clearly for too long, other than the vague &#34;it was ghastly, and a strong ending&#34;.
1476734941|4|good book..very informative, easy read.i understand much more about how people can go a day or two on very little calories
B007J4T2G8|1|I could not get past chapter nine of this book. It's extremely repetitive and phenomenally boring for erotic literature of this kind.<br /><br />I've read better fanfiction that didn't get published.<br /><br />The sex scenes are laughable, at best.<br /><br />With all honesty..THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.<br /><br />Please read Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel series instead.
B00JH49OTS|1|I don't know what went wrong, but I got a black screen for over 5 mins.  I gave up, and had to power down my computer.  I was not able to terminate the website.

0671004107|5|Sagan was a very intelligent man and it shows in what he wrote about.  Rarely do i see a movie i really like with the book being as good or vice versa.  The different ending to the book is maybe more interesting than the movie but is more of a cerebral subject.  Discussing pi in a movie and implications of it would not work as well but in a book, very interesting.<br /><br />I wonder how much this book has contributed to the explosion of books analyzing pi and its history?
B00AAQRNQ8|5|took awhile to get used to the size because it was quite a bit larger than my old one, but now I like it a lot.
B00IDI8KLC|5|My nine year old son absolutely loves this movie. I have yet to meet a 7,8 or 9 year old doesn't. Not bad fun for the parents either. Worth a watch for everyone.
B00BAXFECK|5|I enjoyed this immensely, couldn't put it down.
B000SMWUPS|5|Awesome accessory for under $10! We keep bottled drinks, snacks, pacifiers, etc... in there easily. There's also a zippered pocket to put money in. We don't have to take it off and on when folding the stroller up. It stays upright when the handle is at a 45 degree angle :-) Highly recommend this for the UppaBaby Vista, esp bc their cup holder is expensive and worthless.
006441034X|5|Howl's Moving Castle is, overall, a good book.  <br /> <br />That said, I don't think it is even in the same sphere of interest as J. R. R. Tolkien, or J. K. Rowling. The tone is different; DWJ maintains a witty tone, very emotional, but practical as well. She keeps you interested because of the ways her characters act. Sophie is a particularly complex character, and I enjoyed the ways in which she tried to deny her, um, feelings for Howl (especially the weed killer). I found Tolkien to be more detail-oriented, and less character-based. His books weren't as easy (or, in my opinion, interesting) to read. J. K. Rowling? A different story entirely. The three books don't compare, and not because one is better than the other. They're just completely different. <br /> <br />The book and the movie differ as well. At least two people I know, faced with me coaxing them into reading the book after seeing the movie, declined, with the excuse that they didn't think the book would be as good. This is definitely NOT TRUE. Miyazaki couldn't possibly summarize the character's personalities (Sophie's stubbornness and emotionalness; Howl's selfishness, and total escapism, and his courage, bravery, genius and hot! body, haha). He didn't even try. Come on. Even though I love Miyazaki, admire his films, and think he is truly skilled, I don't think this film was at all his best. The characters were saccharine. Sophie was a nice old woman without a lot of personality, and Howl was a seemingly selfish man who turned out to be a flying bird turned war hero turned 'ideal' male lead. And then there was the Witch. She WASN'T GOOD. SHE WAS EVIL. I know I sound pessimistic, and there were parts of the movie that made me love it... but as a movie. I loved this book first, and I was really disappointed with the movie. If you are looking for more Miyazaki, you're out of luck. <br /> <br />The book starts out with Sophie, the responsible sister of two girls constantly in competition and the daughterof a hatter and his new wife, an ex-assistant of the shop. She doesn't believe that she has much chance of striking it rich and living happily ever after. But soon, for reasons somewhat unknown, the Witch of the Waste decides to invade her shop, and turns her into an old woman! Shocked, Sophie soon begins her journey away from the hat shop to cure herself. She ends up staying as a cleaning lady for the notoriously womanizing wizard Howl. Supposedly, he eats hearts. Her encounter with him is complicated, involving two curses, unknown motivations, and all the supporting characters and sub-plots.  <br /> <br />The best thing about the book is Sophie's personality. She is actually an honorable person. In the beginning, she seems overly dutiful, and near the middle she can seem immature; but if you look more at the reasons she acts that way, her actual character becomes clear. I like that she's human, and acts in different ways. So that was what made the book for me.  <br /> <br />Give this book a chance! It's better than it might seem.
B00HV8TN7K|5|Awesome movie!<br />Can't recall seeing another movie with only one character<br />but this movie holds your interest throughout!
B005OCFGTO|3|Not sure if its because my dvd player is old or not but picture and color not as sharp as i would like...love the harry potter series though!
1933865474|5|I love it!
B003XRELGQ|4|Easy to read short story reviewing religion and society.  A lot of things to consider through easily digestible format.  I enjoyed it.
B000E6GBV2|5|Everything All the Time by Seattle's Band of Horses is not an overly complex record but its simplicity adds to its charm.  A little bit rock, a little bit emo, and a little bit country, it wears its influences on its sleeve.  Almost like a fine wine, you can distinguish the key ingredients as you swish it around in your mouth and after giving this album a listen or two, you can taste the influence of My Morning Jacket, Built to Spill, Neil Young, labelmates The Shins, and maybe even a dash of Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips.  Not bad ingredients to draw from. <br /> <br />Most bands aren't necessarily be trying to re-invent the wheel and BOH are no different.  The songs on this album however, are so strong and singer, Ben Bridwell offers the perfect delivery.  While the tonal qualities of his voice may present a familiar recollection, the annunciations are very unique often times reminding me just how much a voice can contribute greatly to the instrumentation of an arrangement. <br /> <br />Musically you can expect dynamic, lush arrangements with layered, swirling guitars, catchy melodies and a vocal track in which producer Phil Eck has crafted an atmospheric feel that could use a hair less reverb. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the album is incredibly solid from head to tale and is absolutely one of my favorite releases of 2006.  Pay special attention to the songs, \\"The Funeral\\", \\"The Great Salt Lake\\", and the subtle \\"Part One\\" which almost gets lost between the two aformentioned. <br /> <br />Also, don't miss them live if you get the chance!  Enjoy. <br />
B00DBSZEH2|3|Nice movie
B003G4W49C|5|This book is so great. I love it. Definitely a great read. I would recommend this book for young adults looking for a quick and fun read.
B0018QOIXU|4|The cafe soul voice of Adele is amazing. \\"19\\" was on the best CDs released in 2008, and rightfully won two Grammys. Adele is one of the best and I hope she stays around for a long time.
B00932AA5G|5|As a fan of Jo Nesbo's books this film is not about Harry Hole - but it is no less satisfying. The plot is engrossing and the twists keep coming ensuring that the viewer is constantly on the edge of their seat wondering where the story goes next. Yes there are subtitles, and yes it's a foreign film but if you usually don't cope with those elements you should still give this film a chance - especially if you're on the Prime program and can stream for free.
B0094M2WTM|5|Wonderful family appropriate film about the heart of a fearless champion. I am a huge Diane Lane fan and this flick does nothing but burnish<br />her image. Whether the characters were portrayed with complete accuracy or not matters little. Here, the horse is the star and Secretariat was a virtuoso mega star. We loved this flick.
B0076DCT2G|4|From the moment you open the first page, DeMille has you captured.  He has done his homework on the story line and presents it in a fashion that you cannot leave it alone.  John Corey, his character of many books, is so described, that you know almost what he looks like.  You do have to be into current times and world affairs because he does come close to home with this book.  Recommend reading it highly..
B0094M2ITG|5|What a story!
B00DQC2FPM|5|I bought this for my husband (age: 37) and he had a really good time building this!  The instructions were really good - it's a really nice book.  He also enlisted our almost 3 year old to help with some of the easy stuff.  It's a really neat concept and reignited my husbands interest in Legos.
B0034G4P9E|5|You find yourself glued to the screen in the last twenty minutes of this film. Your muscles tense, your eyes dart back and forth during cuts. And the conclusion is gripping, warming and genuinely fantastic.
B0051UP5NQ|2|Yeah it lets you go to the presentation ,document , and the rest but the presentation I can't figure out how to do founts there's no themes it's just Wight and black if this app was not the app of the day it would be a waste of money.
B00ANVX6DY|5|My daughters love this movie. They love sofia the first i will be buying more
B00F1W1SS0|5|Its awesome how a  20 year band still delivers power and talent. I need to be sincere, this Concert is not my favorite from them in terms of camera angles and sound quality, The camera angles are sloppy at times, and Myung is almost missing...Whyyyy? In sound quality the voice of Labrie takes an emotional passage throughout the show, but at times, its just out of tune (but not horribly). I was listening to Scenes from NY cd, and the sound of every instrument just sounded perfectly balanced....here, some of the instruments feels overpowered by the guitar, depending on the song. The drumming is great, but if you compare it to Scenes from NY, it sounds muffled, it just dont has that &#34;thumping&#34; sound. I think the mixing could be better, BUT RATHER THAN THAT, ITS A MUST BUY FOR EVERY ONE, FAN OR NOT. TALENT DONT NEED FANS, JUST MIND AND ATTENTION....and dont miss the documentary, is beautiful! I was going to rate it 4/5 but the documentary made change my mind so 5/5!!! This band deserves it!!!
B009LDD1X0|5|Definatly one of the greats!  We love this show and have all the seasons!  Great pick me up after a long day!
B0083EW97W|5|This is a great album! I was looking forward to some old John Mayer, but he came back with a more southern appeal in this album. Guess it came with his new look.
B003O86FMW|5|Simply amazing! First time I ever read a book in two days and didn't want to finish because I didn't want it to end.
B0000041TD|5|I'm sorry this is not a review. I was wondering if someone can tell me if libretto is included in this product. Thanks in advance.

B000002LAB|5|True this is mostly producer/bassists Marcus Miller's work,<BR>true a cover of Scritti Politi's &quot;Perfect Way&quot; may seem suspect<BR>but I'll tell even FUSION snobs where to get off about &quot;Tutu&quot;-it's one of Miles's funkiest albums and a highpoint in his catolog!The tital track,&quot;Splatch&quot; and the deeply grooving<BR>&quot;Full Nelson&quot; pretty much exemplify the rest of what is to be found here-synthesizers,drum machines,deep bass licks and as always Miles's own distinctive playing that makes &quot;Tutu&quot; a pretty<BR>magical work of art and not a crass commercial ploy.Now if only<BR>the work Miles and Prince did together during this time could<BR>be released.???????
B00C7KXUOE|5|Fantastical
B000I3P3EM|4|...but it's Star Trek so it's awesome. Apparently there were some storyline issues for Shatner from the beginning, but I think he pulled it together for some coherence. It's still an enjoyable movie!
B0002EQ7EC|4|This album is reminiscent of Graceland in its rich native tones. I enjoyed Graceland more as I felt that it was more upbeat overall. The Rhythm of the Saints is a fun listen on its own, but also makes great background music for entertaining,tasks or driving.
B00003CXB4|5|My entire family enjoys this movie, especially me.
B000GCFY0I|5|It held my interest the whole time. I kept on wanting to know what was gonna happen next. It was definitely a book you could read in one sitting from it holding your interest
B001GZ6QC4|5|Awesome movie...if you like this type.  Visual affects and story is much different, but GOOD for today viewers of this type of super hero.  Great twist to and old hero...and good story.  My boys loved it and the service and availability through AMazon was AWESOME! Recieved in excellent condition with speedy delivery.
B006LSZECO|5|Gone Girl is worth the read.<br />Well paced, well written, challenging and not predictable!<br />It was hard to put down after getting into it.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I started reading the Hunger Games Series about a week ago and I finished the entire series in just 3 days.  It took me less than 4 hours to read this book.  I simply could not put it down.  I am so happy with the ending :)
B009MO57H6|5|Love this movie so much
006112429X|5|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" starts out very strong... I couldn't put it down until page 150. Then, more than once over the next 150 pages, I got annoyed. Despite its perfectly detailed writing, the conceit (the entire novel is a series of letters) and sheer length (400 pages, in a smaller than usual typeface) of this story strained my patience. Thankfully, Lionel Shriver understands something about payoff. The end of this book had the hairs standing up on the back of my neck. Wow. Very well done. What would have been a four star review gets a bump due to the thoroughly satisfying ending.<br /><br />Clearly Shriver can write. I especially love how small, well chosen details convey characters so well. I love the letter in which Eva describes her husband purely through his quotidian interests. She has also taken on an unwieldy topic -- senseless murder. To a certain extent this debate has already occured a million times in the media, with conclusions no more conclusive than what Shriver can come up with. That's the condondrum of senseless things... there aren't any profound answers. For these reasons (quality of writing and ambition of subject) I think this is one of the better books I've read this year.
B003GSLX5Y|3|Not as great as it's made out to be. Some of the stuff they have in here is pretty much a joke, because they use it themselves. The book really needs an update. Good starting point, but if you follow all their rules, your writing won't be that good.
0385344430|5|Amazing! I love it! This is my favorite series of books and this most recent addition is just as great as its predecessors!! Eagerly anticipating the next one!
B00005RDRO|5|Awesome
B00KG2OZIU|4|Good  for history too.
B00LIQJE66|5|Another great album. You never get tired of his music creativity
B00IINPXLW|1|I had the first CTR (Cut the Rope) and I got this to go with it. But instead I got In-app Purchases galore. First of all On Nom gets tired when you're in the middle of playing and you have to use tokens to get more energy. Or pay to get tokens. And there is more In-App Purchasing! So this game is not so free at all. And I'm guessing the &amp;#34;Fun and Free&amp;#34; five star review is fake. If I were you I would get the first CTR.
B000A88EV4|5|A thick and intricate plot will not be found here and if you're looking for one, you maybe sorely disappointed. However, if one is looking for rich, life-like, and carefully crafted characters than this film will satisfy and appeal to people who appreciate realistic and witty dialogue, interesting and complex relationships and very convincing performances.     The relationships that are manifested through this work of art are also carefully crafted to perfection as well; a film with a total of four main characters drives this film's run time of (128 minutes) into what feels like a nano second.                 Our beloved protagonist, Johnny, will garner the majority of the attention and rightfully so because he is so entertaining and easy to fall in love with; Johnny is raw, incredibly intelligent, witty, voluble, gregarious and highly charming. Johnny is a mere vagabond; a drifter; a true conversationist in every sense who converses with people on all different levels of society; he is a criminal on the run and yet so attractively likable.    The consequence of this criminal act moves Johnny like a magnet to it's opposite pole, or in this case, to Louis's flat in London (Johnny's ex-girlfriend)  After being invited inside by Sophie, one of Louise's roommates. It is here that we are delightfully invited into Johnny's outlook on life, time, space, technology and human nature.     The owner of the flat, Jeremy, is about as despicable and chauvinistic as a male can get. This is more plainly manifested through his treatment of women and material possessions. To Jeremy, women are less than material objects but are designed for humiliation and sexual abuse. He interchanges women faster than a politician exchanges handshakes at a campaign rally. Jeremy's brief appearances are powerful as he abuses his role as a landlord with impunity as well as dominating women with his wealth. His complete disregard for people's privacy along with his general outlook on life is appallingand highly disturbing indeed. Jeremy's character is immediately and appropriately defined when he is receiving a massage from a woman and candidly asks her, \\"do you think women like getting raped\\"?     Jeremy's distasteful traits are further enhanced when he shares the same space with Sophie. Unlike Louise, Sophie is mentally weak and submissive but strikingly attractive in her own quirky sort of way as Jeremy confesses to her.  Sophie lives very much in the present or day-to-day sort to speak. She is by far the least dominating character in the film. Her attraction to Johnny is instantaneous and his interaction with Sophie truly exposes her neediness and emotional attachment.    Louise is the alpha female of the flat. She is the only female who is able to directly challenge Jeremy's personality. Her relationship with Sophie can be best described as delicately calculated. They are not close in any emotional sense, more like an economical one, but nonetheless, they make the best of living with each other. Interestingly enough, there relationship evolves into something a little deeper when Jeremy feels it necessary to spend the night.     The relationships between these four main characters are captivating because all of their performances are convincing and seem so very real. Observing Johnny's interaction with people is entertaining and very enlightening; no one is left unscathed when sharing the same space with him, not even the mentally unstable.  The real power in this film lies in the main character, Johnny, and the director's ability to invoke sympathy and compassion for a man who has committed such a horrid criminal act of rape.     By the end of the film we forget about Johnny's mistakes, in fact, we are so interested in Johnny's past life and where the forces of nature will take him that we don't want to see him leave.  It is quite saddening actually. Initially, Johnny begins with a clear concrete destination, towards the end of the film, he becomes a free-floating leaf during a fall breeze in the streets of London once again because According to Johnny, he has an infinite amount of places to go, but it's where he stays is the problem.      On a side note, I feel it would be unfair not too mention the beautiful score to this film by Andrew Dickson, another masterpiece from start to finish. It's too bad you cannot purchase this anywhere as I have tried many times with failure.
B007J4T2G8|5|Loved reading this series!

B0015DWJX2|4|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society was a wonderful story. It is 1946 and the ending of World War II when writer Juliet Ashton becomes pulled into the world of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands, part of Great Britain. Through a series of letters with the islanders such as Mrs Dawsey Adams she becomes more aware of the war in a different way. The island and the citizens of Guernsey becomes real to her as through the letters she receives and sends and she learns about the islanders and the impact that the war has had upon them as individuals and upon their community.<br /><br />The story tells of the lives of people who must deal with concentration camps, loss of loved ones and making desserts to share from scraps and bits of pieces (thus potato peel pie) since food is so scarce and of the hardships and terror that was ever present in their lives. Juliet feels the need to visit Guernsey herself since the people of the island have become personal to her, and thus she sets about sailing to Guernsey, her life takes on an entirely different turn and she is forever changed. The characterization is strong and the letters are written in such a way that you can hear the voices of each writer. This is a book I would recommend. It is frequently chosen for book club discussions and you will understand why as you read it.
B007PTJOV0|5|I liked the game reminded me of mario. But I don't understand the back story so if they cleared that up then it would be perfeft.

0195073401|1|This text is the one of choice for micro courses in econ PhD programs. I (and several of my colleagues) almost quit the program because of this book (some in fact did). And it was not because we were mediocre students - some of us went on to become very well-published individuals. It was because the econ was lost in this book, with math taking primary importance (thus making it quite boring!). Ironically, the students who seemed to do well with this book had a very hard time coming up with thesis topics! Of course, this is all anecdotal evidence.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that it lacks any intuition - it is basically a math textbook with econ terminology sprinkled around. As a first micro course textbook this is unacceptable! There are many well-known economists out there (Jeff Wooldridge comes to mind) that publish widely-used textbooks which are easy on the reader without compromising scientific rigor.<br /><br />I blame this book for the state of econ research today - the increased complexity in models/formulas/derivations without any novel or interesting underlying ideas. In fact, most research papers out there have become like big-budget movies with stories that go nowhere. (A colleague of mine confided that he once co-wrote a paper whose message remained the same, but after a few rounds of revisions got so mathematically complex he could no longer present it on his own). If all econ PhD students are subjected to this text, there's no wonder...but I digress....<br /><br />The only survival tactic to econ PhD students struggling with this book is this:<br /><br />1. Relax! Understanding this book has nothing to do with your future success in the field.<br />2. Pick up Varian's micro textbooks - both the undergraduate and the graduate one. There is no shame is starting easy if that means you will really truly get it. Go over each with a fine tooth comb, and solve exercises at the end of each chapter.<br />3. Take a math course that covers matrix algebra, differential equations, and calculus in n-dimensional space, or just grab a book and go through it yourself (e.g. [[ASIN:0262082942 Mathematics for Economics - 2nd Edition]]).<br />4. Pick up Mas-Colell and see that it is really not as hard as it looked at the beginning.<br /><br />I guess part of the problem is not the textbook itself but that graduate programs use it for intro to micro PhD courses. Without proper priming, this text is torture. Unfortunately, many programs do this. I am mostly aware of the econ programs in Big Ten universities, some other schools of similar ranking, and a couple of leading departments (such as UC Berkeley). It is unfair to use such a sledgehammer of an introduction to micro - it will sort students based on technical skills rather than creativity (because most attrition does occur in the first year). It also sends the message that technical skills are of primary importance, which is not, in my opinion, what economics should be about. Technical skills should be there as an aid to solve complex models, and to make sure there are no mistakes in the theoretical implications of said models. If such skills are indeed the most important thing, then perhaps a math PhD program would be more appropriate.
B00AWTTUHI|5|Olivia has crafted a masterpiece with the second half of this epic. While never forgetting that he was in service to the story, Oliva clarified muddy plot points and streamlined Miller's work while remaining true to the sequence of the story STEP FOR STEP. The voice acting was superb, with Weller's weary, resonant baritone serving well in the place of iconic Kevin Conroy.<br /><br />This two-part feature has become my benchmark for animated interpretation of graphic novels, and has my highest recommendation.
B005LAIHPY|5|My husband (for whom I purchased this title) was engrossed from the first moment.  Definitely not a &#34;Chick Flick&#34;, but good fun for any fan of the old-time &#34;Battleship&#34; inter-active board game or WW II buffs seeking a feel-good tale.

055380684X|3|The title perked my interest and since I had read several other text dealing with deliberate practice, I expected great things.  Unfortunately, I feel that Coyle promised much, but failed to deliver anything of significant applicalbe value.  He broached the concept of myelin wrapping in relation to increased performance, etc.  He then proceeded to use an \\"examples\\" of hot beds of training; however, the attempted tie in with performance became anecdotal.  I did not except a \\"how to do book\\", but I did expect valid insights in the process of talent development -- Basically, Coyle fell well short of proving anything of value.  On the positive side, the book was well written even if it circular in its content.
B00004WGY9|1|... but it just isn't very good. Rowland's self-indulgent singing style is too grating for their strong horn section to cover up. He's all over the friggin' map. The song writing is mostly forgettable. I have to say I can't understand why a few people love this album so much. It's such a far cry from the band's inspirations (per the liner notes) - the 1960's soul greats in America. I actually like their/his next album, Too Rye Aye, but this was disappointing. If you want UK soul go for Van Morrison.
B00NAZ221C|5|Gripping and delightful with wonderfully real characters. An awesome combination of a thriller and a sexy love story. This is the first time in years I finish reading a book in one day. I could not put it out of my hand. Goldberg keeps the tension high throughout the book. I laughed, cried and was thrilled. A real page turner.
B00C8S9VKM|5|As this is the year of my birth, and I remember a lot of things recorded here, plus so much of which my parents told me, this book is of considerable interest to me and my children.  Thanks for putting them all together.
B00006LSM3|5|Just wanted to say that George's final album is fantastic and classic George.  All the tracks sound reminiscent of Traveling Wildbury's and Cloud 9 tracks.  Marwa Blues, a nice little slide guitar jam/intrumental provoked some Beatle riffs and Any Road is a definite Wildbury's style track.  All in all, it was a fitting finale to George's career.  The tunes range from buoyant and poignant to honest testaments of the trials of life....Thanks for the music George.

B00HY7VU60|5|Great series.  I really enjoyed it.  I thought it was good acting and it has a good plot.  It pretty much follows what history I could find about it on wikipedia so the realism was great.  Great costuming and a little hot stuff laced into it now and  then. I had lots of fun watching it and binge watched like a wildman to see what was going to go down next.
0312932081|5|I havn't read a real novel in a long time. I think this book got me interested in reading again. I don't need to describe the book. Others have already done that. I couldn't put it down, for if I did, I'd be up all  night thinking about it.

1451629184|4|This book was heart-wrenching and at times difficult to read. After reading for an hour or so, I'd have to put it down for a while to absorb and process the horrors this little girl suffered for so many years. Jaycee is to be commended for keeping love in her heart despite being abused and separated from her family all those years.
B00NAWYI1W|5|Love it!
B003EYVXT6|2|This is not a review for the DVD, it is for the movie itself.  The previews for this movie were misleading I thought, making it look like a thriller. This is not a thriller, it is more of a sci-fi drama. At the very end it does turn a little \\"thriller\\"ish - for about 10 minutes.  I found this movie very disturbing. And for everyone who would care to be forewarned, there is a rape scene.  I was not aware of this when I saw the movie. I believe people should be warned of such scenes.    This is not to say the movie is not \\"good,\\" just that I personally did not like it.

B000003BEV|5|In 1967, EVERYBODY went psychedelic: Cream, Pink Floyd, Hendrix, Traffic, the Doors, and all the rest of them, including, yes, the Beatles and the Stones.  <br />So this is not the Stones \\"copying the Beatles\\".  <br />The Stones (led by Brian Jones) wore extravagant multi-colored trans-gender clothes when the Beatles were still in their trite Brian Epstein-imposed uniforms. They were into the ritual music of Jajouka, in the mountains of Morocco, a good 20 years before \\"World music\\" happened.  <br />This album is just an expression of what the Stones were about, and too bad if it does'nt fit the narrow clichéd commercially accepted limits of what's to be thought of as \\"Rolling Stones music\\". <br />Every song here is beautiful: great lyrics, great melodies, great arrangements, great playing and singing. <br />And the overall atmosphere is unique and extremely poetic, a kind of ominous futuristic World Music. <br />This is one of the Stones' 4 album masterpieces, right along \\"Aftermath\\", \\"Begger's Banquet\\" and \\"Let it Bleed\\". <br />(I know I'll get crucified for leaving out \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street\\", but I'll stick to my guns.)
B00005BL2A|4|It would have been easy for DM to put out a surefire hit album, and cater to everyone's expectations.  It would have been easy for them to just cobble together another synth-laden, mopey, dark masterpiece.  But this collection really speaks of musical growth and experimentation.  It incorporates classical elements, jazz, pop, rock, etc.  The most impressive thing to me, however, are the lyrics.  I've always been impressed by DM's lyrics, but for a different reason.  Before, I was impressed by their apparently exhaustive collection of rhyming dictionaries.  Very clever rhymes, very tightly constructed.  I say this as a published poet myself.  But this time around, the lyrics are looser, more casual, utilizing--gasp!--slant rhymes and internal rhymes.  It flows like water.  The effect is very lush, sensual, and confident.  Also, Gahan's voice has done a lot of growing.  The range and emotional display shows strength in vulnerability rather than some of the raw need of some past efforts.<br />The two instrumentals keep me from giving the album 5 stars.  They feel like scraps, afterthoughts.  This is a very small complaint, however.  Overall, the album is very accomplished, sophisticated (&quot;Dead of Night&quot; is a hoot, though), and rich in an almost aquatic way.
B000002B7O|5|Diary Of A Madman along with it's predecessor \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\" are genre defining records that stand the test of time some 23 years after their original releases. Of note: <br /> <br />1] Randy was quoted as not being entirely happy with this record because they were rushed out of the studio to tour America. He felt some giuitar parts were unfinished or not quite where he wanted them to be. <br /> <br />2] In spite of this, I feel that one of Randy's best pieces of work is the outro of the song \\"Tonight\\". While the song itself is a mildly entertaining cut, the work Randy does on the end of it is simply amazing. Put the 'phones on and turn up the volume as the song fades and be amazed and left wanting for the tape to never end... <br /> <br />3] Although it was recorded almost immediately after \\"Blizzard\\", to me the production sounds a little glossier, although I can't put a finger on why. Probably the mix. <br /> <br />4] As others have stated, buy the '95 remasters or the original issue - used. The recent versions re-released by Sharon with Trujillo and Bordin replacing Daisley and Kerslake are nothing short of a greed driven attempt to rewrite history. The insult of this act is pure sacrilege.
B000VNMMQG|4|Ioan Gruffudd gives an invigorating performance as William Wilberforce, the sharp-witted, determined supporter of abolition in Amazing Grace, the true story of one man's struggle against a kingdom. With impressive performances from an equally impressive cast, this epic battle is one fought not with blood and steel, but of intelligent words and cunning linguistics. Brimming with intricate character development, pertinent morals, and thematic gusto, Amazing Grace is a period piece not confined by its period or the piece of history it so masterfully depicts.<br /><br />In 18th century England, William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) fought tirelessly in Parliament to end slavery and the slave trade throughout the British Empire. Amazing Grace chronicles his successes and defeats and also delves deeper into the life of the remarkable idealist and the events that shaped and influenced his extraordinary career. Forced to contend with debilitating illness as well as the ruthlessly powerful and deviously manipulative lords supporting the slave trade, Wilberforce overcame adverse odds and managed to construct a diverse and unexpectedly strong movement for abolition. Comprised of a flashback structure that relates his many tribulations, Amazing Grace also reveals a poignant tale of love, friendship, and the unending efforts that led to his monumental achievements.<br /><br />Based on the true story of William Wilberforce and his endeavors in Parliament to abolish slavery, Amazing Grace utilizes flashbacks to connect the arcing storyline that traverses several years nonsequentially. At once both an engaging courtroom drama and a whimsical love story, the carefully structured film remains assertively paced throughout and the mood is seldom as grim as its subject matter would expectedly afford. Combined with compelling characters and subsequently affecting character development, Amazing Grace boasts a surprisingly epic feel for a film devoid of any gladiators or soldiers dying on the battlefield.<br /><br />Though its themes are powerfully presented, Amazing Grace would not have achieved its pronounced conviction were it not for the overwhelming talent of its cast. Ioan Gruffudd magnificently portrays the brazen speaker with rebellious charm and heartfelt sincerity from his stunning accomplishments to his tragic defeats. Aiding him in his ceaseless crusade are Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Clarkson (Rufus Sewell) who both give strong performances; Pitt as a figurehead working behind the scenes and Clarkson as his resolute right-hand man. Michael Gambon effortlessly scene steals as the cynically droll Lord Fox, ever ready with his sharp tongue and comedically commanding presence. Albert Finney also turns in a bold portrayal of John Newton, the former slave ship captain who wrote the title song and sought forgiveness for his sins. The antagonistic Lord Tarleton (Ciaran Hinds) and Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) add a refined touch of villainy to their characters, creating a far more satisfying conclusion when they finally fall to the band of ingenious heroes. Not a dull performance exists in this graceful drama, and even the rather expected love interest is handled refreshingly by the lovely Romola Garai.<br /><br />Perhaps a bit over sentimental at times, Amazing Grace still captivates with its diverse cast of exceptional talent, often movingly witty dialogue, magnificent recreations of 18th century costumes and sets, and the incredible true story of one man's unceasing quest for justice. Thankfully relinquishing any long-winded speeches, Amazing Grace allows the actions of the dauntless Wilberforce and his followers to do what they do best - speak for themselves.<br /><br />- Joel MassieThough its themes are powerfully presented, Amazing Grace would not have achieved its pronounced conviction were it not for the overwhelming talent of its cast.

B007H51DQG|5|Both seasons are great - I personally like season 2 a bit more than season 1.  Expect the violence to be gritty, gruesome, & unforgiving because the story is about surviving in a world saturated with zombies. Because the meat of the story is about survival, you shouldn't be surprised that there will be a good dose of drama and character building.  I think the show does a great job at depicting each character's internal and emotional struggles.  Finally, it is actually the human species that are anarchists and struggle with co-existing.  The zombies are a peaceful species with an overly active appetite for fresh food.

B00BHNQ5XK|5|This movie was very creepy. I was jumpy from the very begining all the way until the conclusion. I would not let children watch this movie because of the ways people die in the movie. There was a good plot of the movie and some thought was brought into the deaths it not just another thriller movie. I love this movie and highly recommend it for adults and older teens.

B00DYQLEZM|4|I was not very sure if I really wanted this box set or not. I did some research, mainly, what exactly was included here. I already had some of the CDs, so to buy a box set with stuff I already had was not something I was very happy to do. However, the Amazon price was very attractive, so I decided to go ahead and buy it. I paid $100.49 for this, so that meant a couples of bucks for each CD, which is a real bargain.<br /><br />I am not going to spend time discussing here whether the Berliner Philharmoniker is one of the best orchestras in the world or not. It is in my Top 5 list. This is a very personal choice, so this may or may not help you decide to go ahead and get this box set. Unless you have most of these releases already.<br /><br />This may be obvious, but the core of the box set is Herbert von Karajan. A total of 15 CDs are his signature. Among them, Beethoven's 9th (1963), Mahler's 5th (1973, his first Mahler ever, and my favorite one), and Schostakovitch's 10th (1982, magisterial!) are among the best of this box set. You can also find his Bizet's Carmen (highlights), Wagner's Parsifal (highlights), and Mozart Great Mass. The Schoenberg is included, but beware, this does not match the Legendary Recordings editions. There, his Verkl&auml;rte is paired with Pelleas. Here, the original CD is presented, which includes Verkl&auml;rte Nacht, Variations for Orchestra (a must IMHO), and Webern's Passacaglia.<br /><br />After Karajan, you have B&ouml;hm and Abbado. My favorite Abbado here is Prokofiev and Ravel Piano Concertos with Martha Argerich. I have most of Argerich's recordings on EMI and DG, so again, nothing new, but for those who don't know her, or don't have this particular recording, this is perhaps the best interpretations you can listen to. Abbado has done a lot of Mahler, and his 4th (2005) is included here. Also Beethoven's 7th and 8th are included (I believe these are the same ones he published on DVD, which I also own). B&ouml;hm is represented with 3 CDs. Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, Mozart's 40th and 41st, and highlights of his Zauberfl&ouml;te.<br /><br />The rest of the box is very mixed, with recordings as old as Nikisch Beethoven's 5th from 1913 (horrible sound, of course), or Furtw&auml;ngler Beethoven 5th (1926, more horrible sound), to Rattle's Dvorak's biblical Songs (2012, so new, the CD does not even have art cover for it!). In between, Beethoven's Piano Concerto NO. 5 (two: Kempff and Pollini), Beethoven's 9th (two: Karajan and Fricsay), Dvorak's Cello concerto (twice -?!-, but the Rostropovich in my opinion is absolutely essential), Dvorak's 9th (two: Fricsay and, thank you! Kubelik!!!), Bernstein's Mahler No. 9 (Karajan's 9th version of Mahler also included), Boulez's Ravel Bolero, etc. I'd suggest you go to DG's website to read the contents before you purchase, to make sure you like what's included, or to double check your collection and see if you already have most of this.<br /><br />The box is nicely packaged, and the CDs are contained in cardboard sleeves. Most of them come with the original art work, except for CD #50, and the first 10. A libretto is included, but unlike other reviewers have noted, I don't find it to be exemplary at all. It's 96 pages long, and it comes with `A word of greeting from the Berliner Philharmoniker,' `The edition of the century.' `The Berliner Philharmoniker and DG: A creative partnership of 100 years.' These texts are in English, German, and Japanese. The booklet explains the way this selection was done, which was by asking patrons of the orchestra to decide which releases to include. I find this to be a very original way to approach a box set like this, although the results will not be satisfactory for some. The booklet is completed with the track lists of all CDs, and a final index by composers (39 composers in total!).<br /><br />Pros: Price. It includes some of the greatest classical recordings of all time (although you probably have them...).<br />Cons:The few operas represented are only highlights. Although understandable in a box set, it would have been better just to not include them at all, or include two full operas (I'd say Wagner's Parsifal by Karajan, and Mozart's Magic Flute by B&ouml;hm). A lot of repeated works. You may have many of this releases already.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great collection of excellent classical music recordings by one of the greatest orchestras of all time. This box set will be out of the market soon, and therefore, hard or impossible to find. If you like the Berliner Philharmoniker, Karajan, or just classical music in general, get it while it is available, especially at the $100 price. You may want to pass it if you have most of the albums here, though. Not essential, but highly recommendable. Thus, 4 stars. Thank you for reading.The few operas represented are only highlights.

6304493681|4|This is a good movie, in the same vein as Blade Runner. Nice visuals and fully realized world, though the plot is a but convulted. A great take in Masamune Shirow's manga. On a side note: I resent people who say hardcore  anime fans might not like this because there is no sex or gratuitous  violence, as if to say anime has those negative conotations. Any real fan  would know anime is like any other art form, incorporating all types of  genre's that the pen ( and pixel ) can offer. Gundam, Blue Submarine No. 6  , Escaflowne, Ranma 1/2 etc. prove my point.
0061928356|5|I learned of this book from a &#34;Daily Deal&#34; and would have bought it but since it was also in the &#34;lending library&#34; i decided to borrow it.  I would have gladly paid for it tho.  I really enjoyed the story  The author did speed through a lot of stuff because the book is spanning over 20 years but I got the gist of how everyone felt and why they felt that way and I think this book will stay with me unlike many other books I have read.  If adoption stories (from all different perspectives) appeal to you or you are interested in India then u may get more enjoyment out of this book  If you are looking for more indepth stuff about these things you may be disappointed.  The adoption aspect is what appealed to me and I do like reading about other cultures  I really loved this book<br /><br />***Spoilers****<br /><br />Yes, some characters did annoy me  I didnt like Somer much and after awhile I groaned on her parts but she did come around at the end and work out her feelings. Yes, I would have expected her to be more open-minded to her husband and daughter's culture  given where she was from. But, you can't help the way you feel sometimes.  You may think you are open-minded until you are forced to face something new and foreign to you.  She had to work out her feelings as did Asha.<br /><br />I could understand how Asha felt too being different and not feeling like she belonged.  A lot of kids not raised by biological parents feel that way they want to find some truth to themselves.  Maybe not necessarily meeting biological family or having a relationship but just KNOWING things is enough  I was disappointed she didnt get to meet Kavita and Jasu and really know why her mother did what she did and how she literally did save her life<br /><br />i enjoyed Kavita's story the most.  She really sacrificed a lot for her family and never did forget her first children especially the one she was able to name Usha.  I was disappointed her and Jasu never met Usha  but at least she knew she did the right thing and her baby did have a good life.  The book could have went anther route and had the perfect ending with having Asha meet her mom or even an miraculous meeting of them being at temple or on the same train and meeting that way but they didnt<br /><br />Jasu also had to face his &#34;truth&#34; of what happened to his first daughter and how he could have lost second one too if not for what his wife. He also knows that having than son he wanted so bad didnt turn out so great either.

B002RWKSII|5|Many years ago John Lennon said that the most influential musician of his generation was Brian Wilson. This great collection is proof he may have been right.    \\"I Loves You, Porgy\\" is sensational.     There isn't a doubt in my mind that the Gershwins would love this clever take on some of their best work.

B0044IJ1S6|5|Art (as they say) is subjective and in the case of Tour Of The Universe - Live In Barcelona or even Depeche Mode for that matter you either get the magic or you sadly don't and those who do, and or own this 2 disc set are the lucky ones.    If you were one of the estimated 2.7 million fortunate who managed to catch the boys from Basildon live on this tour as I did from the 13th row in Anaheim you can attest to the fact that Depeche live are more of a revival meeting than a rock concert and what director Russell Thomas has managed to capture in this the Mode's first glorious Blu-ray outing borders on the miraculous.  Unlike Touring the Angel live in Milan which was a seemingly head-spinning attempt to capture the hearts and eyes of A.D.D./MTV addicts everywhere, TOTU is tasteful, thoughtful  and a testament to a director who understands \\"it's about the performance and the music stupid\\" as he approaches the task with the TLC of a man (not unlike long-time Depeche creative genius Anton Corbijn) who clearly knows that the best concert films make you feel like you were there or are able to take you back to the 13th row as this production does brilliantly.    With that said however anyone who knows anything about Depeche Mode's Devotee's knows if you put 10 of them in a room together they'll all find something different to winge about (which may be part of their charm).  Alright so this might not be the earth shaking Devotional, 101, One Night in Paris or as \\"dark\\" as some might like but it's hardly a liability and part of what makes it great.  TOTU showcases a band that even after 30 years continues to surprise us, evolve and mature despite some grumbling by well-meaning fans comfortably stuck somewhere between Black Celebration and Songs of Faith and Devotion.  Perhaps no other moment illustrates Depeche's interpersonal growth more than the fact that Dave (Gahan) goes topless only once in the closing moments of Never Let Me Down Again and returns for the encore in a black tank-top, hey man, as he put it in the bonus features \\"I'm pushing 50\\" so get over it, that's not to say however that he still doesn't have the swagger of a sex crazed snake because he's dripping in charisma (damn him), he's just thrown a sprinkle of modesty into the mix.    Throughout this Olympian  performance it's evident that Depeche, although always cognizant of their fans' needs, is on a never ending journey to also satisfy their own creative. personal and spiritual cravings and in doing so appear relaxed, energized and reveling in the liberation it brings, nowhere is this more evident than in the closing moments of the concert (SPOILER ALERT) where an obvious miscue during Waiting for the Night between Dave and Martin (Gore) becomes a picture perfect moment of how far these two performers and friends have come together personally and professionally.  Kudos to the band for being grown up enough not to fix this perfectly sweet moment in editing.  There's also a spontaneous bit where Dave turns to Martin after a brilliant guitar performance and shoots him a look as if to say \\"Holy s#@t man, that was amazing!\\" Priceless.  Dave loves his mate Mart and unabashedly basks in the wondrous gifts of Martin L. Gore, it's one of the reasons this team still works and why we love 'em.    The 21 song set includes the usual Mode barn-burning suspects and introspective masterpieces as well as 5 tracks from Sounds of the Universe which is fair considering they were on the road promoting their new record, they're hardly clunkers and Wrong will certainly find a permanent place in future set lists.    One minor gripe is that they couldn't find some way to simply included the 5 bonus live tracks, including the soaring One Caress or new comer Miles Away/The Truth Is, with it's killer mind grinding front and center guitar riff into the program as it's a bit of a drag to watch these great performances one at a time and not in sequence, in my book they would have only enhanced the overall experience.      The 5.1 sound is crystal clear and the mix exceptional befitting the outstanding vocal and instrumental performances.  The HD visuals are razor sharp.  The creative but tasteful camera work is brilliant and at times breathtaking although occasionally straining to see the band through a sea of cell phones and cameras brought back nightmarish flashbacks from my Mode  encounter at the Honda Center.  It's nice the band gives the fans that sort of photo/video freedom but when you drop that kind of coin on a decent seat the last thing you want to do is watch the show through cell phone screens, but I digress.    The extra's on Disc 2 are hardly filler as you're treated to a very candid and extremely well produced \\"making of\\".  What is immediately evident in this compelling glimpse behind the TOTU scenes is the bands lack of pretense, they have clearly grown up and the rose colored glasses have been packed away.  And although each member of the band and management team address the personal and health crisis' that befell the unit they're introspective and honest without self-aggrandizement and telling \\"too much\\".  Bonus material also includes two great rehearsal tracks Walking in My Shoes and Wrong, the production videos from the tour as well as the 4 promotional clips for the Sounds of the Universe singles Wrong, Peace, Fragile Tension and the ill advised and stomach turning video for Hole to Feed, which in my humble estimation is the absolute low point in the bands otherwise unrivaled visual repertoire, so if you have a hair-trigger gag reflex you've been warned!    What is truly remarkable about TOTU is that is was wildly successful without a half-dozen singles on the charts, publicity generating scandals or hype.  Tour of the Universe is a testament to Depeche Mode's artistic depth, remarkable talent, dedication, tenacity and honesty; their ever-suffering but eternally loyal fans and the unseen forces that must certainly play a significant roll in shaping and expanding the Depeche Mode Universe.

1601257155|5|It's rare I give anything a five star review, but Unchained is worth it.<br /><br />This has been called &#34;Unearthed Arcana&#34; for Pathfinder.  It isn't.  It fixes some classes (Summoner, I'm looking at you) simplifies some others (Barbarian) and unifies the theme of others (Rogues are back to skill monkey supreme, Monks are more flexible and can be build unified (and are more complex as a result)<br /><br />The gem for me is the Variant Multiclassing (VMC).  Basically you swap out some feats for class abilities from another class.  Want to make a 'scholar fighter'? VMC into bard for bardic knowledge and eventually a versatile performance (with free retraining!)  Want a rogue with a sidekick? VMC with wizard or summoner.<br /><br />The background skills and skill clusters can address an often heard complaint, unskilled PCs.  While I see it as a feature, not a bug, the alternate skill systems can address that issue for those who don't like the skill system.<br /><br />An excellent book for the experienced Pathfinder.

B004HD61KE|1|I think the book skipped around too much making it hard to tell who was who.  I will read it again this fall and it might appeal to me more.  You know when the air is cool and crisp and a warm blanket makes you feel like snuggling in.
B004SRWW0C|2|What's the whole fuss about this mediocre app ? It's like any other normal FREE file manager for Android, but it's paid. ES File Explorer is way better looking, with even more features and it's free. Yea, anyway,,, I don't hate this app, but for sure it doesn't worth the fuss it has generated.
B001RTP3YQ|5|I recently heard the song #34;TOWER OF SONG\\" on FM radio.  That's what prompted me to buy this CD.  LEONARD COHEN is a national treasure, U.S., U.K., or Canada. The CD recording process is fabulous. The song list is perfect. The musicians play with HEART and SOUL. Thank you, LEONARD COHEN.
B005ZMUQCK|5|This is a favorite for my 3 yr old and myself! I don't mind it when he wants to watch this one over and over.
6300208591|5|I remember seeing this movie when it first came out, in fact it was the first movie I went to see more than once. For some reason it resonated with me then as much as now. I recently watched it again, and found the scene at Steiner's apartment to be quite fascinating.  Here we have a man who is hemmed in by the walls of society, and the way for him to experience nature is by making audo tapes of the sounds of rain, storms,and other facets of creation. Then he can play them back in the safety of his apartment, apparently unable to just enjoy the outdoors in all its beauty. He is afraid of the future, and can't break away from society and its walls.  Perhaps that is why he is attracted to Marcello's character, who just floats freely about, apparently without a worry.
034580404X|5|This book series was not purchased for me to read, but for my wife.  She is stuck on the twilight universe and is currently reading the books, so when i told her this series started off as fan fiction she was intrigued.  I was as well given the hype that was being created and since my wife also like Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty books i figured she would want to try these books out.  So far she is really happy and is working on the 2nd book now.

B008KOTNVA|4|Everything about this kit is fantastic, except the plastic tray. Unfortunately, the plastic tray doesn't hold the driver nor bit blocks in place particularly well so you've got to be a bit careful opening it up or the components come tumbling out. Which is too bad because the rest of the kit is awesome!

0060934700|5|Neil Gaiman is quickly becoming one of the world's most recognized and revered authors, and with good reason. His stories are fantastical, but not to the point that they are merely escapist enteratinment. When one reads a work by Gaiman, they come back into the real world and look at it differently, through smoke tinted glasses if you will. <br /> Every story in here is good, but some are better than others. <br /> -&quot;Chivalry&quot; is, as Gaiman himself says, a very friendly story. It's very funny and much lighter than his other works. <br /> -&quot;Tastings&quot; is not so much fantasy as it is eroticism, but it's different than what you would expect. There is more to this story than sex. <br /> -&quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot; is a very disturbing take on the Snow White mythology. A very chilling read that makes you see the Disney film in new light. <br /> -&quot;Murder Mysteries&quot; is one the best short stories ever written. Not only is it intricately plotted, but it also has a resonating message that anyone could find inspiration in, and if not inspiration then despair. <br /> -&quot;The Price&quot; is my personal favorite along with &quot;Murder Mysteries&quot;. It takes a whole new spin on the good vs. evil motif, has a twist that will throw you for a loop, and really makes you appreciate things you might perceive as normal, and in some cases annoying. <br /> -&quot;The Wedding Present&quot;, the story Gaiman hides in the introduction, is chilling and thought provoking. My next favorite of the collection. <br /> This is a great book and should be on the shelf of everybody who loves a good read.
B000089RVX|5|This band rocks!  The vocals are haunting, drawing the listener further and further into the lyrics.  I find that the intensity of this music keeps me interested after repeated playings.  I tend to like &quot;softer&quot; music most of the time, but this one is different.  I keep going putting that cd back into the player, the one I wear when I go for a walk and need to think.  These people are musicians and poets.
B00HB8UWCU|5|Really wasn't sure what to expect when two over the hill actors collide in a action flick but using James Caviezel as the straight man foil arny and stallone pull it off. Alternately comedic and action packed it never slows down keeping the punch and the timing perfectly.
B000002KB8|5|As other reviewers have said, this C.D. is not groundbreaking. It's much more than that. It's more like earth-shattering. Led Zeppelin may have released a heavy rock album before Black Sabbath, but I truly believe Sabbath's self-entitled debut was the first-ever real metal album.<br /><br />This album was the start of a great career-a career which influenced a countless number of bands; most hard rock groups, including everyone from Smashing Pumpkins to Slipknot, have cited Black Sabbath as an influence.<br /><br />The first ever Black Sabbath song recorded was, well, \\"Black Sabbath.\\" This song (and this album) begins with the sound of a thunderstorm. The instruments eventually begin and the guitars play slow riffs (making it sort of sound like a later Sabbath tune, \\"War Pigs\\"). The lyrics (like \\"Oh no, please God help me\\") help make this song's theme quite dark and brooding. The beat eventually speeds up, however, around the 4:45 mark.<br />\\"The Wizard\\" begins with a solo from an instrument that sounds like a harmonica. The bobbing guitars and drums kick in, and make the rhythm worthy of a toe-tapping, but the harmonica reappears later in the song.<br />Track three, \\"Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B.,\\" has four parts to it. \\"Bassically\\" has a bass solo by Geezer Butler, and \\"N.I.B.\\" sounds like a song from \\"Paranoid.\\" Its groovy riff, a catchy drum beat, and chants of \\"Oh yeah!\\" make it, possibly, the catchiest moment on the album.<br />\\"Wicked World\\" has more catchy, wailing guitar noise and some fast drumming.<br />And, finally, \\"A Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning\\" begins with soft, almost twangy strumming. Then there is some heavy double bass drumming and some humming bass notes, but guitarist Tony Iommi dominates the show, with wild, wailing, looping guitar solos.<br /><br />Even though I don't think this is Black Sabbath's best, or \\"definitive,\\" album (\\"Paranoid\\" owns that title), this is still a must own for all hard rock and heavy metal collections; it's definitely essential listening for all metalheads. And even if you don't like Black Sabbath (for some odd reason), you've at least got to appreciate what they've done for heavy metal, and what they've done for music in general.<br /><br />What are you still doing reading this review? Go listen to the C.D.! If you don't own it, it's never too late to have a complete heavy metal collection!l listening for all metalheads.

0060254920|5|I never read this book as a child, and was always told that I was deprived.I finally buckled down and read it.<br /><br />I only wish that my parents had bought me this book as a child. I can only imagine where my imagination would have taken me with story like this. My heart was warmed by the sheer innocence of Max and how he could imagine his room as forest and escape to it. I wish that I would have experienced this book as a child, because I was definitely the child that imagined herself as a princess in a far away land.<br /><br />The illustrations are too good for words. They can express so many different events in each one. I love how as long as Max imagined it to happen, it happened.<br /><br />I am so glad that I got to experience this book as an adult and I will make sure that it will onmy child's bookshelf for when he/she learns to read, needs a way to escape :-)

B00APUYN0I|5|HILARIOUS MOVIE!!!
6301008944|5|This movie is an un-appreciated classic!  It's got everything...even a 'bald Chinese woman with no pants on!'...well, we don't actually SEE her,  but still... I believe the true show-stealer is Anthony Rapp, who play's  Brad's Playboy-toting best friend Darryl. It was interesting to see Rapp,  who I have seen in movies 'Road Trip' and 'Dazed and Confused', and on  Broadway in RENT, at about 15. All in all, this movie should be in every  family's video collection, and it should be re-released on VHS so i can  replace my worn copy!

0689865384|4|Uglies by Scott Westerfield was an enjoyable book. I agree that it was a little predictable at times, and I had trouble connecting to some of the characters, but all in all I loved this book. <br /> <br />The author worked hard to create a subtle blend of science fiction and reality, and left a lot to the imagination in the way of what actually happened to our civilization, the \\"Rusties\\".  <br /> <br />While some of the \\"futuristic\\" lingo and lifestyles got a little irritating at times, I loved the two heroines of the tale, Shay and Tally. They are startlingly real and as independant as any teenage girl who wants a different life. Their search for \\"the truth\\" if you'll take the cliche, leads them somewhere you might not expect. <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, and want to see what will come next in this fantastic and sometimes frightening world of the future.

I just get the feeling with some songs that  the symphony is just extra ... and like I don't know whether that is a good  or bad thing ... sometimes, the symphony really captures the vibe of the  songs real well ... but like to me, for most of the 2 hour set ... the  symphony is extra ... the only thing I can compare it to is how some songs  on Justice didn't need to be longer than 5 mins ... not extra in a bad way  ... but like extra in a way where you go ... hmmm am i missing the pointThe  boys played a real real tight live set ... and if you have bought live sets  from them whether authorized or booted ... you know that it's more high  wire act rather than tight lock step precision at times ... the orchestra  played in a way that didn't make them seem soft or inarticulate ... yet i  sit here vaguely dissatisfied at my attempts to get myself to say ... hey  this was really awesome ... hey this was really good as a live album ...  but like was the extra really necessary ... i haven't figured that out for  myself ... so 3 stars for the tight performance by the band ... 1/2 star  for the new stuff before the new disk next year (hopefully) ... 1/2 star  for attempting it ... but beware that you don't suffer the fate of myself,  metallifans --- i think the whole idea was to bang the head that doesn't  ... not scratch the head ... oh well

B00461AIXI|5|I'd never heard of Bruno until I saw him perform on SNL a few month ago. I was immediately taken by his looks, style and the two songs he sang (\\"Just the Way You Are\\" and \\"Grenade\\"). I bought this CD immediately and absolutely loved it! I was struck by how many different aspects of his personality the songs reveal (assuming they're at least somewhat autobiographical). In \\"Grenade\\" he's a bitter spurned lover, in \\"Just the Way You Are\\" he's an infatuated youth, in \\"Our First Time\\" he's a tentative, romantic lover, in \\"Runaway Baby\\" he's a cynical star who can have any girl he wants and throws them aside nightly. \\"The Lazy Song\\" makes me smile every time I hear it; it's an amusing, sexy take on lollygagging. The rest of the songs are equally good; there really isn't a klunker on the whole album. Bruno's voice is prolific and endearing; he may bring to mind Michael Jackson at times but his falsetto flourishes seem less artificial then Michael's. I can't wait for his next album.

B000O8OTNC|4|A sharpener in you pocket as well as your kitchen bench , this versatile tool is something everyone one should have. It has three sharpening modes , two draw notches and a fold out diamond steel, ideal for sharpening serrated edges and similar irregular shaped blades. You can also use it to sharpen blades \\" butcher's style \\" .    The first of the draw notches has two carbide cutters intersecting as a \\"V\\" at the bottom . Drawing your knife though this sets the angle of the edge , eliminates nicks and produces a sharp cutting edge . The second draw notch is made of ceramic cutters arranged in a similar way and these HONE  the knife edge to perfection, (not found on supermarket sharpeners).     I would recommend this tool for people looking for a good quality, yet cheap , sharpening system .

B00000JLWW|4|James cameron's Titanic is everything you would want in a movie, and is the most successful movie ever, but it could have easily been the best film ever, save one downer. The film opens in modern day, with some scientists going down to the Titanic wreckage to find some treasure. They show the foul-mouthed scientists finding a drawing down there, then bringing in an ancient woman who the picture is of. The woman, of course, is Rose, a survivor of the legendary shipwreck. Then Rose proceeds to tell them of how the picture was drawn, and we are transported to the 1912 world of the greatest epic ever. Now, if the movie had opened where the flashback had opened, this would easily be the greatest film ever. However, the first thirty minutes showing modern day are spoiling, and it takes away a lot of the epic grandeur. If the film had closed with Rose arriving in new York in the pouring rain, then that would be perfect. But then, after the flashback is over, Cameron shows us the old woman dreaming and throwing jewels into the ocean..what? Anyway, if the modern-day scenes were excluded, Titanic would be king of all movies. But because these scenes were added, i knocked a star off my review rating, and other movies surpass it in quality. Also, i thought the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio was a bad move, and if i had been Cameron, i would have cast somebody like Antonio Banderas.
1451627297|5|\\"Life turns on a dime.\\"  Wow...just...wow.  I went into 11/22/63 expecting to like it (Stephen King always delivers for me.)  But, this was really one of my favorite books in recent memory.<br /><br />Jake Epping is a teacher in Maine who is shown a bubble in time by one of his friendly acquaintances, Al.  Al is basically trying to recruit Jake to go back in time to stop Kennedy's assassination.  His belief is that this will have a ripple effect that saves millions of lives (including Martin Luther King, Jr., Bobby Kennedy and many American soldiers in Vietnam.)  If you step through this bubble, it always takes you to the same point in time in 1958.  Every time you go back, it's a complete reset.  Jake eventually decides to do this - live there from 1958-1963 and save Kennedy (and others along the way).<br /><br />As you can imagine, it's not simple.  The butterfly effect is mentioned throughout the novel - if you change one thing in history it can have many unintended consequences.  Both good and bad.<br /><br />It's always interesting to think about things in history or even in your own life that you might want to change.  But, we really don't know that these changes would make anything better.  It could mean that someone you love ends up dying or it could alter the course of world history.  Plus, the past is obdurate and doesn't want to be changed.<br /><br />11/22/63 gives you a roller coaster ride of emotions while talking about American history and human nature.  I simply loved it.  5/5 stars and highly recommended.
B000929AJQ|4|It's now officially been 1 week since \\"With Teeth\\" was released and I picked up my copy.  I've waited to review this one so I could allow it some time to sink in and get a more accurate perception of it.  After waiting nearly 6 years for another NIN album, I am satisfied with the results.  However, I think in the long-run when Trent Reznor is officially done with Nine Inch Nails, I don't think this will be one of the stand-out albums.  Since I'm a die-hard NIN fan, it would be easy for me to say...\\"everything Trent touches is gold, I give it 5 stars...\\".  Instead, I'm going to review this CD not as a NIN fan, but according to my general taste in music.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"All The Love In The World,\\" which is a very quiet, yet bass-driven song.  In fact, the majority of the song, you hear piano, bass, and Trent's whispering.  Considering how quiet and suttle the song is, you'll find it stuck in your head after a couple listens.  Very good song, but there are better things to come.<br /><br />Next is \\"You Know What You Are,\\" and it's probably one of only two songs on this CD that I would call heavy.  It has a fast drum-beat with a very aggressive chorus involving loud guitar and creepy piano.  It's probably as close as the album gets to sounding like \\"Downward Spiral\\".<br /><br />The third song is called \\"The Collector.\\"  This one didn't stand out for me at first, but the more I listen to it, the more I like it. (As is the case with the whole album.)<br /><br />The fourth song is the album's first single, \\"The Hand That Feeds.\\" If you're reading this review, you've probably heard it by now.  I absolutely love this song...I think it's one of the catchiest songs Trent has ever written, even if it is a bit pop-sounding.  As good as this song is, it's not a good representation of the rest of the album's sound.  Nothing else on \\"With Teeth\\" sounds similar to it, or has that sort of song structure.  Depending on your out-look, this could be good or bad, but it doesn't bother me either way.<br /><br />Next is \\"Love Is Not Enough\\"...another song I didn't think much of at first, but grew on me. It's kinda slow, yet angry.<br /><br />\\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" is another song that ended up growing on me quite a bit.  At first I thought the chorus was too repetitive, but now it's stuck in my head.  The song sounds a lot like something from the \\"Fragile\\" album, so much in fact, I wouldn't doubt it was written at that time. The guitar solo even sounds similar to the solo on \\"The Fragile\\" (the song).<br /><br />Track 7 is the title track, \\"With Teeth.\\" Although it's kinda weird, I like it a lot. Again, the guitar sounds similar to \\"Fragile\\"-era stuff.<br /><br />\\"Only\\" is penned to be the album's next single. This one has grown on me a lot.  The mood is similar to that of \\"Into The Void\\"...angsty yet upbeat.  There's a combination of piano and very techno sounding keyboards, while Trent does some singing similar to that of \\"Down In It\\".<br /><br />\\"Getting Smaller\\" is the other song on the album that I would call heavy. It's kinda hard to describe, try the sound sample to get an idea.<br /><br />Track 10 is \\"Sunspots\\" and is one of my favorites on the album. It's just very experimental with some very cool sounds. Again, kinda hard to describe.<br /><br />\\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" starts off sounding very rough.  The drums are static sounding, and the vocals sounding like they were recorded on a cassette player in someone's garage. The bass is very in-your-face, and you can clearly tell that it's Jeordie White. If anyone ever saw Marilyn Manson in concert, you could always recognize Jeordie's (Twiggy's) signature sound, which is a very rattling, low bass sound. It's recognizable on a few other songs. Anyway, the chorus sounds a little less raw, and gets stuck in your head easily.<br /><br />\\"Beside You In Time\\" was the song you may have heard in the \\"With Teeth\\" teaser trailer.  Even though this track doesn't go in many directions, I really like it. It just starts off simple and gradually builds to a big climax. I think it would have been better to open the CD with this song.<br /><br />The final song, \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is one of Trent's absolute best writings. It's very sad, and measures up to past tunes such as \\"Hurt\\" or \\"The Great Below\\".  There's some electronic noises going on, but it's mostly a sad piano melody with Trent's muffled singing, which clears up later in the song.  The lyrics are excellent!<br /><br />All in all, I am very pleased with how \\"With Teeth\\" turned out. Again, I don't think it'll be one of Trent's most defining musical moments, but if you've enjoying everything he's done so far, then this is for you. If you're just looking to hear the heavy anthems like \\"Wish\\" or \\"Star****ers\\" then you'll probably be let down.  For me, it'll probably still be one of the best (if not the best) album of 2005.  If I had to compare this album to one of his past efforts, I'd say \\"The Fragile\\", even though it's very different. There is a lot less stringed instruments this time, and the guitar plays a much smaller role. It's much more about the bass and drums. Anyway, big NIN fans will like this, metal-heads probably won't. Either way, I can't urge you enough to keep listening to this CD. On my first 2 listens, I was like, \\"....eh.\\" But now I'm addicted to it and listen to it every day. It grows on you a lot, so just keep listening!!! To me, it's a brilliant piece and I'm glad to finally have it in my hands.ack doesn't go in many directions, I really like it.

055380684X|5|With 34 reviews already written for this book I can only justify writing another if I think I have something to say that hasn't been said by other reviewers.<br /><br />I have spent most of my adult life teaching, in universities and in industry. Through it all I have always sought better ways to perform the task of getting a concept or a bit of understanding from my head into that of someone else. And I've also often struggled with getting it into my own head, and many times I have struggled with getting from the novice stage to one of mastery of a concept or skill.<br /><br />Bear with me as I attempt to set the stage for your understanding what I am trying to say. Being a scientist I'll approach the topic from the viewpoint of a scientist. In science research, or the organization of existing research, is usually done either to (a) support (i.e. to \\"prove\\") a hypothesis or (b) to disprove a hypothesis. Coyle's approach in \\"The Talent Code\\" is the former - he is assembling evidence in an attempt to prove that myelin is the \\"key\\" to developing talent. That's fine, but what I am most interested in is that he has assembled a large amount of data concerning development of talent. We don't have to accept his hypothesis to make use of his data.<br /><br />The myelin sheath effectively makes some neuronal connections more effective than others; that is undeniable. Thus it is unarguably an important factor in speed of transmission. That, along with details of the chemistry of neurotransmitters, neuronal connections, the function of glial cells, and an infinitude of factors unknown collectively make up the \\"key\\" to developing talent.<br /><br />I'm heading toward a strong recommendation of this book. How can I get there when I've just buried the author's theory, the basis for the book, in a pile of other factors that I consider to be of potentially equal or greater importance? The answer is simple. Coyle has assembled a sequence of steps that he argues does lead to maximization of talent. And he backs up that assemblage of steps with enough examples to leave little doubt about the general \\"correctness\\" of his argument. Whether one accepts or rejects Coyle's explanation the steps that he argues leads to talent development clearly work.<br /><br />Who will benefit from reading this book, and why? If you are a teacher or a learner you can benefit greatly in the direct application of his observations to your daily work. If you want or need to develop a talent in yourself Coyle gives a blueprint for how to do that. If you are interested in the \\"myelin viewpoint\\" you'll get a reasonably complete view of that. If you want to know the \\"answer\\" to the question of the biology/chemistry of how talent is developed, this isn't the place to find it though you'll see one such hypothesis developed in some detail.<br /><br />In short, I recommend reading the book with the mindset that if you follow the prescription you'll get the desired results. If he's correct in that myelin is the magic ingredient so be it. If he's wrong, you'll still have the results, and that's nothing to sneeze at.

1416550550|5|This book was a winter weekend book for me. I did my chores and hunkered down with it on a friday afternoon and reluctantly faced the real world again on Monday morning. I often do that, but usually have regrets/guilt over all that I ignored.  Definitely not with this book though.<br /><br />It has remained in my thoughts though I finished it quite a while ago. And though the ending was very satisfying (no loose ends), I was sad to get there because I cared so much for the characters. Well, a couple of them. That brother was pretty sick.

B007H9B6KA|4|Garbage is back.<br />But...ARE they back?<br />Obviously, this is their new album.<br />But...IS IT...?<br />Let's find out.<br /><br />Automatic Systematic Habit - First things first, you are Garbage. You blazed a trail in the 90's by, not so much creating the hot-female-fronted-dark-pop-rock-band-with-some-electronics-thrown-in-there, but certainly by perfecting it and carving a niche for yourselves in pop culture.<br />You are not Britney Spears or Madonna or some other crappy/bland product that needs autotune and nastee hott tekno beatz to get people's attention...as you've done with \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\".<br />You're better than that.<br />Now that we've agreed on that, we can focus on the fact that it is a very brave song. For this to be the first track on their first album in seven years is very courageous. It shows evolution of sound and concept and that is always exciting to see.<br />Just wish the song was better.<br /><br />Big Bright World - Ah, here we are. I'm beginning to understand why everyone who heard this album said it sounded like the first one: because it's great. This is the kind of track that made Garbage stand out, that grabbed the mainstream's attention. It's not dark and smoky and sexy like some of their other stuff, it's bright and open and hopeful, which is just as welcomed as the former. Love the sound of this. It would go perfectly with a fan made Doctor Who music video.<br /><br />Blood For Poppies - A bit radio-y for my taste; not bad, just a bit...soft, I suppose. There is some new ground tread on here which is always nice.<br /><br />Control - Harmonica is a bit weird... Something about it reminds me of the feel of Use Your Illusion II. Interesting, but not really great. Oh and that singing-into-a-fan vocal effect towards the end...yikes.<br /><br />Not Your Kind Of People - Starts off kind of weak. Remains weak. On the whole a pretty forgettable song. I thought this would be a lot more aggressive and confrontational basedon its title. But it's more sad and proud; a low energy anthem for outsiders. A lot of this album seems dedicated to said outsiders.<br /><br />Felt - This feels like a b-side. A really good b-side. Not bad at all, just a bit incomplete maybe. Love the guitar and chords. Shirley's...yodeling at the end is an odd choice...<br /><br />I Hate Love - Excellent, rock-solid 90's Garbage. Total call back to what made them great. I hope this is the next single. At times it has the feel of (another) Bond theme. And the ending? \\"And then your love dies\\"? Dark.<br /><br />Sugar - Really dig this one. Don't know if anything Shirley Manson does could ever be as sensual as \\"Supervixen\\", but this comes in a close second (or third if you count \\"#1 Crush\\"). Her sultry little husk is still intact after seven years of disuse. Or, to put all this into one word: rowr. Although, much like with Lykke Li, I have trouble believing that either of these talented, gorgeous, artistic women really has problems finding men to love them.<br /><br />Battle In Me - Very strong, very forceful track. I really enjoy the guitar/drum breakdown at the chorus. Not sure why this was the first UK single and America got the far less interesting \\"Blood For Poppies\\". Then again, all these record companies are reaching senility and making less sense, so...I guess that explains it? Either way: great song.<br /><br />Man On A Wire - Kind of sounds like Peaches. This brings up an interesting aspect of Garbage's music. More often than not, it isn't good Garbage songs versus bad Garbage songs, it's super catchy and well written radio playable Garbage songs versus skippable Garbage songs. I can't really think of an out and out bad Garbage song, just a bunch that I'd rather not listen to in favor of a different, better Garbage song. The delineation is clearest, I feel, on their second album Version 2.0. There are two types of songs on that album: the radio singles and those that are not radio singles. The former just have that perfect mix of hooks and melody and everything else that makes a song great and super replayable, and the latter just feels a bit...wrong. It isn't really something I can point out, just this abstract feeling of \\"these are better than those\\". All this to say: \\"Man On A Wire\\" is skippable. For me at least.<br /><br />Beloved Freak - A disclaimer: I'm a huge Eels fan, and, as the title reminds me of \\"Beautiful Freak\\", the two songs will always be compared in my mind and the Garbage song will always be found lacking. Sorry guys. Also, I don't really like the song a whole lot. It's too smaltzy and saccharine. \\"You're not alone, you're great, you're special, let your light shine...\\". It all just sounds like a grade school teacher consoling a kid that all the other kids are calling a weirdo because he like Magic cards instead of baseball cards or plays D&D or wears a cape or something. Honestly, I blame my own cynicism. It's a sweet, warm, encouraging song and my sensibilities just don't lie that way...even though I, too, own a cape.<br /><br />Overall, this album shows that Garbage is still capable of evolution. Maybe not lyrically so much, but sonically. Most of the music on this album has so much going on under the drums, bass, guitar and vocals that it makes listening with headphones and listening on speakers two very different experiences, both rich and highly enjoyable.<br />I'm very interested in hearing the other eleven or so songs the band wrote and recorded for the album, as they're known for having some really excellent b-sides out there, many of them better than some album cuts, in my opinion. I don't think I'll consider Not Your Kind Of People truly complete until the other half has been released and can be fit in and around this first half. In any case, Garbage is certainly back and, hopefully, able to step right back into where they were almost ten years ago.<br />Oh, and also, Butch Vig is awesome.

1594481717|5|Our society's past is littered with the fallout of linear thinking, that is, believing that life is a series of if-then or either-or choices. In this book, Pink outlines the fallacy of this approach as we wend our way through the 21st century. We can no longer rely on left-brained thinking to analyze our way through sticky situations. Despite the subtitle, Pink is actually positing that in order to succeed in today's world, we must combine both brain hemispheres into whole brain thinking. (For those unfamiliar with the brain hemispheres, the left brain is sequential, logical, and analytical, and the right brain is non-linear, intuitive, and holistic.)     Pink's proposition provides another framework for systems thinking. As we move from the information age to the conceptual age (a transformation similar to moving from the industrial age to the information age), those who will be successful will demonstrate high concept (an ability to detect patterns and opportunity, create artistic and emotional beauty, craft a satisfying narrative, and tie unrelated ideas into something new) and high touch (an ability to empathize with others, understand subtleties of human interaction, find joy in one's life and elicit it in others, and to stretch for purpose and meaning). He further defines these two concepts into six essential aptitudes: design, story, sympathy, empathy, play, and meaning.    Pink devotes a chapter to each of these six senses, as he refers to them, and at the end of each chapter, he outlines what he calls a portfolio: a list of resources, exercises, and instruments to help the reader practice each of the six senses. For anyone interested in thinking outside the box or practicing systems thinking, this book is a must read. The audio version, which I listened to, has Pink reading the book, which is extremely effective.
B00B2V66VS|4|so I'm playing this game and for some reason it doesn't let me open the app up wtf is that?
B00F8F3J2S|4|On the whole it was a good read.  While the author did an excellent job of presenting his story, I felt it was a little bit repetitive in spots and I felt myself eagerly awaiting for the last page.
B003H6KRIE|5|You dont need a review of the three movies. You already know what they are about. The packaging is fine, the discs work well. You need to know however that the versions included in this box set do not include the UV or Digital Copy, which are handy for transferring to the mobile devices. Other than that, this box set is everything you would expect from this trilogy.
B00NX73VL2|5|Love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!
B00MNYTWMI|5|In this game you find hidden objects and also find clues to hidden places if you are lucky. It's fairly easy and I love the design of the game. It's quite artistic. I'm still not sure of what else to do except gain points and money, but it's a fun little journey to get your mind off the everyday world.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|I was playing until my mom saw and said it was the game of the devil's
0486211045|5|First off.  The retailer got me the book in three days.  I didnt pay additional to have it expedited, so that was a plus.  As far as the material goes.  Buy this book.  There is a reason that Bridgman is know and recomended by so many professional and aspiring artist.  I hadnt had this book a month and already improved my anatomy line work considerable.  The sketches are very much in the Frank Frazetta style. Not a whole lot of dialogue instruction but multiple angles of each part of the body and for a visual learner like myself. Extremely insightful.  I read where a lot of people note that you already have to have a clear understanding of anatomy.  Well i have purchased quite a few books that go in long, long anatomy detail and i am not a professional artist by any means. This series of books along with Loomis and Hampton seem to be the way to go if you want to really get a grasp.  Just my opinion.  I am very glad i purchased this book. I would use this seller again, no question.
034580404X|5|Love the books. Can't wait to see the movie.
B000HIVIOW|5|would recommend the snowman to everyone for a very light and enteraining movie for all the family. we loved it
B0036TGT3E|4|I bought this for my son as it was a favorite of mine growing up.  The first few scenes in the movie were in fantastic HD and the scenery jumped off the screen.  Unfortunately this wasn't the case for the whole movie and portions of the movie didn't seem to be as digitally remastered as you would expect for a Blu-Ray.  The story was the same good story and the movie wasn't too expensive.  Overall we enjoyed watching it and that was why we bought it.
B00RL9WRAE|4|Good Denzel did a good job in this one. I excepted a little more action like the punisher for which this is a remake of. I am a huge Denzel fan so I might be a little bias in my opinion.
0345350499|4|Most of the characters were very three dimensional.  The plot was never really played upon though, it was as if the author tried to fit in every detail of le morte d'arthur onto her thin plot, but it only left an  undeveloped plot. I would have like to have seen it go further.
B0038M2AZA|5|This movie led me to Temple Grandin's unique insights into human and animal thought and perception, which are staggering in their implications. Don't be fooled by the dorky cover, this DVD is exceptional in every way.    This review can't really do justice to this movie, or Temple Grandin's contributions to humankind and \\"animalkind\\". If I could give it 6 stars, I would. It deserves every award it received and will receive, and then some. In a way it's a pity it was made for TV because it (and its cast) would otherwise almost certainly have received Oscars. For some reason, \\"It won seven Oscars\\" would probably convince more people to watch it than \\"It won seven Emmys\\". Then again, maybe it *is* as good as it is because it was made by HBO. Maybe the Hollywood treatment would have ruined it - I don't know.    To me, it's not just about the production, direction, and acting, as exceptional as they are (I can't enthuse enough about how Claire Danes *becomes* Temple Grandin; it's closer to transmigration than it is to acting). It's not even just about the story, as fascinating and inspiring and important as that is. It's about how little we understand about the world in which we live, and the creatures we share it with, and a signpost to learning much more about that (through her books and other reading).    After the movie finished, I immediately watched it again, this time with the commentary track enabled, on which Temple Grandin, director Mick Jackson and co-writer Christopher Monger speak. It was a treat. Then I bought three of her books on Kindle. I read \\"Animals in Translation\\" overnight, which blew away what was left of my mind after I had watched the movie twice in a row, and I will never again think about animals in the same way.    People might consider this movie to be about autism and meeting its challenges, and it hopefully will be a huge help to the heroic parents and teachers, and other professionals in the autistic community, and of course to autistic people themselves. To those who would accompany Dr Grandin through her \\"door\\", especially the \\"neurological normals\\", it is also a portal to improving our very limited understanding of perception and reality.    As a postscript, it's got me thinking about neurodiversity and related concepts: how wide is that autistic spectrum, anyway? Could some \\"normals\\" fit into one end of it, people who don't quite fit the DSM IV definition of Asperger's, say, but are still too easily overstimulated, socially awkward, bright, sensitive, and geeky? Should autism really be called a disorder, or is it simply a different - but valid - way of perceiving reality? Is someone's \\"difficult\\", emotional, but extremely intelligent child actually very mildly autistic? Why do so many highly gifted children have difficulties coping with the \\"normals\\"?    In other words, could autism be a variation of common-or-garden brain wiring, falling into one end of the normal distribution of how people perceive reality, just as someone with a very high IQ falls into the 99.999th percentile of the IQ curve?
1476734941|3|This diet would probably work IF I used it. I can't seem to get myself in that mode. I'm still hopeful I will use it and be successful.
B00IRMTTPU|5|This is a disturbing film of the period of History that would rather be forgotten.  I reccommend it to my friends.
B00BHHIWQO|5|This is one of the better games on my KIndle. However. I refuse to buy extra hearts. I do love to play .Amazon has done a good job.
B00L8FC1QM|5|The roaring MetalPak Godzilla Blu Ray is pretty much nothing short of spectacular.  The packing pops up and the roar is loud and great.  The movie itself is a straightforward, classic-style Godzilla film with slow burn setup and amazing payoff, ridiculously entertaining.  The extras are all very very good and presented in full HD, although I do wish they had included deleted scenes on this release.  I would also have liked to have seen a featurette on the music.  No matter, it's definitely a must-have for any blu-ray collection.
B001MS7IBS|1|This show is only a bad intent to make another X-files, it has the most stupid and nonesensic plots a series has ever had with disgusting and unnecesary scens.. Definitely the series continue getting worse and worse after the first episodes. The main actress acts so bad that it's very difficult to believe that is a professional actress. In my opinion is one of the worst written shows currently on TV, believe me, very bad written.
0763644765|5|My kids still LOVE this book and they have been potty trained a long time.  So cute and really got my two interested in using the potty.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Love the story lines, writing, characters, cast, scenery, and costumes. Totally into it. Cannot wait for season 4 to become available.
B00BAXFECK|5|Great read, if not exactly cheery. :)
B003VS0CX8|5|We loved watching this wonderful movie again.  It had been many years since we watched it last. The Blu-ray format was outstanding and so was the sound quality. Thank you for the quick shipping!
B007IXWL2C|3|Good for erotica if that's your thing.  I forced myself to read these books because everyone was raving about the.
B004LWZWBU|3|The idea for THE BIG YEAR sounds fascinating; the fact that people spend most of their time and energy trying to spot as many birds as possible during a calendar year offers fascinating possibilities for the exploration of obsession, as well as including some wonderful footage of the birds themselves.<br /><br />While David Frankel's film manages to fulfill the second requirement, it fails notably on the first.  Rather than exploring the characters of its three protagonists (Jack Black, Owen Wilson, Steve Martin), it relapses into a familiar tale of the ugly duckling with little money (Black) taking on the big boys (Wilson, Martin) in the Big Year competition.  No one is initially prepared to admit that they are actually participating; but when they do, Black and Martin form an alliance against the cocky, arrogant Wilson, who believes that he is obviously the best, his position unchallengeable.<br /><br />THE BIG YEAR includes some stunning photography - by Lawrence Sher - as well as some picture-postcard views of various locations in the United States.  On the whole, however, the picture descends into sentimentality, especially in its depiction of the relationship between Black's character and his crusty father (Brian Dennehy), or the way in which Martin's character becomes so human that he is prepared to give up an opportunity to become the president of 3M worldwide.  The ending is wearily predictable, although there are a few incidental laughs along the way.
B008JFUQ16|5|What a great movie!!!!
1592537251|5|I checked this book out of the library and hated returning it. I decided to buy my own copy and have enjoyed it immensely. It's a great book to look at and enjoy whenever. So glad Gabriel Campanario decided to put this book together showcasing the drawings of other urban sketchers around the world. As The Seattle Sketcher, his own drawings of Seattle scenes are wonderful and intimate art and can be viewed on his blog.
B0016Q2D5M|5|Cute, wholesome movie!
B0063IH60K|4|I like solitaire. What is not to like? It is one of many different type games I like to play. I can change the look of it too which also entertains me. :)
B0035JLVWY|5|Great courtroom drama, amazing plot
B000002LCK|3|I agree very much with the review of a previous contributor: New Order is a fantastic band, but this compilation carries as much bad as good. The disparity between disc 1 and disc 2 is too much to handle; the former is an overall superb collection of the bands' early-mid 80s work, and the latter is a mostly odd combination of early singles and various instrumental remixes. The extended versions of &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Perfect Kiss&quot; are excellent, while tunes like &quot;Confusion,&quot; &quot;Subculture&quot; and &quot;Shellshock&quot; are good demonstrations of the bands ability to combine heavily produced synths and drum machines with meaningful, emotion-driven lyrics. But disc two just doesn't match in quality...it does contain some early and noteworthy singles such as &quot;Procession,&quot; but its still quite dissapointing...overall, highly recommended for fans, but just not worth the expense for newcomers
0553381407|5|It is hard to say I love this book because it is difficult information.  At some time in every person's life, there is an encounter with a \\"toxic parent.\\"  There are also times that we, ourselves, are toxic parents.  This self-help book explains the problem, defines \\"toxic\\" as he sees it, and offers alternative ways to deal with life.  I have purchased and passed on many copies to friends and family.
B00000JCB2|2|this album was lagging behind Limp's debut album when it was in production. like many others comments may have said, this album has fairly pointless lyrics, all pretty much boasting their sexual appitude and what  new friends and connections Fred Durst has made within the hip hop and  metal community (method mad, Jon from KoRn, etc...)<br />this album's musical  content on the other hand is well put together on the plus side. Wes plays  some fine guitar riffs to give a small minority of Limp's songs an edge  over the next rap/metal clone.<br />i bought this album expecting it to  surpass the underground-gone-sellout first album, but it failed. fairly  dismal
B005K17RU0|4|Best weather app I have ever used. I have it for both the ipod touch and the kindle fire. very simple and very accurate.
B008602KQI|4|Good movie, but the picture has streaks running through it.
B00005JMFQ|5|One thing is clear about Love Actually, either you'll completely be blown away by it or you'll hate it.<br /><br />Personally I am of the former camp in regards to this movie. The characters have complex interactions and despite the seemingly unjoined stories you find bridges that connect characters left and right which unwind as the story develops.<br /><br />The movie also brings together many stories with both sad and happy endings depicting all the aspects of relationships which can be encountered.<br /><br />Not to mention the movie is hilarious. Hugh Grant's character is amazingly fun to watch and the character called Collin is insanely funny.<br /><br />All in all, I could go on for awhile about this film but I'll leave my comments at this. I could watch this film twice in the same week without losing interest in it. I can't say that about many other films.
B0049J2BSM|5|My 2 1/2 year old and I really enjoyed this cute movie. Now I think we need to buy it.
B008AK8FHM|5|It was not written well but what can you expect from a neurosurgeon? It is still incredible and an absolutely amazing true story. A must read.
B0000AQS0F|5|I know my title seems a little...well ok over the top but I'm serious. I don't really watch many TV series anymore because they have gone down hill. Latley it's just been movie's. So I had a friend recommend a movie, Serenity. I thought the movie was pretty good and my friend explained that the movie was based off a series and all the original characters had been used. So he said if you like the movie you love the series. He was right. I saw all four DVDs in one weekend. One right after another. Once you get to the last DVD you'll get a little sad. So my suggestion \\"Buy this box set\\". It's the perfect combination of action comedy and drama.
B000VNMMQQ|4|I loved this movie, saw it at the theatre and enjoyed the fast paced action and the way the title character has not changed his attitude.  The supporting cast were believable and the action sequences well filmed.  Storyline was also fast paced and there was no down time at all it was like the others just go, go, go.  Four stars from me.
B009JZTOG8|4|I loved Season 1, and I am enjoying Season 2 - there's something wonderful about seeing the stories you grew up with transform into tales that still entertain you after you've become an adult.  I've been made to care about these incarnations of characters, but I am hoping that there will be some more growth in their personalities.  Right now they seem a little 2-dimensional, because so much has happened over the course of the last two seasons but only Emma seems to have really changed.  I think the appeal of this series was that primarily one-dimensional fairy tale characters could be turned into people that really change and evolve according to their experiences, but I haven't been seeing much of that in the last few episodes.
B0000DD7LB|2|WHAT WAS SHE THINKING ... YEAH SHE CAN DANCE BUT SHE CAN'T SING A NOTE. THIS ABLUM WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. SHE TRIED TO BE LIKE MADONNA TOO MUCH AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. FIND YOUR OWN IDENTITY. IF I HAD THE CHOICE OR SEEING OR MEETING BRITNEY OR CHRISTINA..... I'D SEE CHRISTINA BECAUSE SHE CAN SING AND SHE HAS THE TALENT. YEAH SHE MAYBE SEXY AND OVER THE TOP BUT SHE HAS THE VOICE AND THE MOVES TO BE THAT WAY.
B00B2V66VS|5|This game is just as good as the regular temple run, if not better. It is somewhat the same thing but with a different setting and more objects to collect
B00G5G7EXY|5|I loved this movie in the theater and love it even more at home.  Brought me to tears a couple times but all worked out in the end.  Love Olaf
B00F91RYL8|3|Glad I rented this on amazon prime,  I would have been upset to pay full fare on this so so flick
B009RH9FR6|3|The problem with the first one was the plastic &#34;frame&#34; that holds the Kindle was installed crooked, which made one corner stick out beyond the case, which looked like it could get bumped and break and thus would not hold the Kindle very well. I returned it and received another one very promptly - with the same problem, just not quite as bad.
B000FC11A6|5|Long before Bitcoin, the need and idea was well fleshed out.<br />But that's just a sidebar on this incredible roller coaster careening through the modern history of cryptanalysis and the development of computers and information theory.  Hilarity and excitement abound in this amazing book, which teaches as it holds you in thrall, mesmerised.
B000JMKNVK|5|I am big fan of Dennis Lehane and although a tad bit dark, this was a great book.  I highly recommend it to anyone!
B004SIIBGU|5|ebay is ebay
0762454970|5|The book is a pocket sized book which is fine I just wish I would have known! Got here on time and in great condition!! And it's a great book to read!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5|This book had a magical story and was very fun to read.  I imagine it was intended for a younger audience, but this grandma enjoyed it very much.
B00IEOC4OO|3|Fun game play, but has tendency to glitch out and cause the screen to flip uncontrollably. Otherwise, a decent little game with fun graphics. Although, with paying for the extras, it takes a long time to build up much gold and can get repetitive.
B00003CXE7|2|I know I'm not gonna find anyone to agree with me when I say I didn't like this movie. It was just too . . . formulaic.<br />The villain was the same type of villain we've seen in all the movies--dirty, rotten, stupid , yada yada.  Then there's the female role who's all nice and we all have to like her. Then there's the kid who's just annoying. <br />The only good thing is Russell Crowe, the special effects, and stunning overall look of this movie. I hated the cheesy moments--the dream sequences didn't work. I don't know why anyone would cry at this movie. You have to be a real softie to.<br />Great-looking, but nothing new in the story.
B00DMCV7K0|5|I loved this book!  The characters (based on real life activist sisters) were so powerfully drawn.  It was as though you were a fly on the wall going through the same activities and emotional upheaval.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves history - especially the pre-Civil War era.
B00688628M|5|Finally watching this series and it's incredible. Damien Lewis is superb.
B00IU0M85C|5|We are loving it! Sort of creepy but definitely a very original story line! Can't wait to see the rest of the season!
B00MJANW40|4|Very impressed with the special effects.
B00BSB2AE4|5|I seriously laughed out loud dozens of times while I was reading this book and in many instances I almost felt like Allie Brosh was in my head, talking of very real and often unapproachable subjects. I couldn't even find a quote I would consider a favorite.
B0071QIN00|1|why do they make you tilt your device it hard to do it if you're shaking this is wack stupid
B0083GQ2A0|2|I only rented this video because I am a Liam Neeson fan. But this film would be totally lacking in dialogue if not for the F word.
B000FCKC4C|5|It is a nice book
B00DPM7TIG|5|GOOD REVIEW OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF WWII FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BOTH A YOUNG GERMAN BOY AND A YOUNG BLIND FRENCH GIRL
B0019NB9A2|5|Of course, I don't need to say anything about the movie itself. Its worth watching just for the art direction - so far above the norm for the era. The transfer is crisp and full. Buy it.
B00GRVV29E|5|Interesting application real nice graphics and fun to play with
0977326403|5|Excellent
B0089LOG02|5|Excellent book from beginning to end. I had never heard of his part of our history.  Characters come alive in the telling of the story.
B00CWQ5Y3S|5|Excellent
B00JAWAIZ6|5|This is an amazing CD. Not one of the songs on this disc can be considered &#34;filler&#34;. The overall tone is one of upbeat, danceable music; clearly the Gallagher brothers were in good spirits while writing and recording their first CD. From the opening track hello to champagne supernova each song sets an optimistic tone the listener will find infectious. My favorite track she's electric is one of the most happy songs I've ever heard.
B000NQPZCO|1|[[ASIN:B000NQPZCO Donnie Brasco (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray]]]  Boring...boring...boring...  Made by Hollywood bubbleheads...for Hollywood airheads...  actors were sleepwalking while mumbling their sorry lines...  please, I'll pay just not to watch it.
0070511136|4|I read this book for a sales and negotiations course in my undergrad.  It did a good job of showing the importance of the cycle that sales goes through.  How you need to find pain then follow the steps recommended here.    Overall, a very good book.
B00G15MWSG|5|it was a good movie it was hard to keep up with the Chinese language .but still a good movie hope to find it in English later thank you
B000HL0EEE|5|excellent show. Could plug great characters to any other sci fi series. its so sad it was cancelled before its time
080013799X|4|Who can make a better comedic spoof of the King Arthur legend than the British themselves?  John Cleese, Eric Idle, and the rest of the Python gang submit brilliant comic performances in this funny, entertaining,  albeit bloody at times, motion picture that fans on both sides of the North  Atlantic have come to appreciate.
B000007NZ5|5|I didnt discover Martin-era Sabbath until the era was over unfortunately.  I bought this one, Tyr, and Cross Purposes, the great Eternal Idol, and Id rather forget Forbidden.  This Headless Cross is every bit as good as Tyr.  Martin is a powerful singer and sounds barely contained in most of the songs on this disc.  The low end is very there, and Iommi is in all his glory as always.  Standout tracks are:  When Death Calls (a haunting, chilling heavy tune that will keep you up at night), Kill in the Spirit World (when one spirit murders another - yeah its deep), Bad Moon Rising, Call of the Wild, Devil and Daughter, Nightwing.  Did I mention that Tony Martin kicks ass on this disc?  I love Dio, RIP, but Martin proves hes worthy of carrying the greatest metal band in the world.....ever.
B0097GVJWQ|5|great story that kept me well entertained for most of the day. game is long but not tedious. some items. are small but you can enlarge the picture. great buy!!
B004KYLM0Y|5|Actually it's not just the best album of the best Seattle band. It's the best Mark Lannegan's ouvre. I really love it and the vinyl is a wanderful experience of listening music.
B000E1JOSE|5|Everything was received in good order
B00DUGCLY4|5|I love it<br />I love<br />Awesomeness and development of the first place for the first place in a little bit more information about the first
B00BP4ZNFM|5|And we found it here. My kids love it and it was nice memories for me :) great movie for all ages.
B00005JNTX|1|I can't believe this movie. <br />The dialogues consist of endless one phrase pre-killing warnings, like \\"You just made the greatest error of your life\\", \\"You will regret it!\\" and so on, after which the actor/actress throws a \\"meaningful\\" dramatic look at the bleeding victim and pull out their big gun/sword/bazooka... <br />The women have of course their own bazookas stuck in their leather G-strings and their hair always has wind in it and they are really really badass. <br />Everyone's voice is low and dramatic and it becomes kind of monotone and makes you want to sleep, especially whith the movie being always so dark. <br />I found it terrible and predictable. But if you like computer games with women fighters you probably will enjoy this.
B007V693YK|4|Great
B00HEPDGKA|4|great
B00AB7HESI|5|a great way to interact with your young children
B000O1799U|1|Ugh! This film was awful. Beyonce cannot act her way out of a wet paper back and her singing is marginal, at best. Jennifer Hudson has a huge voice, but the songs are so bellowy it has little to no effect. Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx were just ridiculous casting. Avoid this turkey.
B004EBT5CU|5|What a beautiful voice. This was a gift for a younger person and it was very well received. She specifically asked for this cd so I couldn't go wrong.
0316666343|4|I really enjoyed the main character's point of view and perspective. Wonderful! Rare is a book that makes me want to read it again, and this one is a keeper! Better yet, pass it on to a friend when you're finished.<br />They'll thank you, like I'm thanking my Mom for lending this to me.<br />Thanks mom!
B00C7DGRL4|2|I quit watching after the first 30 minutes.  It just did not grab me. Maybe it gets better, I don't know.
B009361C5O|1|Garbage
B0048WQDIE|4|I really enjoyed the book.  It was so much like the world is today as far as people as they appear to others verses who they really are.  The book was funny and serious at the same time.  I would everyone to read it and then look closely at some of the people around them and compare their actions to those in this book.
1878424319|3|This book is GREAT at teaching people a good way to approach life, by living by the four agreements as specified in this book, and in my opinion; this book or something similar philosophy should be read by every troubled young person.<br />I have a HUGE nitpick against this book.<br />This book is being sold as a book to assist people in practising Shamanism, and in my opinion; &quot;toward that effort; this book falls amazingly flat.&quot;<br />If you want a great way to approach physical life; this philosophy id good. If you want to explore Shamanism; please go to my &quot;about me&quot; area, and see my assorted listmania lists such as &quot;Shamanism, Indian, or Wicca&quot; lists; Two_Bears.<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit).

B00E8KLWB4|4|I'm haven't been playing The Secret Society-Hidden Mystery. I haven't mastered all the different aspects and sometimes get confused. The tutorials help.
B00G5G7K7O|5|Great!! such a wonderful story and a perfect movie for all ages!  I bought it for my classroom library but also for myself:)
1480568147|3|I was disappointed in this book. I have loved the Cross Fire series and adore Gideon Cross. I feel like with each book Eva becomes a little weaker each time. I truly did not like Eva in this book. I prefer when an author makes the female a strong character. I feel the character Gideon deserve someone better then Eva. One that will scream from the roof tops that she is married to the man she loves, one that truly loves him and only him with her whole heart, and one that would not play on his insecurities. I wished I would of waiting on buying and read the reviews 1st. I have plan doing that with the next book that is released in this series. I truly do not like the way the story is going.
B008Y7N7JW|4|The book was way better. But not too bad for an adaptation. I think Peeta needed to be a bigger guy. It drives me nuts. Also, there is zero chemistry between characters.
B000O8OTNC|5|Great little shrapener, but i didnt at first know if i was suppose to use the carbide then the ceramic or vice versa, so i would like to have a 1 and 2, so i know in which order i should use them
B00TU9UO1W|5|A lot of people said this movie was bad so I almost didn't watch it but I am so glad I did. The movie kept my interest the entire time and unlike most of the movies I watch these days I was completely surprised by the ending.  Definitely worth the time.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Its awesome

B00BUCXVPI|4|Had to watch it twice, great flick
0393312836|5|Once you start to understand the nadsat speak it's a pretty interesting read. If you enjoy anti heroes this book is for you
B00L9B7IKE|4|Despite the dark tone, which bothered me at first, this was a real page-turner! Enjoyed it reading it very much.
B001YB29HG|5|Very catchy and easy to watch over and over again! This gets played often in my house and doesn't tire easily.
B000003CKH|5|This CD crosses all genres making it one of my favorites.  If you are like  me and love all kinds of music, it will probably be one of your favorite  CD's also.  The lead singer has an everyman voice. In every song he says  &quot;all right&quot;, which is makes you laugh. The songs are funny but  this band is for real.New CD in 98 baby
B00WSD2BGS|5|This movie is one of our family's new favorites.  The story line was heartwarming, and it kept the attention of my two year old which was a plus.  I love it when children's movies also include humor that parents can enjoy,  and Paddington provided that.
B000W9399S|5|A fun read.  Dragon Lance meets Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Rich characters,  a good story,  and cross reality bleeding makes growing up in the 70s feel relevant.<br /><br />Reminiscent if my childhood... shutting down pools of radiance on the c64 to watch Saturday night Star Trek with Shatner and Nimoy (llap).
B00E8KLWB4|4|Very entertaining. I wish it didn't take energy to play a level though. Other then that great game that can be challenging at times
0307165485|5|Full disclosure, I had this book as a kid. That being said, it's just the coolest, best toddler/preschool book around. It is too big to haul around, but that's the beauty. It's the at-home book that the kid keeps re-discovering. I have a couple of other Richard Scarry books, and my son loves that some of the content is the same in different books. It's like a little discovery for him, and he remembers the words even quicker.<br />Did I mention this book is great?
B00PSLQYWE|5|Awesome. Sad that I've watched all the episodes. Wish it could continue
B002JXK5VU|5|Pretty good
B002DQLGHU|4|Watched this with my 12 year old daughter who is a huge fan and has watched it many times.  Very good I will watch the next in the series soon!
B000002897|5|Had this album since it came out, can't believe that it didn't taken off but I sort of like the &quot;specialness&quot; that the lack of recognition adds. Needless to say this is a really, REALLY good album, a real warm  'laxed out feel, an alternate reality within which one finds oneself lost.  A sort of progression and improvement on &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;,  anyway - Highly Recommended.
B000O8OTNC|1|The only good thing about this sharpener is the diamond rod.  The preset 45* angles are only good for chopping tools, like axes, kukris, and machetes, and not usable for slicing edges (you want 10* to 20* edges for slicing tools).<br /><br />However, the biggest, number one flaw of this thing is that it's a pull-through sharpener.  If you're reading this review and care about your knife edges, then don't make the same mistake I did and buy it.  This tool, like all pull-through sharpeners, will DESTROY your knife edge.  What happens with pull-through sharpeners like this one, is that they don't actually sharpen your knife.  What they do instead is tear the metal and turn your straight edge into a serrated one.  That's why it seems like it works; the torn blade seems to cut better for a little while, but as the nicked metal tips tear off the blade dulls.<br /><br />If you want an easy way to &#34;sharpen&#34; your knife and don't care about destroying the edge, then this will suit your needs just fine.  If you want a way to sharpen your knife without ruining it, then get a field sharpening stone instead.
B000FBJAOG|4|At first I thought this book was going to be like those \\"worst-case scenario\\" books (lots of pictures and little info). I'm happy that the author took it seriously and this really is quite in depth on how to defend yourself from zombies. It's a great read and the part I really liked was the timeline of previous zombie attacks. I love history and thought it was really cool how he even intertwined some of the events together (i.e. the frozen Cossack being discovered).<br /><br />The one criticism I have is that some of the information is repeated more than once. This is good I suppose if it were real, but it can be a little repetitive.
0385537131|5|Love this book.  Another literary triumph for John Grisham.  You won't be able to put it down.  Having read ALL of his books, I would have to rank this one near the top.
B00CNGA1PS|4|This app is good for downloading and listening podcasts.  It is easy to use as well,but it does not seem to have as extensive of a library as itunes
B00AESN8XY|5|This game is cool and has a plague that turns people to zombies but got to upgrade the symptoms to get zombie mania that means all your infected people turns to a zombie it's the best-selling game
B003TSEEDY|5|Really enjoyed it. Would recommend it to all ages. The theme is universal, being your true self that participates in your life. Not just observes.
B006ID6NDQ|4|From one who lived through similar brutal regimes, this is reminiscent of events that seem to have happened just recently, albeit many years past. One never forgets moments of man's inhumanity to man. A must read for deniers.
B006MW3UZW|5|Can't get enough!
B000065V3H|2|If you enjoyed this review, make sure to check out my review movie blog at: criticbrandoncsites.blogspot.com<br /><br />Can't Buy Me Love (1987) ** / 4<br />D: Steve Rash<br />C: Patrick Dempsey, Amanda Peterson, Courtney Gains, Tina Caspary, Seth Green<br />P: High school nerd (Dempsey) pays the most popular girl in school $1000 to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month, expecting that her popularity will rub off on him.<br /><br />In Can't Buy Me Love, Patrick Dempsey's character of Ronald Miller suffers an identity crisis-- trade off his individuality to be popular or stay true to himself, but be a loner in the process? Can't Buy Me Love suffers from an identity crisis very similar to Dempsey's. Does the film stay true to its original premise and do something more meaningful & more considered or does it sell out to be more marketable? Unfortunately, the film goes with the latter.<br /><br />Watching Can't Buy Me Love, I could see there was a good film just beneath the surface. Amanda Peterson's character and the object of Dempsey's affections, stars as the most popular girl in school. She hates it. Popularity is more like a job to her. Her friends are superficial. Everyone treats her like an object. No one can really see the real her. These are interesting ideas that could have made for a very intriguing film. Peterson seems game as she has a solid grasp on her character and what makes her tick, but these story elements are only scratched upon and not fully explored. [PG-13] 94 mins.
B005GFPZYK|5|Great read! Couldn't put it down!
1401235417|5|Lots of writers have over the decades taken lots of different approaches to Batman.  Impressive enough as a fine prose writer, Snyder's \\"The Court of Owls\\" will certainly earn him a place among the highest tier of authors to riff on the Dark Knight, indeed, it may well signal a place to come in that pantheon of truly extraordinary comic book maestros.<br /><br />In \\"Court of Owls,\\" Snyder is firing on every cylinder.  He creatively combines two recurring Batman plot elements for which I have a particular weakness (Gotham City as more than a setting but as a character and Bruce Wayne's first love, along with further exploring the history of the Wayne family).  Just as Bruce Wayne launches a major urban renewal program, his evening half is confronted by a mysterious murder.  The murder evokes \\"The Court of Owls,\\" a Gotham legend captured in a nursery rhyme.  According to the myth, the Court of Owls is a secret society that \\"watches\\" over Gotham.  Batman has investigated the whether the Court exists and has determined it to be a myth -- but was he right?<br /><br />One cannot say much more without risking spoilers (several reviews here get too close to that line for my taste), but suffice to say, Snyder works wonders.  On top of a very solid plot and a gripping story arc, his sense of Bruce Wayne as a character is extraordinary -- a man cut off from his emotions, able to pretend during the day and unleash his rage by night -- as well as what promises to be a vital and complex perspective on Dick Grayson.  He also manages to incorporate some of the more metaphysical elements of the Batman mythos (owls prey on bats), without it feeling anything less than organic to the story.  Snyder also demonstrates an awareness of the fact that, more perhaps than with other comic heroes, suspense is a vital element in a successful batman story.<br /><br />On a last note, I'd be negligent if I failed to mention artist Greg Capullo.  His style, toned down some from his Spawn days, suitsSnyder's vibe like a bat in a cave.  It is dark and evocative and at times almost verging on the florid, yet maintains a sense of grim reality that leaves a reader worried about the consequences of every choice and turn.  One thing is certain, whatever your worries about DCs new reboot, the Caped Crusader has landed in the hands of a pair of spectacular talents!  No true Batman fan will want to miss this book.
B0069G5Z9K|4|My son dowloaded this and plays it all the time.  He gigles and laughs the whole time.  He loves making and upgrading new items.
B007BVMVDU|5|Cannot get enough of this show
B00I8Q77Y0|5|this is so fun and so so cool and my highscore is only 1 and it is very I do reacamend it but be ready for extreme hardness
B00VFTCGES|5|Love this movie. A favorite for sure!
B000QRIGLC|5|I've read the book twice now. I'm sure there will be a third reading. The drive, determination, and prideful spirit that makes America the greatest republic ever is still alive. God Bless the men and women that serve.
B000E1ZK3M|4|Too bad HD-DVD is dead, but if you still own a player, this is a great movie for the price.  I think those of us who are soldiers and have been to Iraq can understand this movie a little better than those who haven't.  Some of the scences can be too close to home and somewhat overbearing for non-military viewers, but helps to remind us how much of a sacrifice we made in both wars.  The picture quality and sound delivers, though this more of an enhanced DVD than a true HD movie.
B00DRPVE3M|5|Yoo hoo!!! This game gets so addicting!!! Once you play, you gotta keep playing till you win! Love this game! 5 star game! Ya!!
B00DR0PDNE|5|This thing is awesome.  I might get rid of Cox cable now.  It took less than a minute to install.
B0031KC8OC|5|A sarcastic, teenage Jessica Fletcher, what's not to like?  Plus, both &#34;Brad&#34; & &#34;Randy&#34; from Home Improvement make appearances.  Hits all the sweet spots for a 90s girl.
B00LXKI1A2|5|Fun game. Worth a try
B00AA7O6QC|3|Was ok
B00KAMX1MM|5|Particularly awesome release from Morrissey
B000002ITW|5|got it fast. item as described.very happy with purchase. thanks again!
B001609SQA|4|This was the ultimate action syfy movies that showed multi-faceted strengths of the female lead character.  Segourney weaver brought her character to life.
B00V4JJPKM|1|Two hours of my life I'll never get back.
B00DYFCYSO|5|Bought this after the grammys....and all I can say is 'wow'....where have I been? Had no idea how good this music was......
B00003W8NO|5|My children and I loved this movie. I thought it was very well animated. Disney is terrific in pleasing a child. This movie can easily keep a childs attention. My children watch it over and over again, even my 11 and 12 year old sons love it. It will make you laugh and might even make you cry. I think Disney gets better and better with their movies and this one is definately a must see!!
B005HJU7HA|5|A wonderful and complete collection of  the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Very enjoyable . No defects in the digital version that I can recall. Great price as well !
B001ANSS5K|4|Very similar to his other works but still good. The beginning-middle dragged on a bit, but the ending made it worth it. Would recommend.
B00JJH3LZG|4|Very well done. Almost believable!
B00B5HQKNI|4|Sad to see mom go, and i was kinda taken back when Bond was shot, and the fact that the girl that was in the bar got killed. The bad guy, did a awesome job at his roll, he made a good bad guy.
B00000J2PH|5|One of my all time favorite albums/cd's. Great songs sung in a great time.
B002NXSRX4|4|I had heard a lot of bad stuff about G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra and it was, for the most part, a bad rap. Sure, it wasn't set back in the 60's when G.I. Joe was founded, but World War 2 and Vietnam movies have been done to death. So, it was refreshing to see them take G.I. Joe in a completely different direction. The future. With new weapons, new technology and new faces.<br /><br />Sure the script has been criticized as being non-existent and smothered by action sequences and special effects. Yet, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra is by far, a more creative and involving story than many actions movies of recent, as in, anything by Roland Emmerich, Twilight movies or whatever. It actually is a fast and furious pace with an actually very complicated story. That to me, was the problem. Because the fast and furiuos pace would brush over the story elements with a very thin brush and so when the ending finally got there, there were way too many loose ends and they all seemed to come pouring down in the final 3 minutes.<br /><br />They could have slowed down and made the story elements more important, but all in all, what you get with G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra is an energetic, cyber-weapon summer flick that gave people what most summer movie viewers want, slam bam action with cool effects.<br /><br />If anything, G.I. Joe tried to do TOO MUCH story, and didn't cover all of it or give it justice because they were more interested in pleasing the teenage crowd that buys the tickets. People like me, a 40-year old male who likes that stuff too, but would rather save his money to get by on bills, enjoyed the heck out of it in his living room with some surround sound and some Orville Redenbacker.
B008O2T3O0|1|The product said their would be English subtitles and if their is it's difficult to do. Very disappointing, looks like it would've been very nice.
B004GUSG4M|5|Loved this book.  Very quick read due to the great story line.  Granted it may have been a little far fetched at times but that is what makes a great novel, right?  The story was intriguing and I read every line and read it fast so I could see what happened at the end.  I have recommended this book to many people and they have also loved this book.  Download it now!!
B007VWEEQQ|1|Don't buy this!  Needs a mini AS card which are difficult to find.  Sound is bad.  Don't waste your money
B00KW282MO|2|Too far fetched!
B00CBRAD2A|5|Good movie I like the action on it
B009KS4XRO|5|Lots of fun.  It is easy to play and very addicting.  I play on my kindle and on Facebook with no problems.
B00GCE3TCE|5|This is an amazing book.  From the narrator to the main characters, you are continually drawn to read on. A must read.
B00005LOUQ|1|I didn't know what to think of this film when I saw it, so I saw it with a pretty open mind.  It stunk.  This is the most wandering, stupid, over-budgeted waste I have seen in a long time.  Jim was given plenty to do, largely because he had to fill-in a character who didn't exist on the script.  The town is composed of vaccuous rat-faced idiots, and and a meandering plot searching for somthing to say beyond Christmas involving spending money, and The Grinch not liking it.  What a waste!
B00M60RKW8|5|A bit hard to get in to at first but then I was hooked. Finished it in two days. Once I was hooked I couldn't put it down. It was just what everyone promised.
B00CWY76CC|5|this game is quite challenging at times but still very fun.  hope for more rooms soon.  the last room is pretty tough.
B000TGCR3S|5|I received the movie about 4 days after i ordered it, item was in great shape no complaints here would do business again
B002PEP4SC|2|I was expecting more of a read. maybe I will get it from one of the other Nikkei heat book
B000PC0S5K|5|I chose this book because I saw him on Oprah's show and I wanted to follow along.  Loved him explaining easily about his concepts.
B00BW5K5DO|3|Just wasn't what I expected...guess I got to used to more of a challenge from Playrix, and with this I don't get that.  Sorry, but that's just me.
B00PTB7B34|4|Okay game. Kind of slow.
B000002J09|3|Nah, I don't buy all the hype about this album. Yeah, Black Dog is a great song. Rock and Roll is, well, very noisy, straight rock and roll (and it works selling Cadillacs too!). Stariway to Heaven is a cheeeeeeeesy thang which never fails to impress the semi-deaf three-chord bunch, although doesn't make a dent on any minimally trained ear. As for the musicians, Page is a good player but in this album he began yielding to overdub temptation (that's why his live playing sounds so lame). Bonzo hits the drums as hard as he always did, which is pretty much all he ever did (I don't care if he revolves in his grave or not). Plant did all of his tricks in Zepp I already -and he repeated them to exhaustion in all of the other albums. <br />Overall, this is not a crappy album, but calling it &quot;the crowning achievement of r'n'r&quot; is a very long shot.
B00CWV9FQA|4|My son loves any Lego movie.. They were funny. The plot was cool and this was an all around great family movie...
B00BWBHIUG|4|It's cute and entertaining. I enjoy making my own little reef and seeing all the characters join. Wish they were moved easier ways to get some parts and stuff besides buying them.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Fast paced with good imaginative plot.  The actress does an amazing job playing so many diff. characters.  A great show
0471267554|5|I was recommeded this book by a fitness coach.  I was about 50 lbs overweight and suffering health problems.  Anyhow, I been following the program for about 2 months now and occasionally work out and have lost 25 lbs.  I tried Atkins before and did lose about 40 lbs, but as soon as I went off and added carbs back I gained weight like no tomorow.  I wore everything I ate.  With this program I eat a lot of fruit and vegtables and the part that is great is it seems to kill your hunger after awhile.  I used to think about food most of the time and with this program, I actually sometimes have to remind myself to eat.  That is completely un-heard of for me prior.  Additionally, I feel much better, my compexion, and skin is much healthier looking.  I ve lost about 25 lbs already and I have  energy to want to work out.  With Atkins I had no energy and no endurance.  Occasionaly when I cheat, and eat bread, it actually upsets my stomach now.   I used to have indigestion frequently, now that is also gone.  I highly recommend this program.
B00ILHW6AG|3|Entertaining but not up to the level of some of his prior works. His word pictures are as disturbing as ever though.
B00992CF6W|5|My preteen stepson has been playing Minecraft for ages, and we started to play together a few years back. He and I have both been loving having Minecraft everywhere we go!<br /><br />I've always been the person that pulls out their phone in a waiting room or on a crowded bus and starts to play a game. This Minecraft Pocket Edition plays just like the PC and xbox versions and really incorporates all the essential elements of the original! Navigation is easy with the intuitive compass touch controls on the bottom left of the screen. Using items and crafting comes naturally, and I found that the controls and actions required to play were very easy to figure out on my own. Several different worlds can be created and saved on one device, and world can be created in either survival or creative mode just like the original!<br /><br />By far, this is my favorite way to waste time and make waiting more enjoyable! I'm very glad we decided to purchase the pocket edition of Minecraft!
145162445X|4|A great book detailing the implications of the latest evidence on universal expansion.<br /><br />Krauss incorporates some mild-to-moderate pro-atheist reflections into the book.<br /><br />4 stars because I felt the book was front-loaded; most of the really ground breaking information was in the first half, and he kind of ran out of new material to discuss so it dragged. It's a short enough book as it is, but since it is dealing with a single topic there is only so much to say about it, and it could have been said in 100 pages.
0316098329|5|I could not put this book down!
B00FEMJF6O|4|I am new to this game but it's fun so far.
B00846REIS|5|What a great start to a series of good books! I love the hot romance and it keeps you wanting more!!
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love this game it's soooooooo fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />it's a little bit like temple run.<br />your going to love it<br />(have fun)
B00JLJ0Y2U|5|Great!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Brilliant! Such a great game.
6305537798|4|If you're in the mood for a teen flick, loosely based on Shakespeare, then this might be good for you. Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, and cast make a great showing here, but it's not their best by far.
159514188X|1|This book makes mental illness and suicide seem like a joke. If every person committed suicide over the things that occur in the book, there wouldn't be a teenage population. Are the things that this girl experiences through high school okay? Not necessarily. But they are very typical, and I would say average occurrences. Suicide is a serious topic, and while this book doesn't glamorize it, I couldn't help but wonder how many teenage girls reading this book might think suicide is a good option because 'a rumor was started about them' or 'a boy touched their butt.' If you're looking for a book about depression or suicide, try something else. And stay informed on such topics. As an individual who has struggles for many years with depression and suicidal ideations, this book sickened me.
B00BAXFAOW|4|Engaging, insightful and historic, but all very educational and interesting . The stories were well chosen and significance completely obvious. Would recommend to anyone who reads non fiction
B007FG9LIE|4|very good read. I am usually good at figuring things out but I was surprised by the direction this story took. Will definitely read number 2 in this series.
B000ICKPOQ|4|Decent show
B003JJA59K|4|sad and depressing, but shows you exactly what we would face and completely makes you think about our futures and what this world will become.  the relationship between this father and son was so emotional.  i loved this movie.  the acting was incredible and went straight to the heart
B00127RAJY|5|I just did this workout tape for the first time yesterday, and it is REALLY HARD! I consider myself in pretty good shape and so I was under the impression that the level one workout would be easy. Boy was I wrong!! I literally had to push myself to be able to finish it and I am still a little sore today. I am confident that if I do this every day, I will lose weight and tone up! I would recommend this video and definitely suggest that you start at level one!!!
B000FBFN1U|4|A tour de force!  Thrilling follow-up to Clash of Kings. Shocking twists and turns that beg the reader to continue. Can't wait to dive deeper into this series.
B00ADIT8U2|3|A bit too short - finished in less than three hours.  Enjoyed the story line  - puzzles were somewhat easy.
B00A6CCF0K|5|Amazon won't let you submit a one-word review, and for good reasons. But wow, there isn't much else to say. King has done it again. His books just keep getting better and better. Dr. Sleep is a mature and well-presented book. Gone is most of the explicit gore in the Shining, but in its place you'll find a polished and suspense filled story populated with characters you will enjoy getting to know.<br /><br />Read this. You will love it.
B000002ACR|5|This truly is a classic Byrds album with Chris Hillman pulling a vast majority of song writing duties here.<BR>Not only does he extend himself more on this album, but his songs are among the best it has to offer.  &quot;Thoughts and Words&quot; will always be one of my favorite tunes, with a moody, Los Angeles type of feel (that still holds up well today.)<BR>&quot;Have you Seen Her Face&quot; is another great Hillman track with fantastic lyrics and McGuinn guitar.  &quot;Time Between&quot; has a kind of Desert Rose Band (Chris Hillman's future/most recent band), 'Sweetheart of the Rodeo' country-rock feel.<BR>&quot;The Girl With No Name&quot;, yet another great Hillman song about a failed relationship has Clarence White (future Byrds guitarist) as guest on it.<br />To me though, the bonus tracks shine here, as &quot;It Happens Each Day&quot; (Crosby) and &quot;Lady Friend&quot; (Crosby) turn out to be two of my favorite tracks.<BR>I used to listen to this album with headphones on top of the apartment building I lived in off Sunset Blvd.  (That's Los Angeles for people who have no idea what I'm talking about).  Being from Los Angeles, I could feel the atmosphere looking over the city and listening to classic Byrd songs.  Amazing.<br />One last thing,&quot;Mind Gardens&quot; in my view is just terrible.  If this was any other band, I'd consider taking it down a star just for this song.
B00CWY76CC|4|Very addictive, challenging and fun. I really suggest you try this game out. My son likes it too. We often have to work on them together
B001PU8N0I|5|This series was very interesting and entertaining.  I watched it from beginning to end.  It is like a good book you can't put down. I first saw it on a PBS channel and knew I had to have the DVD.
B00MFDMM3I|5|Amazing. The plot was a wonderful surprise. Aaron Paul delivered a wonderful performance. I hope they make a sequel!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Me gusta mucho la utilizo en mi trabajo y cuando hago mis compras personales. La recomiendo. Creo que les gustara.
B006M4RN3U|5|great music by a relatively new group. Nice upbeat tempo and catchy tunes. I Would deffinately recommend it to my friends
B0044XV3QY|5|Very solid box with nice art work, not to thrilled about the way they did the insertion of the discs tho. Packaging was very well done and I look forward to purchasing from this merchant again.
0004723724|5|This book was absolutly wonderful to read! peices from his works, his life, and the world. it was probably one of the best books I have read. I am a big fan of oscar wilde and this is,in my opinion, one of the best collections of his works all put together in a very nice and organised  way.. making it easy to read and absolutely enjoyable.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Great app very addictive
0316069434|5|Still going strong, Michael picks up where he left off in The Drop.  He kind of summarizes what went before without repeating himself and basically going over the Drop.  Starting with the Echo, Michael keeps us riveted with Harry's exploits.
B008CLI4N4|5|Excellent gift for the person who has it all. Reasonably priced. arrived fast. Would recommend to a friend. Enjoy. Happy watching.
B004QSQML8|5|Perfect
B009PU2SX8|5|A friend of mine at work told me about Gary and all I can say is WOW!  Blak and Blue is a veritable cornucopia of musical goodness.  The diversity across each track just makes this a stellar album to have.  It has everything from a Jimi Hendrix psychedelic rock vibe to blues to R&B.  In today's world of cookie-cutter sounds, Gary is a true artist.
B00FWPWNKS|5|This is one of several similar games from the developer Bullbitz. All those games sport cute if somewhat saccharine graphics, accompanied by decent animations & jingles. They also have voiceovers which make the occasional announcements & encouragement, in essence pretty much like Candy Crush. (In fact, I think their first game was called Candy Crunch but subsequently had to be renamed for copyright reasons!)<br /><br />Gameplay is smooth & responsive. There is a help page(s) on the main screen through which you can acquaint yourself with the game & its power-up's, but I'm sure many of you will be able to enjoy the game even if you just dive right in. This game asks for the Internet access which (it seems) is used for checking other games by the same developer & to take you to its Facebook page, but it runs fine even with Internet access denied. Other than that, there are no suspicious components which you should worry about.<br /><br />I have bought from this developer before, and they seldom add new levels (or very few) to an existing game. I believe they would rather design more levels then publish them as a different game. So, some of you might feel the 60 levels (available for all 3 difficulty settings so you argue 180 if you must) this game are too few but, for me, considering their games are only 99¢ each, I'm okay with that. [Added] This game indeed can detect when there are no further moves & reshuffle automatically. However, there seems to be a bug where matching 2 types of fruits in one swap does NOT award a Sunflower power-up as its help file claims; No, you have to match 5 fruits of the same type in order to get that...
B00992CF6W|5|I love it it was awesome it was inspiring to adventure it was a whole world all to myself<br />it was nothing like ive ever played before<br />this game is cool u can build floating houses and underwater bunkers<br />and u can fly and u can build underground houses and bunkers and find underground hideouts<br />and lava pits and build animals and farms floating farms u can pretty much create any thing u want<br />mine craft is awesome a<br />mincraft has different worlds to it is so cool and entertaining maby u should try it out
B006OOHYIC|5|No snorting hogs. No exploding birds.  Relaxing music plays in the background as you attempt to collect pearls.  If you feel stuck just tap the refresh Icon  A very relaxing game.
B00ESF2772|2|Theodore let himself go wild on this one - difficult to read to kids - they don't get it and bored
B0094M2WTM|5|The cast, director and editor on this film were amazing.  Knowing the Penny Chenery was \\"on board\\" made it even more spectacular.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Ever since I picked up the first book to the Hunger Games trilogy, I just couldn't put it down. I was addicted! This book kept me guessing and wondering what would happen next. I applaud Suzanne Collins on writing such a masterpiece. Now I'll be anticipating the movie... Bravo!
0439023513|5|I cannot imagine any reason at all that people who have read the first two books in this series would not rate this book as 5 stars without a doubt. The only thing I can imagine is that perhaps it didn't end the way a reader wanted it too, perhaps it was too much, too deep, too draining, too much emotion, so much so that it made the reader experience emotion that is not often evoked from a book. I put this book down and wanted to cry, finishing it made me feel as though I had run the emotional gauntlet, I can say without a doubt that I will not forget this book or these characters any time soon, if ever. Great job Suzanne Collins, my hat is off to you.
B00FAPF5U0|3|Too hard on some levels, but overall fun.
1878424718|5|Mind blowing information
B00AEFYPQ6|5|Fast transactions , and good quality
B0030A0ZD4|1|I am a huge MJ fan. This video is crap. A bunch of chopped up clips of MJ at various ages and times in his career. I did not even watch it to the end. Seems like a poor excuse to make money off MJ with an inferior film. I do not recommend this it is a waste of money.
B00HY7VU60|5|Excellent show. Can't wait until the next season!
1741798981|5|I loved this guide for London! I used it almost every day to look up sights, shopping, dining, you name it. It was great to have on-hand, easy to both browse and look for specifics (using the index in the back). The pull-out map was also extremely useful. I was in London for 6 days and I used this book every day - I carried it around with me in my purse (a little inconvenient, considering that it's a normal-sized book) but I loved it! I would definitely get a guide from Lonely Planet again. One note: I would say that this guide is for someone who is looking to do some solid sightseeing and traveling, and is appropriate for any age. If you're a &#34;young adult&#34; (whatever the heck that means), you might find the guide a bit boring. But even so, it's got a lot of useful information as well as some great resources about traveling around the city, the country, and to and from the airport, as well as many more tidbits of information.
B00BGI086Q|4|Didn't see this when it was on TV.  Overall, a good effort at producing a superhero TV series.  I have a hard time, though, connecting this Arrow and the fellow playing him with the Oliver Queen Green Arrow I grew up with in the Silver Age and later.  The actor does an okay job but is wooden.  The storylines do avoid to some extent both predicatability and repetitive formulations.  The supporting cast was for the most part very well chosen, especially the woman playing Oliver's Mom.  She's a yummy.  I am curious to see where this goes in Season Two.  But I would have appreciated the real Oliver Queen.  I don't know who could play him.  Matthey McConaughey when he was younger,  I guess.  Oliver needs some fire in the hole.<br /><br />I gave it four stars.  That might bea bit generous.  I recommend but don't expect the moon and stars.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I truly love this series. I am anxiously awaiting Season 3. The acting is very good, and the story lines just draw you right into the Abbey.
B006VFLIYK|5|When I started the book, I wasn't sure I would stick with it, because it made me think Robie was a robot.  However, the more I read, the more I enjoyed it.  When so many problems kept hitting the characters, I'll admit I got frustrated thinking &#34;this is a story - get on with it.&#34;  But I realized we are so used to 1 and 2 hour stories and think everything should happen so quickly.  And that is not real life.  All problems have to be worked through and they take time.  Sometimes lots of it.  Mr. Baldacci did a great job with the character,story line and I look forward to more Will Robie.
B0040I09RM|5|It took me a while to start watching this series. I binged!! Still haven't watched Season 7 though. With that said, this is my SECOND round of watching SOA :)
B00GCBGAMS|3|My view of the book was clouded by the author biography that came with it - that I happened to read first.  Therefore, I did not like it.  His life was a tragedy - as was the life of the main character.  Just sad.
B002MW50KO|5|GREAT!
B0029LCJJS|4|This show takes an exciting look at a crucial time in history.  If you can get past the sex scenes, the show does a great job showing this complex time in England.
0553260111|5|The Bourne Identity, the first in a series of three Bourne books, is one of the best books I've ever read.  I simply could not put this book down.  If you like Clancy, but wish he didn't drag on at times, you'll love Bourne.  Bourne is always on the move, discovering more and more about who he is and what he's capable of.  This book is action packed, but don't expect complex plot twists or the character developement of Literature.  This is spy fiction at its best!
B00FAPF5U0|5|So addictive it hurts!  I love this game except when it tries to sell me things but it keeps me coming back for more.
B00KQFP5GS|4|Surprisingly good. If you like action and\or science fiction, this movie is for you. All the social commentary of the original Robocop has been appropriately updated to reflect the current times.
B0046B8GEQ|5|This movie always makes me laugh.  We have watched it several times as a family and my son is very much in love with the minions, as are many other children.  It is a great movie to entertain the entire family, and does not get old.  It can be watched several times and still makes me laugh.
B00B19F3PG|1|Nothing new! Not very scary.
B0080MPUUK|5|Watching this for the second time was just as enjoyable as the first!  It is brilliantly done, as always for Woody Allen, the music is wonderful, and it is an all around great, entertaining movie.
074356619X|5|this 4 piece cd set was in excellant condition arrived in a timely manner the price was excellant i enjoy listening to this daily love ordering from amazon i have never been disapointed thanks
0399215980|2|I was planning on sharing this book with a class of students, but the size of the book is so small I do not believe I will be able to share it with a class.  I was disappointed when I opened the package and saw the small size.  I had only seen the bigger of the size of this book and that was what I was expecting.
B00CPTUNBK|5|Awesome! Great pony movie! They should do more episodes where the ponies get turned into people and show more characters.
B000QCQ8Y4|5|Jack Reacher never fail his reader,lee child know just how far to take you..This book is just as good as all the other ones in the series...
B00GDFVTZQ|5|Real good play!!
B0038QGXHW|5|this is a stunning, easy album, Charlie has calmed the waters and the result is like sitting an a cozy piano bar at closing in the 60's.  I wish they had continued together all these years...   buy it, you won't be disappointed....
B00DR0PDNE|4|Pretty awesome, much better than Apple TV which I hate.  Only issue I'm having is where's my $20 Google Play credit?  I haven't seen this come through yet....
B00DJFIMW6|4|I love this game
B00RY86HSU|4|good
B007PJFIU6|5|Great game. Family throughly enjoyed playing.  Great for about six people,  trying to figure out the clues are fun to do.
B007SGM084|1|i have read part of the first book and was going to buy it for my kindle but i think the price for a downloaded book should be cheaper than an actual book. shame on amazon for pricing the books beyond reason.
034580404X|5|Loved the series, hated to see it end! Can't wait to see what else she comes out with. I heard maybe something along the lines about his perspective.
B0064TVQ5E|5|Love trying to beat the clock!  Mahjong Deluxe HD free is an addictive game!  I think it is a lot of fun.
B00008MNYS|4|I bought this album last fall through the Amazon UK site (for about double the price).  I think it is such a shame that Robbie hasn't been more accepted by the American public. If you are a Robbie fan, I am sure you will add this one to your collection.    <br />\\"Feel\\" is the first single, but I love the song \\"Sexxed Up\\".  Revolution, Monsoon, Nan's Song, the list of great songs goes on.  Hopefully people will see the humor in Robbie's songs such as \\"Me and My Monkey\\" and \\"Handsome Man\\".<br />If you haven't listened to Robbie yet, check this and some of his earlier albums out.
0792153294|5|I have seen this movie probably over 10 times, and Armaggeddon twice.  How people can say that this movie is boring because of various subplots proves that there is one hellava dumbing down in America going on if people can't  keep stories of regular people and families in crisis straight.  This movie  was more like Armaggeddon than Armaggeddon was.  Politically it was as real  as if it actually happened.  You see it build at the beginning because you  don't know what's being hushed-up and it just goes from there, but  unfortunately there are quite a few people in this country who do not quite  get it.  And these are the same people who either don't vote, or vote for  the best looking politician. <br />I highly recommend this movie and urge  people to listen to it throughout.  Don't be ignorant.
B0083ZRAJS|5|My daughter absolutely loved this book.  She was captivated from the first page and never wanted to put it down. She does not usually do that with books!  We will be getting the other Oz books!
B009ZQC7MY|5|Love everything about it. Love the characters. Love how we have the story of both the Lords and Ladies, and Mai the staff. I love how the staff is treated with respect and compassion by their employers.
B0055PGUYU|4|This book manages to explains scientific and business information without boring you to tears, suggests advice without sounding like (too much of a) self-help book, and provides interesting stories about people and companies.
B005BDZN62|5|A classic.
0440227275|5|Excellent.
0143122010|5|My niece requested this from her gift list. She says it has depth and causes intelligent thinking to occur without effort.
B007FG9LIE|4|This book took a turn I did NOT see coming. I'm excited to start Book 2!
B0049IWQJW|5|A very fun movie for all ages.
B00ISJSPXY|5|Good storyline and beautiful scenery with a touch of romance
B008R3EYZ4|5|This will make a perfect Christmas gift for my Father-in-law! Excellent condition, wonderful shipping, as good as expected. Thank You.
B000FBFMZ2|4|Good SF/cyber punk noir.  Engaged throughout.  Got a bit muddled at the end but a good read, gonna check out more in the series.
B000TR1D1O|5|If you are feeling a bit low and music is a way to retune yourself I highly recommend Louis Prima!  He can make you get up and dance in your living room.  The remastering is good and the band does swing.
