B008BM9L72|5.0|This is actually a very complex and at times a very sad love story with lots of spicy sex thrown in.  I would recommend it to all women.  I had to keep reading, very glad I bought the trilogy.
B00932A6G4|1.0|Im thinking that maybe this computer generated movie and story were not so good.  I turned it off half way through, I just couldnt take it any longer.  Have to give this one only 1 star..for effort.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The game itself is not for me.  I downloaded for the kid I nanny.  He likes it a lot, and it's better w/o the ads.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Enjoyed this movie very much, it really was better than I thought it would be from the previews.  The effects were pretty cool, not bad CGI.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Harry is a flawed and very believable human and a relentless ruthless detective. A man with strong personal values that are challenged and tested many times. I enjoyed the many twists, turns and developments. This was a good read
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell is an excellent game. From the very first time you open this app, you can feel the effort and thought that went into this game. Thr backdrop of the main menu takes to a place, which is rich and horrific in its own way. The soft violin captivates your senses and eagerly you await your first mission. The stages progressively get harder but also have a few easy levels between to give you some relief. Graphics, music and gameplay are very well put together and will give you a relaxing and mindbending good time. Two thumbs way up! Great job.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This is a great action movie. Liam Neeson either kills or beats the crap out of the bad guys. If you like violence in your movies you will like this one.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|Christopher Hitchens was smart, clever, and fun to read if one is of a contrary frame of mind. There is nothing new in this book that would add to the opinions he has written and spoken before. The subject of this book, written as he was dying,deals again largely with his low opinion of religion. I wish he would finally have gotten past the shallow arguments he makes against it in pointing out the inconsistencies of its myths and morality. Hitchens does not believe in a realm of the spiritual, but he does not speak to that issue directly. Rather he attacks the gatekeepers to spirituality, mainstream religions, and assumes he has finished off the former with the latter.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Great action sequences, terrific locales and set pieces, and (mostly) good actors who didn't think they were too good for this sort of popcorn movie. It's definitely a fun modern-day 'Saturday serial' type of action flick. No surprise director Brad Bird did the heavy lifting behind the sublime 'The Incredibles.' A little more Tom Wilkinson and Ving Rhames wouldn't have hurt!
B00973DDN2|5.0|This is The Killers version of Queen's News of the World. Back in the day, it was Queen's 6th album, and though we knew who the band was, that record came out and changed everything for them, rightly so.  Listening to Battle Born even for the first time all the way through, I felt that same way I had so many years ago.  I just had to close my eyes and listen to many of the tracts so I wouldn't be distracted by anything else.<br />Bravo, guys.  May you have the same success on this breakthrough albmum that Queen did so many years ago.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It's an Irish story that's been told before with sadness but for me, a decent ending.  The descriptions of characters and countryside take you back to Ireland. The story comes alive with accent and personalities all to be enjoyed by the reader, and the story though sad, is not without some Irish humor and charm.  I found it to be a very engaging read.
B007V508CC|5.0|I was surprised that this album drew some poor reviews, so I am putting my two cents in.  I graduated from high school in the late sixties, so, granted, my tastes tend to run to old muscle cars and rock from that era (e.g., Zeppelin, Cream), so in a way I have been a little surprised by how much I like Maroon 5, since generally I tend not to like newer bands.  I don't know the current music trends or terms - I just know what I like when I hear it.  I LOVE this group and I LOVE this album.  I love their sound; each album has been a little different, and I like the instrumentation, the way their music has evolved, and the variety of their albums.  I especially love the lyrics of this and their other albums; it always seems to me, anyway, as though the words are carefully selected and often convey a mnessage that is almost \\"heart break\\" in content, something that I find poignant and pleasing.  I have always appreciated Adam Levine's vocals.  I walk early every morning, and this group and its albums are frequent and constant walking companions.  Don't overanalyze this; If you like Maroon 5, give this newest album a try; I think you will really like it.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|There seems to be no rhyme or reason to determining when it &quot;sums&quot;. In an hour of play, and reading the help, I came to the conclusion that either the help needs clarification, or the game is horrifically bugged. Glad I didn't waste money on it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Being ex-military and a fan of Tom Clancy and other fiction military writers, I thought the book well written and a good story. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an overview on the life of a SEAL. I can not speak to the accuracy, as I was never a SEAL.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written, places you in the mission on Bin Laden.  Finally an actual first person account on how it went down.  Appreciated his candor on politicians and the \\"system\\".  Excellent read......
B008JAFXOQ|4.0|This film really is powerful,-these are the sort of stories that should be told about life, death and living in cities like NYC. It just feels real in so many scenes and the acting and writing is excellent, probably the best performance I have seen by Anna Paquin. The death scene is particularly harrowing but again I applaud that they took the time to show this in every slow painful moment as it sets the trajectory for everything that follows. Great film wish more American films were as good as this one but a lot of movie viewers don't like to be disturbed, or see the truth, they want fantasy and to be entertained so Hollywood keeps catering to the majority. If that is your thing don't watch this film because it really is like good art it makes you question, disturbs, challenges and stays with you for a long time after.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I fell in love with Christian Grey since book one but Fifty Shades Freed put the icing on the cake!<br />Great ending to a great book.
B005NACYQU|4.0|Quite a good, exciting read with plenty of humour. Reminiscent of Pratchett in places, though less absurd. Definitely worth a read and a noticeable improvement on Neverwhere.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The Hunger Games is a Science Fiction fantasy film about how future conflicts between societies can be turned into a marketable production, with deadly consequences.  Actually the real time audience (our time) is drawn into the conflict by rooting for the heroine.  This film is bias with regard to race and shows partiality and has a sequence where the \\"magic negro\\" saves the day for the heroine.  Political correctness is becoming all too pervasive in our movies and takes away from the believability of the plot, of which this film is thin on.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Kathy Reichs is my favorite author.  Have read all of her books.  This one is my least favorite.  Off to a<br />great start with 3 newborn deaths to solve, but I was very disappointed with the lack of depth and detail in the plot.  I think this was because the book lacked the usual great interaction between the main characters - Tempe and Ryan.  Could hardly stand the new guy, Ollie Hasty.  I will definitely buy her next book, and love the Viral series that she writes with her son, but Bones are Forever was a real let down for me.
B008EQIJQO|5.0|A delightful movie worthy of the Oscars it received.  So creative in the silent picture format.  Grab a relaxing hot beverage and enjoy this movie with your significant other.  It will be time well spent.
B008H5J510|2.0|UPDATE:<br />Disk 2 was supposed to contain all of the special features, but there wasn't any extra content that I could find on any of the disks, so I am returning my copy for a refund.<br />------------<br />I knew this was going to be very \\"autobiographical\\", but from how it was advertised, I expected it to be as much about the concert experience as it was the behind the scenes story.  This movie however, is a 93 minute VH1 documentary with very little actual concert footage.  Where there is concert footage, it is interrupted by interviews.  Only toward the end are there a couple of songs which were played in their entirety.  I haven't watched any of the extras, so this review is just based on the movie itself.  I'll update my review after I watch the other disks.<br /><br />From what I was able to tell, most of the movie was shot in 2D with a few 3D embellishments.  The concert footage was shot in 3D and looked good, but this was hardly what I would call (or would have paid for had I known) a 3D movie.<br /><br />The movie was kind of an interesting insight into Katy Perry's life, but I walked away from it liking her less.  As written in other reviews, she comes across as stiff and fake as her candy colored costumes and props.  She is supposed to be some sort of role model, but for what, I don't know.  She is a natural beauty who hides behind a phony persona, not exactly role model material.  Her music might have been from the heart at one point, but by the end of the movie, she seems to have become the formulaic act she was fighting against at the beginning.  Granted, it is her formula...or is it?  You decide.<br /><br />Not worth the purchase price (especially for the 3D content) unless you're a die hard KP fan, but probably worth renting.
B0049VZ222|4.0|i didn't know what to expect going in, but it turned out to be a great show.  this was recommended by some family members, which is not always a good thing, but i gave it a shot and was really pleased.  good characters, good storyline, i am looking forward to the next season!
B00932A6G4|5.0|Ery good movie if you are a ST fan. Original movie was awesome and this has many of the same main characters having advanced in their careers. Animation is great medium for this movie. Highly recommend.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Made me think a lot of my dad. I would recommend to anyone.<br />Clint Eastwood gives a wonderful performance as always.
B009329Y30|4.0|This movie was a bit predictable but enjoyed it none the less.  I thought that the subject of post traumatic stress would have made this very difficult to watch, but it was handled gracefully.  While it is a very serious subject, it was nice to see this soldier was able to move on.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|From the time I started reading this book I was consumed with what would happen next. This is one of my favorite books!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|my 5 yr. old. loves  it . I like it . my wife hares it .over all 2 thumbs up,
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it it ok but some games are bad and its games are retared like an Easter egg game . jdbdcbfhd jdnxbcbdh g
B0011Z31V8|5.0|This album is great, it has all his greatest on it. This brings back so many great memories of the Purple Rain movie and all of his other hits!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|So far so good - I'm only about half way through but am totally immersed in it.  It starts out slow but gets interesting very quickly.  Very enjoyable.  Not scary as  of King's books are.
B002U3CCBK|5.0|Fantastic story, hard to put down, better than the movie?  You will really enjoy this book its not only a love story but also one that inspires your to believe in your dream and the chances are your dream will become reality.<br /><br />Loved it
B004ADF7RO|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST. GROW UP WITH THIS MOVIE WOULD WATCH AT EVERY WEEK UNTIL THE TAPE DIDNT WORK ANYMORE
B00846REIS|5.0|This book, although very similar to 50 Shades, was a great book to read.  The story line was very interesting and it was easy to engage yourself in the content and plot.  I thought it was well-written.  I wish I had read this about 20 years ago.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|It's an ok weather app for current conditions but it is missing some key features I look for in a weather app. First the precipitation indicator on forecasts is only a tiny cloud that you have to guess the meaning of. It at minimum needs to add the % chance of precipitation.<br /><br />The other main missing feature is a weather map. They at least should provide a still image of current local radar. Better is the ability to see a short animation of the last few minutes so you can see the direction storms are moving.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Too much sexual detail for my taste and far too often.  I found myself skipping over large amounts of text that were of little value to the story.  Pornographic Mills and Boone.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|good things controls are easy<br /><br />bad things its more like a demo and it keeps saying buy the full version but everytime I put ok it sends me back to the game
B00881VLCE|2.0|Good program for the most part, but pieces can be pushed off screen and become lost with no apparent way to recover them.  Also, the game chooses which pieces to present, so unless you want to dump them all on the &quot;table&quot;, you are stuck with their ordering.<br /><br />I do like the switch that shows only edge pieces.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No wonder the Ombama Gov't wants this censored.  Of course this is just a sample of the gross censures committed by ABC,CBS,NBC,CNN, MSNBC and all the other \\"Main Stream\\" media\\" ... and the greatest coruptor The White House.
B0016492BW|3.0|The Film:  Let's just say that this is one of my favorite comedies of all time.  I have lost count of the number of times I have watched this film or quoted it throughout my life.<br /><br />The Video:  A nice upgrade from the (horrible) DVD, but still a disappointment overall.  The print is cleaned up nicely and the bright exterior shots look decent, but overall the film is too dark, flesh-tones are inconsistent, and its occasionally out of focus (you can see this even more in HD).  It's probably the best this film can ever look, but you'll still wish it looked better.<br /><br />The Sound:  It sounds somewhat better than it looks with a 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless audio track.  Not at all bad for a 40 year old film that was recorded in Mono, just don't expect it to sound like a modern blockbuster.<br /><br />The Subtitles (yeah, I'm calling out the subtitles):  Subtitles are included in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and \\"Subtitles For People Who Don't Like the Film\\", which cleverly inserts scenes from William Shakespeare's 'Henry IV: Part 2' in case you just don't find the film all that funny.<br /><br />Extras:  19 mins of deleted scenes and outakes in HD!.  Many are funny but too silly for even this movie.<br /><br />Overall: One of the silliest and funniest films of all time looks and sounds the best we can probably ever hope for it to be.  If you're a fan it's worth it for the upgrade, just know what to expect.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard so much about the books I had to read for myself. I cannot put them down and am on the 3rd book after a very short time. I love the characters and love the authors writing. This is more than just about sex, this is a great love story as well and I am hooked. I cannot wait to get home and finish reading the 3rd book this weekend.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Another one of those overhyped books. The premise is interesting, the verbiage is prety good, but the only true lesson here is a very old one - in the S&M world, it's the M who has the controls and rightfully so, otherwise it is sheer abuse. I will not purchase 2 & 3 because it is all so very predictable. Ending is pretty abrupt, but than again the writer is clever and knows there is another book(s) to be purchased, except not by me as I said.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|Katherine Hepburn is one of my all time favorite actresses and this movie was fun, romantic and just the perfect cast of characters!  \\"High Society\\" lacked the chemistry and humor of this version.  Absolutely the best!!
B000QRIGJY|4.0|It was good. Similar to most of the series books. It could have been better if you didn't know that it was a local job so early.<br />Since he didn't talk about the specific terrorist, with no background, you really didn't think the murder was anything other than a local job.<br />I'll still buy his next novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game because it is so much fun to play as a group and allcof my friends love it.
B0026772N8|1.0|Never received the book<br /> a s d f  g h  k l z x c v b n m n m
B003OFVIXG|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time. I LOVE it. I listen to it daily and never get tired of it. The seller was quick and efficient. I would not hesitate to buy from them again. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this album and the seller.
B008518MOW|5.0|While I'll admit I'm not a rabid MIB fan, the third installment is fun and has (a little) heart. The 1969 setting served the story well and the production design was faithful to the era. Josh Brolin makes a great \\"K\\" so it's disappointing that (save a spin off set in the early 70's) he will not get to reprise the role if there is a Men in Black 4.
B008KGPEQG|1.0|I purchased this book based on an interesting interview I heard recently with the author on public radio.<br /><br />As a fellow baby boomer, I was interested in learning of his thoughts on the aging process...specifically the psychological aspects. How does he see it?  What are his thoughts about how we boomers will tackle aging issues unique to ourselves?  Our generation is likely to live longer, healthier lives, and be productive for more years than our parents and grandparents.  Many of us are working well into our seventh decade and likely to keep on going.  We \\"do\\" more things than earlier generations.  We have access to travel, entertainment and a myriad of diversions that our ancestors did not.  From the radio interview, I thought the book was about that growing older....the winter of our lives.<br /><br />It is, instead, a retrospect of one man's life.  And, interesting as his life has been, it was not what I sought.<br /><br />This review is not meant as negative toward the author or his story....the work was well done.  I simply want to advise readers who may be looking for a more soul-searching vehicle....that this is not it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game its a great way to relax. I had this game a while back on my phone but now its on my kindle and its even better. love it
B0084I9QIW|1.0|MJ gets 5 stars for this performance, but Sony gets 1 star for releasing it 25 years later.  This should have been the 25th anniversary of the Wembley concert VHS or theatrical release and not a rare find.<br />Those guys as the notorious Dr. Murray was told by a Sony exec \\"Own(ed) the toilet paper MJ wipes (himself with)\\", but could not release one of his concerts from almost 30 years ago? C'mon!!! or like MJ says in the concert, jamoan.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|And yet another fabulous book by Kathy.<br />From start to finish she keeps you on the edge wondering where the tale will end. She brings forensics to the everyday person. Loved it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|the computer version is better -and there is no serviver mode . and less blocks to work with and I don't know what is wrong with the wick play but still its a good minecraft game. no internet required
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Loved the first book but although I'm not done reading second one yet, I'm loosing interest...okay already - we know, you love to have sex with each other....
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Couldn't download to my Kindle fire; despite removing it and re-downloading. My mom has this game and I really want to play it.
0345803493|2.0|WHY is this trilogy so popular!!!!! It took me a while to finally finish this book. It was really  boring and slow. I'm tired of everything working out so perfectly. *spoilers* Grey was freaking in a HELICOPTER CRASH and him and his partner walked away without a scratch. Thank goodness Ana knew self defense so she could fend off Jack the crazy. Thank goodness Christian is paranoid so he can swoop in just in time to save the day. Thank GOODNESS the sex is always mind blowing. SOOO annoying is this book!<br /><br />Also, if Ana is going to use phrases used in British English and if the author is from England then why not set the storyline in England? Americans do not use the word wanton! We say hoochy or slut, OK? The love is on an irrational level, just like Twilight. They would die without each other. DIE!<br /><br />Dialogue is incredibly repetitive. I can't count the times Ana is insatiable or she made a good point, well made, as ever. And let's not forget how many times Ana says Jeez. I wish this trilogy would just go away. I wish they wouldn't make it into a movie. *spoiler* Maybe Jack will succeed in killing them in the 3rd book. A girl can dream.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|PROS: Uninstalling only takes a second.<br /><br />CONS: Poor control scheme, cheap sound (1981 is over), and forgettable track design make for a poor experience.<br /><br />TL;DR Pass on it, and certainly save your money.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app! I have it on my Kindle fire and my phone. It tells you so much information and is a lot more accurate than the stock battery on my phone. The best part is that it's free! Every android user should download this app.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|It took a little getting used to the phrasing being used in the early Eighteen Hundreds. (So many commas.)  But as I began to get into the story it held me entralled.  I could easily visualize the characters and relate to their feelings.  The discriptions are so appealing of the countryside in which the story takes place.  Ms Austen paints a broad picture with her words.<br />I found it very hard to put down.  I wasn't sure that I could enjoy this book on the Kindle but found it just as engrossing as a hard cover book.
B007RAJVR4|5.0|Excellent (Mraz and Amazon), what else can I say?...I mean you have wonderful artist, who's music I listen and sing along to, the ordering process through Amazon was easy, download fast, and now I'm listening everyday. I saw him live thanks to Reverb (you guys rock). His live part on the record was just as good as his concert. I'm so glad I got the deluxe version....I did it, I am A-W-E-S-O-ME :-)
B009329ZF2|2.0|Do you remember the movie Pearl Harbor with Ben Affleck? Great eye candy but a truly bad, bad movie.<br /><br />Well, Hollywood did it again.....Battleship. They took what could have been a fun popcorn movie and turned it into a mashup of ridiculous motivations, unbelievable emotional situations, bad acting, bad writing, and bad direction. If you watch the movie without fast-forwarding when you finish you'll feel like you need a shower and will desperately want your 2+ hours back. Really, it's not even worth a bucket of warm spit!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is pretty cool and definatly better then the first one I think now that's just my opinion. awesome
B007SSEBCU|4.0|This is an outstanding performance by Merrill Streep.  She becomes Margaret Thatcher! If you like biography type movies or books you will love this story, Margaret Thatcher was a pioneer for women in politics!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Nothing but trash!! The book was a waste of money with no plot or purpose other than describing the dark side of two oversexed superhuman beings.
B0060CV31C|5.0|I cannot count the times we have watched this movie.  If you like the humor of David Spade don't miss this. It is hilarious from beginning to end.
B008YYCUES|5.0|i only bought the one episode because i was watching it on tv and missed this one and then missed when they reaired it.  i love this show, i think the writing is very smart but you do have to watch every episode, you miss one and  you will miss something important.  if you have never seen suits i would start at the beginning, its not your normal lawyer show, there are no big court room scenes with soapbox monologues, they hardly ever go to court!  the cases are important but the show is more about the characters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books. Hope the author writes another book - can not wait to read all of the books that she writes.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This boook was great.  I would recomond it to anyone.  Loved the reference to the way people look at time.  After reading it I have now started enjoying the moment rather than looking past the moment and forgetting about what's important.  A great read.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This is a great story this is my second time reading these books, they are a great read i highly recomend them.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I've read about a dozen seal memoirs and if this is the only such book you'll read then you will miss much of what goes into the work these men do. This book tells a gripping account of one seal's experiences and the event leading up to and including the Pakistan raid of the UBL compound. For anyone familiar with seal accounts this is a must read. If you are unfamiliar with stories like this then I would suggest reading Lone Survivor before this book which will provide more background on the introductory training of seals and a very detailed account of a ill fated and tragic operation in Afganistan.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the way this book was written.  It was very unique in that each chapter alternated between the man's and woman's perspective, and the man's perspective was at the present time while the woman's perspective was in the past working toward the present time.  The story had a lot of twists and turns and I found it to be a page-turner.  I couldn't wait to keep reading and find out what happens next.  The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because I didn't like how the story ended for the characters.  However, this is probably a matter of personal preference. Overall, I would recommend this book.
B008I3QZKU|2.0|Always looked forward to a new killers album until now. The Album flows really poorly with a seemingly endless number of ballads. Gone are the well written lyrics and grit of Sams Town and Day and Age now we have great lines like \\"Number In My Cellphone\\".<br /><br />What surprised is how much they have channeled REO speedwagon with flakes of journey, U2, Meatloaf and Duran Duran surfacing here and there.  This honestly feels like out takes from Brandon Flowers's Flamingo album.<br /><br />What's worse is that they put the two best tracks as tracks one and two leaving the rest of the album to trawl through which really just sounds like Flamingo. I'm sure that these songs will go down well in a stadium setting with easy sing along lines etc but wheres the grit of Sam's Town and all that Bruce Springsteenish quality that they used to boast of years prior.<br /><br />The bonus edition i bought had 5 bonus tracks 2 of which were out takes that sounded much better than the album tracks i suggest making your own sequence of tracks up and removing the lame tracks depending on your opinion.<br /><br />The Strongest tracks on this album are; Flesh and bone, runaways, heart of a girl, from here on out, carry me home (outtake) and prize fighter (outtake)...would've of made a good EP<br /><br />1. Flesh And Bone - The albums best track<br />2. Runaways - The single...okay pales to other hits<br />3. Way It Was - Ballad<br />4. Here With Me - Ballad this definitely sounds like REO speedwagon<br />5. Matter Of Time - Mid tempo rock ballad meatloaf quality to it<br />6. Deadlines And Commitments - Ballad stronger than the way it was<br />7. Miss Atomic Bomb - Despite the title another ballad strong Brandon Flowers solo sound<br />8. Rising Tide - By numbers killers track loud quiet loud pixies dynamic not too bad<br />9. Heart of A Girl - The best ballad on here finally something that resembles the killers<br />10. From Here on Out - Bouncy country rocker kind of like something that i said crossed with a bit of Zevon<br />11. Be Still - On the same level as the way it was maybe worse think U2 gospel (like Stuck In A Moment)<br />12. Battle Born - Sams town intro into REO speedwagon lame<br /><br />I brought the 'deluxe edition' in australia which has 5 bonus tracks 2 poinless remixes, 2 out takes that should of been on the album and an alternate version of be still which sounds exactly the same as the one on the album<br /><br />13. Carry Me Home Why wasn't this on the album proper could've used more upbeat tracks<br />14. Flesh and bone remix - pointless remix<br />15. Prize Fighter - Another out take that should of been on the album<br />16. Be Still - Alternate version sounds exactly like the one on the album<br />17. Flesh and Bone - Pointless Remix
1440503257|5.0|Oh my goodness I love this cookbook so much :) I originally bought it to cook things for a Harry Potter-based Halloween party, but I actually use it all the time! It has lots of great recipes and little blurbs about where all these foods originated. The directions are very precise and easy to follow. I would recommend this cookbook even if you aren't a fan of Harry Potter, cuz it has a ton of great recipes! (My favorites are pumpkin pasties, hot chocolate, and kreacher's french onion soup!)
B001HN6EF4|5.0|My kids (4 & 9 years old) and I LOVE to play this.  I carry it in my purse in a pouch (don't use the clip) and it has come in handy while waiting at the Dr's office, at restaurants, on an airplane rides, at the beach, on road trips...our possibilities are endless! It appeals to all members of our family especially to my youngest.  I would buy this for a pre-schooler before I would buy any of your other monotonous board games.  :)  DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY, you will not regret it!  :)
B0084I9QI2|1.0|I seen the footage of this concert today and was super let down! Michael face was blurred at times and images were fuzzy and not clear. What is this? The MJ Estate should of taken the time to do MJ right! They should of released the best of MJ's performances of the bad tour on blu-ray and put this performance as an option to see as a bonus or extra but not as the main concert.<br />The packaging comes with a lot of pic's which is nice and CD of MJ's original BAD CD release and bonus CD of demos and unfinished works.<br /><br />I feel like they bootlegged Michael Jackson and charged me $34 dollars!!! It is not worth $34 dollars the MJ Estate did not think this through they just found a VHS copy of the concert put it on DVD re-packaged the CD and Demos and made it seem like this was going to be something special.<br /><br />Look I just want Michael Jackson the KING OF POP to be given the royal treatment like the other Icons/Legends that have past before him. Elvis, Sinatra and so on.<br /><br />Okay, Has anyone seen Queen release from the early 80's at Wembley Stadium? They released the best of that tours performances and then put the not so good one as a second option for the fans. They didn't put Queen's dark and rainy performance as the only concert, that was just an second option. Queen made sure the fans have the best footage of their concerts out and the not so good concerts as alternatives for the fans to pick and choose. I mean come on MJ ESTATE YOUR DEALING WITH ONE OF THE GREATEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE WORLD AND GIVING THE FANS BITS AND PIECES OF WHAT IS OUT THERE AND IT IS NOT EVEN GOOD QUALITY!! The MJ Estate started off with the worst quality concert as a starter!!!!<br /><br />Michael Jackson is not being given the treatment he deserves as the King Of Pop! FREAKEN ELVIS from the 50's , 60's and 70's has better material released on dvd than this!!! I am very let down by the MJ estate they did not do MJ justice at all. There is better material out there andthey are not utilizing it. MJ Estate took advantage period. The MJ estate could have released the Tokyo Bad performance and put it on Blu-ray and put this as a second option on the blu-ray but not this alone! Come on MJ Estate get creative and give Michael the treatment he deserves and Give his loyal fans the treatment they deserve!!!<br /><br />Don't waste your money wait for the blu-ray sets to come out. Even thought the MJ Estate is trying to rake in as much money as possible with this kind of product they will eventually release better material that will be worth a fans money. Seriously, it looks like someone uploaded this concert to youtube and someone burned it on DVD. I guess I am so upset because Michael always deserves the best he would not release this quality of concert to anyone ever he would of made sure it was perfect, excellent only the best for his fans. MJ Estate is not living up to that with the recent products they have been releasing with Michael's name.
B006VREN86|5.0|Awesome as a reluctant gangster.  Set at the start of prohibition, this series shows how the illegal booze business built up organized crime. In episode one a lowly driver named Al brings a stolen load of whisky to Chicago.  Guess his last name.
B007N85POS|5.0|I purchased this after I had completed all of the regular Angry Birds games. I was glad to have a new Angry Birds game to play.  I will purchase the other HD editions.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|I really liked season five even though the first couple episodes started really slow. The characters progressed nicely and the ending was tragically awesome. It just didn't seem to have the Draper spark like season one did however. I am still purchasing this box set though for sure
B000FC1MM8|5.0|When I saw this unread Bosch book from 2003, I jumped at it and was no disapointed.<br /><br />Connelly's earlier work is simply the best. His developement of characters and mood made him (along with T Jefferson Parker) the undisputed king of LA Noir.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It even surprised me a bit at the end. Great character development - I really cared about the characters and what happened to them.
1878424319|5.0|I read this book while I was on vacation. Immediately, it impacted my life positively on every facet of my life. I feel great and I feel free.  I always take things personal, but thanks to this book, its helping me.  Please read this book and share it with everyone.
B00506NRBS|5.0|This is a great little book and in many ways, in line with the Lean Startup movement, but without the measurement discipline. I am recommending this book to a small entrepreneurs group.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|The angle of the movie was interesting, the special effects are very impressive and Charlize Theron is majestic, she proves once again that she is not just a pretty face, she knows how to think and act, unlike Kristen Stewart who should really rethink her career as an actress. And it's me being nice.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I am really enjoying reading the Stephanie Plum series.  It's so interesting and entertaining.  The way it's written you really get to know the characters and can't wait to see what will happen next.  Especially after seeing the movie based on the first book.  When I read it I can picture what they look like and really connect with the story.  I would recommend this.  Each book is just as good and I plan to continue on through all of them.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|Both kids really enjoyed playing! I had fun with it too :o) Good, clean and a lot of fun! I would buy others like this one.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|What an amazing album. It is full of emotion and poetry that only Rosenberg could create. I cannot wait for more to come of him.<br /><br />Just buy it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this book.  Could not put it down and even gave a copy to a friend.  Can't wait to see how the movie comes out.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the books and the first movie!  Jennifer Lawrence is definitely an actress with true talent.  Some others her age in her field should take note.  Fast paced action ...definitely not a snoozer.  Can't wait for the next movies to come out!  Appropriate material for most teens and up....in my opinion.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Edge of seat reading.  A situation in which none of us dream or wish to ever be involved.  Maintaining one's sanity would be a major issue for any normal human being without an acknowlegement of a \\"murder gene\\". Child rearing is difficult enough on its own. How far do we take family mercies?
B0085A9HXS|4.0|The fight scenes are awesome. It has a good story and great soundtrack. Full of bad asses and guns and swords.
B003B02PF4|4.0|It took me awhile to \\"get into\\" the idea of the story until the characters were defined by their role. This did not deter me from enjoying the book and I found it to be an \\"easy\\" read.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|I chose this movie because i thought that it would be funny.  While it had some funny moments, it was more mushy than humorous.  Don't get me wrong I love mushy.  That's just not what I was expecting.  The movie touched on several issues that can and do happen during pregnancy.  Some happy. Some sad.  It was an OK movie
B006WWNUFC|5.0|Great season! I have watched them all!! Love the characters and the actors! Great show And it hasn't lost anything with progression like most series do.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Jack Reacher has again used his years in the military, general athelticism (size) and all round life experiences to defeat the bad guys. Another great Lee Child book.  I can't wait for his next.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />M
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this immediately after the first book and couldnt put it down! This book is a good segway into 3 which blew me away. I \\"borrowed\\" it from the Kindle library and actually purchased it so that I could re-read it and I could share it with my son.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Yeah their is alot of \\"extra curricular\\" activity but the story line is great.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|Not sure why Amazon is asking me to rate a product I returned that was an accidental purchase... I bought the Fire HD-hated it, so I returned it, had already ordered this case so returned it when it came and would not fit the original Fire.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Great escape from the rest of the world, especially if there's no place to escape to outside your own space .
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A fine depiction of the training of our SEAL teams and the development of Middle-East intelligence.  A truly gripping portrait of the coordinated attack on Bin Laden's compound.  Highly recommended.
B008602KQI|5.0|MY DAUGHTER WATCHED THIS WITHOUT ME.....SHE LOVES IT VERY MUCH. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT. I'VE SEEN THE PREVIEWS AND LIKED THOSE.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I valued this book for its account of how the author's SEAL team trained for and carried out the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden. However, I felt I had to wade through too much other material about the author's other missions, material that was only peripherally relevant unless you want to know how much he suffered in his training. Fans of Tom Clancy will also enjoy this book because of the author's preoccupation with technical details about weapons.
B001NAT05W|5.0|I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE---ALREADY WATCHED IT 1/2 DOZEN TIMES. I HAVE IT IN VHS FORMAT, JUST HAD TO HAVE THE DVD. I REALLY LIKE HALLE BARRY. I'LL WATCH IN MANY MORE TIMES..... PLUS I LOVE CATS.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Wonderful historical piece with likeable characters.  Looking forward to reading the second in the series. It is loaded in my kindle fire now!
1612680011|1.0|I had a teenage student who loved the Kiyosaki series. The 15 year old was sure he was on his way to becoming the black Donald Trump. I said to him \\"you live in Harlem, your family is beset by troubles, you've been suspended from school three times this year for trumped-up charges, and you're certain your teacher is a former pro-wrestler. Why no write a book about this? You could make $10,000.\\" The little genius, like anyone who reads RICH DAD POOR DAD, ignored advice from someone who knew how to manage money.<br /><br />There are many financial gurus in America. Some are good, like Suze Orman, and some are crazy, like Robert Kiyosaki. Suze Orman advises readers to have basic life insurance, avoid credit cards, and be stingy with their money. Kiyosaki advises against overspending, unless you're spending the money on high risk foreclosed property in a state that's 2,000 miles from where you live. He's nuts, and that's putting it mildly. He contradicts himself throughout the book, warning against buying a house as an investment, then telling you to invest in foreclosed houses in Arizona and renting them out. The last time I checked, houses are foreclosed because there's nobody to buy them, and that probably means there won't be anyone to rent them either!<br /><br />Throughout RICH DAD POOR DAD, Kiyosaki keeps giving anecdotes about a man he knew from childhood, an uneducated businessman who became the richest man in Hawaii. He talks about this guy starting out as a salesman, then owning a small store, then several stores, then having beach property, hotels, and more, more, and more, most of it bought with no money down, just a leverage on what he already had. Problem is, nobody's sure who this man was. In fact there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of information on the man that Kiyosaki keeps using as an example. All we know is that he went to the US Maritime Academy, joined the Marines, became a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, then a salesman for Xerox in Hawaii.<br /><br />I admit that I loved this book when it first came out and believed every word of it. Looking back, I know I was conned, and Kiyosaki is a brilliant con man (got to give him credit for that.) If you want to know how a con man rips people off, read \\"King of the Gypsies\\" by Peter Maas. The best way to con someone is to \\"take the mark exactly where he/she wants to go,\\" and Kiyosaki takes the reader there. We believe these things because we want them to be true. Who wouldn't want to believe that you can retire early with millions in the bank, by making investments in real estate? Con men don't sucker you through hostility. He won't say \\"you can never be as rich as me no matter how you risk your life savings.\\" He'll say \\"I got rich this way, and you can too!\\"<br /><br />I've read three of Kiyosaki's books, and I can tell you exactly why his advice is crap; he blew a great chance to make a profit! The guy went to the Maritime Academy because he wanted to \\"learn how to lead people.\\" Given, that's a worthwhile reason. He became a merchant marine officer, which if you're shrewd, can be a ticket to wealth. He could've eventually owned his own ships and become an importer/exporter. But then he quit after one year to enter the Marines, became a helicopter pilot, and left that after his four years were up. Now why do that? Marine helicopter pilots are well paid. So are civilian helicopter pilots, and seeing as this guy is from Hawaii, he could've made a fortune ferrying people between the islands. With a degree from the Maritime Academy, he could've run a fleet of boats that ferry tourists and goods between the islands. A fleet of choppers and boats would've been profitable, and he could've eventually monopolized the Hawaiian industry. But he didn't. He never seems to stick with anything for too long.<br /><br />I do know of a real estate success story, but it's nothing like what you see in RICH DAD POOR DAD. New York City had an auction of foreclosed property at the Jacob Javitz Center, and a $5000 deposit was required. One of the visitors bought four properties at $20k each; they were tiny wooden houses in Jamaica Queens, which he intended to rent out. This man lived in the area, so he could drive around and check on his rental properties daily. But he also knew how to manage property, from his days as a building superintendent. He knew how to profit from foreclosed houses, but more important, he knew how to \\"spread his bets\\" to avoid losses.<br /><br />Don't take any of Kiyosaki's advice unless you have years of experience. Most of this book is a one-way ticket to a lifetime of debt.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book, read it with my book club. Each time I thought I figured it all out, the plot took another twist so it kept you wanting to turn the pages. However I did skim some of the descriptive narratives, just too much of the same thing at times. Have not discussed it with book club yet, will be interesting to see how they all rate it.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I have read many of Michael Connelly's books and they never disappoint. This was one of his older ones.  It keeps you guessing right to the end.  Great read!
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is an excellent book, one I plan on recommending to my friends and family. Thank you, Mr. Albom, for writing a compassionate, thoughtful account of your faith journey and sharing it with us.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|A great young adult read. Murder, going home to confront the past, and small town issues play the antagonist in this youthful look at a murder mystery.
B00973DDN2|2.0|This really is a disappointment.  I am a Killers aficionado, with Sam's Town and Hot Fuss staples in my car's 6-disc changer.  I also enjoyed Day and Age for what it was - a good, solid album with a few killer tracks.  I was hoping Battle Born would be at least Day and Age quality and crossed my fingers it might be as good as one of the earlier discs.<br /><br />Instead, the Killers seem to have put out an album featuring one pretty solid radio single in Runaways and nothing else at all.  Don't listen to the rest of reviews on here claiming there are lots of really good singles on here if you, like they, \\"get\\" The Killers.  Those people are looking for quality because they don't want to believe The Killers would put out a garbage album but they in fact have.  Buy the \\"Runaways\\" single and \\"run away\\" from this album.  And hope their upcoming live shows stick to the classics.
B004X80QNG|1.0|it workwd great before i updated it now it wont even load. i loved it and now cant use it. :(
B006J38144|5.0|This show has you from the moment you start watching it. Great story, and great actors. I highly recommend this show to anyone.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|works great for my kindle fire. i mainly use it to copy and paste recipes from the web on it. very simple and straightforward .
B006N57PXG|3.0|Can't recommend this book ,Could of been a lot better.Got tired of trying to stay with story.Deffiently for children only.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Poor prose, trite subject, turns out to be a rosy romantic little story, containing repetitive lines, such as the protagonist's habit of biting her lips or her observation about his long fingers, or the color of his eyes. Like a soap opera, it keeps the reader's attention as to what is to follow in the pair's relation. Nothing more.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|I bought into the hype recently and have almost caught up to the most recent season of Mad Men. What a great show!
B008XG1X18|4.0|The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it tends to lock up & need to shut down......
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Craig Johnson has created a series of books that are a delightful read. I laughed right out loud in places! The mystery was good and the characters are very \\"seeable\\" with depth and color. The setting is awesome. Even though I have not been there I can picture it in my mind. It is like the A&E series but contains more detailed information. I learned some information in the book that I did had not known. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I hope Craig keeps on creating. I read the book on my Kindle and have the next one ready to go. It was recommended by both a friend and her husband.
B00377E5SG|5.0|Love the original, love the remake :) Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Greg Kinnear is too. Funny storyline and great pairing of actors.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|The content of the book was good and it was fun getting to know the characters although I felt the writing could have been better. There is a good underlying message in the story which is not really evident until most of the way through the book and then I was looking forward to the next book to see if Ana achieved her goal. Captivating!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is a must own for puzzle lovers. It is paint by number with a puzzle background. They constantly update the game with new puzzles which are of differing difficulty and makes some great pictures when completed.  This game is highly recommended for any fans of puzzle games.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved to escape to the world of Christian Grey and Ana Steele, and in this book, as the other 2, that happens in a nice way!<br />Loved it!
B0091P6590|5.0|Harvey goes to the dark side! Everything you thought was going to happen (maybe) and more.  Season two finale is just as exciting as the rest of the series. Can't wait for season three!
B002R88G5E|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and am recommending it to everyone. A beautifully written tale of 2 women living in a country I now realise I know very little about. A bit of a history lesson (a very interesting one!) intertwined with a heartbreaking story. Once I started I couldn't stop reading, it was just the book I'd been searching for after the torture of 50 Shades. Loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Simple and very easy to use Calculator. I am surprised that this app is not part of the default applications bundle with the kindle. I particular like the large buttons for the display.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Well I had to do it. I was sick of this book being in the top 10 (usually the trilogy being top 3) week after week, and hearing about nothing else - the curiosity got the better of me. Thank god it's over! I forced my way through it purely because I don't like not finishing a book. It wasn't as poorly written as I had expected (though it was no literary award winner) but it was just so...boring! The sex scenes were ok, if that's what floats your boat, but the rest was mind numbing dribble. I cannot help wonder HOW this book got everyone talking???<br /><br />Perhaps you'll be like me and just read it so now you know what it's all about and can join in those conversations, but I wish I'd spent my time reading something more worthwhile. My advice: don't bother!
B00846TTDG|2.0|This story line is of personal interest to me, however this movie is not worth your time. There are plenty of books written by real Frogs which ARE worth your time and effort to locate & read.<br /><br />Richard Marchinko is just one voice you should hear....
B007VUA7VO|4.0|easy to read. also easy to use. gives a good idea of different apps an<br />d the. battery usage it takes.  very much recommended
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The sex in this story is very explicit and can be very provocative(hot).  However, there is too much sex and not enough story.  At times, because of the amount of sex used in the story it becomes boring.
B005UKKAZA|5.0|I've been a fan of How I Met Your Mother since season 1. I absolutely  love this show! And can't wait for next season to start .
B0088X7YMS|2.0|You really need to be a SicFic fan to enjoy the Trooper series. First, it was disapointing to see an animation, although well done. It would have been nice to get a warning in the Amaszon sales pitch that it was anima and not live action.The movie had some of the same grit as the first, but the underlying themes weren't there. Kinda how they ruined the Robo Cop series.Nice T&A, fair on killing bugs.
B003B02O14|5.0|Typical of a Grisham Book, the author gets the reader in the story immediately. Interesting plot of a large firm lawyer gets upset with his firm and bolts away to a small town firm with two shady lawyers making just enough to keep them going but always hoping to make big score. Easy entertaiing fast read.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is a great Pink Floyd album that has endured the test of time. Money and breathe (in the air)are classic tracks.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loving the story. Usually, I champion the woman but even though the husband isn't perfect, she scares me! Just started reading a few days ago and I am almost finished......hate for it to end but can't wait to find out what happens!
B008JAGG38|1.0|I bought this to watch on my kindle fire and the entire movie would not stop buffering. After about 10 minutes I stopped trying to. It was awful.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|its really fun and competitive lol we keep trying to beat each other score my partner and I only problem sometimes the number wont move when you tap them
B001RP1G0U|5.0|This movie is wonderful!  The dog steals the show as do the actors, Diane Lane and John<br />Cusack.  I watched this movie with my golden retriever, Chance right next to me on the couch.  He especially liked the dog scenes!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app was a great app when I first got it, and I couldn't believe that it was free! Then, after using it almost daily, one day it stopped working properly. If I tried to play or download videos, it would bring up a message claiming a connection problem. here's how to fix it. first, make sure you're device allows apps from &quot;unknown&quot; sources. ( on kindle fire you can find this option in device settings) next, open the app and tap share with friends. then click on the link to the app website. search for the freedi youtube downloader, in the search box. click on the free version. delete your old version of the app, then download the app! (click on the notification to install) this works because the version on the website is not yet available in the app store. enjoy!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Good movie. It mostly followed the book. I will watch the sequel Catching Fire when it comes out. Hopefully it will be as good.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I've been entertained for a coupe of Weeks with this game. I went through the campaign on easy, then again on normal. Normal was challenging at times. I think the so is not smarter; but just get more money to buy units. I look forward to hard mode.
B004GYY714|5.0|I downloaded the iheart radio app not listening to the reveiws about face book. its great that this app doesn't need a facebook to work. love the stations. and sound quality. also I love the fact it gives you the name of the songs your listening to
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Having read all of King's books, I feel that this is one of his best.  I didn't want to put it down. It really put you back to the 50's and 60's in a way that us \\"old folks\\" can really remember.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]A very entertaining book with emphasis on the leading up to the actual raid. A good deal of interesting information on the makeup of the military and the actual people involved in the raid.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Having read book one and two, before completing book three, I do believe that this booked could have been completed in book two, as the story line kind of fizzles out in book two and then pick up again in book three.. very basic story and characterization. If you want a simple read that is not a complicated story, you will enjoy this trilogy...
B00190OHD6|5.0|This was a romantic, and sad at times, but uplifting movie.  I really enjoyed it.  Men would consider this a 'chick flick', but it is well worth watching!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i have not finished the book yet but i do love it--i liked book 1 and i will read book #3--i'm  really not into s and m but it does have a great story behind it
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|This is a wonderful, romantic movie ... I just LOVE it.  Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves were really good in this movie!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a highly addictive game.Easy to learn and reasonable price to purchase additional pictures. Very cute and colorful with many versions of amount of pieces.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Its hard to put this book down once you get into it.  I cant wait to read the next book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omg! Best game ever!  perfect for on the road. Doesn't freeze loads fast. Best game ever! Worth the money! Get It!
B008KMHFJY|1.0|A friend highly recommended this book to me and said it was a good, easy, trashy read, in the same vein as 50 Shades. I can appreciate a fun read, but the more I read this the more I was disturbed. Travis is extremely violent, possessive and stalker-ish. His reaction to another man even looking in the same direction as Abby is to seriously and severely beat them to significant injury while everyone looks on. This book made me think about the current genre of books out there, and scarily how young women may be viewing this sort of violently possessive dominance in a relationship as 'normal'. In reality most women would run for the hills! I didn't find anything passionate or endearing about their relationship at all, and I've struggled to finish the book. I also thought it was more poorly written than the 50 Shades books. However from the reviews I can see that many people are enjoying it.<br /><br />As an aside, I was blown away by Slammed and Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover and would highly recommend them as an alternative!
B0025WG4SS|5.0|It's fantastic to find an MP3 download that hasn't been \\"digitally remastered'. This is one of them. Like I said, GREAT memories.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is perfect for my kindle fire &amp; has never crashed nor have I had an issue with it (:
0439023513|2.0|The pacing of this book was just off.  The descriptions of actions seemed more suited to instructions in a script rather than something for me to visualize as I was reading.  The intensity of the other books was lacking because days and weeks could pass in a sentence with little notice.  Sigh.  I was a latecomer to the trilogy anyway because I had started the first book twice and hadn't been caught up.  When I understood that it was a teen novel, I was able to overlook the writing style and get into the story.  If this had been the first book, I never would have read the others.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Daft Punk and this is the album that started it all. Even after all these years it never fails to be great.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is addictive. I like the different weapons and their uses. The images are funny and saving the peasants adds a different level of challenge.  I would definitely recommend this game if you liked Angry Birds.
B008ASLNN2|3.0|Entertaining movie but difficult to follow at times. I love Robert Downey Jr. so it was worth the money but not the best plot. Seemed predictable and cliche. I liked the slow motion breakdowns and visual effects. Made it worth watching.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching \\"The Hunger Games\\" I bought all three books in the trilogy - am rereading them again and will probably repeat.  Love the characters and the plot line.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|From the very first page I was captivated.  This account of the Bin Laden mission is a real page turner.  As a former Marine I respect all of the Armed Forces but now particularily the Navy Seals.  A really great read.
B0091REZMW|5.0|one of if not my very favorite games!!<br /><br />I just would like a little more explanation and guidance to the new friends and gifts. some of that is a bit confusing. but love this game!!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Loved this book. It contained real twists and turns and kept me guessing until the end. Amazing how warped human nature can be!
B0026O475M|5.0|Who ever knew that loosing a soccer ball can be so sad? Hanks gives us a wonderful performance in this heartbreaking movie. Tears, survival, lost and heartbreak. An award winning movie definately worth watching!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is very good.  These men give up a normal life to serve our country.  I think anyone who wants to be in office should spend a month working as hard as these men do.  Maybe then the Oval Office wouldn't risk their lives so easliy.  These men don't play golf seven days a week.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|The game was fun when it would play. It would constantly freeze and restart my phone. . . . Droid x. So i uninstalled.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting, easy to read and hard to put down.  If there were any State secrets, I missed them.  Both my husband and I read it and felt the same.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great read, these guys put themselves on the line every day. Very well communicated. Hard to put down once started. Every reader will be amazed, how throughly the mission is developed.
B008ER9QLK|3.0|I have never been a big fan of Levine's Wagner, especially his \\"Ring\\" performances, although in Bayreuth he faired less Italianette since there is only so much he could undo there.  I saw these performances live in the local theatres and his \\"Rheingld\\" here seemed more or less like before, again on the lighter, Italianette side; but his \\"Walkure\\" here showed some real promise.  Then Luisi stepped in.  I have studied and been to the entire \\"Ring\\" my whole adult life, and I never thought I would be unmoved by the \\"Immolation Scene\\" but it happended with Luisi.  He literally marched through out.  He indicated in his on-screen interviews that he wanted to take out the \\"Germanic elements\\" in the performances, and whatever you may view those to be, he certainly took all the fire and intensity out of the last two installments of this \\"Ring.\\"  Most of the time he stays out of the way so as not to let the orchestra come unglued but there were a couple close moments, especially in \\"Siegfried.\\"  But his light, quick concept seems totally at odds with the intent of the music and the dramas.  Fortunately, there was some very fine singing throughout, with some strong characterizations.  Too bad the camera-work got so closeup to show nose-hairs, dings in the sets, and other stage equipment and lighting.  And \\"The Machine\\" (as it became known) for a principal stage set - how tiring, even by the time the \\"Ritt\\" occurs in \\"Walkure\\" Act III - comical.  But for those unfamiliar or those who want a modern \\"Ring\\" should buy this to hear and see what is up with this greatest of all musical accomplishments - at least in the US.  For the real sound one has to go to Europe, and of course, especially Bayreuth itself for the sound this piece should have, although not necessarily for the staging (I have been and it can be distracting).
B005XOPEOU|4.0|Let me start by saying that I was not a Coldplay fan until recently. I had really only listened to a few of their well-known previous songs (Clocks, The Scientist, Viva La Vida, etc). Then, my girlfriend took me a Coldplay concert. It could just be the positive association with her, but I'm really starting to enjoy their music. I listened to a lot more of their catalog, starting from Parachutes and ending here with Mylo Xyloto.<br /><br />Since I've listened to a lot of Coldplay all at once lately, I can say with certainty that this album is quite a bit different than the previous ones. It's more upbeat, it's more electronic, it's more \\"produced\\" (though unlike some of the more critical reviews here on Amazon, I don't view that as a negative; I was a percussionist in a previous life and I'm never going to knock anything for being upbeat). Music snobs are going to gripe but I doubt most people will notice.<br /><br />Mylo Xyloto isn't the best introduction to the band either. [[ASIN:B001VWBFTG Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends]] is a better album to start with if you're getting in on Coldplay late like I did. And I think that album is a better album as well. But it's always good to hear a band try a different style and there are some good tracks on this one - Every Teardrop is a Waterfall is so good, it gets its own intro track, MMIX. Since this is a gapless album, I've found myself listening to large parts of it instead of just one or two songs at a time, though the end doesn't link back to the beginning as Viva La Vida did.<br /><br />Overall, it's not really earth-shattering or groundbreaking, but it's something different and it's catchy, and that's enough. If you get a chance, see their live show. That's what really sold me on a lot of these songs, and they performed them in concert with gusto.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved the honesty and frankness of this book. Just enough details of the life an elite SEAL and the dedicated hard work needed, not only to become a member of such a highly trained team, but what it takes to maintain the skills. As far as all the crap I'm hearing about the government looking to file a law suit against the author and co-author, I think it is more posturing on their side because the author was very honest in his criticism of their encumbered thinking and feet-dragging when it came to rendering badly needed quick decicisions and support. Unfortunately, being a veteran myself, I know this is typical beauracacy. I didn't know how much luck played in getting Osama on this particular mission, but there usually has to be some for success.....despite our government's lack of quick action. And to learn that it was a twenty-something female CIA Analyst who figured out where he would be is fascinating. Great read!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I loved this album so much! I'd constantly heard \\"It's Time\\" used in various shows and commercials and decided to look the band up. So I glad I did! I loved every song on the album!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book wasn't exactly suspenseful since I knew how the story would end, but it was definitely attention-grabbing.  I felt this author provided the most honest account of what happened when bin Laden was killed that I've heard.  Though the ad said the book had the potential to affect the November election, that may have been a bit of oversell.  It might change the election if they try to prosecute Seal Team 6 member \\"Mark Owen\\" for sharing supposedly classified information.  I seriously doubt that any of our enemies would benefit from anything in this book.  They might benefit from the White House leaking that it was Seal Team 6 that finally accomplished what most Americans have been hoping for since 9-11.  My hat is off to the courageous men and women who are fighting this dangerous and frustrating war on terror where many of the people we are assisting will shoot you in the back if given the chance.
0307730697|5.0|Simply put, this man makes me proud to be an American. This book is an unbelievable journey into the life of Adam Brown; a story he asked to be told.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|Snow White is a film I didn't see in theaters. It's not that fairy tale films don't appeal to me, its just that I didn't want to watch a film about Kristen Stewart. I was completely wrong, I should have given this film a chance because now that I've seen it at home I think it's FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Albeit, there are problems but the film really works where it needs to. This is not the story of Snow White, this is the story that surrounds Snow White. It really should have been called The Queen and the Huntsman, or Snow White and the Queen... because in either case, the Queen, played to perfection by the gorgeous Cherlize Theron, is the real, central figure to this film.<br /><br />Snow White and the Huntsman begins with the typical telling of Snow White. Snow's real mother is walking in the snow, pricks her finger and three drops of blood fall to the ground while she imagines having a baby. I would expect visuals like this so it starts off pretty well. As it flows we get into the awesome scenes with Cherlize... I mean the Queen.<br /><br />Snow's mother dies and soon after a ferocious army of orc-like creatures attacks the Kingdom. Snow's father, the King, defends his Kingdom and easily defeats the army of warriors that cracks to pieces when hit by swords. Okay.... After the army's defeat the King finds a beautiful woman locked up in a wagon and immediately falls in love with her. IMMEDIATELY marries her the next day because.... she is a witch! Using her beauty as a spell to lure powerful men to herself, it's Cherlize Theron taking over the Kingdom! There is a beautiful marriage scene and then, before you know it, Cherlize, now the Queen, kills the King, murders anyone who stands in her way (really, the imagery is not for kids) and with the help of her strangely obvious, perverted brother, takes the Kingdom.<br /><br />From this point on the film is just short of amazing. We see the young Snow White as a now youthful Kristen Stewart and the film chooses to keep her dialogue to a sweet minimum (good choice). When she does speak, its useful and not annoying. We see the stark difference between the evil, beauty stealing Queen (she sucks the beauty out of any woman, not the YOUTH, but the beauty. If you're an ugly gal, you're pretty much safe from the Queen) and the beautiful, genuine innocence of Snow White. Snow White, locked in a tower (and it looks rough, really) is praying the Our Father in a hushed whispering tone and I'm simply blown away. Not many producers or directors would show a character praying these days. It was really refreshing and really set the tone of the film.<br /><br />The film tackles all the Snow White tent poles while giving us amazing imagery from the evil Queen and her just as evil brother without messing with the crux of the Snow White story. Hemsworth as the impossibly handsome Huntsman is a good addition to the story, and the impossible situation that brings the Huntsman and Snow White together is not toyed with as in usual Hollywood films... they know they are in a bad situation and do not use humor to break the mood. The Prince of the story, the son of a Duke fighting the Queen, is actually just as amazing as the rest of the characters. He is a fighter, a kind of Emo Legolas who can actually walk the walk.<br /><br />The film does have problems, most notably the large cast of characters gives almost no time for the seven dwarves to have good development and they almost seemed like an unneeded addition to the story... which is weird, since it used to be Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.<br /><br />Several moments seemed rushed (the aftermath of the infamous, spell breaking Kiss wasn't very climatic for me) and the romance was really left up in the air (bummer for Huntsman).<br /><br />However, the Queen with all her evil awesomeness, her amazing outfits, her flawless performance and even sympathetic life is really the heart of this story. And its worth a good watch.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it, despite the recent news of the actors bad life decisions which kind of hurt the movies reputation I think.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is really alright in this film. Not exactly the greatest but she pulls off the innocence remarkably well. One or two of the dwarves will knock your socks off, Hemsworth is amazing, as always. Cherlize Theron steals the show, but all in all, Snow White and the Huntsman is a good ride.<br /><br />Give it a shot and enjoy it! I recommend popcorn because this film is a lot of fun. Four out of five stars.espite the recent news of the actors bad life decisions which kind of hurt the movies reputation I think.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is really alright in this film.

B008EQIK90|2.0|I thought this movie was going to be funny but it was one of those movies where the jokes and acting just didn't do it for me.  It was trying to be overly funny.  I really like J. Hill and all of his movies but I thought this was his worst.  C. Tatum I just don't like as an actor especially when he is trying to be funny.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Emily Giffin is a writer who lets you know her characters well, warts and all and causes you to like them and want to cheer them on.  I was thoroughly involved with their lives and didn't want the story to end.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I always look forward to Kathy Reichs books; they are welll developed and entertaining.  The plot keeps you guessing. The books are better and different from the tv series \\"Bones\\". Enjoyed this book; it is a fast read.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I would give it 0 stars...if it was an option!<br /><br />Reads like watching her on TV.<br />Gets old really quickly
B009329Y30|5.0|I loved the movie I wish my guy would be as much of a man as zac Efron was in this movie
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Cant remember the difference between the first an second installments in this current version of the franchise but who cares.  a fun if predictable romp.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|Timed to coincide with the Resident Evil: Retribution theatrical release.<br /><br />This series just keeps getting better with each sequel and I loved this one because it expanded more on the character of Alice and her superhuman abilties and it also introduced the idea of a cure (well somewhat) for the T-Virus.<br /><br />The whole Resident Evil storyline gets better with each movie but the fact that the directors are not permanent does kind of take away from everything (I do applaud the return of Paul W.S. Anderson in Afterlife, though).<br /><br />It took m a second or third watch to figure out if Oded Fehr and Mike Epps characters even knew who Alice was because they seemed kind of oblivious to her presence even though they escaped Racoon City and liberated her from an Umbrella Corp. lab in Apocalypse (maybe that was the fault of the script, acting, direction or maybe it's just me).<br /><br />But overall this was a great movie with a great cast and killer Crows and should not be missed. also check out the other movies in the series.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I so fun. I love this game so much I can play it all day! I'm kya and I am 8 years old.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was well written but that's it.<br />I liked the movies costumes but that sucked just as bad as other movies ive seen
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I really like the game, but it's hard to tell the difference between the tiles.  I use it on my Kindle so it's kind of small.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Love the tv show has great picture didnt have to load one time after it started unlike netflix constant loading. Also great price only 13.99 for whole season. Went to get season 7 but was $24 so I didn't a buy it a little to expensive but over all good product
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was hoping for an account that talked a lot more about the actual operation. I didn't expect so much background information on other operations that had no real significance on the Bin Ladin compound raid.<br />It's definitely worth the read and interesting, but disappointing that the actual raid is not more central in the book. The style used is almost exactly the same as in the book 'Delta Force'.
B009157BWU|3.0|Although I did enjoy it as I enjoy documentaries of that sort, it was kind of slow, but nothing wrong with that.  It's just one of those movies/documentaries that you want to see at least once, but probably never again.
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Hunger Games, the movie, didn't come close to the book. It left no impression on me and I can hardly remember the actors.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|It was ok to watch once, but I probably wouldn't watch it a second time.  The kids enjoyed it and it had a good message, but once was good enough.
B0078XHAB4|4.0|the book talks about death in an unusual way. there are lots of details on moods and hopes. I liked it and shared the emotions of the characters.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie just as much as the Transformers movies.  I thought it had good action and a great ending.  Definitely a movie I would purchase.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|First book of Mr Follett's I have read ,very engaging novel and for the most part based on actuality ,with only the participants fiction, they also could have been based on actual people .It moved along at pace and anyone who likes a good read with an appreciation of history would enjoy this book very much .It swaps from country to country who are the main protaganonists in WW1 namely Russia ,Germany ,Britain and USA and each change always piques your interest and leaves you wanting more of the story .Realising it's going to move to another book (1st book of a trilogy)and having read prior reviews that indicated it was a stand alone book.The ending was rushed ,as though the author was told you must finish now .It did not tie up a lot of loose ends very satisfactorily or add to the spectrum that we would learn more about these characters in the follow up .<br />Still, enjoyed it and look forward to now reading the second book
B005IQZB14|3.0|I originally had little interest in reading this book.  Then I watched it climb the charts.  Maybe I was missing something...  Anyway, I enjoyed the book but would not put it in any of my \\"very favorite\\" lists.  The story was fascinating in that she made a pledge to herself and stuck to it, especially since she was so totally unprepared.  Her courage (or stupidity) has to be honored!
B00122N0MU|5.0|From the over-played Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing to the over-done, 8+ minute Tunnel of Love, these tracks pull me back into the head of a teenager, reminding me what it felt like to be young, in love, and clueless. I'm not saying that those were the best days, but through the fog of nostalgia, they were amazing times of discovery. Romeo and Juliet, So Far Away, Skateaway, Walk of Life... each was a secret anthem for a trial of triumph of that young man's life. Then there's Telegraph Road, the one that came too late to catch my ear, to late to touch me as I sailed away under the watchful eye of Ronbo the Cold Warrior. Sometimes I my dreams about times long lost have these songs as their soundtracks. Yet, the funny thing is, the name Dire Straights never seems to jump into my mind when someone asks about favorite bands.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app is awesome.  It can really help you get the most out of your wireless equipment, by helping you determine your signal strength, and showing you how many networks within range of you are on the same channel.  It will help you avoid the inteference from those other networks.  I love it.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is more than a dictionary its very useful information just like typing a word into Google it gives u lots of information ..
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Amazingly addictive read, couldn't put it down. Highly suggest it to anyone who loved 50 shades. Great story line and a fun read all in all.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Too much war games and not enough character study. The first book held me spellbound, the second, not so much, but the third left me yawning. Sorry as she is a great writer, but I lost the plot.
B008XG1X18|3.0|stalls a few times but not too bad.  will sometimes just stop or close on me. like it better than Pc version.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Best. Adaptation. Ever. Jennifer Ehle plays a lively Elizabeth and Colin Firth a perfect Mr. Darcy. This is a movie you can watch over and over and savor over several days--if you have the self-control not to watch it all in one sitting.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome book, such a great story line for killing Osama Bin Laden.<br />Government is trying to get this book out of stores, I recommend buying this book.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|AWEsum is an amazing an a AWEsome game for not only kids but adults also remember this phrase.AWEsome AWEsum.It is also a great game for loud children who need to be kept busy.
B004PLT3TY|5.0|My daughter and I both love this movie...there is a bit of violence, but it didn't seem to be too over the top.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm glad he wrote this book. I think this is a good time to let the people know what's going on in our nation and the military. This book answers a lot of questions surrounding this event.<br />I thank him for writing this book he has guts and courage.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|This is another interesting tale of English History.  It is a wonder that England survived it's bloody battles for power and control.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|This is a well written book with a clear explanation of the author´s point, including thought experiments and many references to support.<br />A plain, non-technical language is used, so it can be read by those not expert in the many scientific topics touched.<br />I think the only point against this book, is that in a few parts it tends to make a point \\"merely because of the point\\", stablishing an opinion instead of supplying an argument.<br />A book of rational atheist and agnostics, and also for open-minded and inteligent religious people.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Unlike other Nicholas Sparks novels.  What I thought would be just a love story turned out to be a suspenseful thriller.
B008COD5OO|1.0|Not only are the characters seemingly wasted, but so is your money unless you like inane, stoner humor, or at least something that pretends to be humor. From the early previews I thought this was some kind of sci-fi flick, you knows, kids have a party while parents are out of town and aliens land and destroy the hood. NOPE! No such luck. It's just STOOPIT! I had to spell it like that because stupid doesn't come close, plus I has t'roin' a little NY accent in there, for those of you who already watched this waste of time. Drugs are NOT GOOD people! That is why the nation is in the stank hole its in now.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was one of the best books on the reality of our special forces that I've ever read.  God bless our troops.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run!!! its so addicting when u play it. this is one of my favorite games! I think you should download it on your kindle fire or whatever you have!!!!
B007SSDDWE|4.0|This movie was surprisingly better than I thought it would be!  Tense, suspenseful, and quite well done. I was doubtful that it would amount to anything given the premise shown in the trailer, but my family convinced me to give it a try and it turned out to be a good movie. I'd watch it again.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I've finished reading this book and I am still not sure if I just liked it or loved it.  It definitely had some twists to it.  I kind of felt like, at a few points, there were so many twists that I was a bit lost.  Have to give it stars for the ending though.  Although, that still left me wondering a bit.
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|Yeah, there's some goofiness, some hokiness, but it's a fine movie for when it's a rainy day and you just want to be drowsy and watch a little action. Don't know why they named it after Johnny Cash's kid, though. That's got me stumped.  I'd watch this again... in a couple years.
0307730697|5.0|There really aren't words to describe the impact that this book has had on my life.  Other than the Bible, I can honestly say that I have been affected more by this book than any other that I have ever read.  It meant so much to me that I bought 20 copies after I read it and gave them to friends and co-workers.  How does a man go from being a crack addict in jail to being a Tier 1 operator with the most elite counter-terrorist unit in the world?  If you want to know, you need to read the book.
B0037ECH8O|5.0|I cannot think of a more perfect example of the filmmaker's art, unless one considers his many other films.  This is a spectacle.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is my first time reviewing a book on kindle for amazon in 3 years and over 100 books of reading. Best book I've read in years. Can't wait to see what they do for the movie.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|Enjoyed this movie as we got to see how they all look grown up.<br />There actually is a storyline running behind all the joke and screwing around.<br />Nothing still beats \\"This one time, at band camp, ....\\"
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I like the fact that it Syncs, but I can not trust it any longer, it crashed and closed on me while writing notes in lectures several times ( over 3-4 times in just few mins and is doing it every day now!<br />Now I read reviews and found that it has a privacy problem as well.<br />I still gave it 3 stars to be fair, it is a great idea but needs a lot of improvment; like auto-saving and more office functions as well!

B0027MJU00|5.0|I discovered Gillian Flynn, like a lot of readers, via her breakthrough novel \\"Gone Girl\\", but her excellence is in full view here in her second book, Dark Places.<br /><br />I am queuing up \\"Sharp Objects\\" next.<br /><br />Crisp, and plausible, her thrilling, mysterious plots are well thought out, and the characters engaging, enraging, and thoroughly delightful; and as the title suggests REALLY DARK!<br /><br />This reader also finds her acknowldgements a source of fun (can a writer with such macabre sensibilies really be a happy, well adjusted mid-westerner?) and insight into a life to be admired and respected.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Play this game all the time very addicting, don't like all the ads though. Great time killer and it's free.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is an interesting and easy read. I finished the book in a couple of hour long flights. The book actually is more about what is involved in being a Seal and the preparation for battle than the actual mission to get Bin Laden. That's ok if you're an ex military person as I am. In terms of what I would consider classified info, I just don't see it in this book but I'm not an expert. I don't detect any political overtones in the book beyond the statement that the Seals assumed from the beginning that if they got Bin Laden that President Obama would use it for political purposes but there was nothing they could do about it. The description of the raid and killing of Bin Laden is much different than what the White House put out. I recommend this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book (second in the trilogy)is just as captavating as the first.  For some readers it may be hard getting past some parts of the book, but if you are reading the book(s) for the great story the rest is incidental.
B000001F26|5.0|This CD is incredible.  It features many of his well-known songs and takes me back to a fantastic time period.  It's fun, and it makes me smile every time I listen to it. I recommend \\"The Best of Eric Clapton\\" to all of his fans, as well as to those who might not have heard him and want to experience unique entertainment! It has a home in my permanent collection.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Dictionaries are a must for me.  I want to have them close at all times and Merriam-Webster has always been my choice.
B000GOVND8|3.0|I love The Last Boy Scout, but the version they are using here is not widescreen, which makes for a poor viewing experience on your laptop.<br /><br />Best suggestion is to watch it on an iPad which fits the ratio better.<br /><br />Hopefully they will fix this if they can.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I thought this movie was very good, the story was strong and the acting and special effects were excellent.  If you enjoy this sort of movie, I recommend you check it out.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love all of the angry birds games.  Can't wait for Bad Piggies next week.  Am trying to decide about downloading other games also
B001FA0W5W|5.0|Just like his other (and rather more famous book, The Black Swan), Nassim Talib does not disappoint you: Turning everything you had been taught on statistics upside down. Some sections were a bit difficult to follow, due to heavy handiness in statistical calculations. However, it does make you aware of probability's shortcomings, and to be sceptical of media, especially financial.
B007P0Z9AY|4.0|Adult film, wow, strong sexual content. I liked it very much, started feeling like a teenager again and I am near 60. This is more natural than Viagra, and not vulgar but very tastefully done.
B007MOU6ZQ|5.0|Someone who buys \\"self-help\\" books based on glossy title and back-cover frequently, this book was a real eye opener. Made sense on a lot of issues, sometimes controversial, but nevertheless very helpful. What I learned life is too short, so don't try to be perfect, accept it as it is. A must read.
B008DR2GD6|4.0|Typical Eddie M. Movie- funny with family value theme movie that Eddie always makes, this one is better than his usual ones, a little more creative then the others. Rent it and watch with the family.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm usually not a fiction reader, but the title, \\"11-22-63\\" grabbed me.  From page one and on to the end, this story took every part of me and found it very difficult to put down.  The title has very little to do with the whole story.  Best book I've ever read.  I've recommended it to so many other friends.
B007JUWTI0|4.0|Action and Swash-Buckling Movie with some money spent on it, and a little technology plugged in to bring the Musketeers into the 21st Century and out of the olden day Musketeers. Hey some acting as well.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Pleasant book of memories by Mitch Albom with attempt to connect concepts across racial and economic lives. It seems almost as much about Albom as about the main characters. However, that is his style and it is very effective and captures one's interest easily. Recommend highly.
B00782O7NE|5.0|I rented this originally expecting a dull, artsy movie that was made as Oscar fodder. I was incredibly wrong. This movie is really as great as the academy claimed. It's not boring at all. It's actually very slapstick at the beginning. The characters are quite endearing and when they begin to go through struggles, it really pulls you in. You care about what the characters are going through.<br />Don't avoid this movie just because it's black and white, give it a shot!
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I got through the first two levels with some difficulty. My first experience with A. B -- it IS addictive. I started Level 3 but when I went back to it A. B. did not come up, instead I was asked to buy some other games. To heck with it! You get what you pay for, I suppose.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It took me awhile to decide to go ahead and read the Fifty Shades - I figured it was just another romance novel type with kinky sex. I was certainly surprised to find myself carried along with the great story of Christian and Anastasia. It is well written and a page turner, sometimes too hard to put down. Yes, there is a lot of sex but it's intermingled within the story and well written without being too vulgar at all.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|As I listened to this CD alone the night I picked it up, I uncontrollably blurted aloud to myself, \\"Wow.  This is pure rock and roll.\\"  That is exactly how I feel.  Pure, unpretentious, and soulful.  Thank you, Brandon Flowers and crew.  The heartfelt lyrics match the mastery of the sound.  I will be listening to this album for many years to come.<br /><br />Note: \\"Carry Me Home\\" makes the deluxe version worth every penny.  It should be a single!
B009DH372Y|5.0|I saw this on at the movie theatre last night, and WOW! I was blown away. I adore the Wembly concert, but I think this one is at least as good, and perhaps better. Freddie's voice just soars, and i love hearing his choices, to harmonize a particular line, or punch another one. He's wonderful to watch, too, of course. Seeing him singing the folk tune in context was great. The video and audio quality were fabulous.<br />There are cut-aways to the four of them periodically, doing interviews, publicity events, and just hanging out. It was fun to see them in those contexts, too, and added to the movie.<br />It's more than just a concert. It's an event.<br />Sometimes after a really rough day, I'll watch Wembly, just to help cheer myself up, and soon I'll have a choice. Can't wait!<br />Enjoy, everyone!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This was a very engaging film and I enjoyed it immensely. I have since read the first 2 novels in the trilogy (The Hunger Games and Catching Fire) and I am enjoying them a great deal. Even though they are intended for a young adult audience, it is mature enough material for older adults (which most certainly includes me!) I have one recommendation regarding the film. If you have not read the books, watch the film first and enjoy it in its own right, then read the books. If you do the opposite, I think you may find the film disappointing. It stands on its own as a very good film but as is typically the case, the film pales when held up to its literary inspiration. Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I started this book because I thought I was the only woman in the world who had not read this.  I found the writing to be poor and was bored by the 6th chapter and couldn't read anymore.  It was just the same old thing over and over.  Not worth it's HYPE.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|This particular book unlike the two previous in this trilogy was a bit slow and difficult to get through with so many unimportant details to connect to the previous two books. Unfortunately the author has passed away so we will not be seeing any more books on the tattoed girl \\"wasp\\".
B003L5LEYW|2.0|Nas pretty much ruins this album. I keep thinking I'll like a song because the music and Damian's part starts off great, and then Nas comes in spewing nonsense or juvenile cruft. Jamrock was at least 100 times better than this. Oh well.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs, is one the very few series which avoids ruining the previous movies with excessively lame and predictable events. For kids, Ice Age innocently entertains via vocal and visual effects, playing upon the various characters hilarious characteristics. But Ice Age isn't just for kids. Any discerning adult will be thoroughly bemused at the frequent innuendo and satirical references and plays upon other films, events, and culture.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B008N1LL42|4.0|I think Battleship is underrated.  I know it looks like it'd be terrible, but I fully enjoyed this film.  If you like any type of Micheal Bay flick, you'd like this one.  And when they fire up Mighty Mo, that was awesome. Give it a chance, go into it thinking it'll be fun and it won't be disappointing.  Is it a good movie... no. Is it an enjoyable movie, absolutely.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am politically Independent and this book shows at length how inept not only is BHO but also how complex Military command has become.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book, and all the others in Brandon Sandersons universe, are definitely going to go into the annals as one of the greatest series we have ever seen
B001G060V6|5.0|Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormond) needs a job and she's willing to lie (a bit) steal (a little) and even relax her standards about proper adult behavior in order to get one.<br /><br />Lucky for her, the person she relaxes with is the generous, rich, and unfortunately named Delysia Lafoose (Amy Adams). Miss Pettigrew brings a bit of rationality to Delysia's day, while Delysia introduces Miss Pettigrew to a world of wealth, luxury, and more importantly fun. Along the way, they both find romance!<br /><br />The movie blurb calls Miss Pettigrew Lives for a day \\"a delightful champagne cocktail of a comedy.\\" I can't put it better than that.
0399159029|3.0|Although the historical material in this novel is excellent, the character development is so so. Kerr attempts to give his detective an existential crisis following his involvement with the nazi killing squads in the Ukraine, but the crisis is not convincing. It's short lived and pretty soon the detective is back to wise cracking in the tradition of hard boiled detectives. There are also some plotting problems. Kerr bites off too many plots and subplots (existential crisis, a killing in Berlin, an attempted rape, an attempted assassination attempt on a Nazi SS general, a Czech anti-nazi conspiracy, a love life for our hero, and on and on) and the resolution is poorly paced and clumsily hammered together. It feels like a mid-series novel where the author may be bored with his protagonist.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I appreciate this ap so much. It's even Synchronized to my personal computer so what's deleted or added to spam on my Kindle is likewise deleted or added to spam on my personal computer. It's formatted the same as well.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Love love love it:) Keep the levels going going going going.  5 Star rating all the way. Please. Way to go. Lets keep it going.
B0047WJ11G|3.0|Plot becomes extremely intense a plot within a plot within a plot within a plot Within a plot. Ok movie if you have nothing else to do and you can devote your undivided attention to from start to to finish. But if you are like me and was trying to do other other things as this movie ran next to my computer, you will bEcome sorely disenchanted with the entire movie.
B007SGM084|3.0|The first 2 books were pretty good and definitely page turners... by book 3 the romance scenes are a little much and it feels very repetitive.  This should have been one big book- not 3 500 page books.  I wish i had purchased them separately instead of the bundle.  To be honest i didn't even finish book 3 with 40 pages to go..
B007IXWL2C|1.0|As far as erotica goes this is sorely lacking. I was disappointed by the first book, but as I had already started the series I had to finish...yes my own personal issue but dang I wish I didn't have that particular issue for this series. Read some Anias Nin for arousal. This series is slightly better than a Harlequin romance.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found this book very repetitious thus leading it to boring , over and over the same old gets rather tedious after awhile .
B001NEYO8Q|5.0|One of the great westerns with Wayne & Stewart with a great story. Wayne is the epitome of a western actor. Truly a great movie!
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Cant wait for the second book! I love the whole story. very romantic and funny. i recommend this book to all bookworms out there. amazingly beautiful disaster.
B0065CCM76|5.0|The title says it all ultimate. I really think this is a great collection of his hits. If you like Seger this covers it.
B0090EIILU|2.0|Very disappointing, loved Borat, but this was way to predicable and boring.I only watched it about half way through before getting completely bored
B0025UHKNS|5.0|After 3 years together, I am still completely in love with my Forerunner. I use it almost daily for outdoor running, indoor biking (with the bike cadence attachment), sprint intervals and even during strength training for the heart rate data. With constant use over 3 years it's still in great shape and I have had 0 serious problems with it. The workout feature from Garmin Connect is essential to any interval training plan. I usually only need to charge it after 3 1-hour long workouts. I have never had connectivity issues to my ANT+ stick on Windows. As people have pointed out, the stick is flimsy and can be easily broken if you leave it in a laptop. It's not hard to replace though - I'm on my 3rd one and replaced it recently off of ebay for about $25.<br /><br />My number one complaint with Garmin is that the Forerunner isn't supported on Linux. I have spent years trying to get it to work consistently without rebooting into Windows. If anybody else has been on this quest, the best Linux port I've found so far is the python ant downloader (you can find it on GitHub - braiden/python-ant-downloader). Works consistently. I've found it occasionally has trouble with the maps, but when an import goes badly it can be re-imported from Windows later.<br /><br />My only complaint with the actual watch at this point is that it doesn't have Garmin's new \\"Training Effect.\\" I only hope when I splurge to upgrade to the 610, it will be as reliable and easy to use as my 405 is.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Extremely good book. I could not put it down, but it had its sad parts. I would recommend it and will probably read it again.
B00122LXTM|5.0|I was driving in my car and heard a classic Doobie Brothers hit that I really liked. I got on my computer and checked at Amazon's MP3 Music Store and found this \\"The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers\\". $5.00...and it's all good.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Love this song, wish she'd hurry up and come out with an entire CD<br />Love this song, wish she'd hurry up and come out with an entire CD
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I began reading this book while on a plane. My friend had loaned me her Kindle which had all three books in the series loaded on it.  I mention the plane because had I not been trapped and bored, I don't think I would have made it through the first book.  It was a slow start, and I really had to concentrate to keep reading.  The main characters leave quite a bit to be desired.  Ana is naive and innocent.  Hard to believe (spoiler alert) that she chooses a man such as Christian Grey (Dom) which she relinquishes her virginity to, ratherly easily I might add. The characters are not very well developed, and some are introduced and then never heard from again. There is no feminism here, our heroine is rather, um,... how should I say it \\"easily sub-dued\\".  ALL THAT SAID . . . I read all three books and I promise if you get through the first one, it gets better.  Not great, but better.  I did find myself pulling for these two to overcome their issues and problmes.  Oh, one other thing - the sex scenes are steamy, not gross or violent, none the less they are steaming!  Happy Reading!
B0098VXBIA|5.0|The movie came in great package and on the promised date. This movie is halarious!! It is about three different women all expecting and how their pregnancies are very different. It also show how the dads take part on Saturday morning and the Daddy club, keeping everything they say as \\"sacred\\" amoung themelves as they learn to how to be dads. It also show the emotions of a young couple about the difficulty in adopting a baby and how the other dad help the adopting father work through it and the adopting mother hides her fears until the end. Great movie for young adults and above.
B005AVIW54|2.0|This is one of the  most boring books I have read.  I skipped lots of pages and at the end put it down.  He is making money out of people again. Sorry I bought it.
B0064Z7RXS|4.0|If at any point in your life you wore flannel, black boots, had long hair, and sat in coffee shops for long periods of time then this album is a must have for your collection.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is one of a few books that I could not wait to start up my Kindle for.  At the start it caught me in its grasps and kept me there to the surprise ending. My husband also read it and and enjoyed the suspense.
B0090EIILU|1.0|After seeing Borat and Bruno I was expecting something really funny but Dictator failed to deliver.  It's the same execution jokes over and over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic sequel to Hunger Games.  This book was maybe more exciting than the first, and surprising!  It has been many years since I have read anything that could keep my total attention and these books give that.
B007MJSQSK|5.0|It captured the looks and the feel of the old tin tin comics I used to read as a kid. I introduced it to my son and he loved it too.
B008MM9630|5.0|love this its my all time favorite farm game i have found nothing else like this i just love it so much!!! hope there are going to be more games like this in the future.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun for my whole family. Its the only game we play continually. My sons compete for the highest score. It has brought our family closer. I love it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well constructed and eye opening.  Gives one an understanding of what it takes to become a SEAL. Also appreciated the disclaimer and careful consideration to not disclosing any classified information.  Every American should proudly read this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great!  I love viewing pins and repinning!  Pinterest is the best and this app is perfect!  I love that I can view my boards from my kindle!
B004Q9TK98|5.0|I loved this book. It is current with many grey areas. The twist at the end was delightful. The awful cult references are so typical of what is happening in many so called developed countries, including USA. Fundamentalism is dangerous under any religious guise. Well done again, Jodi!
B0090EIILU|2.0|I rented this movie because the kids really wanted to see it.  Definitely not one I would have chosen.  This is definitely one of those movies geared towards teens with all of the inuendos and silly scripts.  Glad I did not pay to see this in a theater.  All of the funniest parts were in the trailer.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This is a very informative book if you enjoy finding out what goes on behind the scenes with presidents and US and world events. I'd have to say most of the anecdotes recounted in the book is first time knowledge for me. This is a political book so if you don't enjoy reading about politics and the goings on in Washington skip this. But if you enjoy reading about the history behind presidential events, decisions, and the outcomes you will enjoy it.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I read this primarily because of my grandson, but I enjoyed the books also. I am glad that it inspired an archery interest in him and others. Also enjoyed the movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game it's so much fun and so addicting. My girlfriend got me playing it all the time so we can make bigger villages.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this app is so fun. I play it 24/7 that's how fun it is! I would defenently recommend this app!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This movie is definitely a buyer. I haven't read the books but the movie had a great story line and the acting is good. I rented it on Amazon and watched it a couple of times. The picture quality was great and I didn't have any buffering issues.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Like the others of the MI series, this is a fun, action movie. Its a bit on the long side, and highly improbably, but thats the fun of the MI movies. Tom cruise is really good and plays his character to the hilt. A definite must if you enjoy the series, and the like, similar to Bond movies.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|3d and free? a perfect connection of the two combined in one. one of the best games on the market.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|In the beginning I didn't see why all the fuss, then I was reading with eyes wide open thinking OMG! Then it became a story that I can't put  down, and it has nothing to do with the erotic content.  This is an amazing booK that's hard to imagin ending - I wish It was 1000 pages long.  I'm at the end now of book 2!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I truly enjoyed this story. But just like so many other books, I wanted more when it ended. I am now reading Dark Places.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I think its great that amazon has free software to protect my kindle!  Avast has all kinds of options to give the kind of protection that you need and I've never had a problem with it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is one of the most eye-opening books that I have ever read on diet, nutrition, and disease. I am a health care financing consultant, the husband of a national expert on childhood obesity and I still had no idea how devastating the \\"healthy\\" components of our everyday diet really are. I am buying six hard copies of this book for friends and family. A must read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best way to collect recipes, tips for cleaning, decorating ideas, etc... all in one site.  I spend WAY too much time on this site!  Love it on my Kindle Fire!
B001N1DPDE|2.0|My background is more military and search and rescue so the BK2 was too much of a monster to carry in case I had to hack a small tree down.  I'm 90% in the desert or barren mountains so enough said.  I guess it's a tool for the forrest .  When it's 100 degrees + the sheath works smooth and one handed.  At lower temps it takes two hands and a boy to pull the knife out.  The knife is a great tool but too heavy for me.  I always fall back on using my 10 + + + year old SRK but Becker makes good knifes so I'm ordering a BK16 to try.<br /><br />Update............I bought a BK10............great for my purposes...............renewed my faith in BK/ Ka-bar products
1878424319|5.0|My mother in law gave this book to me.  It has some good advice.....life lessons really. If we could all live by these agreements personal problems would not hurt us so much. I bought this as a gift for an employee I hope it helps her as it did me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The author of this/these books is a gifted author capable of engaging the reader into the emotions elicited by the characters in each of the books. I have read each book three times and I can't wait until the movie is produced and/or the editor writes more of the same kind of books.
B009329ZF2|3.0|After the first half of movie. Takes too long to get into. After the wait pretty good action. Word word word
B000IDCJK8|5.0|Clint Eastwood at one of his best. Would have liked to see extras with this. Making of bloopers etc. This one never gets old.
B008XG1X18|4.0|So glad they finally made an app for the kindle! It works much better than trying to access it via the web on my Kindle Fire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Rarely to I step outside my social norms to pick up a book that I had not really heard about, especially one that was turned into a movie.  My friends, however, promised me that I would enjoy every last minute of it.  So I decided to pick it up for my Kindle, infinitely cheaper that way, I began to read.  I soon noticed that I couldn't stop to put it down.  Wonderfully vivid details surrounding the settings, highly imaginative characters throughout the story, and a plot hook that will certainly leave you dangling like a fish...  I had this book for two weeks and I had finished the book, but it left me wanting more!
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Its a good turn based game, but it lacks levels to play solo. Overall I would buy it if it had more levels involved. For what it is I think it's a good purchase.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book to jump into after the fifty shades series!  Would recommend it to anyone who is Christian Grey deprived, already ordered the second book.
B0031R5K7M|5.0|I look for books that take me away from the normal mundane things that are around us,I also love reading about magic and mystical creatures and and really enjoy reading books that bring fantasy to life by giving enough detail to make you see what is happening as you read and not want to put the book down.<br /><br />This series of books is really well written and enjoyable for ages from teen to adult, it gives a new take one the old dragon, elf and dwarf myths and also adds new mythical species to the mix,they are also the type of book that makes you want to pick them up and read them again at a later date and still get enjoyment out of them.  I have now finished the final book in the series and still want to know more about what happens to the people.<br /><br />I am also interested in looking at other books written by this author.
B002OSAT7U|5.0|At first I wished Strobe wasn't album only... but after actually listening to the whole thing it turns out that it was well worth it.  Get yourself a quality pair of headphones and listen to the album straight through a few times.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I've been reading a lot of fantasy books over the years.  From the likes of Feist, Modesitt, Goodkind, Sanderson, and Jordan.  I would put this book and author right up there among the best.  This is a great book, a little slow to start but its just building a wonderful story.  Not to be missed.  Trust me.  Can't wait for book 3.
B001GXNBJW|5.0|If you're into the \\"old\\" Black Keys then this is a great album - good garage blues rock!  Though if you're looking at this page because you thought El Camino was the next big thing, then you might not enjoy this as much.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Fast and easy way to log on and shop. Like being able to find items easily from this app. One tap shop
B006BAEQB2|5.0|The Kingmakers Daughter<br /><br />Great book, Phillippa Gregory writes well, keeps your interest and whether fiction or fact her books are well researched. Love them, and I have read many of them and will continue to do so. A 10 as far as I am concerned!!
B00338QENI|3.0|The presentation of science and human interest is a nice combo, but even as a veracious reader I had to pause half way through and come back after reading a few other books.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is great, it tells me everything I need to know. Narrows it down to my small remote location too! I like the &quot;Feels like &quot; feature as well...
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This was a good and entertaining movie. Time laps between events was a little unbelievable but still held your attention with the action.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I've been a Pink fan for years and have been anxiously waiting for her to release a new album.  Absolutely love it! Love the upbeat songs & the slower ballads.  You can hear her growth in the music and strength as an artist really being true to herself.  For anyone who is concerned about the lyrics and the explicit language, first - it's Pink!! What were you thinking of buying this version and then being upset?  There is a \\"clean release\\" available if that's what you prefer - you have options.  I plan to enjoy this - it's all P!nk!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this occupys the whole family I love how it makes you thing on all game's. I lobe it so does the family
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash is fast! I up graded from the SB 600 and I am glad I did. I really enjoy all the options I have with this unit.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was very interesting! I wanted her to be found so badly!! I feel like I can't really write anything without giving too much away! This is a must read!!
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I really like this watch. While it seems to gain a little time (just a few seconds every day), it's not a problem and I'd rather a watch run a little fast than a little slow.I had been wanting an automatic and like telling people it's a \\"timepiece\\" instead of a watch. I wish the the dial and numbers were a little larger, but that's due to age and eyes not being able to focus without my glasses :-)<br /><br />I questioned the olive color, but looking at the other colors, they all look \\"cheap\\". You can see the pictures, but it's clean, understated and \\"rustic-informal\\" look. Though I mentioned it could be a little larger, I do like the low profile, and this watch fits better under some of the long-sleeved shirts/jackets I like to wear.<br /><br />This is my second SNK805K2. I lost the first one at sea (actually in the San Francisco bay) while sailing. I'm not 100% sure what happened, but think I smacked my wrist while trying to reef the sail and dislodged or broke the pin for the wrist strap. The watch later slipped off while I was reaching overboard for something from the water. And, for the record, I don't wear it out sailing any longer ... now have a far less expensive X-brand watch.<br /><br />Clearly I was bummed for loosing it. But it's an exceptional watch, and at $70 it didn't hurt quite as much to replace it. So, giving it 4 stars because I think the pins should be a little more rugged. (Would actually give it 4.5 stars, if I could.)<br /><br />Yes I'd recommend it; no, not to my friends. (Hey, I don't want them to be copycats.)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hope the movie doesnt fall too short. That usually seems to be the case. Except for \\"The Town\\". cant wait
B0074QGGK6|4.0|A lot of this is not new to me but I still am enjoying the book. There are a ton of good little reminders and habits to reinforce to get your work out there and making it the best it can be. I recommend it for artists of all kinds.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is an excellent story about the life of a navy seal and the sacrifices they endure in their personal lives, the family they leave behind and the people they take out to keep this country a safe place to live and to help other people who are in harms way, it has to be really hard having such a great job that you can't brag about it, thank god for people like these navy seals and the country i live in. can't wait to read it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this whole series. I'm hooked. Before this series, the only books ive read were about fitness and nutrition. I have never read a book for pleasure ( no pun intended;)<br />However, I have enjoyed these books more than reality tv. My dvr is full of unwatched television shows!
B005M68S4W|5.0|What a fantastic album far exceeded my expections.This surely will become a true classic. The guest vocalist complimented  Mr Bennett's fabulous rythemic style.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Simply the best. Extreme durability, industry standard sound quality, look good, coiled cord. What else do you need?<br /><br />BTW, not kidding when I say extreme durability. I tend to have the misfortune of always breaking my headphones. These bad boys have survived it all. Sturdy construction (you can see the screws holding the parts together!) really make these headphones a worthwhile investment.<br /><br />Highly recommended. 5*
B009329ZF2|5.0|Since I served on board The U.S.S. Missouri BB-63 I would give this movie a  five star rating.  I thought it was great, sure it was a little far fetched plot wise but then again so are most movies these days.  I think the story is good the actors are funny and the Mighty MO is still as glorious as ever!!  A great movie with plenty of action and a great fun story.  I will be watching it a couple of times.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Although it gave his entire military experience, I still liked book. It gave a personal viewpoint of events, and accounted for a lot of the reasons for the entire action taken.
B00932A5QA|2.0|Computer generated characters look great, the story is a little strange and gets weirder by the minute.  If you like Japanese Anime you will like it otherwise not that good and I usually am not too critical on this type of movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really made me appreciate these men, their stregnths, their willingness to die in order to live. Interesting read. Will have to re-read just to soak more of the details in!
B004CYKZZA|1.0|got hte product quickly, but had it a week and it stopped charging, was unable to return for a exhange due to not having the box anymore, worked great for the week i could use it but now it just sits on my desk unused cause i cant charge it for whatever reason
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works well on my Kindle Fire. I have enjoyed surfing through different craft ideas and it gives a big overview of what is on there. Worth the download.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Fifty shades is a very easy read -- I suspect the plot could be summarized in one long paragraph, but the author made the story last and last.  But somehow one reads on.  I initially bought Book 1 because everyone is talking about it.  Then the story, such as it is, continued through two more books.  I'm mostly a biography reader and I spent a lot of time with these three books and learned.....not much.  But if your loved one is out of town, you have a lot of spare time and you want a turn on....and turn on....and turn on......
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was excellent. Very thrilling,capturing,exciting,and heartbreaking. I loved it!! I would definitely recommend reading this book! So everyone should read it!
0340822775|3.0|This book is worth your time because of it's interesting structure.  The author is very clever in how he shifts from tale to tale with new language and mood.  However, these narrative shifts also make it difficult to pick up on some subtle messages.  Instead he hits you over the head with small details (\\"I never thought of my mole as a comet.\\") and a heavy moral.  One heavy moral.  I think there was room for more subtlety AND more clarity (yes, I stick by that oxymoron).  Give me something deeper, like an insight that affects the reader.  I didn't feel affected or involved.<br /><br />But so many other reviewers see something more.  So, I will give this book another read in the future.  Right now I'm going to dive into Ishiguro and savor some excellent subtlety.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I really loved this book.  I loved how UN-fancy it was.  Very plain speaking; sounded like the real person and not a ghost-writer or something.  It took her lots of courage to live this and writing it must have been cathartic. Keep on Jaycee!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Wow..What can I say about this book that everyone else hasn't already said..<br />This book is well book 2 out of the series and I was hesitant at first into getting into this series. But everyone was reading them and I thought why not but once you start you can't put the book down. Or at least I couldn't cause I was really afraid that I would miss something.<br /><br />I admit I have read this series several times and each time it gets better and better.<br />I would not suggest this book for teenagers but for adults whether you be a woman or a man you have to read this series. It leaves you wanting more. I know it did me..<br /><br />Great book
B008MEM24S|5.0|Cute and fun. A lot like where's my water with new characters. Love the evil doctor!  Good times.  And done.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Riveting, I stayed glued to my seat until the very end.<br />The action is exciting,the story line is compelling and it will hold your attention from beginning to end.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Once I figured everything out and all the navigation it has been great to use. still trying to post to FB but that's minor.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Funktioniert einfach und verlaesslich auf meinem Kindle Fire, und hat mir noch nie irgendwelche Probleme gemacht. Ich bin sehr zufrieden!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|\\"Prometheus\\" is one of a new wave of pseudo-SF films that achieve what I call 'fractal stupidity.' It's actually impossible to list all the logic flaws, because between any two given flaws, it is always possible to find a third. Just as a Mandelbrot curve is convoluted in an infinite way, the film is illogical in an infinitely fine-grained way.<br /><br />In other words, no matter how thin you slice it, it's still baloney.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written! what a waste of money and time. I wish i hadn't read this piece of crap book! Dangit.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is simple and easy to use. Great for quick calculations and homework check. I recommend trying this app.
B004PLT3TY|5.0|We loved the movie Sky high.Great family movie.It is a Great movie for kids. It was a great movie!!!!  thanks
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is incredible. I could not put it down. As a reader I found myself crying for her and her children. I grew to love poor Jaycee and I can only hope her life continues to get better and this does not haunt her any longer. She and her children deserve some happiness and I am glad they are starting to get it. Good luck Jaycee!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|nicely written, exciting and kept me engaged in the story line.  Read all three books in 5 days...  Well done.
B008BGNMZU|2.0|When this super group of jazz musicans first got together there first couple of albums were very good, but now this is there 7th or 8th I can't keep track there out put all sounds the same I was once a fan, now I am not , they need to try more different muscial stlyes or more up beat-pass on this on
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Really good movie about not taking care of the earth and consequences.  Comical and heartwarming.  Also a call to action. Great animation and good characters.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|I watched this movie again the other night and I realized it has the best music cues I've ever heard in any movie ever!
B007YA5NRO|5.0|Easy to follow guide into the workings and features of a great camera! Much clearer to follow than the owners manual.
B001DSNELK|5.0|very good box with miniature<br />the movie is a classic<br />worth having to keep at home, everything is pretty much the movie box<br />  the miniature<br />when you think of ghost movie<br />this is the film
B008D28HYS|4.0|I thought CrossMe Color was a lot of fun to play, though I got frustrated when alternating between the color version and the original version as the math rules are slightly different and my brain got mixed up! It was neat to see the same picture I had completed in black and white come to life with new shades in the color app.  I plan to go back to the color app as soon as I play through the black and white version!
B005544V6A|5.0|My 24 yr old son recommended this series.  I have to say that it's not just another legal practice production.<br />  I highly recommend it.
031261246X|5.0|Working in the IT industry and having to seal with security on a daily basis I often wonder how much damage could be done.<br />Zero day paints that picture with frightening detail.<br />Not sure this should be in the fiction section but maybe the self help business section.
B003B02OOG|3.0|Stories are boring and seem to end abruptly They were all over the place. Didn't keep me interested. Regret buying the book.
B00932ANQM|2.0|This is a boring movie.  Even the women watching it agreed that it wasn't that romantic and lacked the magic that other movies in this genre are able to capture.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was about a subject no one had written about in the past and was initially interesting. However, the last 25% of the book was somewhat predictable
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Reich's has done it again.  She has a real nack for digging up the truth ,even when it puts her into a dangerous situation.
B0026QC0YU|3.0|This is one of those things that's better left for the 90's. Especially when watched on an HDTV, you can see some of the makeup and some of the \\"acting\\". If you haven't seen this, you might enjoy it. But if you remember seeing it and it was awesome (in the 90s) you might be better off leaving it at that and just enjoying the memory -- and then go watch Thor or something else if you're in the mood for action.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Could not open the update, not compatible with Kindle Fire:(  Please advise when the update for the Kindle Fire is available.
B006HTUZ1C|2.0|You won't notice the horrible controls until you get above 5000 or 6000 points then it is not playable.  Hopefully there are plans to fix this.
B00932A2MC|2.0|Really disappointed. Could have been a really great movie. Fell into the trap of a stereo type \\"B\\" flick. It did have some nice special effects, but the story line was terrible.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I suggested this book for our book club read without reading it first.  That was a mistake.  While the plot for this one is good, the number of foreign phrases, foreign languages, names, and places make it a difficult read.  If you are a reader who tries to absorb the story in its context, this is a difficult book.  It you are a skimmer and don't care if you are pronouncing the written words correctly, then it will be an easier read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I suppose I'm like a lot of readers and bought No Easy Day out of a need to comprehend this pivotal moment in history. I didn't read the book to learn things I had no business knowing, or things that might jeopardize our military personnel or civilians, or citizens of another country. I'm kind of surprised at the furor over the book's contents. While I found it completely engrossing, I can't see anything it it that ought to be considered classified. There isn't much in it that I didn't know or at least had guessed just from the barrage of news. This book is good for the country. It helps with the resolution of one of the worst traumas in US history. It's a first-hand account, and so yes, it's about the author's experience. I fail to see why some people think a first hand account should be about other people. No, this is what I wanted to know: what was the experience of being there as both participant and witness to this shocking end to the life of a man who created so much harm to so many people? And that's what I got. Well done!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I ejoyed this show even without the hd quality. The sound was mixed well as it sounded awesome on my bose 5.1. Michael jackson's legacy will stand the test of time. He truly was gifted and magical all the same. Its too sad that hes gone too soon. if your a fan get this dvd. Lots of nostaglia. Luv ya michael. rip
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This trilogy was entertaining, but by the third book there are only a limited number of ways to describe sex, and I found myself skipping over romantic descriptions - pretty redundant. Would have loved even more espionage, intrigue to balance out the now boring sex descriptions.
0425263908|4.0|It was a good book, if I didn't read the Fifty Shades novels, I would have loved it,but it was very similar.
B0090EIILU|1.0|Wow. Sacha Cohen is so much better than this. All the jokes were lame, predictable, and one dimensional. It's like he hung out with Mike Meyers and Adam Sandler and asked \\"How do I be more like you?\\"
B001TH16DI|5.0|This release is very impressive. The difference as compared to the dvd releases is drastic. The sounds is clear and distinct, and the clarity of the images is fantastic. The colors are much more vivid and is just a great view on the blu-ray. I would recommend for any Star Trek fan!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|So fun to solve puzzles, earn spending money and purchase fish and accessories for your imaginary aquarium. And you don't even have to clean it. I'm a fish lover and have an outdoor pond that requires maintenance. So enjoy this Amazon fish tank game from the comfort of your sofa.
0345803507|5.0|Great Reading. Really loved the story line and had trouble putting it down. Retread all three books over again on Kindle and then had to buy appear backs to have and to hold 
B004GBFF5Y|4.0|Pretty funny, if your a fan of Gilafinakis this isn't his typical slapstick laughin but it is worth a watch
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I love this song. It is one of my favorites. It reminds me of my daughter. It has a catchy tune.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have this app on all of my computers and my tablet. If your looking for a free app for anyone of these devices. The anti virus has prevented many viruses that would have created problems. It is not for businesses but for the average home use it is wonderful.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I absolutely loved this book and the way it was written. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because the ending wasn't as good as I'd hoped, but all the way up until the ending was amazing!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good book, hard to put down. A good insight to our SEALS and all the special forces in the military. Thanks for publishing this book.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|most stupidest game ever what's the ponit of this game. I think this game is a wast of your time don't download why does it say 3stars it should be 0 who makes a game that combins Mario and pac man
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fantastic read, I hope the author writes more books. I also learned at the end that the majority of the proceeds we being donated to our wounded warriors.
B000000H3Z|5.0|This is one of the greatest thrash albums of all time. I listen to it full blast all the time
B000J0UD94|5.0|I just happen to be a lover of history and this movie happens to be just great for a taste of columbus and his fatastic journey.  also the music is great for recording on your ipod for personal use of course just excellent it is well worth it.
B000LXP1OQ|5.0|Original pressings of the 1970 UNITED ARTISTS album entitled JOHN BARLEYCORN MUST DIE are on their deep carrot & black label. This masterpiece was the band's highest charter in the U.S., peaking at #5 on Billboard's 200 and earning an RIAA Gold Record award. All done without Dave Mason, who didn't return after over a year's layoff in which Steve Winwood cut an LP as part of the British supergroup, [[ASIN:B001G867WA BLIND FAITH]].<br /><br />This record's gentle title piece is adapted from a traditional tune that exists in over 100 variations, some dating back to King James I (circa 1465). Jim Capaldi is backing vocalist and plays tambourine, Chris Wood handles flute and percussion and Steve is lead vocalist, plus he plays piano and acoustic guitar.<br /><br />Winwood sings and handles all instruments on \\"Stranger to Himself.\\" Capaldi is backing vocalist. The album's longest, \\"Stranger to Himself,\\" is another Steve multi-track affair supported by Jim's percussion.<br /><br />There's yet more studio trickery on \\"Glad,\\" this LP's spacey, jazzy opening instrumental. It's Winwood's organ, piano and percussion, Chris on sax, flute, electric sax and percussion, with Jim pounding drums and additional percussion. It's the same lineup on \\"Freedom Rider,\\" a very strong piece with lyrics unrelated to the American Civil Rights movement of the early 1960s. Twin Steve and Chris organs on side-closing \\"Empty Pages,\\" a song that hung around the lower ranks of Billboard's 100 for two months, never getting higher than #74. Winwood sings lead, also plays bass  and electric piano, Capaldi adds drums and other percussive sounds.<br /><br />(NOTE: I purposely reviewed this album's sides in reverse, for that's how I've always listened to it.)<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[6:30] Glad<br />[6:02] Freedom Rider<br />[4:45] Empty Pages<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[4:05] Stranger to Himself<br />[6:20] John Barleycorn<br />[7:05] Every Mother's Son<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 34:47
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I couldn't believe that someone with zero sexual history would allow herself to be treated that way.  The main character<br />was too willing to go along with Christian and his perversions.  This was truly a waste of time.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|The history is great fun even if the story tying events together is a bit contrived. Both my husband and I are reading- one on kindle the other on Ipad! I love the epic scope of Rutherford's writing--read his book on Sarum and the one on Ireland as well.
B002RVEIAI|5.0|Terminator salvation is one of the best movies. I was happy to find it avaliable to download. I watch it almost every week.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love this game when it bothers to work. It likes to freeze and loose my progress, which is horribly frustrating. After the 'update' it won't load the freebie games I downloaded.
B00136RYXG|4.0|She is one of the fire artists that I can listen to a whole CD I own all of her albums and look forward to many more to come
B007IXWL2C|5.0|would highly recommend this first book and the other two sequels  I'm not normally a reader of romantic novels, but friends were raving about \\"fifty shades\\"  I am now on the final one, doesn't seem as \\"juicy\\" as that first one, but still good.  I have it on my Kindle, which i dearly love, I grab it everytime I'm heading somewhere where I have to wait.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This movie is one of the best of its kind, as far as I'm concerned. Five stars all the way, perfectly made. I was born in 1935 & grew up in L.A., CA during WW2 so have a keen interest in that critical period and have read about it & am collecting film commentary on it. This movie is a sterling addition.to my collection. Semi-documentary in styrle, detailing the horrors  of that time & place wihtout dwelling on them. Music being used sparingly. A true story, very well told. So much could be said about it - but I will only say that like the films about Anne Frank it has found a place in my heart.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book, I have to buy the second book.  I haven't finished the second book, but still remember how interesting and intriging it is to read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let me get this straight. Our hero is in his mid-twenties, a telecommunications billionaire, a pilot, a fluent French speaker, and a leader in the fight to end world hunger using his wealth. Oh, and he's drop dead gorgeous and into S/M. The author indulges her sexual fantasies with this unlikely concoction until the book becomes just plain tiresome. And they made a trilogy out of this?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have had my doubts as to whether OBL was really killed--since we cannot see the pictures of the corpse of this heinous piece of human garbage.  However, after reading this account, I am a believer that OBL is truly dead.  I feel gratified that the heroes of this mission are given their due--and not the potus, whose involvement was very, very sparse.  BO-boy's self agrandizement over this has made me sick--it is the men who trained for this mission, who selflessly put their lives on the line, and their commanders, who gave the operational go ahead, who are the ones who deserve America's undying commendation.  Thank you, and thank you Mark Owen for chronicling this great mission.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|I bought this case about 6 months ago and have been very happy with it. It's a good fit for my Kindle basic -- with or without the thin silicon protector I sometimes use on it -- and as an added bonus also works for my Nook Touch. (Warning: if using it with a Touch, be sure to put the screensaver on first, otherwise you'll find pages have been turned in transit.)<br /><br />This case is functional, not fancy. It's lined with red felt and closes with velcro. I think the black with grey trim is reasonably attractive. The case works great when carrying my Kindle in a purse or bag. It doesn't add a whole lot of bulk, though the \\"envelope\\" styling does mean it's not the thinnest case you could buy.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|My husband downloaded it & I have to say...it's better than the first album! Totally recommend it to anyone who liked a few songs from their first album.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I thought this movie was sweet and funny.  It had a happy ending which is the kind of movie I like.  Definitely a chick flick in my opinion.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A very simple game with so many fun hours of addictive playtime. There are hundreds of levels to play and anyone can play it from early levels that are easy for my three year old grandson and the higher levels are challenging even for me. I've had my Android for a while now and have found this to be a great thinking game that every one should try and I know they will enjoy!  This is easily the most addicting puzzle game I have ever played, so simple and yet challenging. If you're a puzzler like me, this game is for you! Get this game, you won't regret it! There are many levels to choose from and you can do the puzzles over and over again. Have fun with it!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Where is the alternate ending?  We all have our own preferences and I for one prefer the alternate ending available on former DVD releases.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game its fun and entertaining whoa yayay this is such a amazing game evryonne will love it I bet you will too
B006VA3ZT6|5.0|Loved it the very first time I had seen it on classic television.And wanted more , so I down loaded it , and watched both series. Hope they come out with another series. Want to go and see  Downtown Abbey for myself.
B007SGM084|4.0|This is a great read and a beautiful story.  I have one caution to the young women out there.  This is a fantasy.  This man does not exist.  You can't change the 'bad boy'.  If you see 'red flags' in a relationship, don't ignore them, you could get<br />hurt!  That being said, as fantasy goes, it's one of the best.  I hope men who read this don't just see what Ana was willing to accept but also understand what Christian was willing to do for Ana.  Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After a while the book became very predictable.Its like having sex for the first time, and knowing whats going to happening  next
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I find this book very interesting and enligtening. I cannot put it down. The problem is it is so long I cannot finish it. When does Linbaba hook up with Karla. They are dragging it out to the end.<br /><br />It is a wonderfully written novel and informative to boot.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really enjoy this logic puzzle game! Simple levels for kids, REALLY hard levels for the grown ups. Lots of time used up for this game. Love it!
0525953728|5.0|This is a great book written on day-to-day basis of the life of a SEAL.<br />There was no contradicting statements, no classified information that the public should not know but on the contrary, the book gave an insight of life of our great SEALS, about the vigorous training  the physical endurance, mental endurance and the tough conditions that they have to undergo to be selected as a SEAL.(to protect our country)<br />Thank you, Dear Sir. Thank you for telling us about you, your life as a SEAL, to the public and we are thankful to you from the bottom of our heart.
B007N0REX6|4.0|The first pass through this CD was honestly just OK. The second pass through was like rediscovering it all over and most definitely almost an instant classic in my eyes. Tracks are very up beat and live, while some really make your emotions turn like \\"Not for me\\". You can feel the emotion is Myle's voice and it just makes you feel it too. Truly a very versatile duo with excellence throughout the LP. This album truly has something for everyone with tracks that echo Journey like \\"We will roam\\" and new age feel title track \\"Apocalyptic love\\". Overall, an excellent balance and worth every cent. This duo has made me a believer with their original content and am looking forward to album #2.
B008JAG2AA|3.0|American Reunion is very special to me because I grew up with these kids. Not the actual actors, but the people they represent. I hraduated in 1999 and just celebreated my \\"13th\\" reunion. So I think I have an inside view.<br /><br />The movie was a good solid comedy.  It dragged at times, I laughed outloud a lot, I cringed, I even had to pause for a minute so I could stop laughing and hear the dialog. My husband (not a 1999) also enjoyed it...although probably not as much as I did.<br /><br />If you are expecting serious comedy look elsewhere. If you want a raunchy, hilarious trip down memory lane then this is a must see.
B005OGYH90|5.0|Made in Stoke was an excellent ride through Slash and his history of GNR, his solo stuff from Snakepit and his recent joint venture with Altered Bridge's singer Myles Kennedy. They explore through some great classics like \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" and \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", but also delve into some B-sides like \\"Speed Parade\\" and \\"Beggars and Hangers-On\\" from his Snakepit era. Great collection of artists playing tracks you know and love. A worth while buy and a great way to get some work done and cruising through an hour plus of excellent live rock at it's finest.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I read the books and loved them.  I wondered how they were going to actually create a lot of the characters, action and scenery.  The movie blew me away and surpassed my expectations.  I definitely recommend it!
B005UVYXPW|5.0|just doesn't get better than this. now waiting for episodes 5 to hit i can hardly wait. any time now
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game is much more challenging.  Just when I thought I had passed one level, I found more games available.  Watch out it can be addicting.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I have enjoyed TED talks on my computer for years and love to watch one...when I have time.  Using the App for my Kindle Fire, I have been able to download 10-15 talks before I hop on a plane and am able to watch several of these on a 2-3 hour flight.  The app for Kindle Fire works perfect.  I get HD quality videos with excellent MPEG audio quality that I can enjoy with earbuds or headphones...or from the built in Kindle speakers themselves.    Want a good recommendation for a Great TED Talk?[...]
B00514HDNW|4.0|I find Richard Matheson a WONDERFUL writer..  He has written many many things from the old Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to Somewhere in Time among others..<br /><br />This book is closer to Vincent Price's Last Man on Earth than Will Smith's I am Legend.. In fact, I found very very few similiarities to the Smith film..  but.. it kept me on the edge of my seat..  Was very spooky...
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was very disappointed in this novel and cringed at all the vulgarity. Will not buy another of her books.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|definitely fun.  very colorful.  graphics are very real.  the bird noises are great.  maybe a little easier than the original.  I like it better than angry birds insp<br />ace!
B00138J342|5.0|This is a quintessential alt rock album of the 90s! Great tracks that illuminate Pearl jams appeal and talent. I couldn't have gotten thru the 90s music scene without it!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The book gives you a whole new way to look at dogs and their lives. Believing dogs can return as a human is a great idea. I loved the story.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This is a great book for anybody willing to publish kindle ebooks. Awesome ideas for promoting your books, I picked up some amazing tips.
0525952926|1.0|Loved the book.  Hated the price gouge.  I guess that should average a three star, but out of bitterness I am rating a 1 star.
B006Z7Z3R2|2.0|This movie was a very big let down!  I read many reviews that said how Ti West's movies keep you on the edge of your seat and that they are good, but this movie to me was very boring and dull.  They did not even show a ghost until toward the end of the movie.  Plus the ending left me confused about if the girl involved was imagining these things or if there was actual ghosts.  If you are a true horror fan or like ghost movies stay away from this movie.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Great special effects, great plot, fast moving.  Very enjoyable overall. Great movie for the action movie lover.  I would recommend it to anyone pre-teen and up.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really really enjoyed this book. My only complaint is that I didnt want it to end.... and it did. There were times that I would try and read for a few minutes before bed and I literally could not put the book down. Thanks for setting the record straight, and thanks for doing America and the world a favor! BUY THIS BOOK!!!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I can't stand watching TV, but I am hooked to SOA.  Season 4 was awesome. Stayed up till 3 am watching this even though I had to get up in the am.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a well written book and is an easy read.  With all of the hype from the government about 'secrets', I was surprised to not find and questionable areas of the book.  The author is a Patriot and just wants accuracy for the public.
0425263908|5.0|I had just finished reading the 50 Shades trilogy for the second time.  I was looking up books similar to 50 Shades and I wanted something to feed my appetite in the same way that 50 left me breathless.  I searched the Internet with the terms\\" Books similar to Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and Barred to You was the first book to come up. I read the book description and purchased it immediately. When I see reviews listed here that says this is just like 50 Shades of Grey - well that's what I was looking for.  I am helpless romantic and this book was perfect. I had stopped reading books in the last three years because I was to busy and could not quite seem to stay focused. I complete this book in on day... I could not put the book down I cried, giggled, laughed and held my stomach in suspense at times. I had a clear vision of the characters and they were meant for each other. This book was a FANTASTIC read!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|The product itself was fine, but Lost got a little out there during this season. But, it's Lost, so I should have expected it.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|I have never bought any of Katy Perry's music but I did enjoy this documentary - she seems very bubbly, like-able and charismatic and it was a fun watch. I still don't plan on buying any of her music as its not really to my taste, but it was an enjoyable movie and the subject matter seemed heartfelt and genuine (the parts about her happiness/heartbreak over her marriage were sad).
B009329Y30|5.0|Fantastic movie. Went along very well with the book. book lovers will not be disappointed. Casting choices were great. Was surprised that I enjoyed zac enron south in this movie role.
B005N1OMVO|5.0|In the sum of one word Delightful. I enjoyed the show it's one of my faviorte prime time shows that live to watch every week.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I haven't listened to it very much but it is not as I had hoped for it really just makes slight sounds and I guess I was hoping it had a melody of some type for putting me to sleep. It does make quite a few sounds but I was hoping for more. Some may enjoy it though as it is interesting to play with for about 5 minutes. Not knocking it, it just isn't my cup of tea.
B008EQIK90|4.0|As far as re-makes or \\"takes\\" on something from the past, this one is pretty good.  Yes, it's cheesy but I'm pretty sure that was intentional.  If you're looking for a deep storyline that can be deconstructed then ya better skip this BUT if you are looking for a little easy-going fun then by all means give it a looksy!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Prints to my old 4100 laser and ink jet with no hiccups. First time I tried<br />Can not ask for more
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard so much about this book so I wanted to see for myself they did not lie it is a really GOOD book I'm still reading it but I'm sure I will get the other two books when I'm finished with this one.
B009329ZF2|4.0|It was pretty good. I did miss part of it when I snoozed out a little. But I had no desire to rewind to watch what I missed.
B000NHPCS0|5.0|If you have never seen this film, then go into a corner and shame yourself. The performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson alone are worth giving this film five stars. When you incorporate all of the history of race relations in Boston, and Scorsese's unparalleled ability to tell a story you end up with the Oscar winner for film of the year.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|I loved this book.  The characters were a madcap bunch of dunces!  Every page sent Ignatius further into the vortex of insane duncehood.  But was he the dunce or everyone else around him?
B008XCF7Y6|2.0|Not as good as I thought it would be, could have been better if it was a \\"real\\" movie with \\"real\\" people, and not like a game!!!critic
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The movie told a great story and did a very good job of \\"showing\\" me the story I read in the book. I'll watch it again and can't wait for the next two in the series.
B000W1PXTU|5.0|If your in your 40's like I am, this will bring back memories, if your younger, then you owe it to yourself to give this a listen. Nazereth had several hits during their career, but really hit it big with Love hurts, which is included on this cd. The song hair of the dog is another hit from the album, and is a great song. What most people don't realize is that the entire album is just as good as those two songs. Check it out for the first time, or drift back in time!!
B007T8BYWE|1.0|You want decent puzzles try cross me.  Much better detail and you can get color too.  All types of pictures and free updated.  Don't pay for each expansion pack it's a waste.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written, easy to follow, hard to put down. Enjoyed the hell out of it.<br /><br />From an old warrior, God bless our troops, and may God bless America.
B007N8RULO|4.0|good basic app. you can chose level of difficulty. I like easiest to empty my brain when I'm stressed. just wish they had &quot;no more moves&quot; feature
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy does not disappoint with this latest release!  I will continue to look for and recommend all of her books!  I love that she leaves you breathlessly waiting at the end of each chapter for what happens next!...
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Actually listened to this on audio book.  Found it to be interesting, but a bit predictable at times.  A great way to pass time on a long trip with the teens in the car.
B008RTE066|5.0|I don't understand why people think this is a bad film, its a pure work of genius in my opinion. So yay! :D
B008KPDYQY|3.0|I am a big fan of Jason Segel, but this one left me disappointed. The movie is slow and badly paced. It could be the direction or the editing, but this one just did not cut it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a very realistic, almost humbly written story about the brave men who defend and protect America. Not because they want hero worship for what they do, but because of a sense of duty and honor. It was a priviledge to be inside the world of these patriots.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Great movie, better than I expected. Even the husband loved it! Would definitely recommend this comedy. The husband group was hilarious.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Addictive reading! I highly recommend it! I couldn't stop reading when i started it. The author creates a unique universe.
159668139X|5.0|An excellent starter book with clear illustrations that walks you through the basics of tools, equipment, materials & techniques, then gives comprehensive instructions for beginner projects.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|Owning almost every album Rush has ever released, it was only natural that I would purchase this new release \\"Clockwork Angles\\"; however, I have to admit that for the first time, I was not happy with their last album \\"Snakes and Arrows\\", so the decision to purchase this one was not automatic. With all that said, I am happy I did purchase this fast paced, hard hitting, rocking album!<br />I can't believe these guys are nearing 60 years old. Neil Peart is a drumming machine. Every space is filled with his presence. Alex gives amazing guitar riffs and solos one after another. And Geddy surprises us at the end with some very moving piano in the Garden. It was this last song that actually made me \\"HAVE\\" to get this album.<br />Of course I now love all the tracks which is great since I really only liked 3 off the last album. I'm looking forward to seeing them for the 20th time in November here in Los Angeles. Get this album, you won't regret it if you like hard rock.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think I may be in love with Gillian Flynn.<br /><br />This is the story of Amy Elliott Dunne and Nick Dunne, the perfect couple in the ideal marriage. It's a storybook tale . . . or maybe it isn't. One day Amy goes missing, and it slowly begins to dawn on you that one (or both) of the two is a sociopath. Gone Girl is plotted almost as diabolically as Catch 22. It's near-perfect, with jaw-dropping shocks and shivers all the way to the very last page.<br /><br />Amy is the Golden Girl, raised in wealth and privilege in New York's intellectual society, brilliant and drop-dead gorgeous. She is Amazing Amy, the subject of her loving parents' eponymous series of children's books that instilled in a generation a powerful sense of right and wrong. Amazing Amy is everyone's ideal.<br /><br />Nick is a son of Missouri, a Tom Sawyer-like figure who grew up near Hannibal and literally once held a job impersonating Huck Finn for tourists. Himself drop-dead gorgeous and a brilliant writer, Nick is the perfect husband for the perfect woman.<br /><br />As this story unfolds in Flynn's expert hands, we learn more and more about these extraordinary people. At length, we figure out that things can't possibly turn out well. But we can't possibly guess how.<br /><br />The style with which this thrilling tale is told is simply intoxicating. Gone Girl is one of the very best novels of of suspense I've ever read. For once, a novel is topping the New York Times bestseller list that isn't (a) written on James Patterson's assembly-line, (b) a potboiler about the rich, powerful, and famous, or (c) female S&M porn. If you have even remote interest in thrillers, read this book.
B004US4K2C|4.0|I love that I am able to customize my Samsung Galaxy S3 even further with the additional themes/icons/transition effects. Creating and updating apps folders is much easier. Once an app folder is created I can go into the folder and select apps to add or remove instead of having to open the apps drawer and dragging the app into the folder (dragging the apps from the app drawer didn't always work for me if the apps drawer covered the apps folder I was trying to access and/or that home screen was too full.  I also have 10 additional icons I can add on the scrolling dock bar (for a total of 15 instead of the standard 5), 2 additional home screens (for a total of 9 home screens instead of 7-- even though I'm currently only using 3 home screens), and I can change the home screen grid to 5x5 (5 icons across and 5 rows) so you can maximize home screen space.  Another convenient feature is that you are able to rename your icons (useful when the name of the app doesn't always describe what it does and so I forget what it's for) or change it (use an icon from another theme) if you don't like the one in the current theme (although it won't necessarily \\"match\\" the current theme's icons, but it doesn't bother you then it's a nice feature).<br /><br />The big downside is that it causes my phone to lag a bit. For example whenever I restart my phone it, there is a lag with the loading of the icons. Not only do the icons lag in loading, but the selected Go Launcher theme icons load first before switching to the selected theme's icons (I have one theme selected but customized and used icons from another theme). Another downside (but one that I can live with) is that not all of the native widgets work/are available with the Go Launcher-- just means that I have to download yet another widget if there is a particular one that I preferred. Also in the non-Go Launcher mode, the number of e-mails I had showed on the icon and it does not in the Go Launcher option.  I've downloaded the Go Launcher Notification app, but does not work for ANY of my apps even though I've tried to reboot and uninstall/reinstall.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) FREE<br />2) MANY customization options for your phone (i.e. new themes, icons, transition effects, dock bars, etc)-- if you really wanted to, you can make your phone \\"look\\" like an iPhone, HTC phone, Windows, Mac, or a combo of any of them with the theme selections.<br />  a) Up to 9 total home screens instead of 7, plus you can select size of your home screen grid up to 5x5 for a total of 25 icons instead of 16.  With these options you don't even need folders.  You could just use a home screen for each category.  Also you can choose transition effects for your home screens.<br />  b) Sliding dock bar allows for a total of 15 icons instead of 5.  This in combination with the max 9 home screens with 25 max icons per home screen= possibility of up to 240 unique icons without having to use folders (just sayin').  You can also select background for dock bar.<br />  c) Can select certain things from the different themes you have installed (i.e. icons from one theme, folder icons/styles from another, dock bar, etc).<br />3) Can switch back and forth from the Go Launcher option and the native Touchwhiz Launcher.<br />4) When I switch between themes within Go Launcher, I don't have to recreate app folders and/or homescreens (I did have to do this initially when I first switched from Touchwhiz to Go Launcher).  If you have a custom wallpaper and customized icons, you may need to reselect those.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Lag time<br />2) Loss of some native widget accessibilities.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Very easy to use but one must be careful how one enters the numbers and other parameters of the calculation.  For a fast calculator it is good.  For entertainment and learning for the young ones a gem.  It is all in how you use it and not to expect a full blown scientific calculator from it as it will not deliver.  But it is as neat as a bug's ear.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Amazon MP3 has a user-friendly interface and is a viable alternative to Itunes and Google Play.  For anyone who likes to get their entertainment content from Amazon, this is a strong app.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|A new best selling author just burst on the scene.  What a plot!  The action captivates you from the first few pages and you will not be able to put it down. I have already purchased his other two books.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book with its interesting plot which unfolds in a way that keeps you guessing. Lee Childs has created a character that continues to fascinate me and his many fans, supported by jolly good writing. If you have never read a Jack Reacher story read this one and you will be soon combing the stores for the previous titles!!
B003WJ81MA|5.0|I was a child when this movie came to the big screen. I loved it then and I love it still.
B004NS710C|5.0|Unstoppable is so good I can watch it time after time and never get tired of it.Dw Is the greatwst!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyable read with lots of twists.  The author did an excellent job of leading the reader through the minds of both main characters adding surprises and twists along the way.  The characters were believable and clever.  The only down side was that about 3/4 through the book, I predicted the outcome and was a bit disappointed to find it did indeed end the way I expected.  All in all I would recommend this book.
144234900X|5.0|I have read all the reichs books and this one is particularly good  .Will definitely buy the next one The usual characters are all present
B00746O3X8|5.0|This product is the best. I have tested it to make sure it meets my requirements as an outdoor's photographer and it meets all requirements. It is well made and extremely comfortable. The price is also perfect. Great Product.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book puts you right in the middle of the courtyard in the raid on UBL. It's good to see the people who actually did the job get credit for it instead of the Washington cronies that think they did all the work. Way to go ST6.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|This is a great selection of songs performed by a woman with a lovely, expressive voice. My musical tastes are generally about as far away from women singing ballads as you can get, but after hearing her sing for the first time I wanted to hear more.<br /><br />I'm happy I bought the (what do you call it now that it is not a record or CD) \\"album\\" through Amazon digital and I will definitely keep Adele on my radar.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I guess you have to be into this and read the books to really appreciate it. It had a good story line but just didnt have the punch i was looking for after talking with people who read the book. I dont recommend this movie if you havent read the book. I guess yo can say it was dull.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Fast, interesting reading giving details of the planning and execution of the raid that have not been revealed by any other source.  This is not War and Peace, but it is worthwhile.
B008XG1X18|4.0|the fact that it closes all by itself on a regular basis. :( I'm using it w/ my kindle fire. Great app otherwise.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love Pinterest!  The app for the Kindle Fire keeps force closing on me so that is very frustrating. Wish they would fix this problem. That is the reason for the 3 star rating. Other than that, I love it!
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|This app kept me on my toes. It took some time for me to get the hang of it. Once I did, there was no stopping me. I can't wait for my son to choke home from school and try it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|When I first got my Kindle it was the first App I tried to add, and was disappointed when it wasn't available.  I'm so happy to have it now.  I love Pinterest, and it's so nice to have it on the go too.  You never know when you need to look for inspiration.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|DISC 1:Is the original 'Bad' album.<br /><br />DISC 2: All of the unreleased songs are killer. If you love the BAD CD and the other songs from that era that are on the \\"Ultimate Collection\\" box set, then I would be very confused if you didn't love these songs. The unreleased demo's are a million times better than anything on the radio today. \\"Abortion Papers\\" and \\"Al Capone\\" are gold mines but on the other hand the spanish and french versions of \\"I Just Cant Stop Loving You\\" a pretty pointless unless you speak spanish or french. Also the 2 remixes of \\"Bad\\" are extremely horrible. The \\"Speed Demon\\" remix is kinda cool but pretty lame compared to the original.<br /><br />DISC 3: Is the live disc which has all the songs you know and love and its obviously great.<br /><br />The DVD: Now I am a avid bootleg collector with well over a 100 bootleg DVD's & I am SHOCKED that people are saying that the DVD looks like a bootleg. Some people obviously have no idea what a real bootleg is. Mostly they are shot by fans at the concert and are often kinda all over the place with that fan just shooting whatever he wants to record focusing on whatever part of the show they are most in to and you would be very lucky to have a few good moments of kinda a clear picture but it would almost always have some drunk guy in front of him blocking part of the shot. NOW THIS DVD MY FRIENDS IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE: Real bootlegs do not have multi-camera angles they do not zoom in and out nothing of the sort, this was professionally shot and the picture is almost perfect considering it came from a 25 year old VHS tape. The only time it kinda seems blurry is when they pan away to show a shot of the whole stage which only last a few seconds. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews of the DVD because the estate did an amazing job at restoring a 25 year old VHS tape. I'm really clueless as to what people thought it was gonna look like. I thought it was gonna look good, but I was blown away at howgood it looks.
B0091XRL86|5.0|We wanted to see this for along time.  Was not disappointed!  It held my grandchildrens attention the whole time.  Lots of action and plenty of colorful characters.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|This is a simple, to-be-played-in-between-more-serious-games kind of game, based around a push-your-luck mechanic. The idea is that you play zombies hunting for brains, and you cast dice with various numbers of brains, gunshots, and feet, which represent a score (brain), a loss (gunshot), and a re-roll (feet- your victim ran away). Get three gunshots and you lose all the brains you accumulated. The trick is in knowing when to stop and when to push your luck. First person to get 13 brains wins.<br /><br />I though I'll get tired of the gameplay pretty fast, but it does have a certain addictive quality because it manages to achieve a degree of suspense from being in a race and for not being entirely in control. I played it with my little sisters (ages 7 and 9) and they enjoyed it a lot.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Very repetitious.  Had a pretty good story line BUT could have done less with all the sex.  Aflter a while it got to be boring.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This was a quick read, very entertaining and funny. The characters were enjoyable. The story line was interesting and fast-paced.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|As a Hello Kitty fanatic, I was drawn to this game initially because of the super cute characters. But as I got to playing it, I got drawn into upgrading the food and decorations. Its a really fun game to pass the time during my off hour at school. My only complaint is that you have to invest real money or play an awful lot to earn the points needed to get the extra characters and upgrades. Very cute though!
B008D30K7E|4.0|A totally different read. Light, entertaining and laugh-out-loud in places. Reality does need to be suspended in places but i found it a joy to read.
B008MZU8R0|5.0|The latest release by the best band in the universe does not disappoint. Fantastic piece of musicianship!!! These guys are on top of their game.
B008QTUPUW|5.0|I enjoyed this series and am anxious for the next season to come out.  It's very good.  Both people are believable.
B0014KFM2Q|3.0|OK, nothing to write home about.  At least don't look back is on this album, not the best, but It's on here.  Poor editing in between songs, but, It's Bruce, who cares.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|My kids and I love this game.  It requires a lot of strategy in the upper levels and is fun.
B001QXE0OC|5.0|I love Sel Sel Gomez what can I say! I continuously listen to her CDs the music does not get old I love it. Buy buy buy buy. Thanks.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|one may become discouraged reading reviews for this album...i have been pumped for their next album ever since Day and Age which, unlike many, im a pretty big fan of......the Killers have given us a couple of nice tracks to tide us over while awaiting for their new album - cover of U2's \\"Ultra Violet\\" and a cover of \\"Go All the Way\\" and a Christmas single.....but now we FINALLY get a new album and in a way its a mixed bag...theres no \\"fun\\" songs here...its a very mature album...no \\"Spaceman\\" or \\"Bones\\" or \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on this album....instead Brandon's lyrics reflect a more serious tone.....first single \\"Runaways\\" is one of their best songs easily...opener \\"Flesh and Bone\\" easily stands out in the Killers' catalog...love it!.....i heard a live version of \\"miss atomic bomb\\" and was completely blown away....but when i heard the studio version here on the album i was major letdown...still a good track but nowhere near as epic as the live version.Why? becuz at about 2 minutes into the song....the epic part with guitars and synths...on the cd you can faintly hear the synths....yet on the live version they crank them up and it sounds amazing...the album version is too \\"quiet\\"...still i like it but just sayin......other standout tracks include the excellent 80sish \\"deadlines and commitments\\"..love it..lots of 80s feel to this track....in fact the whole album has a U2/Depeche Mode/Police/Springsteen vibe to it......\\"Be Still\\" is another that may take a couple listens to get into but im loving it.....and the final track \\"Battle Born\\" is an epic closer....one of their best songs ever....the other tracks didnt really standout but i am going to give them a few other listens...as far as the production it sounds great and Brandon's vocals really stand out on this album....i bought the regular cd even tho i do like the song \\"carry me home\\" which is on the deluxe version.....overall i think some of the one and 2 star reviews are a bit harsh...its certainly no Hot Fuss or SamsTown but i think after a few listens any Killers fan will grow to appreciate the album a bit...should be at least 3-4 star album
B00005ASIL|5.0|Ian Anderson never ceases to amaze me! It's like he never ever gets tiring. I've been a fan for years and now my grandkids are following this pied piper's mystical flute. If ever there was an endless sound it certainly comes from this Scot. He never ceases to amaze me and I will be seeing him in october. Long live the Wild Flute Imp. Gotta love him!!!!!
B0076NKNLA|1.0|Can't believe Williams got an Oscar nomination for this.  I thought she was terrible as Marilyn.  Plus lame script. I was really disappointed in this movie.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have been a fan of Mitch Albom since the \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\". Every book, fiction or non-fiction, is so well written and really makes you think about the important things in life. Although I have heard that Mitch writes his books as lesson to himself, his books take those simple moment, feel, or people we take for granted and remind us that some thing are more precious that the material thing we all focus on.<br />\\"The Time Keeper\\" is a wonderful story about those moment we take for granted, the time we give away, and how one decision can change the direction of time forever. This book is definitely worth the time to read.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I was expecting a more documentation typ of book but it reads like a fiction and the writer salted and peppered a lot to beef up the story. He seems to be always in the middle of the action and his men are all hero bla bla.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Prometheus had so much hype and promise, but it was an ultimate failure.  It is essentially a new version of Alien except it has MULTIPLE plot holes, horrible characters, horrible decisions made by characters, and it just went on way too long.  What an abysmal experience this was.  The movie was a chore to get through, and the only thing I think about in the end was how I could get my money back.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|This movie is a classic. The plot, actors, and style of videography are all classics! It's a very colorful movie with a very compelling theme. When following the plot line, it helped that I had read the play recently.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Wise..not dated.  A cast so wholesome it made me nostalgic for an earlier time.  Gregory Peck plays a man with true sensitivity to the injustice of the situation.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|I really like the concept of the game, but I think it should have a few more functions in it. I think you should be able to create sums horizontally as well as vertically, use more than two blocks to create a sum, and when the sum changes, any combos on the board that create the new number should vanish. Just my thoughts/requests, otherwise a great brain game.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed the authors story of his life, how he became a seal, and his time as a seal. His account of the events surrounding the mission to capture or kill Osama are important since so much information has been released by politicians. I felt that he could have left out some of the details related to the actual killing and handling of Osama's body. Maybe some people need those details but I thought they could have been omitted.  Overall a good read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|how come there isn't survival mode. awesome game but are they gonna update the app. I still give it five stars but survival mode is cool. I hope that add it to any update they are gonna do.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works like a charm on both my Kindle Fire and Android phone.  Features are easy to use and interface is relatively smooth.
B004BSAEQC|1.0|Downloaded by accident but thought maybe it would be good and ya it is not her best work. That is for sure.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a reader.  Some of my co-workers were talking about it and so I figured maybe I would try to read it.  I managed to get through it in a week and found it to be very interesting reading.  I enjoyed the book and now working on the second book and plan to read the third as well.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|It seemed to short but it was as good as others.  I may read it again to be sure. Is this okay?
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I loved this book, like all of his books!  This one really makes you stop and think about how much our lives are consumed with time!!  It also makes you think about others around you, to be less judgemental of others. The  epilogue was a great ending.
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|Fun chick flick. Perfect for a girls night. Reminds me of Love Actually. It's light hearted and will make you smile.
0525953728|5.0|I am retired Navy and have read many books regarding the teams for the past few  years.  The ones I have read have been really good and this book is no exception.  However, I must add that while good, this book is the BEST I have ever read on the subject.  It doesn't give anything away (as DOD tried to say) and tells the truth from someone who was there (2nd in line for breach that killed OBL) and exposes the lies of the current administration and other DOD officials.  What surprised me the most was that the details of the mission were known within ONE hour after the President made the announcement.  Further, there were private citizens who knew the team was meeting with the President ahead of time which was a gross compromise of the President's itinerary for our enemies to know.  This administration should read some of the old WWII phrases like, \\"loose lips sink ships.\\"
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Did find this to be suspenseful and beautifully filmed but not as exciting as all the pre-releases stated. Entertaining, but horrific concept.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love the science and extra little facts and research. Learn something new while waiting for Tempe gets in trouble, nearly killed, and saved at the last second. Thanks for the ride.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Born and Raised is another excellent album from the one and only John Mayer! Great songs & amazing voice. I have listened to this album on repeat for 2 weeks and it only keeps getting better!
B0027MJU00|2.0|Not a good read...so tired of trying to make myself read it. I hope it has a fabulous ending bc reading it has been torture.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|This movie has some of the greatest one on one scenes I've seen. The eggplant exchange between hopper and Walken is brilliant.
B0087HT36U|3.0|great game just wish it was a bit bigger but was  a good way to pass a few hours!  add more levels and it will get better reviews
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I had a hard time reading the first volume, mediocre writing, kinky sex, etc.<br />But the more I got to know the reasons for Christian's odd behavior the more sympathetic he became, and I could totally understand Ana's love for him. By the end of volume one I had to go on because I cared about these 2 and wanted to see how it ended.<br /><br />Even though it contained way too many sex scenes, I didn't find them pornographic, they were more erotic and definitely written to appeal to women both emotionally and physically. I have read far more graphic sex in popular fiction written by men.<br /><br />Finally Fifty Shades is a love story between 2 unlikely people. I loved it.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|I wasn't expecting \\"space\\" stuff. I was disappointed. Had to watch the whole movie to get to the \\"good part\\", which, wasn't what I would call \\"good\\". jmo.
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|Just got the game a few minutes ago. Seems slow at first but after the first few times, it plays well. I shut off the music. Annoying to me.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Really enjoyed this, its hard to find movies that stray from the standard storylines, this one however does and its a nice refreshing change. Movie is fairly well produced.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Many people had recommended this book. It took me a while to get it. So glad I did! Didn't want the book to end!  Amazing!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best book of the 3, though I think they are all great. Already reading for the second time. Talk about boost in sex life. My husband is a huge fan and he hasn't read it!
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Practical and to the point, grounded and very helpful. I would recommend to all as a good anchor.  Like the author's other work too. See RIGHTEOUS MIND
B006YG9HJE|3.0|Why is it $14 cheaper to buy this as a region 2 DVD from Amazon UK, when region free DVD players are readily available?
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was different then the other books. I enjoyed hearing it from her point of view and I am so happy someone is finally writing a book from the male's point of view!! April can't come fast enough!!
B008J34466|4.0|I really wasn't planning on buying the new Pink album The Truth About Love but when I first heard \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\" a couple of weeks ago, I knew I had to get the album. The Truth About Love is a fun, infectious pop album. I have been listening to it constantly. It is obvious in a few of the lyrics on the album that they were inspired by her temporary separation from her husband Corey but there is also some fun party songs on the album. I think those bothered by the frequent swearing on the album should get over it. There are worse things in life to worry about. My favorite songs? \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\", \\"Try\\", and \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\" with Nate Ruess. I really love \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\". It is a beautiful song. I also dig \\"Beam Me Up\\" with the sparse acoustic guitars. It shows a more vulnerable side to Pink. Not all the songs on the album worked for me. Didn't care for \\"Here Comes the Weekend\\" and \\"Are We All We Are\\" but overall The Truth About Love is a great album in my opinion.
B000002I53|5.0|This album is right on the edge of Coltrane's move from playing the standards into free jazz, and because of that, I think it's his greatest album. The title track was my introduction into the direction where jazz was heading in the post-bop era. Coltrane starts out playing the melody of a song that no one would have thought to associate with jazz, and slowly moves from the melody into his trademark style of harmonic improvisation, and finally into a completely free solo that's as inspired and wide ranging as anything on \\"Love Supreme\\"- and then he brings it all back, playing the head once more, and finish on a note of absolute exuberance. I mean, I can feel my heart speed up just thinking about it. It's an absolute tour de force of composition and improvisation, and Coltrane holds absolutely nothing back. The sense of release when he returns to the melody brings makes me want to stand up and shout \\"yeah!\\" at the stereo. Really!<br /><br />\\"Every Time We Say Goodbye\\" is a slower tune, still very post bop. Coltrane hangs on to one note in the melody, and keeps repeating it, with different tonalities, different expressions, and then goes back to the melody once more. \\"Summertime\\" is an up temp blues, but with those unexpected Coltrane harmonies, finishing a phrase some interval up from where you'd expect it to go. And \\"But Not For Me\\" takes a standard and gives it the full treatment, with the Coltrane change substitutions in the head and then a more straight treatment of the chorus, all of which leads to an extended solo on those themes. It's just great music from the greatest tenor sax player of all time.
B0090EIILU|1.0|Borat was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen; Bruno was a disappointment and the Dictator is frankly just horrible. I turned off the movie after about an hour. The plot sounded like it would be funny but the acting and script were poorly done. Save your money and rent something else.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|As I have indicated before I am a Mark Wahlberg fan.  While the movie is somewhat different than the book it is a great action film.  I also like the shooting side of it also now that there is more coverage about military snipers.

B000JPRPAO|5.0|Well first of all I am a Mark Wahlberg fan. I think this is a great action movie.  We have a regular copy and I just got a BluRay version.  Have seen it several times and always enjoy it.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Amazing love story ... never tire of seeing it.  I fall in love with the characters each time I see them
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book should be read by every American. It tells the story of the idiocy of government in handcuffing our brave Seals.  This political correctness BS is placing our men & women in grave danger.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Noone does the writing of this period better than Philippa Gregory.<br />She refrains from getting the reader involved with too many characters ( as could happen with this subject ) Very enjoyable!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love how it rearranges itself when you have no more moves, instead of a game over. Great graphics and many levels to complete
B002EXEGTW|5.0|One of the most realistic movies ever produced and it was based upon the actual happenings of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission.
0439023513|4.0|The \\"Mocking Jay\\" was a pretty good book.  However, ending was a little different.  I think that \\"Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" were better books.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book, as with all of Mitch Albom's books, is wonderful. I am always intrigued by the stories he tells and how they're develop. This is a quick read and I highly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|this trilogy was interesting in the first book but, frankly, by the third book the subject matter and writing style were so repetitive.  The author uses the same descriptors over and over again.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|What a richly woven narrative with complex characters!  Absolutely mesmerizing. Grissom did her research  and transports the reader back in time to experience the lives of slaves and their owners.

B0087HT36U|5.0|I enjoy this game more than Angry Birds. It is a fantastic entry into the strategically destroying type of game. If you enjoy such a game then you'll be entertained for hours upon hours. You simply do not want to put this game down.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|I've known of this book for years, having seen the early movie with Tyrone Power. The movie was surprisingly true to the book, although of course, the book had its own delights due to the clear strong voice in which it was written. A classic well worth revisiting!
B00628RVV0|4.0|I have to say the story was great, the movie was good overall, only thing I know I will not be seeing this title again for the simple reason I just cannot stomach the ending again... It's too hard for me to handle.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I had avoided this film due to the heavy media but we decided to see it online. What a surprise. It was reasonably well acted and directed; the subject matter was very much of interest, however.
B000NTMWYU|5.0|A Good Year is now one of my favorite movies. It was money well spent because I have already watched it several times. It just brings joy to my day!

But, to my chagrin it did not. As a man, I can only imagine that there are alot of women that fantasize about being sexually tortured. I was as disappointed in the end as I was in the rest of the story.<br />P.S. Can't imagine how they could make a movie out of this book,<br /> except a porno. I'm not even a prude.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|Cool Runnings is a classic movie from the 90s that will keep you laughing, is appropriate for children, and has a great story line.  I recommend it highly.

B008OTTRXU|5.0|Ok Lets get it out of the way, \\"Call Me Maybe\\" is awesome and well worth buying the album by itself; however, I think it isn't the best song on the album. I own Tug Of War and this album is even better. It is well produced, written, and CRJ's voice has transitioned into a new sound, but with the same familiar and wonderful Ennunciations. This album is so much more than I was hoping for and Well Worth Buying! I will review the songs in the order I like them because this is my review.<br />  The best song on the album in my opinion is \\"More Than A Memory.\\" It is melancholy set to an upbeat tempo and laced with gorgeous vocals. It is one of them songs you stay in the car and listen to the end before you kill the engine and get out. The next song on the album I love is \\"Tonight I'm Getting Over You.\\" You feel for the broken-hearted singer, but at the same time time the techno beat takes you on the ride to getting better and moving on. The vocals are incredible and the song is well composed like most of the album. The next song to make you hum along and wiggle in your seat is \\"Hurt So Good,\\" the beat get awesome, the vocals are pretty and catchy, and it all comes together in a song you won't want to skip. I love that \\"Good Time\\" with Owl City is on the album!!! It is a great song and one of the best hits of this summer, and as well as \\"Call Me Maybe,\\" worth the album purchase price.<br />  I figured a paragraph break was about due :~p \\"This Kiss\\" is a wonderful tune with the potential to be stuck in your head for weeks, and even though I don't really like the message of messing around, the song is cute and better than half the stuff on the radio right now. \\"Call Me Maybe\\" is great... enough said. \\"Tiny Little Bows\\" is so wonderfully peppy, poppy, cute, and catchy. I love that they sampled \\"Cupid Pull Back Your Bow... (originally by Sam Cook)\\" \\"Curiosity\\" and \\"Turn Me Up\\" are both wonderfully produced, written, and composed. \\"Turn Me Up\\" is a great song to finish listening to the album on, it wraps it up and and makes you smile. \\"Curiosity\\" is a very plateau-ish song. The build-up to the chorus says \\"here it comes.. wait for it .... wait for it,\\" but then the chorus falls short. The song is very good, but could have been better.<br />  A beautiful song for the hopeless romantic at heart is \\"Guitar String/Wedding Ring.\\" CRJ's vocals are strong, confident and combined with the track's great back-beat will have you tapping your foot. \\"Your Heart Is A Muscle\\" is very pretty and I can't place the piano accompaniment, but it wonderful.<br />  OK here's the Bad news, \\"Beautiful,\\" CRJ's part in the song is pretty, but the song is filler. Considering J. Bieber is listed #1 on the executive producers, I'm not surprised he has a track on the album. Thank you for producing the album though Mr. Bieber.<br />  This is one of the best pop albums ever compiled in my opinion. I fully endorse it and hope it dominates the billboards or whatever they have now.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The actual killing mission of Osama bin !aden could have been told in just a few chapters. This book takes you through the experience of Navy Seal training such that you get a sense of what these men go through to make the elite teams. No easy training. Then, you experience missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan and learn the type enemy America is up against. You also learn about the waffling of America's top leaders in making decisions like the bin Laden mission. There are numerous starts and stops. It appears are leaders are just as concerned about their reputations as they are about getting the job done. The actual mission to kill bin Laden is tightly told, taking the reader step by step through the actual events, which did not happen as first reported by the government. Buy it and read the truth.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|It was a good book. I admire her courage and her positive attitude. She's inspiring. It's a good book for anyone suffering.

B008JAFXOQ|4.0|Very thought provoking...  I was uber aware of the tension of the inner battle that fights for recognition in our psychological struggle to keep going.  Only great actors do make this apparent without having to spell it out.  This movie did it for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fine writing enhances an unusually well told story in this popular book.  It's no wonder it's become a world-wide phenomenon!  Characters are drawn well and believable, even though most people would probably say it's pretty out-there.  Everyone dreams of that millionaire lover, but this one is written as if he were real, due to his many hang-ups.<br />Of course, it's somewhat absurd, but definitely worth reading!
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|I like the speed. it seems like sometimes the touchscreen doesn't respond quickly. not sure if that will improve as I play longer and fine tune the touch maybe?

1400049628|3.0|Let's be clear, Mr. Brooks has made a generous contribution to the understanding of Zombification and Zombie Survival.  For the uninitiated, this book is an excellent start.  Mr. Brooks does indeed cover a wide range of topics but there are some glaring holes in his treatise.  Most specifically, he fails to consider how workable his strategies are for those with family.  In an outbreak situation in which you have a family of four to manage, including small children, Mr. Brooks strategies may prove simply too difficult to employ.  Further, he offers no discussion on the psychological implications a zombie outbreak.  How do you talk with your children about zombies?  How do you deal with neighbors/aquaintences/hangers on?  He mentions the importance of groups but he does not really offer specifics except when discussion preparation for a Class IV outbreak.<br /><br />There are some dubious statistics as well.  Such as the likelihood of encountering a sea borne zombie, he gives a ludicrously specific odds ratio.<br /><br />Despite these short comings, I'd recommend this guide to get you going.<br /><br />Good hunting.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Read the book first, then watched the movie with my husband. He loved the movie, I liked it. After reading the book, it was no comparison. The book is so deep, it was impossible not to get completely wrapped up into the characters thoughts and feelings. The movie just couldn't compete. But, my husband (who didn't read the book) thought the movie was good. I am in love with Nicholas Sparks books! Currently on my 5th one, and haven't read a bad one yet. This one gives a great spin on how 9/11 affected even more people than you might initially have thought. Very powerful, deep true-to-life, human feelings. So tired of vampires and mindless sex books. This is a book that a man or woman of any age could read and enjoy.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|I loved the Jump Street T.V. series, however this movie discussed me within 15 min. of watching it. I'm sure those that that don't let cussing bother them found this to be a good movie. For me I couldn't get past the language used to enjoy the movie. Sad too because I really thought I would like it. To those of you whom are offended by the use of the F bomb in every other sentence and other derogatory actions should steer clear of this movie. If offensive gestures and language doesn't bother you the movie might be just what you want to watch.

B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Posted 8:08 AM<br /><br />Game Play:<br /><br />You can move the cubes from side to side by sliding your finger on the screen and if you tap the screen you shuffle the cubes in a clockwise manner.  Try to get the cubes to land on top of each other so that they add up to the AWEsum number that the game is wanting for that level.  If you are able to land blocks and simultaneously get the objective number twice with the same move you get a score multiplier and another swap token.  The swipe token on the RH side of the screen changes the numbers on the cubes while they are falling.<br /><br />You gain 10 points for matching the desired sum, 10 points for matching the color, one point for each row power-dropped, and bonuses multiple your scores based on the number of AWEsums you achieve.  If you create five AWEsums in a row your get a number bomb that destroys all of the cubes of the same number it falls on.  A double arrow cube destroys cubes horizontally and can even destroy an entire row.<br /><br />You can flip the numbers down and have them fall faster to the bottom.  The target AWEsum number changes periodically to a new number and right before it changes it beings to flash.  The target number can only be achieved by adding cubes vertically and not horizontally.  You can also achieve the sum by adding only two stacked cubes and not three.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />The instructions are very good. The game play is solid on my Kindle Fire and I had no issues.  It is sort of like playing a Tetris game where the cubes are all the same size but the number on the cube is what matters and if you match the number and the cube color you double your points.  Think fast!<br /><br />It is a challenging game that keeps you concentrating on math, color and on the location that you want to place the cubes at.<br />The game requires no permissions or default launches!  Yeah!  Its game size is only 8.07 MB uncompressed on my Kindle Fire.  The sound and music were unobtrusive and they didn't get on my nerves like some sound tracks of games do.  The graphics were OK.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />This is a short list, I find nothing wrong with this game.<br /><br />I did try to triple up by stacking three cubes to achieve the number and also create the number side by side but it didn't work.  This might be an option for future updates.  At the present time the game only considers vertical pairs of numbers.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Overall this is a good game that delivers what it says it will.  It is fun for all ages and I give it a 5 star rating.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I LOVED this book.  The writer takes a very interesting approach to unfolding the plot, telling the story from his and her sides, with different timelines.  Great read.  After finishing this, I immediately purchased another of the author's books, and enjoyed it immensely, as well.  I look forward to following her writing in the future.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Reacher is forever cool and above all very very calculating. Calculating in exceptionally specific ways the particular paramaters that suit the occasion. Once he has finished his analysis, he acts. In many cases explosively.  To the reader, who by now has been engaged emotionaly, this is  very satisfying.

B0088749CW|4.0|My press contact for Image Entertainment's \\"The Tall Man\\" couldn't be more correct. It's the sort of film you come away from either really liking or really hating. I enjoyed the movie and found it to be a unique little thriller.<br /><br />A nurse (Jessica Biel) takes over the duties of her deceased husband in a small mining town. Her son (Jakob Davies) is kidnapped and she believes it's the work of the Tall Man. Local legends tell of a man who comes out of the woods and abducts their children. Can the citizens track down the abductor before he strikes again?<br /><br />Director / writer Pascal Laugier put together a smart indie thriller that looks like a slasher / torture porn movie from the outside but upon closer examination is much more intricate and elaborate. It's a great movie that keeps the viewer wondering what's happening all the way to the end.<br /><br />Jessica Biel gives a convincing performance as the nurse and single-mother of missing child David. This is a role like none I've ever seen her in. Biel's no longer the teen she was in \\"7th Heaven.\\" It's hard to wipe the memory of her as Mary Camden from your mind and accept her in the role of a mother and nurse but she pulls it off quite well.<br /><br />Jodelle Ferland plays a girl named Jenny who claims to have seen the Tall Man. She does an impressive job of portraying her as a mute. Ferland displays different emotions with just the use of her facial expressions which can be hard for any actor.<br /><br />The high-definition transfer of the movie gives audiences a clean picture which thoroughly captures the gloomy ghost town it takes place in. The 5.1 surround mix lends to the atmospheric flavor you'd expect from a thriller / slasher film. The soundtrack startles you when it needs to and all the creepy sounds are here to make your skin crawl just the way horror fans like it.<br /><br />There are a few special features but not the ones I was looking for. The story leaves one with questions you would love to hear director Pascal Laugier address through an audio commentary or featurette. Unfortunately, we don't always get what we want. It does contain visual concepts, deleted scenes, and a trailer.<br /><br />\\"The Tall Man\\" takes the familiar elements of mainstream thrillers and the genre horror and slasher films we all love and blends them together to serve up an enthralling film that will leave you muttering, \\"What's going on?\\" to yourself. There are some predictable moments, but the end justifies the means in this situation. Just don't buy the Blu-ray version hoping for answers or insight into the story or characters' motivations.

Trying to hold back the demons who would love to take over the world. Sometimes fighting alongside warlocks, Downworlders, and mundanes.

B006BAEQB2|4.0|So glad someone recommended Philippa Gregory as an author.  I will probably read as many<br />of her historical novels as possible.  It is a joy to be able to learn something of times past<br />while being gripped by a really good story at the same time.  This is the second novel of this<br />era by her that I have read.  Her ability to put you into the time and place is phenomenal.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Finally the truth. Since Obama held a press conference with Hollywood how can anyone in the military complain that the book wasn't in the public domain....unless of course what Obama told the press was fiction.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|Well researched, as usual, but it didn't really \\"grab\\" me as much as others in the Cousins' Wars series.  And, I wondered how come Richard III didn't have even a hint of physical deformity, let alone a hunchback.<br /><br />Hopefully her next book in this series will tackle the mystery of the Princes in the Tower.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read. Did not want it to end. So well written. Cannot wait for the next book and only hope they continue.
B0016LTNL4|4.0|Skip the 2010 remake.  It's amazing how the two movies, with basically the same script, but different actors, are so very different.  The British version is very funny, the remake, not so much!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Ausome as awsomeness awesome radiccal cool as books well dictionarys can totally gey in the un/it ed states of america
B00564GPKY|4.0|This book really gets you thinking of the force of habits in all stages of your daily life.  From early childhood to elder care, this book provides insight into our ability to modify both our own, and perhaps more importantly, understand the habits of others.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have known Mitch Albom as an author of inspirational and quite life-changing books. This book is a good light read that can completely absord you and change your perception about time. It is creative and compelling. Simple and yet extraordinary. A book that everyone can relate to - kids hasty to be old and adults hungry for youth. Dors experience is both meaningful and inspiriting. It's not just seeing the big picture but also looking at both sides of the coin. Definitely recommended. :)
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Can't wait till the second one is released. The book was very hot and just made you want to read more. I did not want it to end.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is an excellent series, full of surprises, a perfect mix of traditional campy americana horror themes with new twists and great story telling! Not for the squimish or children however.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found the book to be enjoyable and informative. It is written with an even / calm tone which I think adds depth to the experience. You feel like you are  a silent observer getting a glimpse into the real life of some unusual individuals.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Of course I read this book decades ago and the only reason I downloaded from Kindle was to have the digital version.  What can I say, it is a classic - everyone should read it.
B00633W614|5.0|I loved this book...this author is so talented....his writing is compelling, and this book was hard to put down.  I was lucky enough to have it, and the follow up book on my Kindle so I could read them back to back...Wonderful stories.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television!  And this is not coming from someone who is usually just an action/ thriller fan.  I actually love Jane Austen movies and Bronte movies as well.  I like contemporary stuff too, but I love the girly classics.  That being said, the fact that I love Supernatural this much (which is alot!)  shows just how much of a triumph this show is.  I watch the seasons over and over again, and season 2 has some excellent episodes including 'In my time of dying, night shifter, crossroad blues, folsom prison blues, children shouldn't play with dead things, simon said, hollywood babylon, no exit, what is and what should never be' everyone loves a clown, and all hell breaks loose 1 and 2'.  this season did not disappoint whatsoever.  And the acting, once again, was superb.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Great book. Yet another hit in the Saxon series. Uhtres is one of my very favorite literary characters. Can't wait for the next one!
B000YABYLA|5.0|this is a very good movie.  It's funny yet simplistic, and doesn't deliver the same old song and dance that romantic comedies always do.  It's great and the acting is very good as well.
B006ATJXQW|2.0|I was so excited to read this prequel as I am an AVID fan of the Maze Runner trilogy. Unfortunately, this book does not meet the same standard as the three books that it was written to precede.<br /><br />The entire novel feels like fight, fight, run away. Fight, fight, run away. I found myself skipping over pages at a time saying they're fighting again, still fighting, still fighting until I would get to some writing with meaning.<br /><br />I was very disappointed because I was hoping Dashner would tell us more about Wicked and how Thomas and Theresa came to be the Thomas and Theresa we knew in the trilogy books.<br /><br />I gave it two stars just because even though it was mostly lame fight scenes the writing is still decent and I think if you've read the trilogy you should read this...just don't expect to be blown away.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|My god, this show is awesome!  The acting is good, so is the writing, the pace, and what I like most about this show is that it keeps topping itself.  In this season, there are new character, new crisis, and more complex story lines.  The introduction of Castiel into the plot was perfect!  Even when you first meet him and his actions come across as 'cold', he strikes you as a fascinating character that will soon develop into something fantastic that will become very lovable.  Some episodes in this season are priceless such as 'Monster Movie, In the Beginning, Yellow Fever, Wishful Thinking, it's the great pumpkin, san winchester, after school special, it's a terrible life, monster at the end of this book, i know what you did last summer, heaven and hell, the rapture, lucifer rising, and death takes a holiday'.  This was a consistently good season!<br /><br />And as for those who criticize the story lines, I disagree and I think they are looking for things to complain about.  Also, I feel that if they didn't secretly worship the show, then they wouldn't be watching it.
B002361MLA|5.0|I have found many answers for entire-life situations in this book; both, spiritual and practical questions: Is it  possible to understand the concept of God? Why does good and evil exist? Are the announcements of the ending of the world true?, How should we interpret them? Is it possible to become a \\"saint\\" in this world/in this life? What is the root cause of stress? Why do relationships break down? Why is there so much pain and conflict in relationsihips nowadays? Is there a right way to mantain a healty relationship? Does true love realy exist or is everything about chemistry, biological and psycological laws?. So I am learning how to practice emotional and mental health on a daily basis from this book. I recommned The Power of Now to everybody, not only for the answers you will find there, but because it is focused on modern life and its circumstances.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Basically just a \\"we trained, we went in and killed Bin Laden\\".  Some interesting facts, but not an intense page turner.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat. It left me wanting so much more. Author keeps a wonderful pace and the plot is amazing! It's a must read for a great thriller!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love everything about this game. doing advanced and expert puzzles is a little daunting depending on your screen size but I'm hooked and I play it constantly and have for weeks now.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|If you enjoy reading sagas then this is a book not to miss. The story flows well and  is easy to follow. The theme of birth status strong and it was exhilirating reading of good overcoming evil. All characters well defined and personable. All up a very enjoyable book.
B009329Y30|4.0|This was close to the book and really I enjoyed it. It was great casting too. I would recommend it to anyone.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have just finished 'No Easy Day' on my Kindle and it's everything that I expected from hearing about it in the press (and more). The author begins by telling his story of how he came to the US Navy out of college, why he enlisted instead of seeking an officer's commission and some of the experiences that he had and how tough it was becoming a Navy Seal. You'll read about what a Seal's personal life can and cannot be and the esprit de corps that builds within his team and among his Seal friends. It's an easy read - not exactly political, but I kind of got the feeling that there might be some impatience on his part when sometimes Washington seems to procrastinate on making decisions that move the Seals into battle.<br /><br />I am in awe of this group of patriotic Americans and the book almost made me wish that I was young enough to re-enlist in the US Navy. It [[ASIN:B008MG1E4A No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]is well-written, at times spell binding and definitely informative on what went down that day in Bin Laden's compound.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I rarely find myself writing reviews, because most of the time what i was thinking- another reader has already written:) Finding so many bad reviews for crossed though, i find myself wanting to comment.<br /><br />I did not like matched that much. Did not hate it, certainly read it, but by the time crossed came out i had completely forgotten what matched was even about (not a good thing). I vaguely re read a couple pages of matched and remembered the story line, but also remembered not liking it much. I almost did not purchase Crossed- but so glad i did.<br /><br />Is the story perfect, fast past? Nope- but it is a much better story and gives further insight than matched did. If felt like matched had all of the authors story about the place, people, but no emotion. I couldn't connect with the characters... in crossed, it was very different- i truly connected with both of the characters and felt i could feel, see, experience with them! Not the best book of the year, but certainly going to be reading the next one! If you didn't like matched- i still encourage you to give this one a try :)
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book changes my life - several health issues cleared up within days.  Severe stomach problems that plagued me for decades are gone.  Off wheat for ever and my belt is getting loose.<br /><br />Thank you Bill O'Reilly<br /><br />Don
B007KZY1YY|2.0|I bought the second book in order to see where the realationship was going and why \\"50' was the way he was.  I got bored.  Very bored and it is now filed, unfinished in my Kindle library.  I can't recommend it
B007FEZQF8|5.0|It doesnt follow the tv show very closely but its still fun to read. This is my first graphic novel and i really enjoyed it.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A few of my friends really enjoyed this book.  Maybe the author wants the reader to feel how detached the father in the book is to his past.  If so, then it's great, but not for me.  I didn't connect with any of the characters, not even Jacob, who you think the book is supposed to be about.  You never get a chance to get inside his character or his mother because the story is written through the father's eyes.  There is no connect to their daily life. The story could have been developed so much better.  I guess I'm not sure what the author was trying to make the reader feel.
B0064SHI9I|5.0|Does a great job of keeping backups of your smartphone.  Extra goodies provided to manage applications if you are fortunate enough to have a rooted phone!

B008220AVW|5.0|Loved loved this movie!!! Went to her show last year, so I enjoyed watching clips of.it again. Very moving emotional scenes, that let's us see The real Katy, also humorous moments.This film is awesome for Katy fans!! Lots of fun moments, but also sad as I cried along with katy :( other than that brilliant!! And for those with negative comments or non katy fans..uhh why did you watch then??
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is awesome in need more games like this one please make another one eternity warriors got to come out with another
B0067TGSOK|5.0|As a long time fan of Chris Guillebeau I was simply blown away by this book.<br /><br />I was beyond impressed with the through research and motivating case studies the author generously provides his readers. From the British photographer that a launched a successful online photography course, to a former waitress turned public relations maven, to the unemployed sales executive that took a supply of mattresses, an empty storefront and combined with a little old fashioned ingenuity, created a unique delivery service based on bikes.<br /><br />To me these stories are the real juice of the book. Readers will not only find these profiles inspiring, but will leave them filled with hope and inspiration. Finally this review would be incomplete if I didn't point out the sound business advice the author offers his reader. For example, his detailed business launch strategy plan is one you'll definitely want to bookmark or dog ear. Great work Chris ~ bravo!<br /><br />The $100 Startup is the perfect blend of practical business building tools, advice and inspiration. In my opinion it reiterates Guillebeau's sincere commitment to provide his readers with an entrepreneurial lifestyle blueprint that everyday real life people can use to create lives that will not only feed us creatively, but hopefully sustains us financially.
B008ASLQZW|1.0|I tried to give it 0 stars, but the rating system wouldn't allow for it. The movie was a complete waste of time and money. The plot was all over the place and had many holes. Don't bother, you'll be disappointed & left wanting your brain-cells back.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I enjoyed the original version and this one is even better.  I liked the added spider to make it just a little more difficult but not so hard that I can't solve it.
0385344333|1.0|Where to start... I'm a cynic by nature, glass half-full sort of guy so let me say that this book was either written, badly, by a ghost-writer or Mr CHild was half asleep on his yacht or on a beach after a good lunch. I used to enjoy the internal dialogue that was portrayed by Child as Reacher's thoughts were expressed on the page, It's hard to get over a person's thoughts unless the book is written in the first person. But, here we are with things like, \\" bright red car. Fire-engine red, the eyewitness called it. Vivid red. Fairly new. A regular four-door sedan, the eyewitness thought. Or maybe a five-door. Or a three-door. But definitely not a two-door coupe. A Toyota, the eyewitness thought. Or maybe a Honda. Or a Hyundai. Maybe a Kia.\\" It really does not work for me as it appears so labored and contrived - we get the eyewitness (mentioned twice in a couple of lines) did not remember but this, to me, does not appear like Reacher's quick brain at work. There are more examples of such writing but this one is my favorite.<br /><br />So if you really want to be a \\"completer\\" read the book by all means but do yourself a favor and borrow it from a library - hopefully a friend would no tlend you this book or look in some trash cans maybe but save your money.<br /><br />Mr Child - if you can't think of anything better just give up on Reacher. If you are writing this yourself and are stuck for inspiration find a decent ghost-writer. If you needed to fulfill some contractual obligation with your publisher, again, you could have used a ghost-writer. If you did use a ghost-writer get a better one that understands your legacy
B006LSZECO|5.0|Exceptionally well written. This gripping story of a disappearing wife will have you gasping in surprise and leave you conflicted and happy and disappointed all at the same time. Unreal. Loved every page!
B000FC10IO|5.0|Garth Nix never writes the same story twice, even within a series. He is possibly the best writer out there in the world of YA and children's literature.  I love the unique characters and the way they surprise you.  The story is exciting and stomach-clenchingly engaging.  You wonder what will happen next, and you can't predict the next event.  You can't tell if a character is good or evil by his surname and physiogamy.  Characters struggle and waiver in their morality and resolve, just like real people.  If the formulaic and predictable \\"Percy Jackson\\" type of novel is getting old, try anything by this author. Abhorsen is a real novel with a real story, not just the same deck of cards shuffled and re-dealt. Nix is an intelligent writer that does not coddle his reader. It is challenging and meaningful and will both entertain and elevate the reader.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Would be a Five Star, but app always forces close on Kindle Fire. Please fix, I have crafts to make hee hee
B008MG1E4A|3.0|A nice description of the taking of Bin Ladin wrapped by an  unnecessary account of the training of Seal team 6 members - almost identical to that presented by Richard Marcinko. The book could have been written  in 50 pages or less without the seal training information. I'd liked to have seen much more  written on the the early life of the author.
B008XBHBX2|4.0|This movie is not like many other classics that seem to lose their flare after the years have passed. This one, while not a particularly scary movie, is suspenseful and filled with great characters who acted very well by this cast. JAWS is one of those movies that I see audiences enjoying for a few more decades because of the solid writing and the restraint to use special effect in the mid 70's. A great movie that if you haven't seen it, you will understand why it is so beloved. An original that is filled with extra bonuses throughout I believe this movie is good for the whole family, as long as your children aren't too easily scared.
0321701763|4.0|This book has really been helpful for me to learn the product.  It takes you step-by-step through a process and has print screens so you know exactly where to look to find the feature they are having you use.  Definitely worth my money.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Great game...exciting...makes you think quickly while adding the sums together!  just downloaded the game and I can already see that it can become addictive ...my math skills are already improving...LoL!!!
B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|While Seether keeps producing new albums that have great music in them, Disclaimer II remains one of my favorites. There is more energy in this earlier album than most of the newer albums. Definitely worth getting if you don't have it already!
0385732554|3.0|A mixture of divergent and matched this book is a futuristic alternate world where everything is monitored and controlled.<br />Jonas is chosen to become the next receiver of the memories amd feelings of the entire humanity and in his journey he decides to scape repression and find a different world. A better world. He takes baby who is destined to die with him and they make it.<br />It was alright I guess.
B004ZZS4CC|2.0|Please understand what Jaycee went through for 18 years was horrifying, from being taken , being raped and then having children is something I cannot even imagine. However with that being said, I found the book very boring at times and I say that because it lacked so many details of what happened during those years. I am so proud of this young woman and her girls. I pray for their continued recovery.
B002H1J2AO|5.0|It's been many years since I saw this movie.  I found out my girlfriend had never seen it so I got it for her to see and she loved it too.<br /><br />Great classic that everyone should enjoy.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have 3 kids (15...11...and 4) and they all fight to play this on my kindle fire...they would play it for hours if I let them...so far no game freezes and it works fine on my device...the kids love it and that makes me happy...so 5 stars from me...way to go and thanks for making it free too...awesome :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The entire trilogy was great. Beyond the sex is a great love story between an experienced complicated man who is brought out of darkness into light by a younger inexperienced young woman. He learned to deal with his demons differently. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others.
B0037EPYLG|5.0|What can you say? It's Clapton. Here is a collection of his greatest hits from Cream thou his solo stuff. If your looking for those songs that you loved on the radio then here they are. Just sit back and listen to that guitar cry.
B001S49AQW|2.0|This probably  isn't a fair review since i didn't finish the book. It just didn't resonate with me. I found the main characters a bit silly and light weight, the dialogue stilted, and the premise too far fetched even for fiction. Sorry, since I really wanted to like it.
B0072A3OGS|5.0|I love this album. Especially the beginning story, end story and Rose for Epona. Would recommend it to any Celt or Gaul.
B000G6R7B8|4.0|I was excited to purchase this wristwatch.<br />I liked the compact size and testimonials of the high build quality when I was shopping for a new watch.<br />My expectations were high and this watch surpassed my expectations in all but one aspect.<br />The build quality is top notch. It looks great on my wrist. It is not as accurate as would have hoped (seems to run fast - almost a minute every 24-48hrs) but that's not a big deal. I actually like having to set it every few days.<br />I am actually a fan of the wrist band, though I fear it will not last long. It show a bit of wear already at the clasp. That's also trivial as it will give me the opportunity to try out different straps in the future.<br /><br />My only gripe is the night luminescence. It looks great for about a minute (may be two) after it's exposed to darkness and then it disappears. I find it frustrating to have to fumble around in the dark to find a cell phone or a light switch to find out the time. Even cheaper watches seem to have that feature sorted, so I can't see the logic behind such poor performance, especially since the rest of the watch seems so well put together.<br /><br />Poor luminescence aside, this is an excellent wristwatch for a reasonable price.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was the first I have read by this author and was pleased with her writing style.  Also learned a lot about witches and even some about vampires.  Plan to read the next in the All Souls Trilogy.
0307386171|5.0|The author, the title (with the word beach in it, it had to be good!), and a discussion about it in The End of Your Life Book Club by Will Schwalbe prompted me to check out this short but powerful novel from the local library. Permeated with alternate themes of sadness and hope, On Chesil Beach was superbly written. Right up until the end of the book, the reader is hopeful that maybe, just maybe, Florence and Edward will work things out.<br /><br />Edward and Florence meet, fall in love, and marry. While their \\"challenges\\" have begun long before their wedding day, honeymoon events unleash feelings and words that can't be taken back. Although the tone of their story as told by McEwan foreshadows the book's end, the last paragraph is thought provoking, haunting, and heartbreaking. The sentence that captures it all is, \\"This is how the entire course of a life can be changed--by doing nothing.\\"<br /><br />McEwan's descriptions of people, places, events, and emotions are amazing. I particularly like the one of Florence's father with \\"small fleshy lips whose resting position was a determined pout, and a button nose, and eyes set far apart so that in certain lights he resembled a giant fetus.\\" Whether describing the contrast between the main characters' homes, parents, or childhoods, the author offers details so vivid that I could see the squalor of the Edward's family home, hear Florence's violin practice, feel Edward's concern about winning tennis matches with Geoffrey Ponter, taste yogurt with Edward for the first time (a glamorous substance he knew only from a James Bond novel), and both and see the horrible accident that affected Edward's mother forever.<br /><br />Life and love are complicated. Read this book to explore just how complex they can be.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Was just looking for a good book and took a chance on this since it was highly rated.  I don't always agree with the masses, but this is great.  I love how the story twists and turns.
B0068FZ1C8|5.0|This is a great but great movie that I like it since the first time. The music, the boy it take you to that moment of discover his vocation and fight for it. It is a great movie to se with your family and understand that everything is possible. THUMBS UP!!!!

I am so glad I only paid $1 to watch this movie.. don't get me wrong there were a few funny parts but this movie was overall just stupid and boring, and only got a couple chuckles out of me.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Enjoyable read. The story held my interest. I have always enjoyed reading King's stories and this one didn't disappoint. If I had one complaint it seemed a little rushed at the end. Judging by the amount of research I am sure Mr. King had to do to make this book fit history in addition to spinning a good yarn I am able to overlook that little bit of a rush.
B001OMJGD0|1.0|Was unable to watch movie kept buffering and stopping very frustrating! Movies are fine unless you watch them during the evening hours which defeats the purpose
B0041D843M|5.0|Up until a month ago, I would never have believed I could lose 20 pounds in one month - until I read the China Study! Other vegetarian diet books seemed too fanatic and \\"trendy\\", but Dr. Campbell's book with it's reasoned and straight forward advice did the trick. It is NOT a diet book, by the way, but a logical presentation of the almost total lack of requirement or necessity for meat in a healthy, balanced approach to food. Well worth the effort.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Have no issues on kindle fire. Used app in app store.Love this app. Great ideas for everything from decorating to just daydreaming.
0525952926|2.0|I will keep this brief.  I have read all of Ken Follett's previous works.  My favorites are Pillars Of The Earth,  World Without End, and Eye of the Needle.  These books were filled with facinating, compelling characters, with complex and interesting motivations behind their behavior.  They felt real, and leaped off the page.  This book reads like it was written by a high school student for a history assignment.  The dialogue is cliche and cheesy.  \\"Oh no!  What are we going to do?\\" \\"It will be the end of Germany as we know it!\\"  This is not Ken Follett at his best.  In fact, I find it hard to believe that the same author that wrote those previous books, wrote this.  I have not finished it yet, but find myself rolling my eyes as I am reading it thinking...really?  If this was written by anybody other than Ken Follett, with all his previous successes behind him-- I doubt that it would ever have even been published.  I will not read the third installment.  I find it tremendously difficult to believe all the 5 star reviews this book is getting, except to say that perhaps the publisher has many friends, and maybe these reviews were NOT written by people who actually paid for the book-- If you know what I mean.

B00514HDNW|1.0|This book really showed very little imagination. Having seen the movie I really expected more. \\"Hats off\\" to whoever<br />had the vision to adapt this to the screen. There were very few surprises and too many contradictions. Having been a long time fan of the genre I know that you can't over think, but even the basic suppositions of this book had gaping<br />holes in it. I personally need someone to root, for or at least identify with and from the beginning I didn't care<br />whether the main character lived or died. It was a complete waste of time but having invested in the book I completed the transaction but should not have thrown good time after bad money!

B008MG1E4A|1.0|This didn't go deep enough tone a book and wasn't crisp enough to be a Vanity Fair article. For serious readers, I recommend skipping it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a beautifully written story about man and his journey to walk miles to see an old friend. Heartwarming and<br />memorable...this story will stay with you.
B0098VXCR0|1.0|I've rented this from iTunes before but wanted to see the extended version so there is some grounds for comparison.  The biggest difference is the audio.  The iTunes version has great audio but the Amazon version nearly blew out my speakers.  On the Amazon version, the sound effects were at a normal range but the dialogue level was so low.  So low that at moments with dialogue and sound effects you either couldn't hear the dialogue or your sound is turned up too high for the sound effects.<br /><br />So for watching a fun, fresh take on a classic story I'd give it 4 stars (cant be helped.  It has Kristen Stewart in it).  For audio quality, I give it a 1.  In all fairness, it did have sound.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and this works great on my Kindle.  So happy I added it!!  I would definately recommend Pinterest lovers to add this one!
B008BIN9EW|1.0|I really like this game but now it says it isn't compatible with any of my devices. Definitely not buy from this author again after reading other peoples issues
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting and very well written.  I've always thought that \\"wars\\" should be managed by the military, who know first hand, what is really happening.  This books shows how Washington makes rules based on political expediency, not always for the good of our soldiers.  While I have mixed emotions about the author \\"breaking\\" his confidentiality agreement, he did not give out any secrets--more political hype??  I am glad I read it, and will probably read it again.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Watched this with my 15-year-old daughter recently and was surprised how well the film holds up by today's standards for action/adventure type films. Being in Technicolor certainly helps, but the sets,  costumes, action scenes and story were all well done and well acted. Errol Flynn is the \\"real\\" Robin Hood.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|Great album, filled with great songs, not much else to say about this greatest hits album.  I hate minimum word counts.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Have so enjoyed gathering great recipes, photos, helpful ideas, fun ideas for the grandkids, and all sorts of things that have made my day and reflect my style by following what others have gleaned and other things I have posted from the web. Love my boards. From Amazon.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was humorous, sad, and contained a really great message. A little mature, I wouldn't give it to a 12 year old or anything. But I would highly recommend it, no matter what your genre of choice is.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|I was quite surprised by how well this album turned out.  After the mellow \\"Over The Under\\", I was worried Down was getting soft.  \\"The Purple\\"  has what we want: that sludgy Sabbath/Skynyrd/C.O.C/Crowbar sound that melts our ears.  \\"Open Coffins\\", \\"Levitation\\", \\"WitchTripper\\" and \\"The Curse\\" are my personal favorites.  Can't wait for the next one.
B003G4W4CY|1.0|I have to give this edition one star. The story itself is magnificent, as you'll read in other reviews.<br /><br />However, the introduction, by Adam Roberts, utterly ruined it for me. It gave away the physical appearance of the Overlords (saying that we learn this 'fairly early' in the book. By my estimate we actually learn this about a third of the way through - NOT early at all, and all the suspense leading up to this revelation is ruined).<br /><br />The introduction also tells us pretty much exactly how the story ends! I mean what the hell! A book whose overarching theme is the question of what the Overlords are here for and what mystery awaits humanity, and the conclusion of the plot is spoiled before I even got a chance to start reading!<br /><br />Utterly unforgivable. I feel cheated.<br /><br />You only get to read a book for the first time once, and this one was ruined before I started. Thanks a lot, Adam Roberts.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you have nothing to do a lot this is a great game if you like playing soitare. plus you don't need wiring to play. the only bad part is they pop up adds like crazy
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy read, good read! No secrets revealed! Obama just doesn't like that the author talks about his leadership in a poor light. The actual raid information was attention grabbing for sure! I recommend this book.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Great book, have read almost all of Harry Bosch series and a couple of others great writer<br />Looking forward to the next book  and then the next one.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|The Pact contained a story line previlant in today's society.  Scary but true.  The story kept you interested trying to predict the outcome. It was very fast reading,  it was hard to put down. I've since read several of the author's books and found them to be of interest.
B007IQWQ88|5.0|Brilliant and absolute bargain less than $3 a disk. Great sound quality. My only regret is that this box set does not include all the Deutsche Grammophon recordings by Karajan.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is truly one of the most inspiring and  convicting biographies I have ever read. This has become an annual read for me, and I would encourage anyone interested in this book to not pass it by.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|If you like Mozart Concerti, and it may be hard not to like them, this is a set for you. Marvellous!!!  Fantastic interpretation, excellent sound and recording. Do not be swayed by those reviews that complain about the quality of the recording (possibly a problem with equipment). I absolutely adore this set. Week without Mozart's concerto is a week lost (arguably).
B008MG1E4A|5.0|i read NO EASY DAY in two days...the writting keeps you tied to the book...and it told the TRUTH something we did not and do not get from washington..kodos to this brave navy seal for telling us the truth is such a spellbinding manor..EXCELLENT BOOK
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This is an absolutely Great book, as are all books by Michael Connelly. You can't go wrong with any of his books!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Stayed up til one in the morning to finish! it was torture but a very  intense and good read! loved it
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is an engrossing and informative book about the on-set of early Alzheimer's Disease.  My heart went out to Alice, a Harvard professor, who first thinks her symptoms are pre-menopausal and soon discovers that she has Alzheimers. Her children, husband, colleagues and friends each have a different reaction to Alice and the author commands the reader to ask, \\"How would I respond to someone with this disease?\\"  The tragedy of Alzheimer's is that the patient loses his life and his relationships long before physical death.  While the topic could have been depressing, the author has skillfully avoided the maudlin and has presented the reader with useful and varied methods of coping with this dreadful disease.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was very pleased with the fifty shades trilogy.It kept my interest and I never got bored.Every book flowed well into one another. The author did a great job!
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time.  It is written for the every day person and not really a boring textbook. It's case is that people should eat a fruit and vegetable more than meat and any of it's by products.  The book backs this up with studies done on a wide range of people from all over the world where diets vary.  It does NOT go into the raising of the animals but does go into the benefits of vegan living showing how our body reacts to the food we eat.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  It has changed my eating life style!
B003XNTTYY|3.0|This book is slow paced compared to the 1st book, but well worth sticking with. It seems to be setting the ground work for the 3rd book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am addicted. This is singly the most addicting game I have added to my phone. The problem is, it never ends. I bought everything there is to buy and it still never ends. Help.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Even though the imagery is nothing like today's movies, this movie will still put a fright in you.  Just a great all time classic movie!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've enjoyed all three of these books. I can't say the writing is great yet I couldn't put it down. When I finished I was disappointed there wasn't another book. I like that this book has gotten so many women to take time for themselves and read. It attracts all age groups from my 85 yr old MIL to my twenty something daughters. EL James has a very vivid imagination, and I like it! Hope she writes much more!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|If you love exposition then you'll love this book. The pace of the novel is, at best, lethargic and the characters fail to compel. It is decent enough to be considered a potato chip for the mind, but I don't feel it is very award worthy.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Excellent story. Delves into some grim physiological problems and weird teenage behavior. Book was interesting, exciting, & has a unexpected ending.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|good series that young and old would like.  I didn't think I would like it as young killing young was not appealing, but enjoyed all the books.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes is the first book in the Rose Gardner Mystery series.<br /><br />Rose becomes a prime suspect in a murder case, when her mother turns up dead on her couch. It's up to Rose to find the murderer, before she becomes the next victim.<br /><br />I liked this story. The relationship between Rose and her mother felt real. Every mother and daughter is slightly complicated, and I liked that they didn't have the perfect relationship.<br /><br />The murder mystery was good, and I couldn't guess who the murderer was. Denise Grover Swank definitely kept me guessing!<br /><br />Moments between Rose and new neighbour, Joe, had my toes curling, and I will definitely be reading more books in this series to see how the relationship develops.<br /><br />Definitely a nice, sweet cozy and I hope to read more books by this author soon.
B008D28HYS|5.0|These games are great, but addictive.  Requires you to think.  Can you do the next level?  I want more games like this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good fun and easy to play. KISS kept it so simple. Simple is better in this clasic game of stratigy & luck.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This trilogy had a good storyline but there was more sex than story.  I spent more time flipping through the pages,to try and follow the storyline.  If you enjoy having someone slapping you, tying you up and inflicting pain and call it sex then this is the perfect book for you.......found it to be too much porn, it makes you wonder what all the men and women are doing why they say their love life has gotten better.
0345803507|5.0|50 Shades of Grey was the best series I have read in a long time.  Easy read - matter of fact I will be reading it again.  You must read all 3 books.  Did it have expert technical writing? Maybe not but it was a fun fantasy ride, sort to speak.  I fell in love with Christian and Anastasia and when you remove all the sex and the bdsm stuff it's really a love story.  I didn't want or expect to read a serious book but wanted something that was an escape and that it is.  All my girlfriends are as taken with it as I am and we are all looking forward to another in the series and the movie!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Sleep be damned, I couldn't put this book down!  I loved the mash-up between 'past and present' and 'he said she said'.  Very fun, albeit disturbing!
B0091P6392|5.0|A compelling must watch series. Don't let this show pass you by. Love the theme song of the show Greenback Boogie\\" by Ima Robot.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a long time sci-fi reader and I love the innovative thinking in the wool series. Plot twists a plenty with such creative mastery of an unknown world. Loved it!<br /><br />It has been a long time since I found a book that I struggled to put down but this book did it. It has been years since I have forgone sleep to read just \\"a few more pages\\" but Hugh did it.<br /><br />Thank you. Money well spent.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is a very addicting game! Its some time very frustrating at some times, but its still a super fun game! LOVE IT! 5 STARS.
B000L53D4O|1.0|Ok! so we all love fisher price and I was excited to get a walker for my son - I bought it for him when he was 10 months old and we have had it for one month now.  It looks great in the picture BUT its EXTREMELY light weight... DO NOT BUY THIS!!! its not meant to work as a walker... when the kid tries to stand up the toys falls over, the kid falls over, and he or she gets hurt.  again - its very light weight and cheap... you are better off getting something heavy and durable... my son tries to stand up with this toy to practice and he falls over... the toy cant hold the childs weight... and my son is not over weight or fat... just a normal 11 month old baby!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Read this book! They barely got out. Book details unreported close shaves at exit and shows the importance of Special-Ops working without political meddling. Super Seals!
B0055PMURG|4.0|Strong message for all ages. Keeps the spirit of drive alive. Nice to see families work together. Worth the rental and time.
B007N8RULO|4.0|A great game for when you have time to waste.  Smooth and so far no glitches.  Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B00881VLCE|1.0|great game....but today i noticed all the puzzle packs i paid for are gone! where are my puzzles?? not happy!
B003WJ9DYA|5.0|Best movie ever! Loved it as a kid and still live it as an adult. Watched with my teenage daughter who loves it as much as ido.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|I rented this on movie night with the family.  It was the first Hitchcock movie that they have seen.  I was concerned that the lack of modern wizbang graphics and action would have them bored and want to watch something else....Quite the contrary!!  My kids (16, 14, 11 boys) loved the movie!  Rear Window has always been a favorite of mine, now its one that my kids are fond of too.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|An absolute life changing book. I would recommend to everyone. It is a very inspirational and life changing read.  Buy and enjoy!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Interestung and intense but sort of graphic, I read this because I really enjoyed Gone Girl.  I liked it as a quick read, although at times it was curiously unsatisfying and the topic was unpleasant.  I'm glad I read it- I think her writing is very easy to read and the emotions are complex.  Would recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been following pinterest for about one year and I find it to have everything to fit most personallities.
B000LJAEFG|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie as it was not as goofy as I thought it might be.  It actually shows the progression of electronics and sparks what can be in the future.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|All the songs are so catchy! The sound of this album is amazing.  I actually sound then through the song radioactive by hearing it on a commercial and I thought, \\" I must know who this is\\"
B008MG1E4A|5.0|very informational depiction of the rigors of combat navy seals duties.  it shows the long hours of training<br />and practice needed to successively carry out their mission....<br />It also shows that despite all the training many things can go wrong.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this the first day it was available because I enjoy tales of real-life heroism. Despite all the hoopla and outrage, this was just a good, solid account of specops. There was nothing new disclosed here that wasn't also disclosed in the several other specops first-hand account books I've read. No state secrets disclosed. No jeopardy to currently serving troops. Not even any dissing of the current administration.<br /><br />So, to all the naysayers, I ask: have you even read this book? Or is all the furor just the flavor of the week for those who must always be outraged at something to be happy?<br /><br />Hmmm.<br /><br />I do recommend this book. The co-authors did fine. You'll be glad you bought.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I must say book two of the series is not quite as good as the 1st, and not as lenghty,  but still left me needing to read the third book.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|good app!!:) well it works great with my kindle fire and I'm glad it works because I use to use the youtube downloader but when I updated it would say error. so this tubemste is a life saver :)
B008ODZEQ0|1.0|This movie was a poor movie --- about a guy who may be a great cook and a crummy Dad --- why watch it?  Makes him into some sort of hero.  Just because it is foreign does not make it sophisticated.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|omg I can't believe this app is free!!! it tells the percentage of battery,  the degrees, how much you can hear music, and look at videos. great app :)
B008BIN9EW|2.0|I guess this is better than snake on my old Nokia, but really not very fun.  Would rather spend my time looking for something else to download than play this again.
B0091574VI|5.0|Very warm and touching look into the lives of chimps. It was a perfect movie for our family, we completely enjoyed it.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Good for short bursts of play such as public transit or before the movie starts at a theater, but not enough to drag you into extended sessions.
B008IG5BHK|4.0|Not as good or as compelling as the first (can i say a disney film is compelling?!)- but very enjoyable. My 6 year old loves watching this again and again. She loves the songs and seeing Pocahontas all dressed up in ball gown and dancing with her 'prince' :-)
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Excelent.is very satisfactorily. I really recommend. This product. You will feel the fun.recreative. I am recommended. This product to many people and they tried and never regretted. They told me is a good game.
B003UBTX72|3.0|I know, it's Keef, so heroin is going to play a part.  I just didn't think it would be that much.  I wish there was more about the creative process.  More on how the songs were written and recorded.  More about interactions between Keith and all the other band members.  Stories specific to each member.<br />I don't know if it was the drugs or just lack of interest on Keith's part, but he really seemed to gloss over the middle of his career.<br />It also tended to be a little repetitive at times.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the first 2 books, they left me wanting to read more, but the third book I had problems with the ending.  From the part where the hoover craft came in and killed the children on didn't quite make sense, and then to just have her end with two children didn't leave me excited for more.
B0018LMZOE|5.0|Back in the '70s, I had all of the \\"original 7\\" Moody Blues albums on vinyl.  Lately, my wife started bugging me about why I don't have them on CD, so I figured I'd buy one or two at a time.  \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" is one of my favorites.  Nothing bad on this one, but I do have some favorites, which are:  The Story In Your Eyes; One More Time to Live; Nice To Be Here; You Can Never Go Home; and My Song.  Four of those songs are captivatingly beautiful.  The other one, \\"Nice To Be Here\\", is a guilty pleasure of mine.  It's a whimsical fantasy trip, but very well done.  And as a bass player, I love John Lodge's bass work in that one.  The more I think about it, I think this one is my favorite of all the Moody Blues albums.  If you're just dipping your toe into their work, this would be a good one to check out.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I've been strategy games for, dear me, over 40 years and as these games have transitioned to the computer and now mobile devices, many have failed, through a lack of imagination or talent, to capture the balance required for a truly great game.<br /><br />UniWar is a great game.<br /><br />The Campaign mode is good for learning, the solo mode is good for testing, the map editor is nice for expanding, and the ability to play multiple games online against of people takes this game to instant classic level.<br /><br />At $10, this game would be a bargain.  Since it's only $5, it's a bargain and a nice cup of coffee and a snack, and really, what more could you want?
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It always amazes me what technology is capable of. You can mix multiple sounds together and adjust the individual volume levels. The timer is a great feature.
B006HTUZ1C|2.0|didn't care for this app because of the poor control.  the numbers did not move quickly enough when you try to swap them around which makes the cubes build up faster and the games over.  fix that and it would be fun.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I really like CrossMe Color. I had never seen this type of puzzle before, and downloaded it as FAOTD. I couldn't be happier!  It is entertaining and brain-teasing. It is a great twist on the crossword puzzle. Really gets the brain going. Highly recommended for those who like challenging, entertaining puzzles!
B003O86FMW|3.0|As Book Two of a Trilogy, it picks up smoothly from Book One.  Catching Fire is an easy read with interesting twists and turns...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app! It works great and I never have any problems with it. Yes there is some pop ups but they are super easy to close down so its no big deal. This app is tons of fun, i play it a lot throughout the day!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I have been anxious to see what the band would release for their first foll length album, and I wasn't disappointed.  This is a great blend of indie rock and pop.  I am happy to have it a part of my collection.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed has penned a fantastic travel log of the PCT.  Worth reading for anyone, both males and females.  Obviously it has been discussed by book clubs because of the notes at the end.  Feel good book.
B008CP93S0|5.0|This movie was a 5 star sleeper! We can't get enough of it. We keep watching it over and over again because there are so many funny lines! Fantastic movie!!!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Many chapters were slow reading and uninteresting. Too many abbreviations clouded the flow of the story.  I appreciate the effort and applaud the author for donating proceeds to worthy causes.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Despite having a few problems with James Dashner's novel, The Maze Runner, I enjoyed reading it. More importantly, I highly recommend it as a great read for middle grade or high school boys who are reluctant readers. The Maze runner is fast, it's fun, and while girls will love it, it's definitely a \\"boy's\\" book. As most parents would agree, if Dashner can get a middle grade boy, who doesn't like to read, interested in reading--that's worth a 5 star rating!
B008I34Z3Y|3.0|First, I love DCD and couldn't wait for a follow up to Spirit Catcher. I saw the reunion tour 6 years ago, and it seemed like the energy was back. Unfortunately, the energy is not on this album.<br />The whole album drags without any strong melodies or stand out tracks. I like DCD's slower atmospheric albums. Serpent's Egg is beautiful, but this album compare. The durginess isn't moving, or cinimatic, it's just kinda dull and repetitive.<br />I'll keep listening. There may be something I'm missing, but after 3 or so listens I'm pretty disappointed. I'd rather listen to old Dead Can Dance albums.<br />I will say that the vinyl is beautiful looking: Clear vinyl with great packaging and design. It also sounds good, it just doesn't go anywhere.
B003O86FMW|5.0|👍 can't wait to see the movie. I couldn't stop reading.. I sure miss reading about katniss and peeta 😔
0307749584|3.0|I was hoping for a blockbuster story and was a little disappointed in this one.  It wasn't until well past the halfway mark that it became interesting, but still I could only give it 3 stars.
B008I3R2VG|2.0|I use to be able to call The Killers my favorite band ever since I heard their first album and was instantly hooked. The driving guitar riffs and constant drum rolls paired with the deep and gritty lyrics pulled me through the album. When Sam's Town was released, I remember rushing to best buy to pick it up the day of release and again I was blown away. How the whole album, and every song, was connected to one another was something so new to me. I felt like I was on an adventure rather then listening to a collection of singles. This trend continued every album, until my fascination reached a dead halt with Battleborn.<br /><br />I instantly ordered the Deluxe Edition assuming I would be getting another Killers album, and instead I got Battleborn. The entire album is incredibly slow paced and the lyrics have no direction. Every song is a repeat of the last, and the only thing Killers about this album is the vocals, which may sound reminiscent of old times, but instead are just as slow as the instrumentals.<br /><br />After I finished listening to the album I was in shock. I wanted to believe in the band I love so much, but Battleborn just doesn't redeem itself.<br /><br />This isn't the Killers you use to know, but I feel the album could have stood on its own merits if it wasn't advertised as being part of the Killers Discography.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have this app on my mac and was happy that it was available on my kindle. Now I can bring it with me wherever I go. I am totally addicted and play it every chance I get. The graphics are soooo cute and sometimes I just watch the fish swimming in my specially designed aquarium. Hope the other Fishdom versions (Seasons and Fishdom 2) will soon be available on the Kindle as well. Great game!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Waiting for the next episodes of Downton Abby is difficult.  This is another series that transports you to another time.  This series starts off being totally believable and makes it hard to shut down your Kindle.  It lingers and makes you anxious to get back to watching. The set design, costumes and the casting are perfection.  The breathtaking scenery and the gorgeous home where it was filmed all add up to a great watching experience. The acting is just plain fantastic.  I am delighted that I bought all of it and I am looking forward to more.
8866131377|4.0|Cheap, durable, enough space for me to write my daily to do lists and schedules with a fine point fountain pen. I like the space on the right side for more notes as well.<br /><br />I use a leather franklin christoph leather cover for mine, which also enhances the durability, and it is a well made product. Other organizers have chipped or fall apart by year end. This thing did not. Still looks pretty good and new even though the 2011-2012 version I carried with me everywhere for the whole year. It gets tossed around and banged around, but still looks fine and didn't fall apart.<br /><br />Good organizer and cheaper than others that are less durable.
0060254920|5.0|My favorite children's book. My son grew up with this and loved it, although I never read it until I was an adult. It just so perfectly captures the imagination of a child, and of this overgrown child as well.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  I am not sure if all those that took park in the games knew each other before hand.  Human nature comes out showing that only the stongest and smartest will survive.  I also saw how love can prevail in the end.
B003XZ0WPM|4.0|Special effects and graphics were great. Storyline was nothing new but it never gets old. Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Everyone knows the story of this book as it's been portrayed through various different movies, but nothing can compare to this fine, literary work.  Every part of this short tale draws you in, and although the wording is certainly from a different era, it is easily understood.  My only problem was that I kept envisioning Bill Murray as Scrooge, lol.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Enough has been written about this book, but I will make a few observations.  Starts mysteriously, disappearance of wife, husband a suspect who is having an affair.  I enjoyed the book, but I didn't rush home from work each night to finish reading it.  It was hard to really care about any of the characters.  But it has enough interesting twists and turns that I wanted to finish it and find out what happened.  Unusal ending.  If I had it to do over again, I would have taken this book on my beach vacation, and finished it in a day or two.  Not anything to think about after you were done, but a good summer read.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Once again Malcolm Gladwell has broken through popular perceptions with that rarest of analytic tools, common sense. He demonstrates the ability to carry the reader along with him on his journey of discovery. He shows that the 'how' behind our popular ideas of what makes someone successful, while appealing, are mostly erroneous. However, his common sense approach also shows what is possible for almost any of us to achieve.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I should have known better after having read the first two.  Amateur writing with outdated expressions i.e., \\"holy cow\\". Basically you wonder how anyone could endure all this relationship went through.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Having read her other books first, Lovely Bones and Almost Moon, I decided to back up and read the first book written. I didn't expect a true life story or to be inspired as I was. I love Siebold's work even more so (if that's possible) knowing what she had to go through to achieve it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These 3 books were awesome! Very rarely can I stay involved in a series of books. They usually get boring and drawn out, but not fifty shades! I'm sad there aren't more books! I loved every min of reading them! I actually started reading them again! Love them! Can't express enough!
0345803485|5.0|I will first begin by saying that I have NEVER written a book review before. But after reading many negative reviews I figured what the heck. It's amazing to me that people will frown upon the lifestyles that others have chosen. It's also amazing to me that people can be so closed minded. In the real world romance and excitement in a relationship is hard to keep up. Reading this book and the sequence books, I must say fueled my want to have a similar type of relationship with my husband.<br /><br /> Most of the reviews I have read compare the series to Twilight or gave it the reputation of promoting abuse of women. Really....are you guys serious!!! I just don't see it. Twilight is as much fiction as it gets with the old scheme of vampires and werewolves. Really!! How can some compare this series with Twilight is beyond me. With Fifty shades this can become a reality to a couple maybe minus the wealth.  In the reviews I have read so much about ABUSE of women. This is so farfetched. There are many ways that people find to put excitement in their sex lives. I don't believe that this series promoted abuse. I believe that this series promoted having an open mind when trying to spruce up your sex life. Behind closed doors anything is possible and everything goes!<br /><br /> I found the books to be full of romance, exotic love making, excitement, and most of all I feel that the book taught a lesson in its own way. In today's time no one comes without baggage. But when in love you can overcome all of that. I have cried and laughed while reading these books.<br /><br /> So...you have the beautiful, wealthy, and very kinky Christian Grey who has unintentionally fallen for the never really been touched by a man Anastasia Steele.  They have sex in ways that some of us have never thought of or are embarrassed and not willing to admit that you have thought of. She has to help him through many things, that years of therapy have been unsuccessful in helping him with. Her loves help him copes with his fear of being touched and his feeling of unworthiness to be loved that all stemmed from a very abusive first four years of his life. She is a very strong minded and open woman who has an alter ego to die for! In the end she wins, she gets her \\"more\\" along with the very exciting and pulsating sex that occurs every time they are around each other. This story has many exiting loops and turns in it that kept me paralyzed many nights unable to put the book down. So paralyzed that my husband was actually interested in what I was reading.<br /><br /> I was very thrilled with the BDSM. I find it strange that most women will lie and say that they have never thought about this! Well... I have! I have read the entire series twice within 3 weeks. The first time around I read all three books within three days. I am now reading them a third time but with my husband who finds them quite interesting and suggestive.  I believe that this series was an excellent read. I understand that some may not be interested in this type of read but please don't frown upon us that do! Different strokes for different folks....and for those of us who have that want to set fire to our sex life and spice it up...Thanks E. L. James!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This app is a puzzle game similar to Picross but it incorporates color into the images. The addition of color requires you to modify your strategy, but it is easily doable and the images are much nicer as a result. I recommend this app - it's free, and it will provide you with hours of entertainment and pretty images!
B001EBWIUO|5.0|this movie on blu-ray is fantastic, maybe the best looking black and white movie I've ever seen.  the original 1.37:1 aspect ratio is presented here, as is usually done with blu-ray versions of movies from the pre- cinemascope era.
B008EQIA7W|4.0|This movie is great for the adventure and special effects. If you are looking for a movie with a story probably not for you.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|For anyone who has ever played with Toys and ever wondered if they were alive.  Toy Story 2 continues to keep the imagination alive with even more funny references to various movies recreated in toy form. However, watching Toy Story and Toy Story 2 back to back makes it very difficult to watch the ending of Toy Story 3. I'd still recommend it, but bring the tissues.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love \\"Angry Birds\\"!I feel ike a kid again playing with it EVERY DAY! There are so many versions and I love the holidays and the weekly contests. It's clear as can be and I have not had a problem with the game at any time. It's a huge stress reliever and challange.
B007IXGUG0|5.0|If people can sit up here and give Kanye's G.O.O.D Music album 5 stars then Drake's album has to be 7 stars!! Sometimes we have to be honest with ourselves and not let our hearts make decisions about music because of whom we like and make honest reviews!! I am the biggest Lil Wayne fan but lately his music in my opinion has not been great and I really believe Tyga's album and Drake's album were better than the Carter4!! Drake is an excellent artist and can sing and his flow is sick.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a pretty amazing book about the people who fight the shadow wars we don't often see.  Although bumping off OBL is the culmination of the story, it's really a study of the mind set and dedication of these incredibly brave and focused men.  These are our gunslingers, our Paladins, ready to sacrifice themselves for their adrenaline rush and the welfare of our county.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This honestly is the most addictive game I have on my phone and kindle fire. I find myself exhausted at having finally finished one puzzle only to surprise myself by immediately starting the next.
B008D28HYS|4.0|Just started playing but I am already hooked. Like the fact that it makes you think about your moves but in a good way. Wish I could play on my ipad.
B008GANNIC|5.0|Murdered Love is a must for hardcore fans!!!  POD is an awesome band to support!!!  Show them your love,  Purchase Murdered Love already!!!! Do it!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a make-believe future, but doesn't seem so far-fetched. Hopefully it will show kids how to be individuals in a society that does not serve them.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|It's really an excellent book. Well written, based on facts from thorough research, very inspiring. I'm a co-owner of a start-up company and I can say that this book changed my view on how to organize the firm, how to choose people and consider business opportunities
B005RUV714|5.0|I have of phobia about zombies and yet I can't stop watching this show I love it Just love it
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest its really fun and a way to keep me occupied when I have nothing else to do.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|I love a good sports story/movie, though I do not watch nor participate in any sports except for big events like the Olympics, super bowl et. I am not a baseball person, didn't see the movie, but got very confused.  I had heard that you didn't need to know anything about baseball to find this to be a good book, but I think it might be helpful. I got the basic premise, I think, but it was full of stuff that I just didn't care about.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft for kindle fire is the best I have been waiting for a couple months I have Pc version and it is the best
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|after a few days playing on my kindle it caused some major damage had to factory reset the thing and lost all my apps and forced me to move to my other account on amazon
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I want to love this game but the flaws cause me to hate it. don't waste your money on buying it.
B00633W614|5.0|This series is a most compelling read.  I enjoyed it immensely.  Characters were real and exciting to follow.  I look forward to more of the same from the author.
0345803485|5.0|Awesome Book!! A Love Story with A flare!!!!!!! E.L James Out did Her Self A Must Read for Woman!! A guilty Pleasure Of Mine!! :)
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was entertaining. It had me hooked from the beginning. But it wasn't,t life changing or anything. I wouldn't,t recommend if your looking for a great book. I,ve already forgotten the characters.
B003KGBIS4|5.0|Truly an excellent film - funny, poignant, irreverent, beautiful. Is is especially meaningful to those who have traveled extensively in India, as I have. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has interest in other cultures.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|The client has it all. I can chat with friends and play many games that I get through Steam at pretty good prices as well as play games that I already have or that aren't available on Steam. That's the part that I like the best because I can play games such as League of Legends and still be able to chat with friends through the Steam client.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is good but way too much hype about it. No need to read the other two unless you want to read about sex over and over and over again. The story line is not bad-wish they would have just made it one book and cut out all the same sex stuff.
B00755MHXG|4.0|So well written, heart warming and thought provoking.  I loved it.  I was a bit worried about how it would end but without giving anything away I would recommend it to everyone.
B00633W614|5.0|This is well written and end leaves you on tenterhooks. Can't wait for next. Installment! Sins of the father purchased from Amazon.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|this film will always be a classic in my home. sure it's not the best film ever, but worth watching every once and a while.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Ace!  Even the remixes!  The inserts are amazing.  Including pictures, liner notes, and artwork.  Fascinating beyond belief.  I have really waited years for special projects like this to happen...and now they are.  Congratulations to the Estate...and good luck doing so well with future projects!  Ha!  Ha!  No pressure of course, right?  Lol.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. especially if you like strategic turn based games. the online play is acctually pretty smooth. it's just too bad that there aren't that many people playing it online. there was only one person when i played.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|What a great series!  I borrowed the first book from a friend and took it on holidays.  I loved it so much that I had to have the other three, and downloaded the four-book series from the Kindle store.  I have just started to read the fourth book, and I have a hard time putting it down.  I think I have a new favourite author ...<br /><br />I also downloaded the fifth book in the series - I'll let you know what I thought of it when I finish reading that one.
B003Z0BWRM|2.0|Entertaining enough but not a book for me. I didn't find the plot very interesting and none of the characters grabbed me at all. The relationship<br />Of two of the characters at the end was just weird.<br />I'll pass on the rest of the series I think.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked book 2 better than book one and it made me purchase book three. There was more substance and less erotica. The relationship was developed more.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This series is completely addictive and you will not be able to put them down.  Well developed characters who go on an extrodinary journey. After reading the hunger games I was dieing to know what happens to katniss and peta and this book didn't disappoint me. Their relationship grows even further. Excellent book.
B008KRJWEK|2.0|boring gameplay after a couple runs and the upgrades are over priced not worth the time ornmemory used to download
B005EGXTEE|5.0|One of the best books I've read in ages. Definitely the best out of the three. I feel in love with the main characters, the world was fascinating and full of danger and the story was nonstop action and drama. Loved it!
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game with cute graphics.  Game play is fairly intuitive and easy.  The puzzles are fun and challenging.  I enjoyed playing it for half an hour right after I installed it.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|This book was not as good as the first two but I still couldn't put it down. It felt epic but in a good way. Some moments at the end were not what I was hoping for and I didn't think worked too well but overall I really enjoyed it.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|One of the best she has written.  One you start to read it, it is hard to put it down
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This is a really good puzzle game.  Fun for adults and kids alike.  Highly recommend, it's a good time waster when time needs to be wasted.
B001KWR3PM|5.0|Although I have any number of Clapton albums and greatest hits, this one is a bit different again.  It contains more recent cuts.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This is a classic Tempe Brennan novel. If you liked the others, you will like this one too. I read it in one sitting
B008BIN9EW|5.0|My favorite game. Very similar to Military Madness from my old TurboGraphics 16 days. I just updated to a Samsung Galaxy S III and it won't download. Waiting for an update.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love love love pinterest!! My compliant would be that I have been running across some very inappropriate content. I have gotten many ideas off of here and enjoy searching thru to find more. But really don't appreciate having to view porn in the process! Otherwise I love it
B007UR1OHO|2.0|My best friend loves \\"The Notebook\\" and kept commenting that she wanted to see \\"The Vow.\\" So for her birthday I downloaded it for her, and we watched it together.  I had heard the true story a few years ago, so I thought it would be interesting, but we were both terribly bored with this movie. I like both of Adams and Tatum, but overall this movie seemed like it was made for Lifetime Television.  I feel sorry for anyone who paid to see this in the theater.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Insightful. Everyone who wants to feel as though they were with the seals on this historical day will experience the inside view.  I didn't feel as though any secrets were revealed. I have read Seal Team six and this was along the same lines
B002W1UEW4|4.0|If you ever enjoyed GI Joe, this is a really fun action movie that brings the toys to life in a well orchestrated way.
B007SGM084|3.0|I read the three books at once and found it a very entertaining story, but without extrapolating the point so that I consider it wonderful. It is an interesting sensual reading, but the protagonist has a major weakness regarding sex that makes her unable to impose her grievances before a sexy man for long, always accepting his behavior, even when it exceeds the limits. That is, is the story of how a woman behaves in the face of psychological disorders the man she loves so she can be with him.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I hope they release part 2 soon. I love the point /click and hidden object adventure games, but I've purchased and played all the ones available for the kindle fire. Please Big Fish Games come out with more adventure games!! As for this game, I loved it. In fact, I found it hard to put my kindle down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fantastic game...keeps my mind focused and alert. Enjoyable on both my Kindle and my Android phone.  I highly recommend this one!
0071762345|5.0|I recently assumed a new marketing role for a family owned collision repair center and found Dave Kerpen's book to be a valuable resource that I could use when establishing a social media presence for my company (check us at [...]).

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read for anyone either in the military or interested in the military. It's very refreshing to get a view of the events from the perspective of boots on ground.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. I have been addicted to Pinterest for some time now and I am very excited that I can now use it on my Kindle Fire. I recommend this app to all pinners. It's a must!
B008XG1X18|2.0|It does a lot of hanging &amp; force closes but when it works it's good. Which is about 60% of the time.  So I put up with it. A fix for the Fire is definitely needed.
B004SBX112|5.0|One of the very few games I can actually play and win at!  I love this product.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great and easy to read biography.  First book I've finished in a long time. Kept my attention so much that I just couldn't put it down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the \\"Hunger Games\\" I was curious how the life of all the characters continued. The writing is quite vivid with a lot of action and romantic tension. When it comes to science fiction I willingly suspend disbelief about technological possibilities, since scifi usually is prophetic. Having the winners of previous hunger games battle it out was fun, yet getting to that point felt strained; but it is fun to read about all the strange things in the game arena. While I usually enjoy more adult level of reading, it is nice to regress to middle school level that Scholastic Press is known for. Although the reader is treated all sorts of violent deaths vividly described, sex is off limits as reading material with a kiss and a cuddle as the possible surrogates. Either that or this future culture is impossibly prudish. For those looking for an entertaining PG13 scifi read, I highly recommend this novel.
B007Z9Q97M|3.0|It was a good episode. I loved how over cautious they have Bones being with Christine. Can't wait for the next season.
B00785P2QC|4.0|love this game play every day. hard to get cash. good good good good to to to to to to
B00933JL0A|3.0|By all means, Townsmen is not a bad game. It's a great way to kill some time. It's also a great way to teach a person responsibility, management and sympathy. It also brings out some latent creative abilities for some. Townsmen displays some of the proper roles for men and women, which is highly valued, while avoiding any adherence to the many stereotypes that exist. As mentioned before, it's a good game but not a great game.<br /><br />For one, there aren't any real instructions to the game. Outside of the tutorial and the hints given between each loading screen, all of your knowledge is based on trial and error and \\"getting a feel\\" for what's going on. This is upsetting, especially for those who want to know exactly how to play and go on to mastering the game. There aren't any specific input/output ratios on the production buildings. You're left to \\"get a feel\\" for what these values are. Because of this, you will often feel yourself getting frustrated having constantly received messages about how this building is low on this product and how this one needs more of that. It's upsetting, tedious and tiresome. The carpenter building is a let down as it doesn't repair buildings nearly as fast as I initially thought. I thought that constructing one would mean that as long as I had the money, I wouldn't need to constantly manually repair deteriorating buildings but this is not the case. From my experience, the townies ( as they're called ) run out of food, way too quickly but seem to retain water like their lives depend solely on that. It's a mess.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing a bigger variety of buildings in this game, much like the amount found in games like Virtual City 2, among other games. I look forward to having the ability to change the direction a building is facing. Though it's not a major concern, it's addition to the game would be much appreciated. Instructions would be nice and more information for the many processes and buildings would help a lot.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Fast ship! Great! Good seller thanks very much . Great work! You can buy with certainty from this seller so rest assured!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app all the time, lists,notes, anything.  It is easy and backs up to my google account.  Even when my phone was lost, I had my info ready for my next phone.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is obvious that this book was not written by a professional writer however, the story is great.  It is encouraging to know that this country is still capable of producing warriors.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing coin dozer.  its very entertaining and fun, a great way to spend extra time. its free which is great as well
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! I could look at it all day long! I have made several of the recipes! I have also made some of the crafts!!! Love it, love it!!!!
B00846REIS|3.0|sometimes a little too close to fifty shades of grey none the less further into reading it was a little different and still held its own in terms of enjoyable reading
B007UPNA6Y|1.0|Have read Reacher for years. They have been getting progressively less engaging. It was basically an Extended car chase, and became predictable and tedious. Started skipping sections looking for the interesting bits. In sum, felt like a formula book - selling on the reputation not the quality of the story or writing. Lee Childs is capable of better- Reacher deserves better!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a fantastic app! The only problem that I have experienced is that I am addicted to it! Very enjoyable on my Fire. Super easy to navigate the app and the links.
B0088WGBC8|4.0|Overall good movie. Plot is predictable but there's lots of action. Different kind of role for Ryan. He's a better comedy actor in my opinion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This book is awesome. It is a convenient and delightful way to learn God's word. The plans in this book are designed to draw you nearer to God and this makes it a magnificent tool for learning God's word. I recommend it to every potential and every active  christian out there.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This latest excerpt in A Song of Ice and Fire brings welcome development to many of the characters introduced in the previous books. Too much repetition and slow plot development in the fourth book with Lannister infighting had almost made me abandon the series. I much preferred the scope of sub-plots and variety of locations in this fifth book. Hope the next offering is ready soon!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I was never a fan of the Adventures of Rin Tin Tin growing up, but was told that this movie was really good.  \\"Really good\\" was an understatement!  I absolutely loved this movie, would watch it again, and am very much looking forward to a sequel!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it but when will y'all add coin dozer. world tour and the others its a good game I love the coins and the prizes
B008BIZ06M|3.0|They have a couple good songs on here. but all and all I paid 5.00 bucks for it so it was worth it. But this is not like the Offspring I LOVED. (i.e. Smash, ixnay on the hombre, Americana, Splinter) Noodles is still putting out the riffs. But, it seems that dexter is just gone a lil soft for my taste.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is a perfect World of Warcraft clone. Alongside N.O.V.A. 3 and minecraft pocket edition, this is my favorite game to play. Written by a 14 year old boy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|At last the truth about the Bin Ladin raid and the truth about the heroes who carried out the raid. This book is well written and an easy read. The factual accuracy is evident as compared to what was coming out of the Obama administration's self-serving so-called facts of the raid.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's easy to be drawn in to this tale of discovery. This book is not what it seems and should be easily dismissed.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Cloud-based file sharing is getting more and more popular.  And I'm sure that many people use it for very common things, such as photo sharing.  Dropbox is geared for all kinds of file sharing, but I use it mostly for work productivity -- the ability to have my files wherever I am, whenever I need them, and to share them with other co-workers.  It's more than cloud-based, because for every device I use with Dropbox, the files \\"in the Dropbox cloud\\" are synched with whatever device I am on, automatically.  Whatever files I've placed in my Dropbox from one device will show up *on* any other device I have (PC, tablet, etc.) that has Dropbox access.  And they will be *copied to* that device, so that I can carry them with me, even when I don't have access to the Internet.<br /><br />Dropbox is a much more \\"business-oriented\\" (read: \\"serious\\") version of the more common social networking versions of file-sharing, and I consider it a must-have tool for anyone moving between devices throughout their day, but with the need to share files with co-workers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Confusing, interesting and addictive way to end the trilogy. Pleasing non-the less. I would love to read more from Mr. Grey, that was quite interesting.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I work with a lot of \\"office\\" files (i.e., Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, PDF documents, etc.), and it's nice to have a suite of tools to do that on a tablet.  I don't know that this would be as beneficial on the small screen of a phone (at least, not for MY tired eyes), but it's perfect for a tablet.<br /><br />Full disclosure: this is not my primary Android office suite.  I actually prefer Documents To Go for almost all of the \\"normal\\" office document activities that I do.  I like the interface a bit better; and I've just gotten used to its tools.  However, every now and then, there is something that DTG just doesn't do quite right, or a document it doesn't render quite correctly, so I keep secondary office suites available, in the hopes that they may address what DTG has missed.  Kingsoft Office is one of those additional suites.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I really liked this one. Actually started reading series from beginning and her writing has improved so much. This Temperance is nothing like the series and there is no Seely  but still it is very good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I heard some rave reviews about this book but it is not grabbing my interest that much. I admit I am only about a 1/3 of the way through, but when I have to go back and re-read several pages to catch up, I know it's not that great. Sorry!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed Mockingjay because it had a twist ending. This final book culminated the anomosity of the period of revolution in Panem. Very good
B0090EHVMC|3.0|I love the Lorax as a kid (both the book and the original movie) and was eager to see the remake.  The movie was okay and my son enjoyed it, however it left a lot to be desired.  It just didn't have the magic feel the original did.  Way to much singing and politics.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I was planning on only buying the song \\"It's Time\\" but I figured since music is SOO much cheaper on Amazon than iTunes I'd listen to the clips from the other songs and maybe get them all. I bought it all for 5 bucks and I love it! Totally great album and the most popular song \\"It's Time\\" isn't even my favorite of them all anymore!<br />Can't wait for future music from Imagine Dragons.
B0091XRL86|3.0|Overall a decent family film but not much more than that.  If you are a Wall& Gromit fan it's worth seeing as the claymation is excellent.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Was a good fun game my kids loved it. Could not beat the price, it was a great value at .99
B008KW43TE|4.0|I bought this on the recommendation from my brother and was unexpectedly surprised at how much I am into this.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book is not well written. The first section reads like a shopping list for materiel. The description of some the authors missions are more interesting. The mission to capture/kill Bin Laden is the highlight of the book and the only reason to buy it. Compared to \\"Warrior Soul\\" by Chuck Pfarrer,  (2004) Random House, but for Bin Laden, this book is wanting
B000669GAI|5.0|All of Pearl Jams greatest songs on two CDs.  Exactly what I was looking for in a greatest hits collection.  Well worth the money.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fortunately, Fruit Ninja is one of those games offered for free on the Kindle Fire.  I don't think I would have paid for it if it weren't...only because I'm cheap. I do have to say that the game becomes quite addicting and my child thinks so too. I'm no gamer and you don't have to be to play this casual yet fun game.  I do however, feel guilty after playing it because it does rob you of your time.<br /><br />Who has never felt like just taking your frustrations out on a piece of fruit?  It does start out way too simple but after you pick the more advanced levels (three all together), you do have to watch out for the bombs that they throw in with the fruit.<br />With all the free games to choose from, I have found this one to be more precise with the touch screen and the graphics are vibrant and luscious.  I found the sound effects to be dead on as if I were to throw a watermelon on the ground.<br />I know from reading other reviews and listening to my child rave about the game, that there's unlockable swag, power-ups, challenges and interesting factoids about fruit.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A good book from someone who was there giving a first hand account of what really happened.<br /><br />These guys should get a lot of credit for doing the tough jobs.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book about Chris Kyle's life in and out of the military.  I would highly recommend this book as well as \\"Lone Survivor\\" which is about Chris' friend, Marcus Luttrell.
B005IQZB14|4.0|What a wild adventure! Cheryl Strayed's unflinching and powerful memoir was a very good read and was often \\"unputdownable\\". I enjoyed sharing her journey...from the comfort of my home.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is phenomenal!!! Great ending to such a intense series!! Definently a must read I couldn't put this book down
B006886C0U|2.0|I hate to give low points since I know what it takes to make these films. But somehow I wasn't enthused about this film.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was very reluctant to read this book, I read the negative reviews and well, I wasn´t encouraged to read it.  Also, I always thought it wasn´t the kind of book I like to read, but my friends talked me into buying it.  I don´t think it´s a literary masterpiece (at all), actually it is even badly written in some parts.  Having said that, I have to add that it is very entretaining and in the end I really liked it.  I´m reading it for the second time around!  I´m actually recomending it to all my friends that haven´t read it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Absolutely best battery app I have used. A definitely must have app. Tells you how much longer you can use your phone depending on what you are using phone for.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I did like this novel. I always want to learn something from a book. Besides learning a lot about the flora and the fauna of the English countryside, I felt that the development of the protagonist was done with tender care and insight.
B001NLL93W|4.0|This was the best of the three novels that I have read in this series. I would recommend it to those who like fantasy novels for youth.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A well written account of what led up to, and the actual mission that killed Osama Bin Laden.  The book gives you the truth of what happened on the ground from the men who were there carrying out the mission with no political spin and media hype.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book raises some interesting questions...like just how much would you do to protect your child and exactly how neighborly you would be in such a circumstance.<br /><br />However, some of it was just over the top as in the way the grandfather was woven in to the story in the end.<br /><br />Did enjoy the courtroom scenes, the questioning by the lawyers and the general strategic tactics that were presented.<br /><br />All in all a good read but not an excellent one.  Great for the beach I guess!!
B00846REIS|4.0|This is very nearly the same story as \\"50 Shades\\". Really. It's bordering on plagiarism. I gave it 3 stars because I did finish it in reasonable time, so it must have been engaging enough. I gave it the 4th star because while it's probably not going to go down as a classic, the writing was decent! Better than the writing in \\"50 Shades\\" for sure.<br /><br />The \\"scenes\\" in 50 Shades are better. More interesting and exciting.<br /><br />If you liked 50 Shades, I *think* you'll like this book. However, I'm not chompin' at the bit to get the second book in this series and I couldn't WAIT to get my hands on the second book in the 50 Shades series.<br /><br />If you're an avid reader, this is brain trash. I mean that in the most wonderful sense. It's a guilty pleasure. If you're sitting in an airport, on a beach, at jury duty or the DMV, this book is good company for that. It won't change your life, it won't expand your vocabulary, you won't learn anything new, it won't make you a better person. It's just fun. Reluctantly Recommended.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had already saw the series and had rave reviews about the books.  This book was great; loved getting all the detail around character development that you normally don't get from watching the show.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Im not sure there has ever been a more interesting site. From food to funny to adorable to hot and there are more DYI ideas than you could do ever. It is awesome.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|This is a good movie.  Rent worthy.  Things are too busy.  Your are spending to much of your time trying to relate to every mini story.  They try to tie it all together but done very roughly.  Should have picked 2 maybe 3 storys and developed them more.  If you have gone threw pregnacy, the expecting process, or ARE going threw the expecting process a few things really jump out at you as funny.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Simply amazing!! so much better than the first. It had me gripping the edge of my seat the entire time.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Love this movie. Great love story and even better travel story. Makes you wonder if it is really possible to travel by ballon.
B000T00KQA|5.0|Seminal and soulful. Songs sung straight from the heart by one of the greatest jazz trumpet players of all time. So cool you'll need a parka.
031261246X|5.0|After seeing that Mark was writing a book I immediately knew I would read his book, and I was not disappointed. Zero Day makes for compelling reading and Mark gets all of the little details right, which is great for us technically minded people. I was disappointed that I got through it so fast (because I could not put it down), but am now eagerly awaiting arrival of the sequel, Trojan Horse!
B008D28HYS|3.0|Once you get the hang of this game it is challenging and fun. Often I was able to figure out what the picture was going to be but getting all the blocks colored just so is harder then it looks. The people who like trial n error will not find this game fun but if you like the combination of trial and error but with high doses of logic it will please you.Not a game for those who quickly become frustrated.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book pulls at every emotional string you have. Plus the understanding of what goes through a young boys mind. It's very touching. A very good read.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Great game for the family. I have three teenaged boys who all enjoyed this game. We didn't know anything about \\"Angry Birds\\" and still don't no anything outside of this game. One of my grown daughters said it was a fun game on her WII. When it was offered as a FAOTD I thought we would try it. We have played the game over and over again. Many levels and loads of laughs. The more challenging levels are thought provoking because it does no good to repeat what you have already tried. Makes you want to make ham dinner out of the pigs that laugh at you.
B00932A6G4|5.0|Good story and voice overs. This franchise is a perfect fit for CG. They have a few new actors for the voices, but the voice for Rico is still the same.
B000I9U75G|5.0|This is a pretty good Godzilla movie. The story is easy to follow, except I still don' know what kind of lizard became mutated into Godzilla. Anyway, it's better than the one right after it, Godzilla 2000.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read this book for our bookclub.  When I started it I knew my husband would love it, so I stopped reading the book and began again when he was available to listen while I read. We both loved the book and wanted it to go on (always the way with a good book).  Since this book is from the Dog's prespective, it is funny in so many places.  There are some repetitive areas, but we didn't mind them.  Just put that in for people to be aware of.  Glad our book club picked it.!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent book! I would definitely  recommend this book! I was depressed to finish the trilogy. :( I cant get enough of Christian and Anastasia!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I resisted reading these books or watching the movie but I am glad I started reading them. Great story, great books.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was a great read. I really want to read more by Ms Flynn. Very good page turner and kept my interest. Very scary and I did not see some of the twists and turns.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|The song is clear good plays well. The song is reasonably priced and you can download it.  Instent avablity and mulitable system playable are excelent.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great book! I was on the fence about 50 shades of grey because its so repetitive & almost like an erotic twilight series. This book on the otherhand is much more realistic & less repetitive. It's a very good read!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Perfectly describes the life of the people in the soviet union at the 50's. Couldn't leave it. Fluently written and took my imagination to this time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I watched my friend play this game on his Ipad for so long. I waited and waited for it to come out on the Kindle. And now...here it is. It's...it's...AWESOME!!!!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! It is worth the price, trust me. It will entertain you for hours nonstop. I am in love with this game. GET IT OR THE CREEPERS WILL GET YOU.
B006O6FK2W|4.0|buen juguete, aunque me parece, tiene algunis defectos en la cabina donde entra un batman, el cual hubieran incluido en el juguete
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I absolutely loved this show and would watch it 10 times over!  I definitely recommend it to ANYONE who is looking for a new show!  It has history, drama, explosions, and of course, love.  GREAT!
B007T7CJZ6|5.0|I might not be the most neutral individual to rate this product because Peter Gabriel is one of my favorite artists. The qualities I love most in Peter Gabriel are his creativity, his ongoing development as an artist often, his embrace of other artists and their work.  I respect his is ability to keep himself private; I think this is critical to being authentic.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I was needing an alarm clock at the last minute. I checked my kindle, which I always have by the bed anyway, and sure enough there was a alarm clock ap! Works like a gem!!
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|An enjoyable and quick read. Capote delivers a dramatic and comedic storyline that offers a glimpse into the life of the characters. I thoroughly enoyed this read. The short stories at the end are a delightful bonus. Each is unique and exquisitely descriptive.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I am revising my review because when I reached level 26, all of a sudden the gane crashes while loading. Very dissapointing. I have to do a 'hard restart' of my Kindle Fire each time. Wish this was fixed, hate to start all over again, and probably won't play it again. - - - - - Great game if you enjoy city building/management games. I've seen lots of complaints about having to spend real money. I'm too cheap to give a free game any $... but if you are patient, you can play as long as you like. Take a break to let your energy rebuild, and don't spend all your jewels at once.  There's a lesson to be learned about managing money with these games too.
B0085776BG|4.0|Great story. Didn't know about it before. I'm curious how historical it is. I would recommend it. Prime movies are fantastic.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|If you like dinner dash or anything like that you will love this game. It also teaches kids the importance of moving quickly and completing a job all the way.
B001DF68MA|2.0|I found it very difficult to pedal with the seat between my legs. The foot rests were scraping against my calves as I pedaled.  Also, it is only attached with one bolt and it didn't seem to stabilize it. Our child was leaning to one side quite a bit (which made it even more difficult to pedal!). We returned it and are going to look at rear- mounted seats.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Cute movie.  I've not seen the Play.  Liked the movie, but others watched only parts, and did NOT like it.  To each his/her own.  Glad I purchased.  Will watch again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down from start to finish. It's a fresh, unique writing style that was a welcome change from the typical suspense/thrillers. I read a lot and it's hard to find a book that can keep my attention like this one did. Characters are great, writing was great, and the story line unforgettable. Highly recommend!
B001S49AQW|5.0|This is one of my favorite stories. Of course, I would say that about most of Heyer's books! Her deft mix of ironic and sympathetic humor makes me laugh, her appealing characters draw me in, and her entertaining plots satisfy. Friday's Child is your quintessential Cinderella tale, but Hero touches my heart in a way that the traditional heroine cannot.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A real page turner! Thank you so much for your service to our country and helping to protect our freedom! This book is a must read!
B008B8DY2O|1.0|Friends insisted but I was very disappointed. Endless bloody battles interspersed with absurd aphorisms. Purple prose: eyes the color of sand held in a palm an hour before sunset? Oh, that color. I made it through but only by skimming.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Anything Ken Follett writes is a hit with me. Haven't finished the book yet as I don't want it to end before the second one is available!!!!It's on my Kindle and I can take it with me whenever I want to read a chapter or two or three!!!
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is one of the best multiplayer async TBS games on any platform.  Maybe the best - with support for up to 4v4.  If you like TBS games get it.  The single player is OK but it shines in MP.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I will read These Books over and over as they're really Great! I think Suzanne Collins is a Great Author! I recommend these Books for any Reader! I also Bought these Books for my Kindle so I can take there were ever I want to go!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not put this book down once I started it. It gave a glimpse into a life I had no experience with at all. Few have experienced this training and hats off to those that succeed. It was a great read.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|On the first try we poured the hot n cold water with no results. But after a minute or two we tapped the bottle against the bucket it was over and it snapped right off. Smooth clean cut.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like it because it says when your battery will run out and how hours/mins you have till it will die.  It would be cool for your phone or tablet such as a KINDLE FIRE!!!!!!!!<br />  Yours Truly,<br />  App Lover
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|maybe the best of our generation. remarkable persons story who did great things personally and professionaly but truly lived 'amazing grace'.  humbling throughout with more sacrifice than any group of folks should have to give.<br />read it but dont plan on sleeping once you pick it up.....you wont be able to put it down.
B0086700CM|4.0|Awesome game!:) only bad thing is you can buy stuff.  So when my little brother gets on it he will accidently buy something like extra coins without even knowing that he did. Other than that and that sometimes it takes frlorever to load its a pretty fun game :)!!!!!!!!!
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|We received the DVD New Year's Eve on time in excellent condition.  This DVD is a great addition to our library collection.  Thank you for a great product.
B0086DBE62|5.0|This was a cute family movie. Fun for all. A bit of humor, a bit of action, and a love story all wrapped into one.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is another excellent read from Mitch Albom.  Really thought provoking and satisfying to read.  I highly recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|If you are like me and have no idea how or what teenagers in this generation are thinking then this is the book for you.  I liked the fact this book is written as a diary to a person that does not exist but that we all wish would exist.  All in all this was an enjoyable read and encompassed many of the issues facing our young adults today.
B0014EU5XI|4.0|grab it on sale and you have a superb collection of zz top hits, a few misses, and even a couple of songs that i don't think i've ever heard. but often, i find the music too similar... the hits just merge together and the misses, well i could just delete those and not look back (but it's personal preference). notables include the raw sounds in brown sugar, the long-forgotten jesus just left chicago and driving while blind, the seemingly out of place, but not, mexican blackbird, and all the rest you know by heart. diehard fans might love it, but glad i didn't pay too much to add to my collection...
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another great read, the twists don't stop - a great plot! It seems at the end of every book in this series you're left wondering how to carry on with the pace, but this succeeds.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book is basically soft porn, but I must say it kept me intrigued the whole way through.  It was suspenseful and entertaining and I found it hard to put down.  The banter between the two lead characters through their emails was both funny and exciting.  I loved it!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I don't agree with some of the other reviewers who didn't enjoy this book as much because it focused more on Cersei and some of the other less known/popular characters.  The reasons most people love these books so much are the intricate plot lines and the fascinating characters.  So this book has given a few more threads and interesting people to follow.  I expect to see more of these characters in book 6, and have all the threads come together when Dany finally arrives in Westeros in book 6 or 7.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This caculator works well, and is a great basic caculator. I have used it for a month and am satisfied with its performance.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I purchased the Kindle edition of this book.  The paper edition may be different.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this book is that it deals too much with Owen's personal quest to become a Seal. I don't really care if he almost flunked out of Green Team.  What I care about is what happened on the raid itself.  The background information was nice, but not really necessary to the story itself.<br /><br />Because I had the Kindle edition, I didn't know there were maps and diagrams of the building until I finished the book.  It would have been nice to see those diagrams within the story itself so I could follow the Seals as they carried out the mission. To say they landed on the south side of the compound and ran over to the east side does not give me a visual of their actual footsteps.  Seeing it in the diagrams with the buildings and trees, etc. was a tremendous help for me.<br /><br />The account of the mission itself is rather well written.  I had to re-read the climactic chapter several times to really absorb everything that happened. I'm no author, but it is probably difficult to trace the steps and actions of 24 individual Seals during a raid such as this.  While not perfect, the authors did as good as they could considering the circumstances.<br /><br />For those of you who are worried that the authors are revealing classified information through this book, fear not. As they clearly state in the introduction, all of the information in the book came from information that was public knowledge. What the authors did was take that information and correct it to give us an accurate accounting of the events that occurred that night and the following day when they disposed of the body.<br /><br />Was everything there?  I don't know.  All I really know is that I was left with very few questions and a great deal of respect for the men who carried out this mission as well as the people in Washington (whoever they are) that planned it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I found the story to be slightly unbelievable in how much the \\"hero\\" allowed the \\"heroine\\" to manipulate him.  The ending was totally unsatisfying.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This was such a fun movie to watch. Acting was superb. No real surprise at the ending. Maybe more of a Chick Flick.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have to agree extremely addicting. I find myself eagerly waiting for coins to reload. might need 12 step program!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because I have company to read my Bible.  The only disappointment is that I don't have Wi-Fi everywhere I go.
B000S0DDG0|5.0|Loved this movie when I first saw it - and it's one of the few movies I will watch over again. Love the music and I have all the songs on my ipod. For me and my family, it's a classic!
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Great story and a most creative way of telling the story.  One that the reader learns about...but I won't tell you when.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|It is one of my favorite movies.  I love the story and the actors.  The streaming was very smooth and clear without any hiccups.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Neither my wife nor I found the trilogy very engaging. The writing was pedestrian, the sex scenes lacked creativity and the story not even a little plausible. Congrats to E.L. James for making a ton of money for a lot of fantasy and a little titillation.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|I love the story and the actors.  Zac Efron did a great job.  The Amazon streaming was very smooth and clear without any hiccups.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Most of you are probably introverts, readers usually are. After taking multiple leadership seminars making me feel guilty for not being a verbal extroverted cheer leader, finally something that tells me that my quiet demeanor is an asset. There are techniques for how to use my stillness in the business arena. How to retreat diplomatically and how to mask introversion when needed. This is a useful and profound book. It will be kept on my Kindle to use as a reference.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|Glad i got my prepurchase in.. this Bluray collectors edition is great.. the packaging is awesome... and the extras are very nice.  The quality of the bluray digital conversion is very clean... super great picture and sound!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The books content is great and it is well written. You just cannot stop reading it.<br />I love the doer attitude versus the politician's maneuvers.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|First time reader of this author---her character development, easy and flow of reading is good---will definitely look for other books by her.
B009329ZF2|3.0|A no thought needed movie to just sit back and be entertained by the recidivous. You have seen this premiss hundreds of times but somehow it still strikes an inner cord...the good guy wins.
B0087HT36U|5.0|same physic style game as angry birds and cut the rope, but with a more interactive style demolition gameplay.  wish it had more levels
B003SI6C4O|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Lots of twists and turns; kept you focused every step of the way.  Would highly recommend
B008HIZHY6|5.0|Order received in good condition and on time.  Was purchased as a birthgday gift for My sister-in-law's birthday. I know she will love it.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|As with all the Saxon Chronicles, I was really disappointed when this book came to its conclusion.  I love the characters and the historical settings that B.C. brings to life.  I can hardly wait to find out what else is in store for Uthred, as the series seems to be drawing to it's (inevitable) close.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is just what i was looking for to get work done! it is a great tool. everyone should use this calculator.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I am very happy with the product that i ordered. The quality of the product was great. The sound and condition were more than i expected.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|We wanted to see while it was playing at theatre but missed an opportunity to get there. It was a nice family oriented action packed, and visually stunning movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's a super fun little game. It doesn't require too much brain power, so it's great to play when you want to relax and unwind.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack it a fun game. My kids really like playing it. The challenges are always fun to try and accomplish. My kids would play it all day if I let them.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Kindle Fire.  Very nice.  The ability to combine sounds is sweet.  The sounds themselves are pleasant. I recommend this product.
B007WPM4P0|4.0|You can't go wrong with any production by Masterpiece on PBS.  It's better than watching the mind -numbing television offered by network tv.  This production is well done - with wonderful acting by some great young actors - especially Eddie Redmayne and Joseph Mawle.  And of course, Marie Josee Croze.  You may remember her from \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.\\"  If you enjoy period pieces, costume drama and a love story set against the backdrop of the First World War, then this movie is a must see.<br />But be aware, there are some difficult war scenes.  I enjoyed it enough to buy it.
B00000JTB2|1.0|This one is so wonderful.  You can hear the two artists talking together between numbers.  So real, so intimate.  Wonderful.
B008I3R2VG|4.0|Ok I am going to defend this album a bit.  I listened to it in my car for several days and just couldn't seem to get into it.  Today I put on some good headphones and cranked it for one more listen.  This made a HUGE difference.  There really is a lot going on musically here.  Is this Hot Fuss?  Absolutley not.  The album is not as good as Sam's Town but much better than Day and Age, so it's really mixed feelings.  The production is excellent on the album I must say.  I have to applaud the Killers for having such musical ability to make an album like Hot Fuss, and at the same time the ability to do something completely different that is still musically sound and just plain good music.  Still one of the most under rated bands of a generation the Killers even with this album have put out a product that is better than 99 percent of the garbage being sold in the mainstream music industry.  4 stars.  This band has a long way to go before reaching their full potential, so here's hoping for that 5 star album next time.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|I actually read this under my Nook account and if I could have gotten a refund I would. I thought it was boring, way too many terms & abbreviations. BTW...taking cheap shots at the Pres & Vice Pres was just wrong-no matter what political party is running this country. He's your Commander-in-Chief and that was disrespectful.<br /><br />You have to love how those who do not agree with your review will assume you didn't read the book because (a) they've read your other reviews to see the types of books you normally read (as though I'm not allowed to read what I like) or (b) your review is short and sweet. But yes, I DID READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT UBL and I still feel the same. In fact, after reading many other reviews there are a lot of people that felt the same way - the majority of this book was about his SEAL training. The actual part about UBL could have put in a pamphlet.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Since the browser version of pinterest would lock up my kindle fire, i was very excited to see this app. i am pleased with it most of the time but don't like when it forces itself closed.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This concert truly changes lives. Someone who isn't a Michael Jackson fan will become an obsessed Michael Jackson fan just from watching and listening to this concert.

It's a truly life-changing experience.<br /><br />Greater than any movie, greater than any other concert or performance, greater than any sporting event, the greatest thing you will ever see and experience in your life!<br /><br />Michael Jackson's dancing and energy defies the laws of physics. His singing and vocals defy all adjectives. The music and the sounds are magical. The heart and the soul is indescribable. You experience this concert and you leave a changed person for the better. The magic gets inside your heart, bones, and soul. I can't stop smiling during the entire two hours and beyond. This concert is greater than anything anyone can imagine. You want to know what it feels like in Heaven? It feels like the way you feel as you experience this concert.<br /><br />Michael Jackson is truly a Champion and a hero. MJ really cares about inspiring people to go after all their dreams, trust in God, never give up, and become the person you were meant to become.<br /><br />The greatest singing, vocals, emotion ever!

B000FC1MM8|5.0|great suspence.  unfortunetly i had read this book before but it has been a long time ago.  it was just as good now as it was years ago.  still just as hard to put down.  lots of twists and turns.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a must have app for the kindle fire. It helps me a lot. Now I don't have to go to the settings to see how much battery life it has. And best of all it's free!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written. Easy to read. Not sure why this got so much backlash from the government.  Probably  because it varies from their PC edition of events.  These men are extremely brave,  dangerous,  and violent. And I'm proud of the job they do for our country.  Politicians can not order someone killed,  then expect a Disney out come.  Book is straight forward and explains what happened. It was nice to be told the truth for once. Worth reading.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Michael Connelly can make you believe your the main character in his book. You feel every nuance and twist of every plot. His books are always worth the time to read them.
B007SNMYNS|4.0|This is a valuable book, but the author's insistance on blaming the world's problems on genetic modification of wheat disguises the real message:  if one is pre-diabetic, one must drop the carbs, regardless of source and regardless of any \\"improvements\\" from the process of genetic modification of wheat.  A much better book , straight to the point and without introducing irrelevant issues, is \\"The Low-Starch Disabetes Solution\\" by Rob Thompson M.D. (also available through Amazon).<br /><br />This book is OK:  [[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]<br /><br />This is the better book:  [[ASIN:B002TGNIWU The Low-Starch Diabetes Solution : Six Steps to Optimal Control of Your Adult-Onset (Type 2) Diabetes]]
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book is great! I love how each chapter is who's talking in the book. :) It's so touching and seems so real.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|It's alright.  The spiders can be predictable and often challenging.  It's a decent puzzle game that makes you think on each level.
0765316994|4.0|After being underwhelmed but intrigued after reading Zoe's Tale earlier this year, I've been meaning to start John Scalzi's Old Man's War series from the beginning (I've even bought the whole series since then). Instead, I picked this book up on an impulse, after hearing so many good things about it. I vacillated for a while, wondering if maybe Redshirts is a little too smug for its own good. Overall, though, the book's concept is strong and the story is legitimately exciting and often hilarious. Mild spoilers ahoy.<br /><br />The title of the book refers to the random crew members on Star Trek (especially the original series) that you can tell aren't going to make it past the second commercial break. You know what I'm talking about. When a routine away mission to perform an ostensibly boring task on a nondescript planet is revealed to be made up of Ensign Bob and three senior officers, at least one of whom should be on the bridge of the ship, it's clear right away that things aren't going to end well for Bob. The book uses this established truism to launch a transparent parody of sci-fi television tropes.<br /><br />The story revolves around a group of fresh-faced Universal Union cadets, newly assigned to the UU flagship, the Intrepid. Once there, however, they quickly realize that something is amiss. The ship's crew goes out of its way to dodge away-team duty, which has a consistent track record of random accidents and bizarre fatalities. The senior officers often act inexplicably strange, and people take every opportunity to dodge them. Even the laws of science tend to go a little weird on the Intrepid, from time to time. Investigating these odd occurrences leads to a crazy theory on what the Intrepid really is, and the newest redshirts embark on an equally crazy mission to possibly save themselves from an early, meaningless death.<br /><br />Redshirts appeals to the same group of people who enjoyed the brilliant satirical movie Galaxy Quest: those who love science fiction television enough to poke fun at its glaring flaws. Scalzi uses metahumor for this purpose, to great effect. The first half of the book is packed with in-jokes, and the second half plows right through the fourth wall and makes a determined assault on the fifth. This element of the writing is consistently funny, but it also gave me pause in the first few chapters. Scalzi's trademark wit in both narrative and dialogue is present here, and combined with the emphasis on metahumor, there were quite a few moments where I felt a little stir of annoyance even as I smiled. Golly gee, I would think to myself, isn't this book just so fricking clever. Look how clever you are.<br /><br />The thing is, though, it really is clever. The concept never strays into being the one-trick pony it could easily be; Scalzi gets a lot of value out of the \\"we're expendable\\" meme, but he deftly sets it up as an integral part of the plot, so it never feels tired. Instead of repeatedly going for the same joke, he layers a bunch of other metafictional elements on top of it. The result is a mishmash of gleefully absurd and unexpectedly somber moments that create a fast-paced, engaging story; in other words, a classic pulp science-fiction plot. I couldn't put this book down, and since it's pretty slim to begin with, I tore through it much quicker than most of the books I read.<br /><br />It does have its problems, though. You may notice that I did not mention any specific characters in my synopsis above. That is because the main characters are largely indistinguishable from one another. The narrative of Redshirts is enormously reliant on dialogue, and Scalzi eschews any sort of physical description of the protagonists, except for mentioning that one of them is a woman. The hero, Andrew Dahl, has black hair in my mind's eye, but I can't remember if he's written that way or if I just did it on my own to make him stand out. Anyway, this can be an effective writing tactic if the characters' voices are distinct, but all of the heroic redshirts (and a good number of the supporting characters) repeatedly fall back on the same sardonic wit for which the author himself is known. They all quickly started to bleed together, and that honestly made me care a bit less about them. One could argue that it's another satirical reference, but it doesn't feel that way.<br /><br />The codas at the end of the book are the big payoff, and they are solidly written and emotionally powerful. They are also radically different in tone and format than the rest of the book, and while I wasn't overly bothered by the shift in gear, I kind of wish all of that interesting, affecting stuff was somehow integrated into the main story.<br /><br />All of those issues circle back to the general tongue-in-cheek tone, though, which taken as a whole is what makes the book work so well. There's a genuinely gripping story and hints of existentialism hiding underneath the snark, too, which ensures that the book transcends mere parody. I can definitely see where it might lose some readers; hard science-fiction fans will probably be annoyed by the blurry, completely nonsensical plot mechanics that drive the last part of the story. I took my cue from the general tone of the book, though, and didn't get bogged down in the details. This is quick read that has a lot of pathos lurking alongside its deft satire of genre tropes, and is required reading for anybody that has ever attended a sci-fi convention or can rattle off actual episode names of their favorite series. Also, it comes with a companion song from Jonathan Coulton, which only adds to its credibility.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|It's amazing,every time I see it I'm amazed at all the details I have not seen before. I love it...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an amazing story about, what you are willing to do for the person you love. And how good, sometimes, that can feel.
B007REAIUE|5.0|This album has a retro flare. Each track is different, with great vocals and instruments. Definitely a great buy for an old soul.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|If you want to read life changing stuff, then this is the one.  Practice what it says and your life will change for ever - FOR THE BETTER.<br />Before reading this book, I also bought [[ASIN:B005JDGTEO The Secrets Of Life And Death Revealed]] and that I found to be mighty useful too.
B008XVG4FS|5.0|This episode is really interesting...i missed it on tv when it came on so I bought it on my kindle fire
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|My 12 year old son rented this movie and really liked it.  He liked it so much he wanted his mother to watch it.  Being 46 years old,  his mother was not so interested in watching it, but I finally gave in and watched it and LOVED it!!!
1596434252|5.0|I don't know what to add that others haven't already said. This book is delightful. Even though it's small, it invites you to look at it again and again. It's definitely not just for kids.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I liked this movie.  A little heavy on the environmental push, but cute.  They could have backed off that a little and made it more \\"kid\\" focused.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds, ad free, was easy to download and install.  I enjoyed playing this game. I like it that there are no ads to block my view.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|After watching Mary Poppins for the first time with our 7 and 4 year old, we realized these old classics have a lot to offer.  Kids enjoyed the music.  Humor was right on target for them and the story line kept them engaged for the entire 2+ hours.  Wish there were more movies like this available.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|First off, I have not read the book and I NEVER will.  This person sold out to greed and, in my opinion, has jeapordized future SEAL actions.  I have undying respect for the SEALs and I believe that this book betrays everything they sacrifice themselves for just so that he & corporate America can make $.  For those of you who have bought the book, shame on you.  I think you need to seriously look at your actions.  This book was written with NO knowledge or approval from the pentagon; given that it is a crime for SEALs to do this (and they sign sworn statements agreeing to this), I see no other conclusion than that this was based on greed according to all evidence so far.  For those who continue to buy the book - and as a consequence, fuel this greed, you're no more than traitors yourselves.  I hope this author is convicted by the pentagon & goes to jail like he deserves.<br /><br />Review update:<br /><br />OK - I admit the above is passionate, but I am very passionate about maintaining national security and maintaining the code of honor that is at the core of all those in special ops.  Maybe \\"traitor\\" is a bit harsh, maybe it isn't.  I refer to froggy's excellent review \\"Blue Falcon alert.\\"  His reference to the \\"well known and established code of ethics to which every Navy SEAl pledges\\" follows:<br /><br />\\"My Trident is a symbol of honor and heritage. Bestowed upon me by the heroes who have gone before...By wearing the Trident, I accept the responsibility of my chosen profession and way of life. It is a privilege that I must earn every day...I humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow Americans...I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions...Brave men have fought and died building the proud tradition and feared reputation that I am bound to uphold. In the worst of conditions, the legacy of my teammates steadies my resolve and silently guides my every deed.\\"<br /><br />The author clearly violates this and further is profitting financially from this violation.  I urge you to not help him and not buy this book.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|As always Kristen Stewart gave a great performance.  I love her character and theplot of the movie.  Incredible fighting scenes and performances by all the actors involved.  I got the movie plus I have one for my computer.  Great, Awesome and very exiting movie.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|My wife, my kids (11 and 13 years old) and I watched the movie at the theaters and we liked it a lot. The deal included the Blu-ray and the DVD. Very good purchase.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|What can I say? It is Adele! She is really great! Her voice, the songs... A little bit disappointed with the fact she stays seated almost the whole show, but this is not very important. I do recommend.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|We started watching Castle during Season 4 and we liked it. So we decided to start from scratch. by the way, the first 4 episodes are really good.
B00709GTGS|4.0|This is really a great movie. That kind of movie to watch when you need to relax. I do recommend this one. It is not a Wonderful production, but it is a nice option.
B006GLT8FK|4.0|The first movie was very nice. So we decided to buy the second, after my wife and kids watched it on TV. A good purchase.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Let me say right now that this is coming from someone looking down the sights of a very big geriatric gun.<br /><br />This is undeniably one of the best movies of the year.<br /><br />A number of older retirees, for a number of reasons, decides on India as the place where they will live out their golden years...some with more acceptance than others.<br /><br />This film presents us with performances from some of the premier British actors of our times. Judi Dench, Grande Dame of all British performance art, is a widow facing complete dissolution owing to the demise of her spouse, who has run everything; Tom Wilkinson, a leading barrister, has reached the end of playing footsie with bureaucracy; Muriel (Maggie Smith) needs an expensive hip replacement, which can be managed far more efficiently, not to mention cheaply, in Jaipur. Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton) are facing placement in a restricted home for the old and incompetent; Norman (Ronald Pickup) is a lonely elder gent who just wants to find a compatible lady. In desperation, they turn to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful in Jaipur, India - a place where, the brochure assures, they can live out their golden years in comfort.<br /><br />The establishment presents more challenges, inevitably, than are assured in the flyer. Things don't work; rooms have not been lived in in apparent decades; difficulties in cultural assimilation have not been addressed. However that is, some of the senior recruits dive into their new environment with enthusiasm, while others look upon their surroundings with little less than horror. One in particular has lived here before, and his attempts to revisit the well-remembered locations of his youth are bittersweet at the finest. One, who arrives a confirmed bigot, evolves in the most lovely way into an informed and sympathetic advocate. And all, apparently, experience an epiphany of restricted values, with the possible exception of one lady who simply cannot evolve into a new frame of thinking.<br /><br />I found myself numerous times on the verge of tears, of affinity, of you-go, of understanding. When you reach a certain age, you begin to weigh your options; I can't deny that I've thought about exotic locales that are purported to be very reasonable to live in - but the thought of uprooting myself to put down roots in an entirely different culture is daunting. Judi Dench's embracing of the life in India is refreshing to say the  least.<br /><br />Dev Petel (Slumdog Millionaire)as the proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has his own problems to work through, with a domineering mother who aspires for a more advantageous union for her third son, while he has already decided that he wants nothing less than Sunaina (Tena Desae) who is a lowly worker at a call center.<br /><br />This is a most involving film.  I never realized two hours had passed, and was truly invested in the convoluted lives of both the inhabitants of the Marigold Hotel and its hapless and striving proprietor. Maggie Smith in particular, Grande Dame who should be knighted, if that's possible, is particularly intriguing to watch; her evolution from confirmed bigot to informed lady is beautiful to watch.<br /><br />I cannot invest too much credit upon this film. It is one of the best I have seen in years. Enjoy it with an open heart and an open mind, and thoroughly enjoy the performances of several established masters of the craft of acting.simply cannot evolve into a new frame of thinking.<br /><br />I found myself numerous times on the verge of tears, of affinity, of you-go, of understanding.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I cannot really pinpoint the reason why I didn't rush through this book like I did the other two. The story seemed to dragged on. ( By the way I am only 45% through this book.) Hopefully it will get better.
B000QCQ8XA|4.0|Sad, funny, good read.  I like the characters and the situations, a little over the top!  Good story with a good ending
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I know LOL is overused but I actually DID laugh out loud many times as I read this.  Also poignant, not just one big long comedy sketch.  Would highly recommend!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinning is my favorite thing ever!!!! Great ideas and recipes... Addictive though, you must be warned.. if you have kids, weddings, a house, or gifts to buy this is great!!! Or just for entertaining too!!!! I love this!!
B007PF7MGS|5.0|I was very pleased with The Starch Solution.  This book is easy to read and interesting while also being packed with hard science to back up Dr. McDougal's claims.  I love the fact that he cites reputable studies and journal articles to validify his recommendations.  This is a book promoting a way of eating that contributes to vibrant health and a feeling of satisfaction.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Book was a bit slow at the beginning and had too much information about insignificant issues.  Once it moved to the Obama issue it was a better read.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I enjoyed this story, an easy read with interesting characters. A light read despite a sometimes heavy topic. This was my first JoJo Moyes book, I will be reading more.
B008N1LL42|5.0|This is a very good up to date scifi. Watching the making of and cast interviews made me want to watch it even more. If you have ever played Battleship (the board game) then you will love the aliens bomb shape.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I appreciate the fact that Mitch Albom's books are insightful and moral, free of offensive sexual references, and basically uplifting, but I didn't think this was one of his best. Just my opinion. It was well written, as always, just less riviting than usual for me.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|I was 8 the first time I saw this so I was only scared.<br />Now that I'm older I appreciate the story line much more.<br />Every time it came on TV when I can catch it I watched it.<br />Now I can see it any time I like and my grown children as well.<br />They like it too, it's a classic.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A well written book about the experiences of an individual who devoted 14 years defending Americans.<br />All should read for an appreciation of these men who serve.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great ap.  Fun to make own mixes. Lovely to read with it in background. Timer function is Marvelous and very useful.
B004C3DLJS|3.0|I watched this third entry in Pixar's highly successful Toy Story franchise with reservations as to how it would conclude.  I was not too surprised with the predictable characters in this final version specifically the villain; a beat up and sour teddy bear and a total characterature even with a southern accent.  For the most part, I watched all of the series to observe the animation and it remains flawless, but after awhile it can even get boring. I'm glad they rapped up what happened to Woody and the gang for the children who followed all the adventures and bought all the merchandise.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|Whenever I watched the Shrek series I would always concentrate on the character Puss' all too little screen time.  Puss is probably the most complex cartoon character ever created and the writers/animators/directors took advantage of this and fleshed him out to purr-fection.  I won't deny that Anthonio Banderas' voice attracted me as well and he did not disappoint.  It is so well done that I would rent or buy this movie again and that's something I don't typically do, but it demonstrates how entertaining it was.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I know better than to buy a book because of the masses. Erotica has been around forever. The story is hard to swallow being that she's a virgin.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liked this book because it was a true<br />firsthand account of what happened. Not the lies of the administration that takes credit for the kill.
0545425115|1.0|The cover of book is broken, seems to be the result of knife, and the first few pages is also broken either.
B0086449YA|4.0|I have all of Mark's solo and Dire Straits albums and see him live every chance I get. I can't say I love every song on this album -- yet anyway -- but there is much to like. Privateering, Redbud Tree, and Kingdom of Gold being my favs so far. I find one has to live with Mark's albums awhile before the lyrics and music sink in and gain meaning. I hope Mark will tour this album in the USA in 2013 -- WITHOUT BOB DYLAN!
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|A movie of one stunning, incredible image after another, some heart-soaring, some heart-breaking.  Sights you did not know existed, coupled with an every-changing score written for the film.  If it is still playing in theaters when you read this, go see it on a big screen; if not, buy the video.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I love the 3D thought/action secquences in this movie.  Sherlock against his greatest enemy - Moriarty.  What could be better.  The duo of Robert Downey and Jude Law works so well in these roles.  I can't get enough.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I normally wouldn't take the time to review a book that already has thousands of reviews. It's sort of a waste of my time. BUT rarely does a book come along that is so good - I'll make it short and sweet because this book deserves every review it gets. Rarely does a story come along, written for the youth audience, as good as this one is. If you read only one (well three since this is a trilegy) book this year or even in this lifetime, I would have to recommend this trilegy. Simply put - I think this trilegy will end up in the classics category. And besides that, it is simply excellent and I have nothing to add or subtract from these wonderful, well-written books. Read them. Unless you were born under a rock, you won't regret it. Just be sure to read them over a long weekend or on vacation. You might have trouble putting them down.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|These series of fifty shades are absolute rubbish. They are badly written and are so stupid. What a waste money.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The \\"story\\" is stupid!  Don't waste your time or money on this crap.  This is the reason Obama got elected, the country has dumbed down to this level... what pap!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book!! All the hype was about the S&M, but I get that the story is much deeper than that.  It is really about the relationship between Christian and Anastasia.  And Grey's kinkiness is just a symptom or coverup for his deep-seated issues.  Can't wait to read the next two books in the trilogy!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game got me addicted to this kind of hidden object / puzzle games.  loved this one for mu Kindle fire!!
B007N8RULO|4.0|very easy to use except sometimes it only moves a few instead of an entire row. It is probably me touching in the wrong place, though. Fun to pass the time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one if not the best game ever. The pocket edition is very good to I have ben waiting with my kindle fire forever I bought it as soon as posable. When I first played it I got very far. I can tell you right now that you should get this.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Only reason I did not give this book five stars is the suspense drives me crazy. Wonderful read. Would recommend to any fantasy reader
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love using the Kindle. It facilitates every aspect of reading for pleasure. I love reading Scandinavian thrillers, as well as novels by Ian McEwan and other European writers which describe life outside of the US which at the moment is overwhelmed by politics.<br /><br />Patricia Theiss
B003204MQS|4.0|Was a very simplistic approach but effective. The ambiance set by the music and the natural approach to the unnatural was very well executed. More real to life affect is what made it so convincing. The sounds and camera angles were brilliant.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good read, good writing, good twist and good page turner. I don't particularly like the ending, that's why the 4 stars.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Not the book for me!  Started out interesting then chapter after chapter of nothing much.  Plus, the language was too raw for my liking.  A disappointment.
B008J34466|4.0|P!nk's first album in four years, [[ASIN:B008J34466 The Truth About Love]] arrives September 18 via RCA Records. 2008's [[ASIN:B001F0VHEM Funhouse]] was P!nk's coronation as an edgy pop chanteuse (hits \\"So What\\" and \\"Sober\\"), while The Truth About Love is more unique and more consistent, led by the catchy, edgy pop cut \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss),\\"  Eyeing her first no. 1 album, nothing is more deserving than arguably this year's best pop album, which is consistent throughout.<br /><br />\\"Are We All We Are,\\" produced/co-written by Butch Walker, John Hill, and Emile Haynie (P!nk also co-writes), opens with heavy drums and mysterious production work that stimulates the listener.  P!nk sounds exceptional, `rocking-it-out' on the chorus: \\"We are the people that you'll never get the best of/not forget the rest of rest of/we've had our fill we've had enough we've had it up to here/all we are we are.\\" A solid opener, \\"Are We All We Are\\" doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Single \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\" is arguably P!nk's catchiest single ever.  Greg Kurstin produces a cut balancing pop and rock sensibilities. P!nk `slays,' particularly on the second half of the addicitive chorus: Just when it can't get worse/I've had a __ day/ have you had a __day?/We've had a __ day/I think that life's too short for this/I want back my ignorance and bliss/I think I've had enough of this/blow me (one last kiss).\\" \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\" is a pop gem.<br /><br />\\"Try\\" slackens the tempo, beginning much more restrained. Greg Kurstin's drums still assert and the keyboard synths highlight as well. Well written and paced, \\"Try\\" is both enjoyable and consistent.  \\"Just Give Me A Reason,\\" is a lovely duet between P!nk and Nate Ruess (of fun.). P!nk solos the first verse with Ruess taking the reins on the second.  By the second chorus, both combine harmoniously, delivering a powerful, nuanced performance. Excellent.<br /><br />\\"True Love\\" features Lilly Rose Cooper, who also co-writes with P!nk and Greg Kurstin.  The tempo is accelerated here while Kurstin's production continues to suit P!nk's inner-rocker persona.  Characterized by edgy and catchy songwriting, the pre-chorus stands out: \\"At the same time I wanna hug you/I wanna wrap my hands around your neck/you're an a_hole but I love you/and you made me so mad I ask myself...\\" \\"True Love\\" is single-worthy.<br /><br />\\"How Come You're Not Here\\" is valedictory with a pounding rock-pop beat, distorted vocal effects, and superb vocal nuance. Vintage touches make this cut special, not to mention the gritty songwriting: \\"Are you hidin' in the closet/are you underneath the bed/did you go for a long walk off a short pier? How come you're not here...\\" \\"How Come You're Not Here\\" is an `A+.'<br /><br />P!nk cedes no momentum on  \\"Slut Like You,\\" produced by Max Martin and Shellback. The famed dance-pop producers attune to their client's strengths on this cut, allowing for P!nk to still embrace her edgy, rocker side. \\"Slut Like You\\" is the perfect balancing act for P!nk. \\"The Truth About Love,\\" produced by Billy Mann blends aggressive rock/pop and vintage pop/soul. P!nk declares: \\"I think you just may be perfect/you're the person of my dreams/I've never ever ever ever been this happy/but now something has changed/and the truth about love is it's a ll a lie...\\" The bridge truly shows off P!nk's lovely upper register.<br /><br />\\"Beam Me Up\\" gives P!nk a tender moment after the sassier quarter that precedes it. Again,  P!nk's upper register is exposed here in a most beautiful way. \\"Walk of Shame\\" returns to `full throttle' P!nk, again pairing her with Greg Kurstin. Another catchy chorus is the product of this slick, edgy cut.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes The Weekend\\" features a rap by Eminem with DJ Khalil and Chin Injeti producing. The beat stomps and P!nk captivates. Eminem performs ok but he is not vital to the success of this cut, which P!nk slaughters all by herself. \\"Where Did The Beat Goes\\" finds<br />P!nk going back to her urban roots (she was an R&B singer originally) while closer \\"The Great Escape\\" gives her a more serious moment than say \\"Slut Like You\\" could hope to.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008J34466 The Truth About Love]] is great. Catchy, sassy, and always creative, The Truth about Love is one of 2012's best albums, easily. There are no misses and no filler whatsoever. Highly recommended.er urban roots (she was an R&B singer originally) while closer \\"The Great Escape\\" gives her a more serious moment than say \\"Slut Like You\\" could hope to.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008J34466 The Truth About Love]] is great.

B007T9FRFS|5.0|once again a great book by kathy reichs it is full of surprises and yet still contains elements of angst. a great read
B008CP93S0|3.0|Not one for the little kids to watch and it takes some of the slapstick humor over the top, but it still had some moments that you just may like. When it's only a 1.99 rental night go for it and make sure your date is okay with crazy sex humor it could be embarrassing.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well described account of the mission. The author gives the reader a real sense of<br />being in the middle of the action. Thank God for Navy Seals.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I really did enjoy this movie and Charlize Theron can do ugly evil real good; she is one amazing talent. The movie has some great special effects and it brings you right into it, which I loved. Kristen Stewart is not strong in this movie which I was hoping she would be; she still needs to grow as an actor and stop playing herself in all these movies. I don't see the character I see her as herself, but beside that it was fun watching this movie. I don't like to give to much away, but I have to say Ian McShane, Toby Jones along with a few other greats lost a few inches for this movie. Enjoy, you'll be surprised, the movie was well done.

B0082A3HTQ|5.0|A friend suggested this movie to me and I have thanked this person over and over again. I viewed this movie in a small theater in Santa Monica. The acting is beyond great, the music will bring a smile to your face and make you want to get up and move. It takes a tragedy and turns it into an amazing fun story. Everyone should view this movie I truly believe you will want all your friends to view it. Enjoy, have fun and dance
B0088TG252|4.0|Mostly action with little character development. Ryan Reynolds is not very convincing as a bad ass, but I think that's because I will always think of him as the funny man. Denzel Washington is pretty solid, though. Another good, mindless action flick.
B0092SQBJA|5.0|Making a fantastic second album after a fantastic debut album is hard, but Two Door Cinema Club has done it. It contains enough of their old sound to still be recognizable, but some new twists that make for an inspiring listen. I love their quirky lyrics and catchy melodies. I am a particularly big fan of 'Handshake'- a good first listen for those who are new to TDCC. 5 stars!
