B00062ZP6G|5|very good, thanks
B003L2ZQ9E|5|The Royal Purple filter is one of the most efficient automotive filters on the market. I spent my whole career in industrial hydraulic systems and the top hydraulic filters always used the fiberglass mat as the filter media. The heavy duty construction is a great additional feature. Having been using them for years and would never use anything else. I would recommend anyone considering this filter to watch the video on the Royal Purple website.
B00FY8648K|1|Piece of junk. Do not buy.
B003BIR8GC|5|Fit perfectly. Also included a filter that i didn't realize would come with it. I wish they had the option for just the plastic part.
B000CDAEAQ|5|Bought a pair for our Sienna and they have been excellent so far. Clean sweep and no squeaking or chattering yet. Good price for a quality blade.
B00GIYF4RG|4|This stripe turned out looking outstanding , I am so pleased .it looks awsum,  and all ready I've got many complements .The only draw back is the transfer tape is stiff hard to work with, I was worried a bit With the installation , and had to work it a bit , but the end result is awsum
B007E1B6RE|5|Went on easy perfect for our Thule luggae carrier.
B002VGC65S|5|Received before shipping estimated date.  Package and stickers were not bent upon arrival.  Included detailed instructions on using/removing.  Accurately described, 6 inches in height.  Great product! Thank you.
B00F2ZPLMA|5|The sensor fit my 02 nissan maxima perfect. This will always be my first stop to get expensive car parts. Saved $218.
B00HNF7MPQ|5|perfect stocking stuffer by two in a throw you a free one
B000E28N7G|4|Got it on time. The price was very competitive.  pretty good filter. I would buy it again. I recommend it
B000F59VNC|3|This unit claims to have an LED flashlight. It does not, or at least mine didn't. A bulb with a filament is not an LED. It's not just a mistake on the Amazon product page, but it also is clearly stated multiple times in the included manual that the flashlight function is LED. If you look closely at the removable flashlight piece in one of the product images, you can see it looks like a standard flashlight bulb. I realize that not many are buying this for the flashlight function, or, at least, they shouldn't be buying it for that, but this mistake is a little concerning for me. It might be chalked up simply to the work of some idiot in the marketing department, but when a company advertises and makes claim that are blatantly false it concerns me with the product as a whole.<br /><br />With that being said, it is currently charging for the first time. Being that I live in Minnesota, dead batteries are a fairly common thing and having a backup for the times you can't get someone to jump your car is a good plan. I've used other portable jump starters in the past and they have been a god-send. I noticed that the warranty is only 6 months, but anything battery related doesn't typically have a long warranty due to the number of things that can go wrong.<br /><br />The other slightly annoying thing about this is that it recommends that you charge it for 24 hours, once a month. I guess I'll have to set up a monthly reminder to recharge it. With such a high capacity battery, it's not real surprising, but worth noting.<br /><br />I'll update my review if and when I need to actually use it.
B000BOKML2|5|Ordered and arrived promptly.Easier to use and more effective that laying pennies near terminals which cannot do with side terminal batteries
B000G6M3VM|5|use it with confidence...nice quality product...keep in glove box because tpm's are always off 3 to 4 pounds.
B00HJXXK9Y|5|This bumper protector is sturdy and does its job! It covers  the corners of the bumpers really well unlike other protectors I’ve tried in the past. Also once installed, it is very securely attached and not flimsy like the ones I’ve had in the past. I don’t have to worry anymore about scratches especially when I see a car parked so close to my car that there is no way that it got in there without bumping my car.
B003Z9YKRM|4|Seals up nice. No water in truck bed. Doesn't fold up all the way. Needs to be removed if you wanted full use of the bed.
B004Y9D0NC|2|I expected this to be more of a neon or hot pink rather than a &#34;baby&#34; pink, so I'm a little disappointed since it didn't look the same as the picture. Still haven't decided if I want to put it on my truck yet, but it seems to be a good quality sticker/decal. Don't know how any of the other colors look but hopefully better than mine.
B0001XPCCM|1|This crap came cracked and it feels cheap.  I want a refund but i would rather just complain since my money will probably be returned cracked like this product did.
B004ME8MZ0|3|Very nice looking, almost can't tell they're not OEM.  However, they're somewhat difficult to install, requiring a fine mix of finesse and brute force.  Thought I was going to break off the plastic tabs or scratch the original mirrors each time I installed or removed them.  I'm sending them back before I do break them.<br /><br />Also, the gimbals behind the mirrors aren't very snug, resulting in quite a bit of vibration in the mirrors.  Not enough to make them unusable, but enough to be annoying.
B005H7DRQA|1|The box showed up cracked and leaking all over the place; It leaked all over my other products I purchased. I am not happy with this product at all.
B00DSD73JM|5|Perfect!!
B00367ILMI|5|My dad loved it I gave it to him for fathers day and he was so happy.
B00JUQFVX6|5|Perfect, great cost very fast shipping helps tremendously with the convience of having all your items organized when on the go
B0042KZ2OI|4|Accurately represented.  covers fine.  Fasteners are a little difficult, however.  I just make my hubby do it!  It is everything it says it is
B003YKYFBS|1|This was purchased for my 2009 F-150 pick up. I went to put it on and it was so cheaply made, it only came with 2 set screws to mount it and there was no support in the middle of the bug shield. It would have just flopped around in the wind.
B00UITC2XQ|5|Love the upgrade to the lights on my car!
B00VWT4WO8|5|Couldn't be better I had a problem with two of the lights not being the color of the other two but that problem vanished also where you connect the lights to the box the little prongs that stick out one of them or couple of them were pushed in but I got needle nose pliers and pull them out they still work to this day perfectly
B0002W2W2K|5|We have used this as the floor to our pavilion for a couple of trips now and it has been great. If something gets spilled on it it goes through and doesn't try to soak back up. Great for putting the air mattresses on and letting the kids play.
B000EQ8DEU|5|Fit perfectly, great price! Muffler measurements were very helpful in assuring the customer a good fit.. I would definitely reccommend this product
B000KKLLX0|5|Easy to install, straight forward, and if you should so happen to for some reason not quite understand something It wouldn't take more than a quick &#34;bing&#34; search to figure out your problem(that's worst case). .. I'll admit I had to do it once but answer was confirmed quickly and install continued smoothly.
B001IH6WJW|5|Its a hitch. And heavy duty. Solid steel.
B00E1SJTUE|5|it worked exactly like we wanted. we will be buying one for the other side soon. Also will be checking the back
B00K1HPIXQ|5|Fit is perfect.
B0087NB0ZQ|5|I'd like to be open and honest from line one - I purchased the pair of these primarily for the bluetooth to phone integration rather than the intercom capabilities. I use this daily on my commute in and out of New York City. I expect only occasional 2 up communications, but I've got the ability when I need it. Prior to this, I've ridden with noise isolating earbuds and my volumes on super low - I listen to music and use my phone GPS when I don't know where I'm heading. I installed in under 10 minutes, hid the wires inside my older Arai Quantum 2 (and later in my Arai XD4). As one would expect - the wind noise and interference is dependent upon how quiet your helmet/screen/bike combination may be). I've taken the occasional phone call while sitting in traffic and aside from honking, it was impossible to tell I was on a bike.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- simple, easy install quickly, slightly more involved to hide all the wires.<br />- easy to operate, audio prompts help with connectivity and menus<br />- large ergonomic controls (not perfectly intuitive but easy to use once mastered)<br />- great audio quality and volume range - it works as well at low speed without earplugs as it does at 75mph with earplugs in<br />- Persistent connections: never once have I lost connection to my phone<br />- excellent battery life both in use and standby - I charge < once per week with a solid 7-10 hours of use<br />- great call quality at speeds below 45 mph ( very helmet specific)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Bulky (its the size of some helmet cams)<br />- Difficult to update firmware if you use a mac (but not impossible)<br />- Probably a phone problem, but occasionally I have to use the Android voice launcher to \\"refocus\\" on my music app so that I can adjust volume or change songs.<br /><br />Overall - I would absolutely recommend this to other riders, and if I lost mine, I'd most probably replace it with the same unit.
B00HUBF47G|5|Everything as stated new and in perfect working order and fit. Thanks
B003AVS9YU|5|This was exactly what I needed when I replaced my Jeep Cherokee leaf springs. Perfect fit, no complaints whatsoever. Good product.
B005OIUQDY|5|I am a woman and had never placed tire chains before, then I drove through the Washington and Oregon mountains during a blizzard. These helped keep the chains snug and in place, and were very easy to apply and to remove.
B00SKEFWWY|5|I got the key blank fast , and it was cut for me on a  key machine for one dollar , it works great.
B001RBQF4G|1|Does not fit scooters well, the net is WAY too big and does nothing to hold items with any security. The helmet you see in the featured item picture definitely flew off seconds after riding away because it's merely loosely perched on the bike due to the large size of the net. I'm sure there are better nets out there, if I were you I'd check the dimensions on other products and find a smaller net. Also the metal hooks are poorly made, will scratch up metal and plastic as their rubberized coating peels right off and the hooks are too sharp and tight in their hooked angle.
B001GJ3E5C|5|pearfect
B004QJTUIE|5|good
B009R1DQF4|5|Nice parts, work well to attach the fender liners on my 2010 Corolla LE
B002K6K3RM|3|These are very good on the low beam but on high they do not put out the light that I was getting with the old pair of mismatched bulbs. Because of this I would say they are good just not real good
B0071L5WJA|5|I am impressed! These really make a huge difference in my 2014 Rubicon. Really cuts down on road noise and even improves the sound of the stock stereo. Two thumbs up!
B002CS96LM|4|excellent product, optimal delivery time
B000CQ6DIU|4|just what I expected
B001U5KFK4|5|I purchased these for my dad since his highlight lenses were some badly oxidized and yellow. We installed with minimal issue: Those issues were only due to Ford's setup. The fit great and my dad can actually see the highway now and is very happy about the purchase
B00KUS5DRM|5|Absolutely love thank you so much
B00FSEU9YK|5|A very easy install and we were able to reverse the covers to blend in with all the other exterior trim pieces.
B003RVT35W|5|It works great !Only took a few minutes to program.Very happy with my remote and I will shop Amazon again.
B00IU2BIEC|4|The tail light is pretty darn good. It's brighter than the stock head light, the options are wonderful and the instructions and installation are easy. The only reason I knock a star is due to the kit not being compatible with other aftermarket light kits. The bike I put this on had another aftermarket kit that was broken, reason I replaced it, and I had to do additional splicing and wiring which I would have liked to have avoided. Wish I could give a 1/2 star cause it truly is a good kit. Recommend it.
B0039KU738|5|I needed to replace my floor mats (after 9 years).  My local BMW dealer wanted my first born child and a pound of flesh. I ordered these online.  They came on time.  They were exactly as advertised.  They fit perfectly...and the price was very reasonable.
B001C6LG3Q|5|Easy to use and works perfectly.  Used it to repair my Honda Ridgeline - blown high side hose from the compressor.  No problems.  I bought it understanding that I might not be able to fix it myself.  Although I was successful in the repair, I would have been happy otherwise because I made the attempt.
B00TG3NWF2|3|Quality product, but somewhat misleading when it says that it is self adhesive.<br />If something is &#34;self-adhesive&#34; no other tools or products should be required.<br />You still must use a mildly soapy water solution and squeegee for application.<br />If you have never applied tinting before, do yourself a big favor, and make a<br />template of the window that you are covering, using paper first; then cut the<br />tint film according to the template.
B00B9FTXM6|5|One of the most accurate tire gauges I have ever used. I ride sport motorcycles and getting to the valve can be a challenge. Not with the offset end. The design of using AAA batteries instead of the harder to get button batteries was great. It's easy to use and very accurate.
B007ASCWR4|5|This goes every where my Harley goes and has come in very handy....
B000IG3QNY|4|Nice addition to my passenger side.
B002P8HIUU|5|I just finished installing this onto our 2005 Ford Focus.  A certain spouse of mine, who shall remain nameless, backed out of the garage and took out the previous mirror.<br />As other reviewers indicate, this mirror does not come with directions.  I looked at a couple online videos to learn the basics on installation.  First off, you do not need to remove the door panel as some videos indicate.  I did it by simply removing the interior cover plate (snaps off), disconnect the wires, unscrew the bolt (be VERY careful not to drop it) behind the wires, then unscrew the screw with a T20 torx screwdriver.  You MUST have the T20 torx screwdriver, so know this in advance.  You'll also need a socket wrench with a 10mm fitting.  I tried using a needle-nose pliers, to no avail.  I ended up borrowing my neighbor's socket wrench set and it worked like a charm.<br />A video I watched actually taped the screw to the 10mm fitting on the socket wrench. This is genius, as it'd be very easy to have that bolt drop behind the door panel - then you'd be screwed.  So overall, get the two tools ready and you're gold.  Gold, Jerry, gold!
B006KDJUGG|3|Not nearly as sturdy as the original hubcaps from my 2006 Sienna CE - but then again not nearly as expensive that OEM.  You get what you pay for and these look exactly like the ones I had on my van but without the Totoya symbol.
B000E8X4ZG|5|This strut is a fine replacement.  All the little doo-dads for the brake line and so on were fine.  Car rides good again.
B005UGF3AG|5|Solid cable, works great for securing my jacket to the bike.
B002RBZMMQ|5|This is a great set for the price. Fits on. My 2004 Dodge Stratus perfectly. Goes along with the theme I the rest of my car. I'm very happy with the purchase
B00ELJD0BW|3|This is the only Viair extension hose I can use with the Viair 88P compressor that I bought. It threads onto the end of the hose that comes with the 88P which is the good news. The bad news is that 6 feet is not enough for my truck so I will need to buy a second 6 ft. hose to get the reach I need to my right rear tire and to the spare tire.
B000BZJK4G|5|Used in my 1987 bmw 325i. Exact replacement part. Fits, what else can I say?
B008BMQYGI|5|Love it
B000FSOZ30|5|At the time, I had a 1994 Pontiac Bonneville with a 3800 engine. Powerful, but not efficient on fuel.<br /><br />So, I took a chance and bought this. Without any other modifications, changes to my car, or changes in driving habits, my fuel economy went up from maybe 300 miles a tank to over 350.<br /><br />Paid for itself in no time.<br /><br />What I've heard from others is that if you already have an efficient car, this won't help. But if you have a bucket (like I did) or just a guzzler then it can help.
B008I2P0KC|1|Maybe I did something wrong, but it sure didn't work for my dark grey Hyundai XG-350
B00FMV0WFA|1|dose not fit the 2014 year
B00PJWAN7E|5|Looks great on my motorcycle
B004RNR9BY|5|For about a year, I have been carrying two 50-foot hoses and one 10-foot hose in my motorhome for connecting to campground water supplies.  I often found that the 10-foot hose would be too short, yet one of my 50-foot hoses would be much too long.  I needed a good in-between length potable water hose that would coil easily but did not kink.  This one fits my needs perfectly.  My experience has shown that most campgrounds have the water outlet within 25-feet of the water connector on my coach, therefore this hose length is the one that I now use most often.<br /><br />The coiled metal strain reliefs at each end of the hose prevent the hose from pinching at the fittings.  Compared with my other drinking water hoses, this one is made of thicker material, making it nearly impossible to kink accidentally.  The thickness also causes the hose to resist being uncoiled when I'm trying to straighten it in cold weather.  Nonetheless, it easily coils back into a neat bundle for easy storage.  Even when I don't use a water filter, this hose does not adversely affect the taste of the water that flows through it.
B006P88TJ0|5|beautiful workmanship...
B005WWI62K|5|absolutely amazing white light.  I would recommend this for anyone with an ATV.  I bought a second set to give to my brother, who was very impressed too.
B000VU56Z8|5|I looked at a lot of bedliners online with cost and rating both being factors.  This liner had great ratings in addition to a great price.  I utilized the free standard shipping and received it in only 3 days!  It fit my 2012 F-150 supercab like a glove and settled right down on the bed (even in the 40 degree weather) easily.  Great buy for a great price!!!
B001IZIFOO|5|Made it through the winter with it did not tear, and this cover had tons of snow.  I love the straps that connect the cover on the underside of the camper.  Also I like that the cover is label front and back.  Access zippers are in perfect place.  This is the first cover that I think we will get a few years out of.
B0006H8BEY|5|Screws are odd tpi, bought quarter by 20 fh ss ( <$2 ), needed to drill and tap hinge. All gud now, need to add small convex mirror and I'll be happy.
B00KBINF7G|5|I have bought about 5 of these for family and friends - very handy for so many items. This has a larger capacity then many similar devices and comes with about every connector I could ever think of.
B001V8U12M|5|best couple bucks you will ever spend. if you already have a cordless drill then you need this then you have electric jacks. even if you had to buy the drill for this socket it is a 1/3 of the price of electric jacks. All the people I camp with are jeleous of it and borrow it from time to time.
B000M8U6RM|3|just what I was looking for
B00WOT3YM6|4|This inflator had been a lifesaver.  It does overheat and will shut off, but let it cool down and it will start back up.  Don't trust the gas station air machines my tires were way underflated.  It comes in a great carry case.  Worth the money!
B000F94HTG|1|The cover its too big for the bike,also its not the material I was expecting,looks and feel like an indoor cover.not happy at all with it.
B0027UMV26|5|Installed this on my John Deere 6x4 Gator a while back.  I can't imagine not having it now! Excellent product.
B002VMP11I|5|I love this sticker, it s still on my car, and it looks awesome. No better way to show your van halen spirit
B00030DLEE|5|I bought these as gifts the boy's loved that they could have hot meals.
B000AXWK1Y|5|This gift was perfect on so many levels.  A Father's Day Gift for my husband from the two youngest grandchildren.  The price was fantastic.  The quality of the sign exceeded my expectations and it arrived faster than I had expected it to as well.  My husband was truly happy with it!!
B00029JC62|3|1st one had a direct short, would not work
B008I22D98|5|Good seller, 100% recomendado!
B00139YMUQ|5|تم شراء هذا المنتج وهو يعمل بكفائة عالية ويتميز بجودة الصنع<br />وصغر الحجم ودقة القياس<br />good good good good<br />GOOD
B00168BJ82|5|Recommended to all drivers for more visibility.
B000EFCPOK|5|Great product!!!
B004MG8X6Q|2|Will not adjust properly lights aren't focusing properly
B003JDLMOI|5|The first shipment got lost in the mail but the second arrived right on time! It was a breeze to program and it operates as it should.
B001FK7KUM|5|Replacement was a breeze, unfortunately it turned out my Camaro had much bigger issues than just replacing out the fuel system parts. But rating this item alone, it worked out well.
B0007RDVH0|5|Spray this on your wheels and tires, wait a few minutes, then spray it off. Shine is incredible. I do still use a wheel brush, but I'm really particular when it comes to my car. Good product, very effective at cleaning tires and wheels. Cuts through the grease and grime.
B005TQN9LM|3|This is a heavy cover that should last the price is high,but does have an elastic band at the bottom. I wish it had a pull cord so it would seal better around the cart and help keep it on better when the cart is loaded on a carrier when I am driving at highway speeds.
B00JMHFK4S|4|NEEDED TO RE HANG THIS PULLEY SHAFT ON THE WRONG SIDE MY MISTAKE
B00I8Y3WWS|5|Awesome and easy product! Took less than 5 minutes!
B003PNSWW2|5|The item was shipped quickly, I received it much faster than initially stated.  No problems thus far and would recommend to anyone to purchase from this vendor
B008I7R6U4|5|A1, Seller.. 10/10..  A++
B00DQ6SIG8|5|Appears to be a well made product. took some time to install, but well worth it. I would recommend it.
B0046I3I8I|3|I bought a spare tire cover and it was the plastic covering with the elastic around it.  This is what i thought i was buying now.  It serves the purpose but not sure it will keep the tires life b/c of how it is made.
B0039ILD42|5|This is the exact OEM Acura part, just in generic packaging. Same manufacturer. Easy to install, MUCH cheaper than the same exact part from Acura. What's not to like?
B003RAVZOA|5|Great product!  Easy to read/use instructions for programming the new remote fob to your vehicle.  Fast shipping.  Fob is brand new, with battery included.  It's like it came straight from the dealership.
B000BQYH6Q|5|works well on cars, not recommended for trucks and can stack together for easier storage. well worth the money great buy.
B00IIRY7W4|5|I absolutely love this item! They are the heavy duty strong rubber not that weak and cheap stuff!
B00MPE8GOQ|4|This distribution post works quite well.My old one started leaking and this is the replacement and I am happy with it. The post gets a lantern 30 inches higher than the propane bottle and the outputs for other hoses, like a stove, are down low, so they will not lever the bottle over as easily as my last post. Because this post allows you to put a lantern on at half the height (15 inches), it will be a little heavier than you are used to, if you have used other distributions posts.
B00HZC4A02|4|Listing indicates approximately 5 x 5, my measurement is exactly<br />4 x 4,  Otherwise satisfactory.
B00NRVCOZS|5|Extremely easy to install. I bought a HID set from another manufacturer before this and I had to splice wires together to get it to work. After that set fell apart within 6 months, I bought Kensun's product and was pleasantly surprised. This particular Kensun set is extremely easy to install although the lights are slightly dimmer than my prevoius 6k set.
B003U684PY|3|This is a nice jacket for a really reasonable price. My only issue is the jacket is cut small. I ordered a Large, but should have gotten an XL... No luck yet in getting it exchanged. Dec 2012
B001GRMLA8|5|It's Weather Tech.
B00BBE7KAM|5|For a scooter rider the New Pro Dynaplug seems to be ideal.  It is made mostly of aluminum and comes as a self-contained kit about the size of a small flashlight.  The directions indicate that repairing a tire puncture is as easy as  inserting the nose of the tool in the puncture to place the plug.  Then withdraw the tool and the puncture is fixed.  Cut off the excess plug and you are done.<br /><br />Light and easy.  Nothing could be better, other than not getting a puncture.<br /><br />George
B00LHNVKTY|5|Good
B00OU0PBY6|3|easy install but the logos fade quick
B0009JB7GI|5|This unit has worked flawlessly, however I did not know there was suppose to be a lighter part that did not come with it for some reason.
B0057903M4|3|ball rusted
B001KS6FPA|4|great works as it should
B0040IIBK4|4|I have used this for one season with no problems. Good quality, and the dump handle system is excellent. Only down side is the time to convert pack and forth to plow. It requires some time to do, but just twice a year.
B003WKMKG2|4|the front seats fit great, the back seat is entirely too big for my wrangler. So I had to make it work and it doesn't look as good as the front, but it serves it purpose
B00DW4YHP0|5|Product was actually used for polar bear enrichment and it holds up very well to the extreme stress test!<br />They love the novel shape, texture, and ability to throw it. But, it holds up rather well to the crushing force!
B002U2E9F8|4|The unit does what they promised it would do. Using it is verry easy,so you will not need the the poor quality manual much. The gauges are not really real time, but that is to be expected, and for me no problem. I used it to reed the fault codes on my mazda tribute. The unit gave me p0305 which is misfire on cilinder 5. After swapping the coils 5 and 6,  and clearing the codes, the unit gave me p0306. This way I was sure that the coil was the problem. I ordered a new one, put it on, and cleared codes (and turning of the check engine light), saved some money doing it myself.
B005KLBVZW|4|works
B00QPK97YE|5|work great
B00B0C1RWM|5|I bought these for my 2011 Honda Odyssey after the OEM rotors warped before 30,000 miles.  Apparently there are many unhappy people with the same problem on this particular vehicle.  I bought this rotor/brake kit after researching drilled and slotted rotors and how they keep 20% cooler than standard rotors.  I received the kit on Wednesday at 3:00 and had the install complete within an hour.  The following day, we left for vacation and had to abruptly stop on Interstate 95 due to congestion.  My van stopped on a dime without any shimmy.  The 2008 Honda Odyssey behind me did not, and wound up rear ending me!  Thank God my family was strapped in and we were sore, but not too seriously injured.  These brakes and rotors did their job!  I couldn't imagine what could have happened if I was the vehicle rear ending the tiny import that stopped in front of me.  They look great and stop great.  Time will tell what steep hills and longevity will do for these, but for now I'm a believer.
B004B7JZ8Q|5|I bought this gift for my Secret Santa (boss) and he loved it.  He's a huge Mississippi fan.
B002JBDH26|3|Saved me a bunch of $$ and we did the repair at home.
B0081B48EY|5|Great stuff man  no fogs  stay away from the fog man..........
B0002UEN1A|5|I use it for all required applications. A friend that builds engines for a living uses it everywhere it can be.  I have never had a failure of this product.
B0018LMSEG|5|I am happy with the purchase, very fast delivery
B005HF2E2K|4|did it's job
B00HTOB0NG|5|WORKS WELL
B00GHT7L1Y|4|Good quality and is OEM replacement for the Door Handle. One problem, although Amazon stated it fit the 2008 BMW E60 550i, the plastic mounting bracket does not fit perfectly in the headliner cubby. The quick fix (because I still wanted it installed) was to dremel off one tab along the mounting bracket probably 1/4&#34;. That made everything fit perfectly.<br /><br />It's only getting 4 stars because it does require some modification on an e60 5 series to fit perfectly.
B00BMDZ1GC|4|the product was great up to the quality I expected is stuck to the car very nicely I would recommend getting these if you have a Crown Victoria Police Interceptor I only rated at 4 though because in the mail one of them came kinda cracked in half I am almost sure it was the post office's fault and they said they would definitely refund it I've just been too Busy to send a picture of the damaged goods but I believe them when they say that I prove it they will send back another just waiting on That Promise before I rate It A 5 but once I know they do I will give it a5
B001NQ9E6Q|5|love the scent. usually dislike and get headaches from heavy artificial chemical cleaners but eco-touch is incredibly pleasant. i love wiping down the interior of my car with it.<br /><br />the only downside is the price. if this product cost a little less, i'd be cleaning my car daily and buying it more frequently.
B000ET9SAK|1|Broke the first time I used it.  The screw cap that holds the plug tools in is made from a relatively soft metal and with very poor tolerances.  The plug tools pull right through the metal cap and out of the T handle.  I wound up using a pair of vice grip pliers instead of the T handle to finish my single repair.   It's a fundamentally flawed product.
B00F8K1L1Y|3|I thought the  reamer tool was way too large, had a hard time getting it into the  tire.  Also thought the plugs were too large.  Even after using the large reamer it was extremely hard to get the plugs into the hole.
B000C5FLFC|5|Perfect OEM replacement for my 2007 F150 4.2l v6
B001C4OBH6|5|I bought this for my 2009 F-150 FX4 SuperCab. The install was pretty easy with the help of watching K&N's install video. The truck gained some mpg and I have yet to notice this whistling sound yet. Installed a magnaflow system and overall gained some Hp & Torque on midrange up, but did lose some on the lower rpm. (Under 2k rm)
B000GV4ZDG|5|These reeds were installed with a Toomey B-1 exhaust, wiseco piston and port job. The Blaster ran way faster after all work was done. I would recommend buying a performance exhaust to accompany the reeds.<br /><br />At one point the stock exhaust was put back on, but the reeds were left in and it was still a noticable difference over the stock Blaster performance.
B00GTXSEKK|5|Fits nice, a little tricky to &#34;hook&#34;, have to take off the O ring thats already on your FOB and use theres. Its nice and regardless it will protect it!!
B003E3Q5AY|2|these were nearly un usable to me - my fingernail works better - what a waste.The Blade bent after 3 minutes use in my project
B001NYNFTU|5|Save your money and replace your own filter. In my experience dealerships and quick lube businesses charge three to four times more to replace air filters. The FRAM filter fits perfectly and works exactly like the OEM Honda filter. It's easy to replace the filter in my 2007 Honda CRV and videos can be found on youtube if you are not knowledgable.
B001UTVVS0|5|Galdly surprised. Pads do not look cheap. Bright colors. Logos are embroided, and are not a mere sticker. Soft yet quite thick fabric. Very easy to install, velcro straps holds well. Protects my neck well from rubbing of the seat-belt. They give an extra classy and sporty touch to the inside of my Audi TT. I'm very happy with this purchase and do not regret it.
B001NXUU9E|1|It was what my boyfriend needed cause he's a volunteer firefighter. Good price for what he could afford. We got it in the summer and didn't use the 30 day return policy cause until it rained or became winter is when we noticed water inside. Was looked at by a fireman who is the best at blue lights. He said in the long run it would get damages. Ended up talking to company that makes it and they sent us rubber for each lens. That didn't help so we spent money and got new lenses. With new lenses and rubber water still got in it and since it was winter it had ice in it. The only solution company gave use was to use silicone but still water got in it. Tried getting information to send back and get refund but they said that if it still works there is nothing they can do. Waist of money and time on phone arguing.
B00CFPRGDM|5|perfect
B00CZAL4O4|5|Good price
B0034NIFAC|3|Received my new jacket within 5 days of shipping. Nice looking heavy jacket. Nice looking liner. Trouble is its about three sizes off. I ordered a XXL and my current jacket is a XL. I returned the jacket and exchange it for a 4xL in order to wear a fleece under it in colder temps. Size chart needs to be revamped. Still, I cant wait for the jacket exchange to go through.
B004FKPAKG|5|used this as edge tape on my paddleboards
B00HJ6TYJ6|5|I love this stuff, its the best for cultured marble & acrylic, a must-have for bath rooms! It cleans & polishes & has a pleasant scent. Buffs to a beautiful shine.  Been using it for years.
B00BC83EDE|5|I bought this to put on my car and didn't want something very large, but something more modest and this was it.  I have not put it on my car yet because I realized just how badly I need a paint job.  I didn't want to put it on there until I have a nicer surface to adhere it to, so I can't yet speak of how it weathers.
B003QV55OQ|5|The dice came sooner than expected and are of good quality for the price. The white ones added a nice personal touch to my white accord.
B0009V4GAK|4|It is ok. Fits well. looks good. Will keep stone chips off of frt bumper. Hope it will last a long time.
B00030DLEE|5|One of the best Item I had ever bought
B000VU91SG|5|Great mat and wonderful fit for our 2014 Ford STX F150.  Lays well in the bed and is heavy enough that there is no way it could blow out.  Custom made for this specific truck.  Holds cargo very well from moving around.
B000FGJSGQ|4|excelentes
B001FIDNGO|3|Works as described, but fell apart after a few days of being installed.
B00967HRW2|2|These are not the same quality as a set I bought a few years ago.  The chrome plating on the pins is very thin.  Both pins are rusting after only a month.
B00TFZNCZG|4|looks good. however the adhesive tape cannot hold it at the end - need to replace it with my own partially.
B00CFQUEYY|5|It is working great so far. The OEM had a plastic impeller; this one is metal. I think that should be a good thing.
B000BYELNC|4|Out of the box this wiper was streaking horribly. During a major rainstorm, I had to stop and try and figure out how to eliminate the streaking. I found out the beam is adjustable, and once I adjusted the beams to their most outward position, the streaking was eliminated. I'm glad I figured this out, because I didn't want to have to return them.
B00FBL2XSA|5|Good product and fast shipping!
B00F73F7BW|5|Great Fit for my leased 2015 Corrola S.
B003V57NUQ|5|Works really well and the price is great!
B000H774BY|1|I purchased the Black & Decker Simple Start a couple of years ago.  This product is a total waste of money.  I charged it once a month and when the time came to start my car it failed miserably.  My advice is don't waste your money on this product.  I am sending it to a recycle location.
B000AY764E|5|Looks good and shows your colors going down the road. Get one for all of you brothers. In Search of More Light.
B00MAG8M66|5|All good
B00CNI1SDA|5|Really does work wonders. I purchased a leather organizer and accidentally used fabric cleaner on it. It had white streaks all over it and looked awful. I bought this and it looks better then new.
B005SEJTUA|5|Very happy.. Royal purple puts enough time to produce a good quality...
B009HB9L80|1|All though the seller claimed it was for a 2013 it was not. contacted Yoshimura they were great. The exchanged it for the correct one at no extra charge. Should have went through them to start with and saved my self a hassel.
B00EW3CO5K|5|perfect
B000E2CVDI|5|I have a large collection of motorcycles and for those that use a K&N, it is the only filter I use. The best. Cheers, Frank
B004UTD82Y|1|Waste of money.  In trying to design a kitchen I needed to utilize the Google Sketch-up link since this software has very inadequate images, but kept getting error messages.  Also had difficulty printing and a bunch if other things.  Not wishing to pay $9.99 for a support call or live chat, I used the online support ticket.  It's been a week and I've had no response.  This is the way it is with all Nova Development software.  I did not realize it was Nova when I bought this or would not have.
B00144D77E|5|This was a perfect replacement for my 1994 Bass boat. Installation was a breeze and the price was great too.
B008FIH17Y|5|This two pack of scrapers is a great value and came in handy during the winter. Having one in each car was very convenient when coming out to find snow or ice on the car in the morning.  They keep your hand fairly warm, very dry, and worked well enough to remove snow and ice from a good sized SUV.
B001DRFJUK|5|I bought this for my 2010 Camry and it looks great! Easy and quick to install. Very satisfied and highly recommend this product!
B00A7WIVNE|3|Overall product was very nice. Had to do some work with the heat gun to get to fit the factory panel, texture is almost 100% match. I'm very pleased with the product and would recommend to everyone who is looking for an auxiliary switch panel.
B001RIBISC|1|You need to pay attention that only 2 screws will work, for your second tag you are forced to buy a second set. They don’t tell you that.
B00480J4J6|5|this worked perfectly for my 2009 prius.
B0051SD36O|5|Comfortable and look great with my Captain Hammer costume. The gloves are supple, while the gauntlet holds it shape. Perfect.<br />And they DO NOT have that horrible plastic/ rubber smell that seems to infect half of the products sold lately.
B00FSC8Y5I|5|Did its job, just as advertised, reasonable price
B000VB8EIS|5|Great for our 2013 Ford Edge, love them!  Perfect fit and made in America, great color match!  They're awesome!  Fabulous
B000EPOG0G|5|AA+
B001KSCF3G|5|Fit as described.
B00UM4BM6U|3|Thick enough & Soft but so rubbery you cant slide in or out. Seat sides come up - they should be much longer. Some odor first week too.
B007DPI0AM|5|Absolutely love it. Came the NEXT day. i live in TX, and it shipped from TX, but it shipped from almost across the WHOLE state! geez.<br />Fits my 2005 GMC sierra 1500 single cab WT. Looks AMAZING. Already Primed black, so no rusting. Comes with lights, brackets bolts, step pads, etc. the whole kit & caboodle.<br />the price is unbeatable, and if you can take off 10 nuts and bolts, you can totally install it yourself.<br />I would HIGHLY recommend this product.
B002MB84ZS|5|They're pretty cheap for the nice product they are. I usually use the smoke lens ones, but they are all worth it, they seem pretty solid and look very durable, at least for now I haven't had any issues.
B004MEO5VK|5|Was impressed with the sturdiness and perfection of this fender. It's rough, tough, and well-made. Has an attractive profile, as well.
B000BQKBP2|5|GOOD QUALITY, WELL MADE, GREAT FOR DRAINING GRAY WATER
B0073WEZU4|5|I see no noticeable difference in reception but I do live in a larger metro area with lots of stations. This looks great and stays out of the way in the garage or car wash. I recommend a tiny bit of blue loctite to avoid this getting loose.
B00GA5977Q|3|Good product
B000MIT5SI|3|When I received this item... the packaging was shredded, crushed and not too mention holes in the box. Speaker plug was broken. I had to rewire the &#34;entire&#34; unit. Center light is ok. Replaced speakers....poor quality. Housing is all that I used from this purchase. In my experience, it was cheaper to fix then return it. Will never buy from them again. I went three star only because I needed this specific speaker container and it has served my needs.
B0006MTRJ2|4|Does it's job.
B00606TIM4|1|First of all I got this at Costco for 13.99 for 3 which is cheaper than 1 stick on Amazon. Good for the time you have a scratch a little too deep to buff just not too deep....when exactly is that?<br /><br />All I know is the package says \\"fast repair for scratches, nicks and dings in your car, bike, boat or other painted surfaces with clear coats. It's easy to get a professional looking repair at a fraction of the cost of traditional auto body shop repair\\". First of all, would anyone really believe that?<br /><br />I decided to give it a try since it was at Costco and one third the price online and I can take it back....which I will...because it's.....WORTHLESS. I basically put clear fingernail polish on my little door ding so now I have a shiny little door ding.
B008BE04C6|5|Love these bulbs. I've been buying them for years, and they're much cheaper on Amazon than at the local auto parts chains.
B005R4MKWA|2|Nice looking head lights, everything works great. The only let down is that the halo lights are LED meaning they are not that bright. You can get the same design but with CCFL halo lights which are much brighter.  The tint on the outside of the light has peeled off. Low beam lights are poor and barely light up the road.
B0002F9YIC|1|The neck of the bottle was broken, when I opened the package the liquid poured on floor and wasted. I want replacement of refund. Thanks.
B0009X8LYK|3|strictly speaking, this paint does not emit any &#34;radiation&#34; (=light), so it has no fluorescence. Well, I kind of knew that, of course, but the paint isn't even particularly strikingly bright or vivid. I used several layers, which makes it better to see, and larger areas (electricity cabinet) works better than smaller areas (gas and water pipes).
B0013AV9B0|5|I was going on a trip from south florida to NC.  I previously had a small coleman plug in cooler, and it lasted 4 yrs.  I know black and decker products are good, so I bought this.  It was an 11 hour drive, and the first thing I noticed is how much quieter this one is vs the coleman.  It kept our drinks really cold and it performed for us the whole trip!!  I would recommend this cooler to anyone!!! You won't be sorry you bought it!!!
B000CINVA6|5|Very useful grease. I used it to lubricate my car's sunroof railing and it does a great job. I've had a hard time trying to get this at local stores so fortunatley i got it on Amazon at a reasonable price.
B007VWYD5S|1|Not as advertised or pictured - received Premium Chain and Bar Oil instead of Winter Chain and Bar Oil.  Replacement order was same - Premium instead of Winter.  I have electric chainsaws that need the lighter winter weight oil.
B00QFEJVG4|5|Fits absolutely perfectly in my 2016 Honda H-RV, and for much less than the Honda branded one.
B00BZAGLG6|5|excellent value for battery, why pay high prices locally for same quality.
B0009YIE14|5|Used in combination with dual hitch receiver and tire carrier on my Jeep commander. Purchased the Rupse 2* White LED Motorcycle, Car License Plate Screw Blot Light to add lights.Taylor Cable 38100 Black Convoluted Tubing, Hopkins 48195 Quick Fix 4Wire Flat (Vehicle And Trailer Ends) and wired to my trailer light outlet. All removable and interchangeable.
B000CNBCB6|5|Was as shown in description and instructions were easy to understand and easy to install.worked great and also fit as described.
B000C7WWRK|5|Very good all excellent thanks
B000EQW2D8|4|Works as advertised.
B00CZEQ8CI|1|I got the LOUD Quad Air Horn Kit Complete w/ 120 Compressor & Tank Combo and was not very happy. I got it the day it was supposed to get here and I then installed it on my truck. putting the compressor in my tool box and putting the horns under the bed of my truck. after drilling all the holes and running the wiring and hoses I was very disappointed. the compressor only fills to 20PSI then turns it self off then turns back on after a few min and then fills the rest of the way up. after it fills all the way up the horns really are not that loud as the description of the product make them seem to be. Also the wiring on the top of the compressor is VERY lose. I'm very unhappy now that I have holes in my bed, floorboard, and dash from running all the wiring. I'm looking to return this product and get my money back. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
B001O0GFY0|5|I used these Gorilla Hub Centric Rings to supplement my Prime 5-Star aftermarket wheels with my Daewoo Lanos. These rings just simply snap in place on the rim and the rim is able to sit dead center on the hub. Super simple and the material they are made of is very tough and light.
B00JJZ2AJG|5|great purchase!
B001Q4OXHU|5|ITEM AS DESCRIBED. THIS WILL WORK WELL USED ON MY POLARIS RANGER. I NEEDED TO BEABLE TO USE A 2 INCH BALL ,A SHACKLE AND VARIOUS OTHER TOWING DEVICES.IT IS GREAT NOT HAVE TO CHANGE THE HITCH EVERY TIME I AM TOWING DIFFERENT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.I WILL ADD I LOOKED FOR A LONG TIME FOR AN ITEM LIKE THIS. MOST OTHERS NEEDED AN ADAPTER AND BY THE TIME YOU PURCHASED EVERY THING YOU NEEDED YOU WOULD HAVE CLOSE TO $100.00 INVESTED.THIS ONE DID WHAT I NEEDED FOR 1/4 THE PRICE OF OTHERS I LOOKED AT. I PLAN TO BUY ONE MORE FOR AN ATV.
B0051NREDC|5|My wife loves it and says it is much more comfortable than the stock pad. Great service also.
B001KOD4ZI|5|I commute really early in the morning. I didn't want my bike to be everyone's new alarm clock. Not wanting to get screaming eagle, I settled on Rush exhaust.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Made in the USA! Very well made.<br />-Fitment is right on.<br />-One of the best sounding exhausts for the Sportster. Really low rumble at low RPMS, but lean and mean in the higher RPMS...real throaty. Really aggressive and not annoying.<br />-Matte black finish is perfect for my bike.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-NONE! If I had to be a stickler I would wish that the 1.75\\" baffle was a bit quieter but it's too awesome to complain about, I love this setup.<br /><br />Application: Stock 2012 Iron 883
B009146R6C|5|Great custom fit at a reasonable price
B00436TULM|5|For long rides and if you are new to riding quads, this will help keep your thumb from getting so sore and tired and feeling like it just fell off. Well worth the purchase. is well designed and easy to put on. I have made many rides into the 50 mile range comfortably with this accessory.
B000NW6XEC|5|This product will fit the 2007-08 NBS Silverado,Tahoe,Suburban,Avalanche,Sierra and Yukon with a 4.8L or a 5.3L V8. If you have a 2009-12 you will need AcDelco 217-3151
B005BNP7Z4|5|This was as good as it gets. Looks awesome from behind. Lights up yellow when lights are on and red when using breaks. I would buy this as a gift and suggest it to friends. Very nice!
B0089XOHYU|5|used this on an old pair of dansko clogs.  Made the leather look flawless again.<br />When I went out in the rain this morning the water beaded up and rolled right off.
B00QRHDIPY|3|Purchased to help maintain a travel trailer battery during the week when not in use. After 4 weeks of use, I've only had one weekend where the battery had charge in it. I've checked for parasitic drain (there is very little) and the battery is less than a year old. Seems like a nice solar charger/maintainer but isn't working for an travel trailer in storage application - maybe I need to go with the 14W version.
B000CODGZU|1|If your toy rubber duck was secured to this latch when a light  breeze came up, all would  be lost!  Pathetic.
B000AXSNVU|5|Very solidly made. Larger than I thought, which is unusual these days. Very brightly colored. Would recommend. Hubs just bought a new ranch tractor (A REAL one not a lawnmower they call a tractor) and will love it.
B00QFY2BCK|5|Amazing product! The foggy haze wiped right off and left a like new shine. Fast shipping too.
B00CZF3YTM|5|Great lights for price! Just as good as anything else u will find!
B009R566T8|4|This filter looks like it was very well made, instructions for installation are very clear. Replacement was easy and saved me a lot of money over having my shop replace this part.
B00280CSF0|5|Good product. A little high on the price side for what you get. Adding the gorilla wrench to that package or maybe lining the security socket with a Teflon product to keep from marring the black finish would make it a better value.
B008CJXQB6|2|It looks cool but leaves a weird beam outline. It's kind of distracting
B00J5THI0C|5|cute
B00G2U0LHY|5|I really like these LED bulbs. They are much brighter than<br />the standard bulbs and will last much longer than the<br />standard bulbs.
B00KXSGJ6S|5|Worked great.
B001I7GNVY|4|Just got them today and they are high quality rubber mats that fits my Honda Accord perfectly.  The delivery was fast as well.  The only bone to pick with this product is that the driver side mat does not cover the upper-right side foot rest area, a feature I prefer to have.
B002LNVBT8|2|I ordered XL because my hands are big; the gloves are nice but to big.  I would order a size smaller.
B000RNWHTM|1|While these are good quality fuses, and the price is good, these are not the mini size currently being used in todays cars. The current mini size is about 1/2 the size of the older ones. Unfortunately these will not fit any of my vehicles.<br />They should not be labelled as MINI.
B00KDKJU2G|5|Very high quality writing instrument. Heavy, we'll balanced, and makes a statement when writing or signing with it. This pen is one people TRY to walk away with, gets compliments almost every day.
B001QT9KO6|1|Did not help at all! I didn't have a heavy vapor trail coming out the tailpipe. It was use as direct by the directions on the bottle.
B00SPRDVTC|1|nothing to stop dry herbs from being sucked up when inhalling.
B001CF3IP6|4|Very good product for great price and fast shipping. I did have one flaw i discovered. The plastic washers they supply you with take away your groung on jeep wranglers causing your brake light/turn signals to malfunction. To fix just remove 1 rubber washer to regain your ground and solve the problem.
B00H22DABK|1|Quit working after a few weeks...didn't work like I thought it would...not happy with performance of this product...not what I thought
B0019CSNNY|5|Great to keep in car to squeegee snow off your car if you happen to be at work when the heavy snow falls. Works in the driveway too. You're fellow drivers will appreciate you cleaning off you car of heavy snow. Have one in each car. Extends far enough to clean the biggest SUVs even the Earth Destroyer 5000 Yukon and Escalade. Also works great for cleaning windows.
B00IN5BU8U|5|Awesome price, fast shipping. Thanks much!!!
B001EOWQ5I|5|Perfect!
B007ZMELII|4|Stretches after a while
B003CY0OPM|4|This cover fits well, is well made and has strong seams, well sewn.  I live in Louisiana so sun protection is the biggest consideration.  I don't expect it to fit like a glove but it does cover the car completely and snuggly. While it is still a little stiff,  is also fairly easy to put on and take off but I would not want to do it on a daily basis or when the cover is wet.  For a large cover, it rolls up to a manageable sized bundle.  Since I have had it only a few months, I can't comment on its durability or longevity which is the sole reason I've rated it as four stars.  On all other factors, I'd give it between four and five.
B00HY8XFQ2|5|Just as if I received it from the dealer! As good as or better than OEM and 1/3 of the cost! Just had to wait 2 weeks for shipping... At first I was like dang, but once I got it put in car wow! I am super happy!  Also gotta get past it being from china but hey it's a German car right ....
B0007IMBK2|1|Smells like pickles and doesn't do  a thing to help  remove water spots..,  Local detail shop  said I will have to use rubbing compound and then  a fresh  coat of wax
B0045V8CKU|5|Saved a lot of money with this product.  Honda wanted twice the amount and seventy five dollars installation.  Easy to install clear install instructions. Total install time 25 minutes.
B00Q3NCUL0|4|i like it but i cant figure out how to use the voice activation mode
B001HY15Z2|1|As I tried to place it on the steering wheel, the internal padding ripped as it was stretched over the steering wheel.
B001RJN56Y|2|IT DIDN'T LAST LONG AT ALL . I ACTUALLY THREW IT AWAY RATHER THAN REFILLING. THE SMELL WENT AWAY AFTER 3 DAYS OR SO.
B002R1AA6Y|4|If your plan is to do a restoration of your Acura, this is not a part to purchase.  If your plan is to replace a broken fog light assembly due to road damage - and do so cost effectively, this is the ticket.<br /><br />I've purchased and replaced both the driver and passenger side.  The precision of the units I received is not up to par with stock but they did both fit and are both functioning.<br /><br />Upon installation of mine, I could readily tell the difference between the fit of these and the fit of the stock assemblies that were replaced.  Since I'm just using mine as a daily beater, these work WONDERS over the broken stock units that were replaced and do so at a cost that is difficult to complain about.<br /><br />The fit isn't perfect but is most certainly good enough - for me.<br /><br />My thanks to the seller for providing these at a rate that makes replacement of a broken stock unit a cost effective option.
B00FG7R0N2|4|is it one of each color 3 feet each or just one 3 feet pipe
B004AIDMGM|1|did'nt come with all parts had to return
B0012ETJ1O|5|Brightest and whitest replacement headlamp bulbs I have found
B00FMV0WFA|5|Fits perfect and very usefull
B000CIGDAG|2|Shame on amazon.  Per their fitment guide, this was supposed to fit my 2003 RAM 2500 with a 48re transmission.  The reality is that the casting rubs on the solenoid mounting, and the valve body preventing it's installation.  However, because I'm stubborn and cheap, I took my die grinder to it, and ground away a substantial amount of the casting to get it to fit (this is about the cheapest aluminum pan with a drain plug you're going to find that, at least, has the right bolt pattern).  I did get it to fit, and didn't actually grind through the casting, but I can't say I'd recommend doing it.  If I had it to do over again, I'd spend the extra $$$ and get a deep pan made specifically for the 48re.  That said it's a good quality piece, looks good, has a drain plug, and probably works fine for a 727.
B00C39D2Y2|4|Very tight fit. Unlike some of the info I found online, I had to remove the intake manifold to install as the fuel lines were in the way and had to be removed to place the hose. You will need to have a silicone hose to connect to the MAF/filter box.<br /><br />The Mishimoto MMHOSE-WRX-AM7RD Red 76mm Silicone Airbox Hose works great with this
B0006M56CY|5|The Mr. Clean rinse products were delivered quickly and they do provide a very-nearly spot free rinse of my white pickup truck and my aluminum Airstream trailer.  The trailer is difficult to remove water spots from once the wash water dries, and this product helps immeasurably as long as the rinse is done before the wash water dries.
B0028MLGK6|3|I have 'Hyundai 2006 Azera'.<br /><br />Bought here after installation O2 sensor to Hyundai dealer.<br />They are charge to $190. If you can self installation. you can save more $190 dollers. GOOD LUCK!
B0007N20GM|5|Easy to instal. Works well and the price is excellent. The responder stays put. I recommended this to my family.
B0044A56KQ|5|I'm very happy with this wheel hub assembly good quality, this is a factory genuine Honda OEM part, the dealership  sells the same brand at a higher price.
B00ULNY8IQ|5|Good quality, easy installation.
B00192JGN0|5|Fits great, just what I was looking for to protect the wheels on my RV
B00715DL8U|5|I have a B&W Turnoverball Gooseneck Hitch and a [[ASIN:B0059929HO Anderson Ultimate 5th Wheel Connection - 3225]]; SuperSprings SSA28 Self-Adjusting Suspension Stabilizer and [[ASIN:B004UR34U2 Timbren FR1504D Suspension Enhancement System]] on rear of my 2013 F150 5.0 4x4 3.73 (6 1/2 bed) (all made in the U.S.A.), I have a Reese Revolution on my 2014 Rockwood 8289. I installed the Anderson Hitch so the coupler is centered with the rear end; I did not install the coupler forward toward to the cab. The SuperSprings and Timbrens are to eliminate squat and the \\"chucking\\".  The SuperSprings were very easy to install, my wife and I installed them in our driveway (30 minutes).  When I am not towing the truck rides ok because the springs do not engage unless there is weight applied.<br /><br />When towing my truck and trailer, everything is level; and because the full load is not being applied to the factory springs I do not have the rear sway (loss of stability).  The maneuvering with turning and parking is easy and more than enough room between the cab and front the 5th wheel. Overall I am very satisfied with the performance of all products.
B001ZTDORG|1|Died after two weeks. Pay for the major brand. It will save you money in the long run. This battery really put me in a bind. My drz is my only transportation.
B0002SQZS6|5|Happy Customer
B0002KKIXC|5|Product maker, Blue Magic, has webb-site with how to use instructions and can picture so I could get top that came off working.<br />Good job with all rug spots - new and old.
B003ZAEUE4|3|Elevates car to good height but a mission to install under tire.  You will need to add at least three 2x4 to floor jack to reach desired height.  Felt dangerous, but I put jack stands and lifted sequentially.
B0040CVXYQ|5|Everything you need!  Always bending breaking these things.
B00IKSJQ04|1|the wrong year was sent to me so it didn't fit on my bike. Had to miss out on a planned trip
B002R0AS4Y|5|This product works as intended, and makes my 1996 k1500 look years newer. I applied niteshade to them, and they look great &#34;smoked out.&#34;  These also serve as a great replacement if your tail lamp circuit board goes out, as they are included along with the lenses.
B006EGAIII|5|Great ramps held up my 2015 Honda Pilot<br />But I still always always always have jack stands and wheel chocks in the mix .
B000C91FB2|2|Not a direct fit for my 06 Jeep Grand Cherokee, The mount bar is facing 90 degrees the wrong way. I found this out only after I had cut the old parts out. So there was no turning back. I had to heat and bend the mount to almost match up with the body mount. Then had to take and leave one bolt out of the body mount so the hanger would match up with the new angle of the pipe mount. I made it work because I was too far into the project to deal with sending it back for the right part.
B00HTP8N0I|4|The work for holding down the handle bars in a place a hook would not fit.
B008WXMMFI|4|Nice quality sticker, just way too small for my envoy :-( I put it on the back of my vehicle and you can't hardly appreciate it.
B001GRQU3W|5|Excellent product as expected. Fortunately, no snow here in Wisconsin at this time to put this floor liner to the test.
B00979QPJK|3|I cannot discredit the shift cover on quality, but your knob best be the minimum size of a tennis ball or larger for this to be of any use. It is BIG! It will not work on standard size shifting knobs unless you first put a tennis ball or something larger over it. I did not think much of the size 2.5\\" dia when ordering. My mistake although they should have written in the description this product is for larger or over-sized shifting knobs.[[ASIN:B00979QPJK Amico Car Vehicle Black Nylon Drawstring Closure Shift Knob Boot Cover]]
B001O03AXY|5|Worked great, quick and easy fix!  So glad I was able to fix my window for less than $40
B0019I5QUG|5|It has an incorrect picture.  It works pretty good, installed it along with a new catalytic converter and it works great.
B00020CB2S|5|Works like it's supposed too.  My car feels solid without the road noise.
B00EN34U9W|5|Quick delivery good saying
B006VENTAM|5|I have a 98 gmc sierra and these things barely fit with a 6 inch lift and 33s because of stock exhaust hangers; but the quality was great and I made it work. I would recomend them
B003AT6EYO|3|We had to return this to get the adjustable mount hitch because this hitch would drag the ground since our vehicle is very low. So the only reason for the lower rating is because it did not work for us.
B005R4L4O0|5|Simply and easy replacement for OEM lights. No special wiring, fits easy, LED lights look great and are super bright.
B004Y9YIU6|5|Used the ights for splash lights around the inside of my boat worked awosome just what I was looking for
B00332GNUI|5|These vents were perfect fit for my  '99 extended cab sierra. There is no wind noise, It only took two minutes to install. I am very happy with this purchase- I wish I would have gotten them a long time ago!
B004I149AY|5|es justamente lo que buscaba, quedo perfecto para  mi automovil. lo recomendaria a otras personas de ser necesario. no hay quejas
B002HBV9FU|5|I have always bought Truck Lite for my OTR trucks .
B00B84IANG|5|Excellent matts, just what I needed for the new England Winters.  I have a nice set of carpeted GTI mats for the Warmer months, but after an early snowfall it was clear they wouldn't make it through the winter.  These are great still look good, but trap all the wet sandy/salty mess.  Doesn't interfere with the pedals or anything and fit the stock snaps in the floor perfectly.
B00SKA1FJW|5|Excellent quality and literally a 10-minute install on my '06 FZ1. I like the ability to disable the running lights and just have them as turn signals. Well done! I would buy again in a second.
B00F58N6N0|5|They fit great and look Awesome
B00BITHB22|4|Wish clip would have come with fuel door lock assembly. Doors work great but having issues with ignition
B00DJEDGVY|3|You are basically forced to use their license plate holder with their marketing on it otherwise the blinkers will not be square flush. There are a ton of different ways I would of positioned the brackets that would of made sense.
B00IH01HSY|5|PERFECT
B002CMXKCO|5|The light fit like it was supposed to.  I saved over 150$ just by buying it and installing it myself which was not a problem.  Glad I found this product because I was definitely not trying to pay someone to put a light on my car.
B00JR33MYW|3|No mounting instructions or hardware.  This may work for a year or two.
B004MTTGZU|5|Solid knife, I used it both in Antarctica and in Iraq. Never let me down.
B00E4D74KI|4|Snug and cool looking but hurts alittle behind the ears.  Glasses sit real close to the face to the point my eyelashes actually rub on the lenses.  Good for riding tho,.
B000KKVZUY|4|Arrived ok and is wirking, but is a lot shorter than stated, meaning I need to circulate the fluid in my brewing vessel to heat it evenly.
B001EMTQMQ|1|its a carpet.  Thought it was a tailgate protector
B0031GJFCY|5|I was a bit wary purchasing this item online, but my concerns were unfounded.  This hose is not easy to replace, even though I have years of working on automobiles/motorcycles.<br />I was very pleased that the hose fit exactly and didn't have any leaks.<br />RECOMMEND HIGHLY!
B003POLA84|4|I used this clay to pre clean my 38 foot fifth wheel before applying the one step sealant. It was surprisingly easy to do and went quite fast. And the surface following this treatment was very smooth and clean. This was much easier that I thought since I has not done any clay work before.
B000CAW4JI|5|These brake shoes fit my 1974 Toyota Land Cruiser rear brakes without problems. According to Beck Arnley, the front and rear setups are identical, so these shoes will also work for the front. They are directional, so be aware how the previous shoes come off and replace as necessary. The box comes with 4 shoes since each wheel requires 2 shoes. They fit the first time and my truck is now stopping properly without noises.
B000WJ75Q6|5|Was very secure and fits lots of gear.  Once strapped down didn't move at all on a recent 18 hour ride through some very twisty and rough roads.
B000QGOPO0|5|I bought this speaker for my 2001 Gmc Sierra C3 and it is a direct fit and works and sounds good. Takes 15 mins or less to change, just google how to take the door panel off and watch the video if you don't already know.
B00B1AKDXM|1|Poor fit, triggers auto-reverse on the the driver's window, and one rear visor fell off within a month.
B001JT37VK|1|Break extremely easy. just driving down the highway and they snapped right off. save yourself the headache and buy firestik instead.
B00681BE2S|5|Worked perfectly and took literally two minutes to program!
B007ZHU5QA|5|So easy to install. Make sure you pick up a nice punch before trying to install or you will come up on a dirty cut and it won't sit straight. You'll have a lazy light beaming off in the distance. Use superglue also. Works the best.
B0089XOHYU|5|It does exactly as it says--it protects and restores your leather.  It will darken lighter-colored leather, buyer beware.  Very easy to use, quick set time.
B007A0HBEQ|5|Absolutely adorable. Was planning on spending $6 on this small keychain but, luckily found this buyer.
B0049BTH5A|5|love it resolve a problem we were aware of
B00KSZ5F5C|5|Can't beat it for the price.
B004HJAS7K|2|Say if your having troubles and their too big try Meijers they may have them. got mine from their and it fit! fit well too and it was cheaper! Was a hassol to get on but we got it to fit.
B000GBBP20|5|Perfect fit and took only 10 minutes to install on my 2002 Tahoe.
B005149YXE|3|Fit perfectly. At 1/3 of the cost of an entire Kuryakyn set, I wish I could have found it somewhere cheaper.
B00068WNZG|5|Great product and price, will be ordering more!!
B0047D2FWM|4|I've used the jack 4 times since it arrived. The light weight is very easy to use.<br />I'm 67, the jack I've used for 27 years was a 98 lb. steel jack. when it blew a seal<br />I replaced it. I wanted to have a new quicker pump jack. The ALJ3T fills the bill.<br />The price was high for me, but now I also have some \\"Garage Art\\". The jack looks<br />very good. I do enjoy using the Arcan ALJ3T. The rubber pad in the saddle is useless, so I made a new one from 2 layers from an 18 wheeler mud flap.
B002FY2MKK|5|But It will make it work, we wil see aftder this accident I recently was in.  (smashed my headlight to smitherines!)  I like it
B000GZLEZ4|4|These covers are very well made of durable material compared to other similarly constructed covers I have used.  Only time will tell the UV resistance but as thick as these covers are, a little deterioration on the outside should not immediately lead to tears as I have seen before.    I am, however, a little displeased with the slightly deceptive description pertaining to the \\"venting system to reduce the harmful buildup of trapped condensation\\".  I suppose it does have a system, but not as I envisioned.  I imagined high-point vents made like a hood scoop (though purely of my imagination, not from any picture); instead the material itself is porous enough to let air and vapor through.  This is also a detractor since this more easily allows water in.  If the cover is not drawn completely tight or otherwise has any sort of dip in it allowing water to build up, the water (and dissolved tree sap) will drip right through to the ATV.  This is not a major issue with a plastic ATV body that isn't pristine anyway, but still a disappointment.    I would recommend this product to a friend after fully explaining the perks and down sides to this product.
B002KMRWG6|5|Well made mat. I've been using it for a season now and it still looks great.<br />Recommended for out door mat under the canopy.
B001ADR6M6|4|This old style oil can is made from high quality materials. The advertisement is a bit confusing as to exactly how large it was. I wanted a much smaller one, however I will keep it as I'm sure Im will use it. Good value.
B004VXJFG2|4|Very functional and well made. Goes great in the back of our Overland and we can get most of the shopping in it. Just pick the whole thing up and carry it inside. Too easy.
B005ZIBWSG|4|Looks Good.
B001DZWXTW|2|I bought this hoping to keep my car just a little cooler while sitting in front of my house on those 90-100 degree days that my area has been having. I figured I didn't need anything expensive to keep the sun out. However, where these guys cut costs is the only place where you wouldn't want them too. There are no ridges and nothing able to grip the windshield so the shade just falls flat in the car no matter how you place it. I ended up throwing it away because it did pretty much nothing to block the sun unless I taped it to the A pillars. No thanks.
B009OBVY06|3|The pad is great, it fits perfectly on the DA Power system and it spreads evenly on the car with minimal effort. My gripe comes from the packaging.<br /><br />When you buy the DA system, it comes with a polising pad but no waxing pad. Why? Who knows, but what that forces you is to buy the waxing pad. When I searched Amazon for the waxing pads, it retured this &#34;Power Pack&#34; that has one pad and a little bottle of wax. I didnt need the wax as I have my own, but needed the pad.<br /><br />Later after my order was delivered and I examined the packaging on the DA system and Power Pack, I saw that I could have just bought two pads instead of the one with wax. That is how they should market it when you search cause I feel I just paid double for the single pad as I have other carnuba wax I apply to the vehicles.<br /><br />If this would have come with the DA system, then it would be a 5 star like the system, but since it feels like a money grab by not being complete, I can only give it 3 stars
B0002UEMZ2|4|I use this in applications where I can't use a nylock nut.  I, generally, prefer not to use lock washers so this is a good alternative for some instances.  It takes a small amount & is quite this to 'wick' into the threads during assembly.  Will take a short while to &#34;cure&#34; so don't install & quickly remove to see if it worked.  For small machine screws & bolts up to ~ 3/4&#34; in diameter.
B007Z4XFR4|5|Lookin great in my 05 Civic
B001KQCBWS|5|awesome product...fits perfectly and great for the price
B00CMMVUOO|5|Excellent
B0002SRF4O|4|This spark plug thread repair kit worked great, but I wish it included:<br />1) tapping lubricant<br />2) high temperature silicone caulk<br />Both are required for a proper repair, and are listed in the instructions.  Just be prepared to have to purchase those separately.
B00FIG8Q52|1|Ordered this for my husband to put on his 4 wheeler but it would not stick. Nice sticker but not much good if you can't use it.
B00KGIE0F2|5|Exactly what we wanted.  Great price!
B00F05K0LY|3|Served its purpose for 8 months then it broke
B0066KPYTK|5|Good
B00BTSG006|5|perfect and it got here fast
B000JFHNEC|4|Used them already and they work perfect.
B00ATXEPQI|5|This is the best piece of eequipment I ever had.  My daughter, my two grandaughters and myself all made use of this in the car while traveling on vacation for a week.  We had far to much tech equipment with us and this inverter handled it all.  Absolutely no complaints.
B000V2W0GE|1|This was recommended with the 12v marine pump, but it's 1/2 screw pipe, so will not connect directly to pump. Need reduce connection to use. Shouldn't be a recommended add on!
B00CMUD8E6|5|Exactly what I needed. I thought since I did not use the Air Condition often in my Honda I wouldn't have to change this filter, but when I did, wow... It was dirty. And thankfully Amazon had this readily available because Honda wanted nearly $90 to install it, and it took me less than 5 minutes.<br /><br />Definitely recommended. My vehicle is a 2013 Honda Civic Si.
B000AY4NZO|5|The blue is a bit lighter than the Scottish flag, but I knew that going in. I wish they'd upload a better photo of the plate so that we could see it better before buying it.
B006QH560A|5|This has been the best battery by far Purchased this battery for my 2004 Honda Pilot back in January 2009. The battery is still working awesome........and its been 6 years last Month. This is what most people do not follow and why MANY BATTERIES DO NOT LAST  There is a secret to making automobile batteries last. The secret is to turn off all the electronic stuff in your car before shutting off the engine. The battery is only used to start the engine. Once the engine is running the battery does nothing. So if you turn off the radio, wipers, HVAC and heated seats, then when you're starting the engine the battery only has to start the engine and not everything else too. The less energy the battery has to expend, the longer it will last. So when you shut off your car and the lights stay on for 30 sec -1 min power you are using is straight from the battery. Same goes for Seat warmers, phone chargers, dome lights & radios. When the car is not running and you put the key in the ignition and turn it to accessory THIS IS A DIRECT BATTERY PULL which lowers the power to start your car. Thanks C.W.
B00NMUYTVG|5|good quality keychain. great image.
B00062YIDM|5|It's fashionable to have a K&N Filter.  I don't know if it does what is purported, and I have no way of proving it doesn't.  Ergo, I can at least rest easily knowing I am trying to give my 460 BB Ford the air it needs.  I honestly can't discern any change in performance or gas mileage.
B00480BWCI|1|Used them first time both as leveling blocks under the tires of my fifth wheel and under the landing gear. They deformed in both applications but more so under the wheels. Would not recommend them for larger RVs. Maybe okay for smaller, light weight rigs.
B002JATYOC|5|The best price ever and best things
B0002U2V1E|5|Go back and forth from Nevada to Washington each year. Have had this 3 years now and love it..holds so much and is easy to load and unload and then fold to put into storage until the next trip.
B005XK39LY|2|I had problems with the size...too small, un-fortunatelly I removed the tickets (trusting in the brand and in the size)...Now I can't returned the item.  Order one full size bigger.
B00DMM9UC2|5|Fits perfectly on my 2007 jeep liberty. I like the fact that you lock the bars on to your rack. Looks nice.
B000VAW6JW|2|Sorry to say but I'm not to happy with it. They did not fit correctly and the tabs to hold them in place we're not set correctly.
B002RTTJNG|5|I chose these straps because they were the right size and they were not a garish neon color. Camo fits that bill.<br />The straps work well for my purpose although the webbing might be on the thin side for those needing heavy duty straps to cinch down a heavy load. Don't exceed the strap's weight load rating.
B0064FDLYM|5|Just like described
B0024NSLMA|5|Very good
B004IQMR8U|5|been looking around for a set of these for a while, I never thought I would need these because I've always gotten axles out before, Then I had a run of ones that were anything but easy. If I had these tools it would have gone so much more easily. Searched them out and amazon provided me with the best option and price
B0009IK5T4|4|After trying a couple different non-OEM wipers we tried this Anco series of blades and have been using them ever since.  We are supposed to have rain every day over the next week so I will see whether this new wiper performs as well as the past wipers have.
B007V2CPWG|5|works fine with no problems. Very well built and heavy duty. Worth the extra price over cheap knock offs.
B008HZK95Q|5|Indeed quiet. Smooth braking.
B001EMSPW8|3|I wish the holes were a bit deeper. also console wouldn't stay closed after i put it in, but just put some velcro on there to fix that! all in all it's better then nothing
B0001DRHFM|5|I don't know why I didn't purchase these years ago. I use them for fishing. They keep my clothes clean and keep the water and rain off me. Excellent product.
B005GHB5U6|1|this smells likes chemicals so bad i cant even wear it my brother calls it the barf bag lol
B002MB4FV0|3|I have always tried to use genuine Honda parts when I replace or repair anything on my 2004 Accord. In this case the OEM Honda headlight replacements were around $300 a piece. So for the money I took a gamble and bought two of these Depo replacement headlights for both sides. I know these were a bargain compared to OEM Honda but the old saying stands true you get what you pay for. Finish was fair, fit was not very good, the passenger side did not line up well at all.  These replacement headlights were manufactured in Taiwan. Clearly Japanese Honda quality is far superior to the Depo Taiwanese copy at least in my opinion. I do not anticipate keeping this car much longer so that is why I went the cheaper route. I gave this product 3 stars because of price in comparison to OEM. If I were rating this product for quality and fitment it would be a 2 star.
B00K85EL9I|3|So far I have installed probably 8-10 of these between 3 vehicles. Overall these are longer than OEM so there were a few fitment issues. I had to trim some housings/connectors to get them to fit. Failure rate on the LEDs is probably 1/4 so if you are ordering 20 about 15 will actually work. Electrical connection is just a single filament wire so making contact is kinda tricky. If a bulb does not come on immediately rotate 180 degrees or reposition wire on housing. I'm not really complaining considering the price but I did want people to know what to expect.<br /><br />When they do work they are awesome. They throw a ton of clean, crisp light. Makes you wonder why all OEM lights aren't LED.
B004ZF3A94|5|Great product. No issues
B0042OX8VS|5|Amazon auto said it does not fit my 2001 Camry V6 LE. But it does. In toyota manual, It will fit VSV for pressure switching valve which is sited next to canister
B00GEV8Y6G|5|Girlfriend wanted this and loves it; worked excellent on our run when it was -6 out
B002GTPE2C|3|nice for the money.. just be patient installing cables on connectors....fast shipper....good customer service! would purchase from company again!...........one two three
B000E7YPA0|1|Look at the picture.You can clearly count 8 items and the discription says 8 piece and all you get is 1 container with 8 bungies in it.Every time I've ordered something on Amazon, what the picture showed is what I got. I'm not a happy camper with this at alhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7YPA0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titlel.Hope you make it right.
B001TAL9NC|4|I received it in a perfect package even it arrived a little late than it said first time since the crazy weather. I sent e-mail to follow up and got fast reply with good advised. I will recommend it to my friends.
B001O0XKR0|5|great product
B00G186POK|5|Awesome lights perfect fit in an 08 pilot. great color great output. will buy again
B00C3MLHPK|1|These lights are nothing but the cheapest smd I have ever dealt with. I ordered a set and BOTH lights were faulty upon arrival!
B002SJ532G|3|I received exactly what I ordered. The shipping was ok. Functions as advertised. However the cargo light l.e.d.s are very dim. Good luck being able to see anything in your truck bed at night. Impressed that it did include a weather gasket, and that it actually fit the truck properly however.
B00378Q9WK|5|This turned out to be a very nice gauge. Good looking, but most of all accurate. I installed a fuel pressure regulator calibrated at 3.5psi - exactly what this gauge read!
B000KIP53O|5|Superb its been three years and the cover is in excellent shape
B0007TQW5G|5|As stated.
B004VIA0KM|4|I have yet to encounter a problem with the zipper, it's very sturdy I did however have to buy an extra large even though I'm a medium but it fits well at extra large.
B0070WAVNC|5|I purchased this intake about 2 months ago, and it does exactly what it says it does.  Keep in mind, it is after market...  so yes you may have to tweak it here or there.  But how for dollar, it's hard to beat.  Look at it this way,  if the installation video looks confusing,  maybe you shouldn't try to install it yourself.  Great product, hp claims are correct.
B0076MBL0S|5|Great
B004ZF31PC|5|Installed on my 2006 Honda CBR600rr. Had to modify a &#34;spacer&#34; on my stock headlight housing so everything would fit, I watched a video on YouTube and it worked out perfectly. Lights are bright, clean, they look great and triple my nighttime visability. 10/10 would buy again.
B00N36OP7W|5|I heard about this product from a friend in Toronto, Canada...and I didn't believe his description.  I was telling my wife what he said, and she said we should buy one and try it out.  So this thing comes in the mail, and I thought we got ripped off.  Imagine an iPhone's length and height, but twice as thick.  This thing is supposed to start a car with a dead battery?  BS!<br /><br />I read the manual, charged it as recommended, and went outside during a snowstorm to try it out.<br /><br />I own a 1987 Toyota Land Crusier with a carbureted 4.2L 2F engine in it (with a manual choke).  The summer heat had fried my battery, and it had sat for six months outside.  I hooked the PowerAll up to the battery cables (I had pulled the battery out and attempted to charge it), and jumped in the front seat.  I pulled the choke out, pumped the gas three times, and turned the key.<br /><br />The old Cruiser started to turn over slowly at first, but wouldn't start.  I turned the key again and it seemed it was getting more power, but still it turned slower than usual.  Third key turn, and it roared like it had a normal battery in it, and it fired up.  I ran outside the car and quickly disconnected the PowerAll.<br /><br />Granted, the little PowerAll cables were hot, but damn!  If anyone here knows anything about Toyota 2F engines, you know....that is amazing!<br /><br />I was floored.<br /><br />Since, I've taken this little gem to work and started several people's cars, including a big diesel truck.  Everyone I've shown this thing to has bought one.
B00AC5O3DI|5|I work on cars on the weekends and this is the third Precise pump i have bought and in all honesty i will never buy another Airtex or Carter pump if I can find an Precise alternative. They are missing some applications but the one's they have are great, I just wish the coverage was better. Bottom line, great pump if you can get them.
B000BUOSGG|4|Works like a charm in our Aliner Classic.  I use it and and am very excited to have a small unit to use in our tight quarters.  I give it a four only because, I have to put a towel under it as the area is so small, I can not place the drain hole over the sink and not have it tipping away from draining.  Not a big deal, though.  I just put a towel under the entire unit in case some water were to leak out.  I love this unit and, highly, recommend it for people with tight spaces in their kitchen RV area.
B00JBIADXQ|5|great fit looks sweet
B009DJEPPK|5|After having it Dynoed and tuned, it is a different bike. To get the 12hp gain I also added a K&N filter and a full system Yoshimura exhaust. Not only is my bike more powerful, the way the power is delivered is flawlessly smooth. Massive torque at nearly all rpm ranges. Really comes alive at 9k. From 10k to reclined, HOLD ON TIGHT.
B001T9AFBK|1|it gave my tires minimal shine & did not last at all.
B000ALG86E|1|The cover worked fine for barely three months.  Then a huge area that covers the hood started to fall apart.  The material looked threadbare. Big rips appeared, leading to even bigger rips. I sent photos showing the pathetic rips and threadbare material to the seller.  He was willing to send me a replacement, but would charge me a hefty shipping fee.  Surely I wouldn't waste even more money on a piece of junk.  Very bad experience, no saving grace whatsoever.
B004O9WC18|5|It is a great addition.  Heavy rubber construction give you durability.  Now, I don't care what I put in my JGC's trunk... this liner can handle it all!  Perfect fit!
B005DZL560|5|I have had this set for six months.  I am so pleased, I just purchase sets for two more of my cars.  All three sets fit perfectly, clean up easy, and look good.  I was hesitant putting rubber/plastic on the floors but they look good and there's no grabbing of your shoes.  Every nook is covered.  Great investment to save the original carpeting.
B001CUAYC6|4|Great starter kit for pin striping as it has the basic colors one would use to get started or add to their collection
B001B1K35Y|5|I have a 97' FXSTC and I love it. One problem was NO BAGS. I have gotten a decent set of saddles, But could not carry enough to really travel. Found this bag and bought it. I am away from my bike for two years, But I know this will be great on it for my runns to STURGIS and LAUGHLIN, And even maybe a coast to coast trip. Plenty of room to stuff it full and with all the extra pockets I know everything will fit. Has extra straps to tie it to the bike and can be used as a rucksack or backpack WITH NO ISSUES. Its GREAT!! CAN'T WAIT TO USE IT ON MY BIKE. I use it as a Backpack while I am here and It is AMAZING!!!
B003CJ927I|5|because it works okay when i use it to maintain a charge in the battery so it will start when i want
B0018S1XRC|1|Placed on roll cage and began to tighten velcro straps. First one tore apart at the stitching. I know I was not pulling hard. Ususally Rugged Ridge is good quality, I have many products. This was a MAJOR disappointment. Would not recommend at all.
B00DSD7UC2|5|Nice size.  Takes me back to the early years when the SUV I'm driving now would have been a van all tricked out in the back.  Get a number of thumbs-up from other old-timers.  Good quality, and easy to install.
B0009N0W38|3|Not that they're a bad product but these reflectors did not work for me way too small.
B000EA5WLS|1|I tried this product on 3 different problems on two different cars.  Two of the problems did not show any difference and the third actually was worse after trying it.  The third, a minor crack .25\\" grew to about .75\\" during the process.
B00DZKCXD4|5|I PURCHASED THEM FOR A SKID STEER, THEY WORK GREAT, VERY BRIGHT, NICE ALUMINUM HOUSINGS, STAINLESS HARDWARE . I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE IN A HEARTBEAT .
B004BCA9B8|2|Don't get this if you need to test the circuit on a car with advanced electronics.  Would not work on my Audi Q7 as Audi (and I suspect other advanced German cars) do not output an &#34;always-on&#34; circuit of high enough amperage.<br /><br />This is strictly for pick-up trucks with simple electrical systems... and maybe that makes it just fine for you!
B0067ED49C|5|I have used this filter before.  It is a worthy replacement for the Toyota brand filter and priced well on Amazon with &#34;free&#34; shipping.
B000JJOGMA|1|I sent the item back to you twice and i explained the problem, i gave up ordered from another dealer. the problem:it had openings for speakers, the 1996 does not have speakers in the dash.
B002VVNXCI|5|Installing these mufflers on any Harley is a breeze, except for the Triglide, due to the design of the Tglide itself.<br /><br />Locate suitable ramps a minimum of about 6&#34;high and have a 1/4&#34; drive ratchet socket set for the mounting bolts at the rear of the mufflers under the trunk.  The trunk minimizes the amount of room you have to work on the muffler's rear mounting bolts.  To make things a little easier removing and tightening those rear bolts, have the front muffler clamp 9/16 mounting clamp nut already loose (using a 3/8&#34; or 1/2&#34; drive ratchet) enough that the rear mounting bolts can slide a bit in their slots when loosened.  Twisting and sliding the muffler forward slightly will give you just enough room to work on the rear mounting bolt with a little extra space.  You may not have to slide the muffle backward to get enough room  to access the front bolt, but you can if you want.  Do the same for the other muffler.  Be sure to put never- seize inside the muffler before installation.  As good as these pipes sound, Uncle could force us to go back to stock one day.  Make it easy on yourself.  Yer gonna like these pipes.  Phu Cat, 69,  Binh Dinh,  II Corp  Freedom has a flavor the protected will never know!
B00V56U28I|5|I am very happy with the Pure-O Ionic Car Air Purifier I recently purchased from Amazon.  I have tried several different solutions to remove the stale air from my car and this item is the solution I have been searching for.  After I received it I immediately plugged it in, and in a matter of minutes there was a noticeable difference.  I don't smoke but like most people I am in my car several hours per day.  Meaning I eat at least one meal a day in my car and sometimes more and sometimes I don't always remove the garbage every day.  This beat the other devices I have tried including hanging refreshers as well.  I highly recommend this device.
B0002SREAY|3|Ok for basic/occasional work, but I ended up replacing it with the OTC harmonic balancer removal/installer tool a year later.
B000E2ALJ4|5|the K&N filter gave me a nice little boost in HP on my Honda vtx 1300.  very nice product too
B00KVC78RU|5|very nice for my dash lights a lot brighter than my original bulbs
B000PDIBF8|4|The treaded metal end will only fit larger size lower unit fill holes.  It did not work for my little 1975 7.5hp Mercury.  I'm sure that you can find an adapter for it online somewhere, but I looked...it was a hassle.  I bought a hose connecter from an auto parts store, clamped the end, and it worked great.  For the money I could have used my $10 O'rielly (or other auto parts store) pump that is the same thing, and comes with a pick up hose for gallon size jugs also, not just quarts.
B0041RPGQ6|5|Bought mine in 2013 and is still awesome.
B004SSEF56|5|It's Jeep enough said!
B002R0QTLA|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00I9JC3N6|3|Fits in my Ranger cup holder OK.
B0016LE80K|5|No complaints
B0028093L2|1|I bought these for my Honda Prelude but really not impressed, in fact I expect they are \\"seconds\\" and both have come from different castings/manufactures. Most EBC rotors are made in UK but these do not have the \\"Made in UK\\" stamped on the edge so they come from somewhere else, have different stamping and production dates. One of them has a very large machining groove along the edge to balance out the rotor which doesn't inspire confidence in it, the other one looks like it's not even finished off properly, has a really(!) sharp edge on the rotor face where they stopped the surfacing process 11mm before it got to the rotor hat/edge. Then I measured it and it was 22.73mm thick when the manufactured specification is 23mm. In my opinion this is a significant amount for a low tolerance important brake item and it means that if fitted to the car the wear on each side would never be even, could lead to problems later on.  I tried to return them but since I'm in Australia the return postage would have been more than the initial price & postage combined (Australia is a rip-off which is why i was buying from the US in the first place). Now In Amazons defense after some discussion with the on-line representative they did refund me the entire amount (initially offered $25) and said to keep them, so I'm happy about that but even so I won't be fitting these to my car.
B004JB4OQM|5|What better than putting the top down and listening to your favorite jams loud and music notes all over the car...yessss.
B00NB57WFW|5|They fit great and look great couldn't be happier with them
B00KGIDI8M|5|This is a great value for the money. Chrome is decent and alternator works just fine. At idle of 750 rpm, the output is about 13.6v going up to 14.6 at 1500 rpm. Only negative I could find are some pry marks at the case halves, probably from someone prying the case apart before it was chromed. It bolted up in place of my old externally regulated alternator with no problems. Price is really good for a chrome single-wire alternator with no core charge.
B00B51X8WU|5|Super nice and fast shipping
B000H6P55W|5|We used this cargo bag on a trip to Yellowstone.  Great item!  Worked fine and will use it again.  Straps work well and has a zipper that goes around three sides.  Easy to use!
B0002UEPVI|5|as you would think it is as described. Gaskets to sealant all love love it.
B008E7GBK4|5|This was a perfect fit on my 13 year old Acura and it really spiffed up the appearance.  The original headlights were very hazy and after two different attempts at restoration I threw in the towel and replaced them with these.  Car looks like new and the cost was very reasonable compared to genuine Acura OEM assemblies.
B004EGZU42|5|Will this fit a 90' caprice with 305 motor?
B00HQZASRW|5|Made a really big difference in our Micro Minnie over a plain vent.  Comes with a full set of screws.  Instructions are poor but you should be able to figure it out, fits existing vents openings without cutting your RV.  You will need to get some butyl tape and RV sealant to complete the install.
B000XEBI9K|5|I use these on all of my work vehicles. It is piece of mind in the city and also I use them to hang signs of off.  They are very sturdy and well built.  The quality is a refreshing change from other products ordered &#34;blind&#34;.  The universal mount works well and you can use this device on other cars.  I recommend the Gold Edition and would spend the money for the best edition available..
B002L6LFPA|5|Like other Chrysler T&C owners have complained about, my 2009 T&C has 60k on it now and I have had the factory rotors turned three times at the local brake shop.  Like clockwork, the OEM rotors would start grinding with 18k on them, then the shimmy and pulsating came about 19k.<br /><br />Frustrated and not wanting to gamble on the quality of the rotors and pads that the local brake “no way” would use, I decided to research and buy name brand parts and put them on myself.  I purchased the Raybestos Rotors and ceramic pads and spent 3 hours on a Saturday morning putting them on my van.<br /><br />After a week of driving, I can say without hesitation, these brake better than the original OEM parts.  Hopefully, 20k miles will come and go without issue, but I will need to wait and see.<br /><br />For less than the cost quoted at the local shop, I put name brand parts on my van and could not be happier.
B007BLMVPS|5|Worked good.
B001JK44LG|5|Worked very well better than expected lot better tha  heli coil will use this product again but I hope I won't have to
B000JILNAY|5|Item delivered on time, was as described
B004PC5CXO|5|perfect!
B0033BZFM6|5|Great item. Mine came with the corner broken off though. Doesn't effect the lights though. Didn't have time to pay and send back, neede it for a inspection sticker.
B0058DPO7S|5|Worked perfect
B004IARFA6|1|After installation and datalogging with an ODB tool, the airflow is lower than with the stock airbox. It produces a weird humming/popping sound under wide open throttle. I reinstall the stock airbox ans will sale this item.
B0002SR29C|5|Seems like it will hold up.
B00IX4CMM4|1|Recived my wind fire on December 1 .2015 Worked fine till 3 months ,One of my wind fire stoped working and it's dosnt project anymore, how can i use my warranty!? Who do i contact!? Plz help
B00CRR5KXG|4|Didn't know I had to do some wire cutting and soldering, but other than that it is working great. Unfortunately I paid for next day shipping and it never made it to my location until 3 days later which cost me money.
B005GRF570|5|looks great on the truck
B0012TNKRS|5|Easy to assemble.
B006JBI2AY|5|It was great
B001INN5HI|5|Got it for my girlfriend for christmas. She loves the show firefly. She absolutley loved the graphic and it looks very good.
B000PEY52U|5|Excellent product.
B00SAFQ0DI|5|These lights are very high quality and very affordable. More importantly, they look great in my car. These lights are about three times brighter than standard bulbs. They give off a very white light. I replaced the interior lights in my 2011 Volvo S40. I would recommend buying the error free lights if your going to replace your interior car lights. These look like they came standard on my car.
B00KGPB9DQ|4|Easy to install and very good quality
B00H0311NA|5|Replaced the OEM incandescent bulbs with these LEDS and can actually see what is in the van.  I no longer need  a flashlight at night to find things under the faint glow of OEM incandescent light.  I found this product to be the best price.  Shipping was fast.
B000CKXWQ2|5|I've had these on my 94 Ford Probe GT for a few months now and they seem to be doing well.  I huge improvement over the blown kyb's.
B0074HNJM8|5|This stuff is great. It gets firm but not hard enough to crack. It is a shame the local auto parts stores dont stock it.
B000EQFTD8|5|Brighter than stock lights. The helped during the rain and at night . The stock lights were dim and these are brighter with a whiter light not really blue
B00RGQ1KV4|5|Great Suit for the money
B006THWK06|5|Highly recommend this product. It is exactly as advertised, and a super value. I mounted mine on a Rowdy 150 scooter and it looks great!  I had this on my bike for a fews months now, and have not had one problem with it.
B000CMKG6O|5|easy to install and working good.....no problems....recommend to anyone who needs a kit like this...installed it on a MX5 Miata
B00BLPQ0IE|3|Helmet was fine, but didn't have 10 cent snap for excess strap after it was pulled thru buckle. Very important that excess strap can be secured to not fly around and beat your face or damage your eye. Unforgivable oversight!!............
B00KL3ALGO|5|I didn't think this could be that good but it really is! Keeps my daughter comfortable she no longer complains about the sun being in her eyes, even though it doesn't cover the full window. It sticks to the window so a breeze to take off and on. Excellent product highly recommend.
B00000JD3O|5|I love this little trash bag.  It is compact enough to be out of the way and is super easy to empty. The bottom unrolls to empty and rolls back up easily.
B000KK8ZNY|5|This bar light is a perfect match to the one I broke.<br />I look forward to dealing with Anderson Marine in<br />the future.  I recommend  them.
B00F0M350U|5|You are never really sure about this kind of product when buying on the internet until it's delivered and installed but these step bars are actually better than the OEM ones that came on my FX-4.<br />My next door neighbor has a lift in his garage and a couple of other neighbors came over and helped us install them, none of us thought the instructions were good but when we figured out how they went on it took very little time.<br />The brackets were heavy duty and fit perfectly, there were actually extra washers in case we lost some, paint was very good and they look good as well.
B000PSW398|5|I've put off trying Briwax for the past few years -- yes, years. This was partly because I couldn't find it locally (some things just beg to be touched before buying) and partly because I was unsure whether to go with tinted vs. plain. I have furniture in a variety of shades, from mid-century blond to mid-range browns<br /><br />Minutes after it arrived, I grabbed an old pair of cotton athletic socks and used Briwax to touch-up my ancient (1970s), real wood speaker cabinets. Let's just say that I am more than pleased with the results! It concealed nearly all the scuffs and scratches; the wood looks and even feels like it did when new. Amazing stuff.<br /><br />Also, I was pleasantly surprised by how much you get for this price. Looking at the seller's photo, I assumed it was roughly equivalent to a tin of shoe polish. Oh, no -- it's a **huge** can, approx. 4\\" in diameter and more than 2\\" tall! It holds enough wax for a whole showroom...likely several years' supply for average users.<br /><br />A few words of advice:<br /><br />1. Think before choosing a stain! I got lucky -- at the last moment, I switched from 'Dark Mahogany' to 'Light Brown'. Trust me, 'Light Brown' is perfect for any wood finish light enough to show the grain and with no 'fruity' (red, yellow, etc.) overtones.<br /><br />2. The instruction sheet warns about the vapor, which is caused by a nasty solvent called toluene (Google it). Use Briwax only in a well-ventilated area! Otherwise, if you don't get high or pass out, the oil-field stink will annoy you for maybe a full day.<br /><br />3. Follow the instructions to the letter and use this stuff sparingly! As others have said here, a little Briwax goes a long way. Start in a small area, then work your way out from there. Better you should have to apply Briwax twice than end up wasting it.
B006UH9NEG|2|Ended up paying to get it installed.  This thing must have been designed by a summer intern whose only previous experience was working on Obamacare!
B009S95N4W|1|They look great and are exactly what I ordered.They took a little work to get on but they fit pretty good.
B0087FJZUQ|4|I never installed them because I sold my truck but they looked nice. They seemed to fit well when i did a dry fit.
B000KL1DH8|1|This articles Y bought because on the Hummer area they describe that fit for H3 2009, I received already but not fit at all, the cheat me I loose my money
B004GE6KMI|5|Perfect fit
B000WK4EC8|5|Total Cycle Cleaner is gentle on paint, but cleans the bike.  Also strong enough to clean the wheels and chrome.  I recommend it.
B0081SC9SY|5|It was just what we needed. We did not have the item number but matched it with the picture . It was perfect
B009AUVGQI|5|They work great on my 68 F-100.The contour looks good. I would recommend.
B00A8717ZW|4|I have only used the product once, but I was pleased with the result.  It did what I expected it to do.
B00KWNUME4|5|I think it is a very good cover. It fits better than my old one did and better built
B001G6FVZG|5|Great product! Great price!
B002P8KRT4|5|Can't tell the difference between this and factory
B0002MA03S|4|These are good, these are loud enough, but they still go 'meeeeep&#34; not HOOOOOONK.<br />I was hoping that that these would have more bass then they do.<br /><br />Overall though, install is easy, the quality seems good,
B006RO8LCM|4|I received an A&M hitch cover but it was not the one that was pictured. The one I received was silver/chrome ATM symbol. I'm very happy with the one I received, I would have just liked some notice that it wouldn't be the hitch cover that you saw online.
B001TBYVTK|5|Really lightweight yet with padding where they say you need it. Great for 115 degree temps in the desert. I have the XXL, I am between 220 to 250, 5'10\\" tall for sizing. Fits perfect no bunching or gaps at the waist.<br /><br />I've had the Joe Rocket Phoenix (bought in 2001), it was a ok jacket but the armor was poorly fitting & bulky. I also ordered a Joe Rocket Phoenix 2012 version with this Bohn bodyguard shirt. The joe Rocket is way improved over previous & fits much more tailored now, but I'm keeping the Bohn because its still better in really hot climes & weighs next to nothing.
B001CBMXNI|1|Overpriced. Originally bought because it was suppose to handle the heat better (not true). Bought it June 2008 had to replace it May 2010 (less than 2 years). The replacement just died on me Aug 2011 so the replacement only lasted 14 months.
B000WJBHHY|5|I have relied on the holding ability and quality of Ancra to secure my dirt bikes for over thirty years.  I have always considered Ancra to be the best and will continue to use Ancra tie downs in the future.
B000EPYI68|5|this product is cheep then other like this but works like expensive ones, so i'm glad i bought it. .
B00803FPV8|5|I purchased this plate as a gift for my son who had just purchased a big green Jeep  which he had nicknamed the &#34;Hulk&#34;.  He loved it and it  fit right in with his vehicle.
B0057SNLB0|4|bought for my motor cycle.  it fit . i would recommend for bikes if you get the right fit. i dont know what else to say
B001OMK53K|5|Exactly what I wanted. Excellent quality. I have bought Spectre products previously and th7y do not disapoint. I recommend then highly for your auto accessory needs.
B001PL4J32|1|They look good, yes...however; poor quality for sure and nearly impossible to get them onto the back seat because it has to be secured to itself. This means you have to take OUT the back seat to secure the cover onto itself with the clips. They are VERY THIN. The colors are attractive. I put them on anyway to protect the leather from my kids spills. They have been installed for 3 days now, already pulling and moving off of the seats. Seriously, with this amount of shipping ($13!!!) and the price of the item I paid nearly $40 - go to Pep Boys or Wal-Mart and see something else in person to get a better fit/quality for your car. SERIOUSLY DO NOT BUY THESE.
B007TKEGW2|4|Nice
B007Q8HUE8|5|Perfect fit, as advertised
B004I0HDHQ|5|Great replacement part.  Exactly as described.  Husband installed it right away and had no problems.  That's really all I can say about it.
B00B0YAY6A|5|Very nice product!!
B0091U4T9I|5|Fit perfectly.  Great Roof Rack for Mazda CX-5.
B000C2EC82|5|I didn't need these gaskets, my intake was shot leaking air and antifreeze, so I had to return them, but by looking at them I knew they're pretty nice gasket. I'd buy them again if I have to.
B002UC2UTK|5|Very Happy with it
B0002L6U60|5|Very well constructed. Works great. Going to get one for the mazda next. So far it works perfect.  Glad i came across it.
B000GZX2HW|5|My father loves it, it was what he just wanted. It went from USA to Puerto Rico in no time thanks for the manual. Thanks!!
B008DCP9C6|4|The key works.  Took to a Ace Hardware and they made the copy for me.  Others posted the programming sequence for the transponder and once followed, the transponder worked as well. The ONLY thing I was not very happy about is the plastic end is to flimsy and tends to pop open if dropped or squeezed just right.  It popped open twice on me within hours the first day I got it.  I ended up applying super glue and gluing it together to keep it shut.  It's not an OEM but it works.
B00B4KTI5I|4|I ordered this product one year ago and now the cable on it has tangled in the motor and is irreplaceable/unrepairable. I am forced to purchase another new one and hoping that it will last a lot longer. One thing I would suggest after having looked at the design of the product is where the cable ends attach to the slides for the window clamps it might be smart to put heavy duty tape across the plastic where the cables attach. This might help to keep the cable stops from popping out which is what I believe happened to mine, a cable popped out and because of the slack it tangled going into the motor.
B002FY9AXW|5|great fit, plug and play application for quick installation
B000EIXQ5Y|5|My main reason to have this item it to take water temps for fishing...Works as advertised will also be good to have to check a/c also
B00CA09LEO|5|Works great
B00G2CY7WM|5|Nice but I needed hayabusa
B000MN4KQ0|5|Iv only had to use it about 3 times so far but every time its done its job very well!
B0002UQAXY|5|These pads by meguiar work great on my porter cable.  They do a fantastic job and are easy to clean.  Great job Meguiar!!
B008OAEVG2|5|Package arrived on time and in great condition.  The bracked took about 2 hours to install (after spending an hour reading the instuctions).  Solid product, strong and will provide many years and miles of service.  I would not hesitate to recommend this bracket kit.  Easily hooks up to the tow bar on my motor home.
B002XL2IG8|5|Works fine.  Price great.
B0044UCISY|5|I was having a hard time finding just the right outdoor rug I was looking for to use with our 35' travel trailer, but then I found this one and it's PERFECT! The rich burgundy color is very pretty and easily hides the inevitable dirt, sand and grass. We've had lots of compliments on the rug and it makes our camping trips feel stylish and cozy. We've used it for two summers now and it has held up great.
B000FW2MWW|5|Great it item; easily reaches across the garage. Quick connections make it a breeze to use. I have a Tender for all my vehicles.
B00DBEMGP4|1|Completely dissappointed. Light output is horrid. I ordered white ones and they light up blue. No way can I run these on my car.
B0030CBIPQ|5|A little on the expensive side, but very accurate and fits between my brake disk and wheel.  I like that it has a small flashlight built it for low light tire checks.
B004S57H7M|5|Perfect
B000IG3JJA|5|I LOVE THEM VERY MUCH IT MAKES MY TRUCK LOOK SO VERY NICE THANKS
B007I7D66S|4|I was purchasing 12V LED lamps from the local auto parts store for $8-9 for two lamps... these are far, far better.  The light output is much, much more intense than the more expensive lamps (made by PILOT, if anyone is wondering), and they seem to hold up well in enclosed outdoor fixtures.  No complaints at all.
B0045LAK96|5|Well made reflectors therefore the 5 stars. I would recommend these to others in the market. What else can one say....
B00E6ACAPI|5|Cool
B004OHGR7A|5|These liners are awesome.....That is all!
B0066SMHOM|5|Works great
B001NAUAXI|5|K&N make excellent products. I switched to this filter because of their known reliability. Ease of use is a major factor, the nut on the top of the filter means you do not need a special filter wrench to remove or replace.
B004SEXO3E|5|Needed a different size lug wrench for my winter wheel set.  I used this to loosen the lug nuts when taking them off this spring and the tool provides just the right amount of leverage.  No issues and works great.
B00KDO3OJ2|1|The angle plus the length of the top bolt makes for an angle that is impossible to screw in without damaging the bracket. Major design flaw. You need a flexible Allen wrench and even then the angles would be off. I had KC brackets before and should have kept them. The finish sucked but at least they bolted in the way they were supposed to.
B00FD5L8P8|5|sweet $
B00AIJY2ZM|4|PRO: Amazingly bright LED!! (Seemingly) Great quality. Comparable in brightness to other junk-brand SMD LED wedge bulbs w/ multiple LED's on a single wedge, & has outlasted some in lifespan.<br /><br />CON: Price! :(
B002R0MUXQ|3|As described.  Pricey, but looks great.  Perfect it!
B000CO7N5Y|5|Hella Optilux 12V. 100 Watts. Had pro install them on Merecedes Benz E350 4matic 2009.  Fit perfectly.  Huge difference from Yellow Quartz bulbs and Noticeable difference from PIAA H7 55W. extreme white 4000K bulbs. Which cost $74.00 Auto Barn or $59.63 Amazon.  The Optilux bulbs are the brightest I've had so far. Pro tech. says should not be any problem with wiring due to higher wattage. Driving at night is a pleasure now. Lets see how long these babies last.  Amazon price is very competitive.
B00CLVC1NK|5|It matched exactly and was easy to apply.  The only one problem was, I had to order more than what was needed.
B003YCEN6I|3|I give this item three stars even though I haven't actually used it yet. I understand the value of this type of cloth for cleaning of many items which is the reason I bought it in the first place. I plan to run the cloths through the washer before using just to rid them of any residue from  manufacturing and shipping, although I realize this is probably not a necessary step. I purchased this mainly because I intend to end the use  of paper towels and replace them with these ...I'm sure they will be fine
B00ICV9OLK|5|Nice
B00B3YMZQO|5|hi.  I bouight these for my husbands bike for Christmas and I was very happy with the quality of the material.  The shipping was fast and i am very pleased with the order.  I also ordered a sissy bar bag from the same company.
B000BOAG04|4|Worked out very well, no rust as of yet
B000Q6QWSC|1|no good. didn't seal couldn't even use it<br />i didn't like it at all. would not recommend to anyone for bleeding brakes
B00J55CZEU|5|Exact color match and easy to apply (even for noobs like me)!
B0062A6MM2|5|Normally I don't bother placing a review, but I was extremely happy with this. It looks amazing, and it sticks to my car very well. It won't budge. I'm not worried about it falling off anytime soon. :)
B00M3ILR5Y|5|Made my Camry look good.
B005M3A8ES|5|I am a pretty handy person and I installed the running boards while my husband and son napped. I enjoy the running boards!
B004L439FE|4|I use this loctite in motorcycle screws and so far it works very well.<br /><br />I have to say that I actually expected the liquid to be a little thicker, it is rather liquid, not so liquid that it drips or spills, but I expected it to form a thicker rubbery material on the threads, having said this, it works very well on fine threaded screws, and in parts of my motorcycle where there is a lot of oil and grease.
B000FPYA06|5|Looks great, cheap upgrade that adds to the look of your jeep.
B004APM12G|5|WORKS GREAT. HAS LARGE NUMBERS. I WORK IN THE INDUSTRY AND HAVE TO PHOTOGRAPH THE THE READING. I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT.
B00068XCQU|5|Learned about this on Classic Car show on TV.<br />Exactly what we needed, at a good price.<br />Fast Shipping and good packaging too!
B00M9LR2QI|4|Works well just as advertised.  No problems.
B000BHQ5JC|1|It broke after 3 uses.
B00I6MTQ6I|5|Simple installation. Sturdy construction. Good thick coating of paint. Feels heavier duty than orginal.
B0041LK662|3|Great to be able to crack your windows during this summer heat. Only reason I give it a 3/5 is because the ones in the rear won't actually keep rain out. So it's pointless to buy all four when you only really use two. I installed the rear ones as well just to get a more uniform look. Install was very easy. Was able to get them out in in under 10 mins. Bottom line, Easy install, decent price, rear deflectors don't serve purpose.
B00AO6IK6G|5|The helmet is light weight and I wear a xl helmet and this one fits perfect to size. My other helmet is larger as a xl than this one. The visor works ok but hangs up on my glasses a little.
B002FDM2NS|5|Worked perfect! Used on 2004 Suzuki Eiger.
B00340DRVM|1|The hitch cover looks really nice online, but it is really cheap. It's all plastic. I liked the way this looked online better than the other black GMC logo I saw and it was cheaper. I'm very disappointed. As another review said I'm sure it will break off in the car wash. Will be ordering the other hitch cover now.
B005JU5U3S|4|Work very well, sometiesm in the snow the driver side does clean the whole windshield.  I think the cold weather affects the rubber.
B001Q4DX9E|5|works as described
B005D5T6C0|5|good light
B001034E6W|5|I got tired of having to clean out my filters constantly because of all the bugs and other large particles that would get stuck in them.  This has stopped that.  The pre-filter does exactly what it is suppose to by stopping larger particles from getting into the actual filter.
B0063XQ4F8|5|I bought this because i am also a Denver Bronco's fan. I lived in Colorado for many years so i wanted to show my pride.
B000GVQK1G|5|This is my second pair like this and there were no surprises.  Of course, since I chose to purchase them after already having a pair, that says it all.
B004RNOVTM|5|This hose is exactly what I wanted. It is exactly the right length for what I needed. Does not leak.
B00192JFZO|4|I bought these for camping and I like them a lot.  They are light and hold a good amount of juice.  Nice design, too.
B002MEYJY0|5|I was really surprise by the price and that they came with the light bulbs already in there. Will purchase with them in the future,,,,Very Happy
B00BTIN7SO|4|Love the idea of a comfortable seat for my beach bike.... But the back is not high enough and a bit awkward when riding... Works , but not ideal😳
B000F22DLM|2|Fairly heavy weight.  Doesn't fit well in my 2007 F-150 standard cab.  It's 1-2 inches too long, extra material is all in the transmission hump area.  After months of using it, it doesn't lay right and is a bit annoying.  I'm using it over a vinyl floor and I swear it has helped make the cab a bit quieter.  This is a work truck, so if I use the mat long enough so that it wears out, I'll just throw it away and get another.  Would be nice if they'd list model years it really fits.
B003GCSJAC|5|good solid construction. carry it on the key chain. makes it easier to find keys too.
B001PLLN90|5|rare find - no one sells these anymore - until now.  worth the price, super fast delivery & the mugs that i have been searching for for 4 years.  penny pincher rating 5 stars
B004HP9PNC|1|Had several issues with this purchase. Previously the picture for the spacers was a hub centric spacer so that is why i purchased them. When received they were not hub centric so i called omix-ada. All they did was change the picture on Amazon, no hey we are sorry and will refund your money. Also they do not warn you that you will need an extra thin 13/16 socket to install the spacers. I had to contact them for that as well. After driving to several auto parts stores i found out none carry thin wall sockets. So i had to purchase one on Amazon for $10. However when arrived it was still not thin enough. I Had to grind it down to fit in the holes to tighten the lug nuts. Terrible experience.
B00O9AREXI|5|Kid thought it was awesome :)
B00BUZIF2E|2|I bought the identical lights to these but just in the white color. These amber bulbs are not near as bright as they should be or advertised to be. The &#34;white&#34; version is much better and brighter. These lights definitely need work.
B001JT011O|4|Easy to read and indexed well for my needs. Would recommend it for any truck driver or employer. Good resource tool.
B0040CYSUW|5|Good part, shipping time and excellent package. This part works just like an original or genuine part.
B00AN93OB0|5|great fit easy to remove and install
B00AKYP6KU|5|not much to say, it is what it is
B00HU8YRRW|5|Longest lasting air freshener Ive ever bought. Great smell
B007HFSK6M|1|Did not fit my 2015 Wrangler. Had to return it.
B006TN4Y7W|5|Fast shipping- just what I needed. I was a little concerned with the low price ( having seen them elsewhere for much more) but the quality is fine and it works great for what we paid for.  Thanks
B000066OC7|4|little soft but lot better than nothing. I like it
B005DUQ6BY|5|So much better than the stock lights!
B004FI325I|5|head was not as big as i thought it would be but it was still big enough it can be detached to be a wristlet too very nice
B006C86G4S|1|Smells terrible,  will be afraid to use,  too expensive to send back to China!  Big waste fo money!!!
B000C9QDT6|1|Does not fit a 2002 Silverado 1500 LS. It holds the correct bulb but It's a totally different design. The site says its supposed to be the correct one.
B000VUEDYI|5|Excellent quality, written in it (Made in USA).<br />But i bought a lot of Hella relay (micro & mini) and written in it (Made in China)
B00BLX1L4O|4|The wheel emblem fix good and looks just as good once I put it on. Great looking on the steering wheel. I'm very please with mu purchase and thanks Amazon once again
B001TALVNA|5|So far everything is working great, no leaks. They also look great! I have them on my 2003 Laredo and the limited look so much better! I put wax on them the first day I got them to ensure no scratching.
B005DUMTLA|5|Tried many this so far works best , We live near the ocean so have to wash often to keep the salt off
B00N4EH7F0|5|Great price and no problems so far
B006R2RZOY|1|Light is bright, but one was fried when I received them. Plus it took way to long to get here!
B003WSXRTS|4|I have two elderly parents, a pregnant wife, and an 11 year old daughter that all complained about climbing into my truck.  These Bestop PowerBoards are able to drop down lower standard running boards because they retract, and help make the step up into the truck much easier.<br /><br />I am mechanical and was able to install them myself.  The one issue was the incorrect identification of the wiring harness location on my 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 Quad Cab pickup for the open door indicator wires.  The harness was located behind the dimmer switch and not down the right side of the stearing column as identified in the instructions.<br /><br />Overall I was hesitant to spend $800 when, in my opinion, a $140 pair of basic running boards would accomplish the task.  I have had them installed for two weeks and would not trade them for anything.
B009WLFIJQ|5|I ordered 2 beanies (1 Neff and 1 RCVA).  The Neff beanie is looser fitting around the opening and can be worn forward on my head or back on the crown of my head in a slouch style which is what I was hoping for.
B000E7UIWE|4|A plastic jar full of bungee cords, what else can I say? Cords are of mediocre strength (as expected for the price), I wouldn't hold anything incredibly expensive with these. They're handy for light camping, though.
B007QMW7WY|5|Is what it is. Not cheesy plastic. Finished my front license plate mount well. Not cheap, but it's a quality frame.
B00QRANHI4|5|I just ordered the silver one. Tha adapter well worth extra few bucks.  I would like a larger one for den in home. Helps keep odors/smoke better than the air gels, sprays, candles, air cleaners, etc than I have been using for years. It just too small with adapter to handle the den. Car & my small kitchen it does extremely well. I would like a larger one for den in home
B005KYWGVW|5|Sound quality is excellent , Mic works great ,comfortable to wear for long periods , battery life excellent<br />Easy to pair, only complaint I have is on and off switch hard to use and you cannot use headset when charging<br />Price good compared to others I have
B005OEIY8W|5|it does as advertized . like the size and all the options plus haveing woodalls availible wherever i am is awesome.however it has frozen up on me a couple of times but easy to reboot
B009KBV9ZK|3|The lower billet grille did not have enough holes predrilled in it... I had to fix.. and the middle is a royal pain to install...
B004W97ZA8|2|They look great. However, they dont fit flush or tight on my truck. I had to perform a little fabrication to get them to fit right. Also, the slide lock female ends on the lights dont match up with the male slide locks on my truck. So more fabrication was required. All in all, Im not sure Id rate the product so well if I wasnt satisfied with how they looked on my truck.
B001DRHMRI|2|I didnt get this case...........
B001AM8H16|5|Very good shock for a great low price. Got the Gabriel G51815's for the front. Rides better than the OEM shocks that the truck came with.
B0064VJ35W|1|Very cheaply made.  It feels more like tin than chrome.  I wouldn't dare put them on any of my cars.
B004XIYXIU|3|Must reattach after each use.
B007IPKY0Q|5|Works Great
B000HTOZE6|3|I received the product later than promised. When I opened the box & looked it over, I noticed that there was a small dent on one side of it (which was not indicated in the item description anywhere), and also one of the bolt brackets was attached backwards.
B0045WBVUM|5|Makes riding a pleasure again!
B0064ONFBC|5|its ok
B000H0OS7E|5|These lights make my 1992 Eldorado look good!
B00D7HN0LE|4|EZ install & works as advertized. Would have given it 5 stars if the wiring was covered with tape or rubber.
B00TEYR3Q2|5|Great
B000XBGFO6|4|The wire to tie the nose on was too short, but the rest was good.  Good product!
B000B68V6I|5|I have used this product for years to keep my gas fresh. I add it to my generator, lawn mower and boat tanks. Great for gas storage and is reasonably priced, it does as advertised.
B00ITF6P0C|5|Good quality. Exactly what I wanted--was true to the picture. The recipient was thrilled.
B00L2A0S22|5|This suction cups offers superior suction! I'm so impressed and will definitely buy another pair. Highly recommended!
B000G28PPE|4|Worked very well.
B0024ECCJW|5|I purchased the product because my burner failed.now with heater i have hot water with a flick of a switch in one hour.easy to install.saves propane.your paying for electric at a campground let them pay for your hot water.recommend it to anyone with a hot water heater.
B008CE09PM|3|I had to modify the top receiver.  It was hitting the bumper on the motor home.  I had to cut and angle and now it fits perfect.
B006EGAIII|4|I read about this product before I bought them and yes they slip a little but a small rug fixes that with no problems .<br />Also drives up just right  for low profile cars and trucks..Store away with very little room and  light. yes I do like them.<br />so if your looking to buy go for it great buy .
B003V3PZIK|5|For you DIYers out there looking to start taking better care of your vehicles, this is a great start. this kit will give you just about everything you need to start out right, chemical wise anyway. I would suggest looking into getting a good set of microfiber towels to really compliment the cleaners and waxes.
B000WJX4BQ|5|The original lasted 4 years, the aftermarket replacement lasted no quite two years. It was half as expensive, but what a hassle to have a dead battery on your ATV. I decided to purchase an OEM style battery so I wouldn't have to worry about starting problems for at least 4 years. Good deal on battery and quick shipping too.
B00AWREHXM|5|The frame is lightweight and durable, there is a nice soft lining that allows me to wear my wire rimed eyeglasses under them and the color optics are great!  I have a open top Italian sports car and the wind can sometimes blow dust or particles up from the roadway. Getting temporarily blinded by road debris, even dust particles at speed can be very dangerous, so these were purchased to eliminate the possibility!  So far they're just what I wanted, and the price is so right!
B000BQSLAO|5|Does the job well.  Heavy enough that when under the truck winds won't move it around.  Galvanized as stated so no rust issues when the rains come. Not sure why it came in a 6 (yes six) foot long box  since it's only about 18&#34; x 24&#34; in sixe.  UPS must love Amazon.
B000FIWKQE|1|This is not the paower rating it says in the add. I would never buy this unit period poor advertising and a waste of my time.
B00IZMWB9I|5|Work perfectly
B000FW61M4|5|I had a huge leak between the engine coolant overflow hose and the radiator, I threw some of this in, cranked up the heater full blast and drove around for about 1 hour. The leak is gone! It's been 3 days since and it hasn't come back! It's worth a try, cheaper than replacing your radiator.
B004TCZU64|5|Fits great on a 2006 Chevy Cobalt and the Light matches the OEM lights on my dash. This is a great item, plus cheaper then the Dealers.
B005F9HR1Q|5|Got this for a 2007 9-5 Saab. Was getting 2 check engine codes related to DIC. Light disappeared after replacing DIC with this one and has not come back for 800 miles now. It works.
B00LZZAUK4|5|good
B000C83PG6|4|Had a problem that I turned off the truck by this piece, had bought several times elsewhere, and did not last even a month, this is very good, resolved my problem.
B003U2O7L8|5|very good
B009DJQHN8|5|Fit like a glove
B001AIZ5HY|5|Great
B003TPW5YM|5|Extremely sudzeeeee!  Smells like bubble gum, leaves behind an incredibly clean car, and after 3 washes my 6 month old wax still stands!  Thanks Chemical Guys, you have a future customer!
B002S70H9M|3|ok
B001TJ1EJC|5|these fit perfectly
B0006H9332|4|This review is not about the part, its great, I inquired at many RV supply outlets and the answer was it was to old and parts aren't available, I found on Amazon and had it in a few days. The picture of the parts made the sale.
B003GXMJG6|5|Its awsome i still use it .....
B00032KBFE|5|Excellent product. Don't hesitate to acquire it.
B000GKLX1O|5|I know too many jeep owners who have had their spare tire stolen.  These give you a nice peace of mind.
B0087GQX14|1|holes did not align with the car. pipes were 2 feet to short and no way possible could fit the car
B005PYRCPW|5|Easy to use storage bag. At least helps you be more organized. That way you don't have stuff flying every where in the back.
B000WJWTM6|4|Used a micrometer to measure the ones I used, they were all to spec. A few in the kit had rust though.
B000HBNV58|5|I bought Permatex white lithium to grease the oscillating mechanism of an air purifier that was refusing to oscillate.<br />(It has a plastic to metal contact.)  The lithium worked very well,and it was not difficult to work into a small space.<br /><br />Great product, reasonable price.<br /><br />Now my air purifier oscillates again!<br /><br />Before trying lithium I had tried two other products. They were a waste of money.  I wish I had tried this first.
B000GXZ5JM|3|Autogeek (The seller) is the king of car product's and offer a ton of options. Having used multiple different car shampoos I wasn't in love with this one. Compared to other choices it just didn't seem to clean as well, didn't have a really pleasant smell which can matter if you take your time cleaning your vehicle like I do.<br /><br />Overall the product worked but I feel there are much better product's on the market like Blackfire or Dodo to choose from.
B005UTS6FC|4|I thought they would be darker pink once I received them but i still like them. They are a cute addition to my all black car with pink extras, lol
B000CLJAMG|1|I purchase all four, Front and Rear for my daughters first car. I thought these rotors would be good, made by Wagner.<br /> Well they fit ok and looked ok at first, Then I saw casting pit holes in braking surface.<br />After these rotors are casted they are machined, and should have been inspected. How many open spaces are in the casting?? Are they safe??<br /> I am disappointed in Wagner for releasing brake rotors in this condition.
B006CQ9BMO|5|This is another high-quality product by CTEK. Note that this unit is designed for smaller batteries such as found in ATV's, lawn mowers and motorcycles.<br />This unit, like every CTEK battery charger I have bought, does not get hot, make noise or use low quality connector clips. Using one of these will, in my experience, more than pay for itself by greatly extending the life of your battery.
B005NFHVRC|4|Installed quick and worked as expected, the problem with these reviews is that you must do so many words when not needed.
B003XFZRWA|5|I think this steering wheel cover is so cute! I originally bought it because I bought a car and the steering wheel kept burning my hand when I'd first get in it to drive. Not any more! This thing doesn't collect the heat like that!
B000FW61SI|4|These visors fit easily on your factory flip down visors. So far it works great on cutting down the glare of the sun while driving or when you are parked. They flip down easily and hide away under the factory visors. They have a warning on them not to look through them while driving. When looking through them they do make the view a bit blurry which backs up the warning, but I only use them at an angle to block the glare of the sun when it is below the vehicle's visor (early morning and closer to sunset). If you have a mirror on the back of your factory visor with a flip cover, depending on the size of that mirror, it may interfere with the cover flipping up while they are installed. Overall I am satisfied with them.
B007GCDM46|5|Priced Right and delivered promptly.  Don't pay Verizon $45 when you can do this yourself in less than 5 minutes.
B0055EK3JO|5|Cool finishing look
B00JGJH8RY|4|Great stabilizer and very good price!!!!
B0037WAZ4O|5|I recently replaced my OEM springs on my 2007 Chevy Aveo with H&R sport lowering springs. The springs are compatible with OEM shocks but, I wasn't too impressed with the ride! So I replaced the OEM shocks with these struts and its an INCREDIBLE improvement! With the OEM shocks and struts my car would sometimes bottom out and I could tell at highway speeds that my springs were working harder than I felt they should have. With these, that is no longer and issue!  My only gripe is the supplied hardware! I reused the OEM hardware because the new nuts looked like they were missing a washer but this was an easy fix!
B007NVRNC2|5|Like them much better than the donjoy sleeves!!
B007KT2AQQ|1|I was not aware that this decal would as large as it was, I would never stick this on my, it would look very tacky, I thought this was a small sticker and I would be able to place it on the back window but heck as big as it is you would not be able to see out your rear view window....
B00GR2W6CU|5|Got several compliments on it around Fourth of July. I bought a small one for back of my SUV window, big trucks would probably look good with larger size.
B0016KH24U|4|Works good with my air compressor.
B00K8ATG20|5|Best buy for the buck. Worked exactly as I needed and look forward to future business with this company.
B004ZF39ZY|5|BETTER & BRIGHTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ONES
B00585GVXM|4|It was what I asked for. I finally got the item off of my dad. It was misplaced! lol.. I am sorry for the bad e-mail in regards to your company! It is a fantastic company you guys have. I am a very satisfied customer, and hopefully in the future we can do more business.
B00BXMRP4I|2|Leaks oil all over the place.
B006JRJHJ8|2|Didn't fit.
B00FPJKO66|5|works great and headlight glare is knock down dramatically, even with the high intensity blue head lights.
B00068XCQU|5|I hooked it up inside my SUV and no more worries about a dead battery! I don't use the SUV as often so this is just what I needed. Haven't gotten through a winter with it, yet, though. Will let you know next Spring!
B00D9FSN8E|5|Fits, easy to install. Give it a couple of days for it  to smooth out.
B00261FNB2|5|Great addon on for the price, using mine on a 2012 JKU with the stock rims and 315's<br />solid build, studs were a little uneven but pulled straight and tight once cranked down.
B001LHVOVK|4|Bought this after the Equus reader I bought from brand W store (at 3x the price) did not work on my car (02 Honda, but this car has had problems with other readers).  The Autel works like it should, but is skimpy on extra features.
B005N6WI92|1|Would buy if I could even wear the others from this seller, straight large is a very small!!! Very dissatisfied and will not buy anymore from them😞
B00AO0E5QQ|5|Good quality, worked as expected.
B0002JMIEK|4|GOES ON NICE, DRYS FAST, EASY TO WIPE OFF AND A BEAUTIFUL DEEP SHINE
B007LQPCY0|5|Perfect fit
B000WPE3K6|1|(Please note:  this review is based solely on products and services received directly from Howard's Horns, and did not involve Amazon in any way.)    21 JAN 2008, I ordered one each of the \\"Big Horn\\" and \\"Little Big Horn\\" by phone based on their \\"scratch and ding\\" sale, which they listed as, \\"brand new components.\\"  Red flag warning:  Howard's Horns only took money orders--no credit cards, and no personal checks. Once they have your money, they've got it. The supplied compressors arrived not in new packaging, were apparently used, and one was dented.  Howard's Horns \\"tech service\\" failed to respond in any helpful manner. Their web site quoted an article which stated that, \\"The compressor is rated at 6 amps, similar to the stock horn.\\" Testing showed that the HH compressors drew 2-3 times that (#1: 12.5-16.3A; #2: 15.1-18.3A).  The HH compressors and horns were bench tested against my older Rivco air horn set. The HH output was 2-12dB less, and one of the HH compressors was unable to sound the \\"Little Big Horn\\" at all!  I bought a new replacement compressor (with similar nominal specifications to the returned HH compressors) from Wolo (great compressor, and GREAT folks!) and decided to go ahead and install the HH \\"Big Horn\\", since I was stuck with it anyway--the HH horn quit working entirely after only six beeps!! I replaced it with the Rivco air horns that I had installed over two years previously:  the Rivco horns worked great with the new compressor, and still do.  I called Howard's Horns, and then the compressors were returned. HH did not return new or replacement compressors, and they did not refund the money for them. In a subsequent call, their representative stated that I needed to also return the horns themselves, and then they would refund the money.  The horns were returned:  Howard's Horns refused the shipment, never refunded any money, and has subsequently refused to answer any calls made during business hours to their published business phone.  The Georgia Better Business Bureau rates this company as \\"unsatisfactory\\".  Internet business is still based primarily on trust--if someone violates your trust, they do not deserve your--or anyone's--business. There are too many other good horns--and good people.
B003TU6066|5|good product
B008XB9BJY|5|I am replacing about 30 1141-style bulbs in a motorhome, and ordered 1-LED replacement bulb from 7 different brands to compare.  I sampled various styles, color-temperatures, Lumens, etc..  I expected the Brightech Warm White to be fairly close to an incandescent in color, which is to say somewhat yellow.  I was  surprised to find the Brightech had almost a pink color to it, what I would guess as an attempt to render skin-tones more life-like?  While it was not the color I was looking for in the main salon of the RV, my wife thinks it may be a good choice for the lighting where she applies make-up.<br /><br />The Brightech arrived from the seller quickly, undamaged, and was as-described on the web site.  I would recommend both the product and the seller to others.
B0002MSY90|4|Exactly what you expect with 3M. These worked very well and were sturdy for my project. However I think we could have lasted a bit longer than they did.
B0041FVEAU|5|Fits perfect
B00GEIIQ12|5|The item has only one ground instead two ground terminal like other manufacturer.  it worked well as specified.  Will buy it again in the future
B00CC2Z9MI|5|Been 6 months since purchase no problem extremely bright white no hint of blue only on start up. great install
B000WJB14I|5|This just sits in the toolbag on my Bobber waiting to be used.  My bike hasn't broke away from home, but when it does (fingers crossed) this tool will most likely help out.  It has most the little tools that I might need to do a minor fix or adjustment on the road and it feels solid.
B001R1Q62W|3|I've needed new headlights for a while and even spent an evening trying to salvage my old ones with lens cream and buffing pad-don't do this-a complete waste of time.  Anyway, my experience is similar to many others, the headlights came in packed fine and the removal and installation process is a breeze. The lights need to be adjusted out of the box for sure, I couldn't even drive with the high beams on. My local service guy did the adjustment while I had my car in the shop for state inspection.<br />The proof is in the pudding. These lights are fine if you drive in well lit neighborhoods and roadways. I don't find the lights as bright as they should or need to be. Since I drive a lot on back roads at night, I'm still looking for a more intense lumen experience.
B005ESEU8G|5|Great product. Easy installation,  seems durable so far. Looks great on my Ram. I would purchase again.
B00KGGKQUC|5|It was just what I was looking for. Perfect fit.
B0010HLVGY|5|Thank you so far so good.  For those who aren't aware this part is much smaller than it looks and hard to find
B003VCBDG4|5|Works great.  Makes oil changes much cleaner and simpler.
B00GZKC6EW|5|perfect!
B002NNWN3Y|4|This product got sent fast and it was what i wanted just havent had a chance to try it yet
B00JU81M96|5|Good heavy duty quality plate cover.  Nice graphics.
B004LGNFZQ|5|Looks and fits exactly the same as the stock R53 radiator.
B001HLIMD8|5|My pacemaker was replaced, and the seatbelt in my car was very uncomfortable over the site.  This Seat Belt Pad has just enough cushion that I can now drive without uncomfortable rubbing over the pacemaker site.  My husband doesn't need it so when he drives he just slides it down towards the bottom of the seat belt.  I would purchase this item again.
B0087NB1IW|5|I don't ride in a group so I haven't used the set to talk to other riders but I use my GPS and phone with it and listen to music.
B00CGCOGIW|5|Looks great I love it!
B001445IZ8|5|Took while for me to get it going but once I did it could not be easier. I am not sure if it gets all the oil out but seems to do a great job. I changed the oil in my two cars in around 30 minutes .
B003GCA3XI|5|Good product. The reservoir is made out of a cast metal instead of the factory plastic and looks much more reliable. The original pump bolted right in with the supplied screws and everything worked the first try. This motor may have more draw than the factory trim motor as it kept tripping the breaker in the outboard motor.
B001RUJO72|5|This Grit Guard fits the orange 5-gallon &#34;Homer&#34; buckets I got from Home Depot PERFECTLY.  I don't know what bucket other folks are trying to cram this baby into, but it is a perfect fit for the bucket for which it was intended.  Made in the USA, it even has a couple of &#34;finger holes,&#34; so you can pul it out to clean the bucket.  Substantial construction, not at all fragile.  Happy purchase!
B006JXAIQI|1|Horrible.  Piece of crap.  Fell apart.
B00VO8OF2Q|3|Not as bright as I thought it would be
B000Q05GTY|5|I didn't need this so can't say if it works well.. That said it looks like great quality and was the correct size for a 2003 highlander v6
B006K8YQYW|5|It was just what I wanted.  The shipping was very fast!
B00AZ68HNG|1|Well I got ny package on time,  but when it came to installing them in my car, didn't fit.  I msg the company to maybe get my money back orAT LEAST get the right springs for my car. They never responded back to my email. I tried calling a few times but they must of been too busy eating to answer the phone -_-
B005477A98|5|Great inexpensive theft deterrent, loud, easy to install
B005RNEH5O|5|I use this as a lubricant and as barrier to moisture for some electrical connections, where moisture could be an issue
B003CJAQOQ|5|Very nice kill switch.  Looks and works great.
B005TC2MMI|5|Really nice helmet, love the matte black look.  Technically everything works great, modular action works great, I like the buttons to release the shield and chin sections.
B0022ZXO40|5|Holds my full face perfectly
B005GECNOQ|5|Fit perfectly and easily!  I'd highly recommend it.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Turned yellow after the first wash.
B003IOKPLO|4|works good for the money.   quality seems a bit low, but function is good for price... would recomend this product for backyard mechanics and entry level techs,  have not used it extensivly so time will tell if quality is an issue
B000JFJLOM|1|not good product at all<br />i can't charge it
B00HFW5V46|1|Lock installed easily. Agree that materials don't appear to be the best. Had lock installed for about 5 months when it refused to work any longer. Unfortunately I have a tonneau cover, so I was unable to access the inside of the tailgate to get at the lock. Ended up cutting a hole thru the case to be able to actuate the cam that pulls the latches open with a screw driver. Although I have not removed the lock yet, it appears that the actuator lever that is supposed to actuated by the handle lever has come loose and has dropped down so that it no longer can be engaged by the handle lever. Could'nt find the original latch. Decided just to order another another one since it appears to be the only option and I did'nt want to go thru the delay and hassle of attempting to get a warranty replacement
B001OCXBGI|1|it was a really low quality box and when I got it it was beat up and bent up in a few places
B0051D3MP6|5|So far the charger does what it's suppose to. I bought extra connectors for my bike, mower and UTV. The green light tells you when it's charging and when it's charged. The red light tells you when your connected backwards. Very simple to use. Good buy!
B0039ONK56|5|The bench seat in my 1997 Sportside Heartbeat was in dire need of some Who Dat! flavor, to match all the other New Orleans Saints gear around it. So, even though my windows are dark tint, you can still see the Gold Gem-Studded Rhinestone Bling-Bling shining through. Everyone is asking me where did I get it. So dont be surprised if I happen to order 4 or 5 at a time.
B0002SNPDO|5|I'm on my second solar pith helmet. I'm looking for my third. I gave my first (very sweaty) one away, my fault for letting someone feel the breeze it was generating!  I was walking around the Bristol Renaissance Faire (happened to be Steam Punk Weekend, so it fit right in!), and I could have sold it right off my head about a dozen times.  Ok, so it isn't exactly personal air-conditioning; and the sun has to be beating directly down on it for the solar panel to work. That's why the battery backup is there.  If you are sensitive to the heat, as I am, every bit helps.  I live in an area of high humidity, so evaporative cooling products really don't help all that much.  Portable shade and an on-demand breeze makes a very big difference!  Oh, please, get these things back on the market!!
B00U5UBQE4|5|100% Satisfied
B00M7DRCJA|5|Looks awesome! Highly recommended!
B000CPIMXK|5|This stuff is awesome! Follow the simple instructions; and one can get the desired look with little work!It's so easy; a caveman could do it. This vht wrinkle plus paint has been used on my motorcycle for over ten years. I love the way it looks, to find yours, go to amazon.com
B00AQKRXXG|5|fit great
B0036U02WM|5|This windshield is very heavy duty and having the ability to let air in low and across your body is great in the summer months.  ALso great for blocking rain.  Match it with a roof and you can stay petty dry.  I have had this windshield on a Rhino for over 3 years and it is still in like new condition without any scratches or cracks.
B002JV0W74|5|Fits perfect on my 14 works great
B0038OOK10|5|I bought this car decal for my friend who just found out she is pregnant and she loves hello kitty. It's really cute and seems like good quality, but I haven't used it so I can't say how it holds up. Overall great product and shipping was fast.
B008CE09N4|2|The weld of the two pieces was off by about 10 degrees.  This made whatever you attached to the hitch of by 30 degrees and completely misaligned.  More cost effective to get the more expensive unit and not spend time sending these back.
B0078XFBMO|4|Received items before I expected them they look like they will fit my needs.
B006ON0K5W|5|High quality.  Slightly wider than the originals, but still fit perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.
B0002SREP4|5|I needed to convert a U.S. threaded holder to take a metric threaded device.  With the Bosch CO2148 21/64 drill, I was able to achieve the mechanical results required.
B005DL3DHS|5|This stuff is amazing,  fixed the problem and my truck runs better than ever! !!
B009MQMHHM|4|It's a little too big just to wear around your neck, or I should say loose around your neck.  It works better worn as a balaclava. It's not warm just more for protection, when on the motorcycle. Love the pattern
B0041FZ8L6|5|easy to install, works perfect.
B003JHBM1M|5|Fit well. Appear to be sturdy. Easy to trim.
B00JYMZMA8|5|Awesome product, better mileage, better throttle response and extremely easy to install
B001DAIJ86|5|Great product for my 2000 wrangler. perfect fit. Also used them in my 1993 Wrangler with the same great results.
B0040CZ0OA|5|I know its just a clip... I was able to get a box of 15 for the price of 2 (at dealership).  They were perfect part exact fit.  what more can i say.  also ordered it on Tuesday and it showed up in the mail on Thursday, Much faster than i expected.
B004R36OV0|5|Perfect fit and very well made.
B005SB6S3Y|5|Bought my first camper and had no clue on all this crap. A friend of mine who is a year round camper and helped me out. We found this product on amazon an for the price was skeptical at first. Especially when the RV dealer was going to charge 800 for theirs. I received and was impressed that it was all solid. Simple instructions to hook up the hitch and trailer.
B000MX2ORM|5|This battery has the extra cold cranking amps you need to go snowmobiling. Don't bother with any other battery. Excellent!
B001KS6FPA|5|This is an exact replacement for 2005 Honda Pilot rear window wiper<br />Can not tell the difference between the Honda part and the Trico 14-B<br />Removed the old wiper and installed the new one in under 30 seconds!<br />If you aren't sure how to remove the old wiper on this vehicle, installation videos are available at Trico's website.<br />I wish I saw this item before I spent more at the dealer (last time) and only got a rubber refill, not a complete blade.
B00CMMV45Y|5|This helmet is wonderful, for the price they are asking it is basically a steal! I saw a helmet very similar at a local shop and it was double the price. Do yourself a favor and buy this helmet.
B00IX26X12|5|These mounts are sturdy and look super clean!
B000NCOKZQ|5|awesome
B003AT8HVC|5|i have a pop up camper with an Suv,  so I don't have many bike hauling options. This ball mount solved my problems. I tow my pop up and a 3 bike rack in the upper receiver with no issues. I use the Allen deluxe 3 bike rack and while it isn't the most high end rack, it gets the job done and has changed my camping life. I truly believe the other review is a bit harsh, i haul and use the bike rack and while it can be a little tight, it is a huge relief. I recommend. This ball mount if your needs are similar to mine.
B00S0Q211W|5|Bright and very useful
B0068ES0ZO|4|came right on time with for the weekend install, good quality and look
B000BNMOLY|4|Very good light
B00K1NS0PS|5|Great product and easy to install.
B001CO2JGG|5|added this to my intake as an extra security feature when it rains... looks great and is made very well.
B00HJQ7VK0|5|Works great
B00CZEZNGU|3|It covers the holes from the factory light but is not as bright as the Lumitronics brand. The double switch is a nice feature
B00469JBW4|5|How does one &#34;love&#34; a polishing pad?  It just has to work as designed and advertised, and have a sturdy build so that it lasts a long time.  I use these to wax a large RV and one pad can easily do the entire motor coach.. That is good enough for me to provide 5-stars.
B001AMC77G|2|Ride is very stiff.
B005Y73WZE|5|Excellent works great
B005BSYRLE|5|I own a 1972 Camaro with a 502 big block and my wife owns a 1971 El Camino with a 350. When I first saw this radiator, I honestly thought it was one of those &#34;too good to be true&#34; items. There is just no way someone is selling aluminum radiators (with an in-tank transmission cooler) for this price and free shipping.<br /><br />I placed my order and, within a few hours I had a confirmation e-mail from the company. Nice. A few hours after that, I received an e-mail with a tracking number. A day and a half later, the radiator shows up on my doorstep.<br /><br />Not only is this a gorgeous high quality radiator, it is truly a direct fit replacement. It came with a 14 - 18lb radiator cap as well.<br /><br />Definitely one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon, bar none.
B002V0AJ8U|5|I am not one for decals, but I saw this one and thought &#34;thats original, but not overly flashy&#34;.  I havent seen anyone else with the same decal.  It rains alot where I live and I take my vehicle through the car wash regularly.  They dont budge!
B00BQWQLOU|5|A superior upgrade to the stock lights in my Honda Civic Hybrid 2011. Very bright, I feel much safer on the road at night.
B00BGCZI2Q|5|I love these rugs and how they look in my Benze. Makes the inside feel and look custom. For the price its was a good deal and I preferred them over my factory set. Good work!
B001P2BNNU|5|Got it as a gift for my husband. He loves it.
B001O7HZPQ|5|It was very easy to install, came with all the wiring and works great. It made a big difference being seen when I work on road sides
B00E9E5HOM|5|Exact fit
B000KPU8MK|5|The price it was good ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok okok okok  ok ok
B005T3ZI6E|5|Fast delivery and good product.
B00CPL9SRS|5|This is a great priced method for improving the stopping power of your car.  This is the third vehicle that I have installed power stop rotors and pads on and all three have seen much improved stopping performance.  With the world of text crazy me first drivers on the roads this is a great asset to improve your car's ability to survive the crazy day to day driving commute.  Priced very competitively to other aftermarket products but the drilled and slotted rotors are a great upgrade.
B0031XQRNW|5|I receive this cover in a very short time period so that I could fix the broken cover on my RV.  It was leaking and now is OK.
B002R0OI90|5|Fits my minivan perfectly.
B0017OANM8|4|I didn't notice a dramatic change in light color...which is fine, as I really didn't care if they were \\"white\\" light or not, I only purchased this type because Amazon had them on sale.    They work at least as good and possibly slightly better than the standard bulbs I had before.
B00MQ64EDA|5|I love it.
B000S2ZNWK|1|don't waste your money on this kit, i just bought this to rebuild my 2002 Chevy express 3500 trans. model number 4L80E. I am extremely disappointed with this kit. First i opened the box to find the oil pan gasket folded in half twice, then, i found all the clutches and plates which are fine, and them multiple assorted bags of o-rings washers, seals, and filters. there was a parts list that mentioned the big items but did not mention any of the rings, seals,etc in the bags... upon rebuild many disappointing problems arose.. first the rear seal was the wrong size so had to order it, next the seals for the centering shaft did not fit properly and needed to be hammered in, almost worked until they cracked and i had to order replacements. next many of the wear parts were not in the kit( washers, etc.) upon attempts to rebuild the valve body, the 1 screen filter included was the wrong size and not applicable. many of the screen filters needed were not even included, i had 2 broken springs in the accumulator body which were not included in the kit.. for that matter NO springs were included in this master rebuild kit! The kit had a material list but no diagrams, pics, instructions, etc. so when i called the company about the missing components it was almost impossible to speak intelligently about what i had and what i didn't have...i have rebuilt 4 transmissions in the past and this was BY FAR the most disappointing kit i have worked with. my advise is to find another kit from another manufacturer. This kit was more headache then anything else. i am utterly disappointed and now still without a car as i await replacement parts from the dealer that should have been included in this kit. not worth the purchase
B0079JWMME|5|I stopped my leaky front transmission seal.  Incidentally, I found Blue Devil Rear Seal<br />Sealant to be a good product.
B00C7YOZBW|3|Unit works well but the bolt to attach unit to battery was missing.
B00DSMEL2A|5|I used this on my old mikuni carbs and now they look brand new after about an hour soak. Great stuff!
B001MXM8Q8|5|First off this antenna ball is large and would not be a good choice for the older metal wire antennas.  I have a newer car with the larger short antenna toward the back of the roof which is perfect for this ball.  I bought one for my friends car as it makes it very easy to find her car in a crowded parking lot.
B00CER8GBM|3|youth very good design but I like the quality of the fabric is not very good and is a bit rough
B004J2EHDG|5|It came in good package and works excellent for my jeep Cherokee limited 2007
B0089I56RM|3|The fit and finish of these tail lamps were very nice. Although the functional part was sub par. The first set of lamps I received the RH lamp worked perfectly but the LH LED's designated for the blinker did not work. The replacement set I received was pretty much the same way. I ended up with a more expensive set of spyder tails that are known for better quality LED's. I'm giving a 3 star rating cause they looked good.<br /><br />I wish I could give a rating for the customer service I received. I contacted the seller through Amazon and received a prompt reply with nothing but politeness and willingness to resolve the dilemma. I am very happy and very impressed their willingness and desire to resolve the matter.
B0007VU48K|5|PERFECT!
B00269DMV2|5|The reason for the title,  I have been a witness to another camper driving off with the electrical cord still plugged in. It was ugly.  Hence I like the \\"yellow\\" color of the cord.  Hard to miss unless you are color blind.  I don't want to be that guy.  As for the product, I am very pleased with the fit and quality, but time will tell if it is durable.  For me, the cord length could have been a bit longer than 35', but it works fine in conjunction with my existing 30 AMP RV extension cord.
B00AWN3H4G|5|These are very nice looking  the girlfriend adores them an wanted them.  I ordered them an she put them on as soon as she got them
B0051SUMJA|5|This product does exactly what it was designed to do. The installation took less than a half hour and it looks terrific.
B00B1CLZGO|5|GREAT COVERS, WHIP THEM OFF, SHAKE'M OUT, WASH THEM, 2 SECONDS TO PUT ON. WELL WORTH IT BOUGHT THE BENCH SEAT COVER AND 2 FRONT BUCKETS SEAT COVERS.
B004UBH89G|5|great product!
B0085KGOH0|5|Great product and a must have with travel trailer.  This is already on loan.  One draw back is to store away from the sun.
B000C5SG54|5|I had a check engine light on my 2002 Tundra V8 and it was for one of the upstream O2 sensors.  It is always recommended to replace these in pairs on a V8 engine so that is what I did.  Replacement was very easy and I only had to clear the code with my scanner afterwards.  Truck runs like new again without the check engine light on anymore.
B0041QK5W2|5|Fit and work perfect, very bright on my 2015 road glide.
B0018ICAMO|3|Ive bought these tubes before and have always been happy but this time time they seem weaker. Sometimes they relax and then go back up. They wont last!
B000ARPVOI|5|Thanks
B0049NJRMG|4|Not quite as beefy as I wanted but otherwise it is great.
B000C9IYHU|5|As described happy customer
B004Y9YIU6|5|perfect for headlight surround. I love the blue color (I have a blue jeep) you have to watch for the law, as some cities and state troopers don't care for colorful lights on cars. so far so good, but I don't drive a whole lot at night. also got a clear pack for my white Mercedes and it is cool-looking.<br />Word of note: if you plan to put inside your vehicle (Like under your dash) make sure you have them placed so the glare doesn't interfere with your vision.  The 'glow' will annoy you if you place them in an obvious spot (like along the bottom of the doors).  do a trial application at night to see how it will look before sticking. They are waterproof, so under the carriage should be just fine
B00B02OCU6|5|Excellent piece, with great features that combine multiple functions into one box. Reduces weight, clutter, wiring issues and saves space.
B000ZLSF74|5|Good brush.
B00IHC8GHC|5|Perfect for 08 e9x.
B003IS3HV0|5|&#34;Leather Honey is everything the manufacturer says it is. I used it on most of my dress shoes with great results -- soft and supple leather with no sticky residue. I even tried it on my forty-year-old varsity letter jacket (yes, my wife kept it) with unbelievable results on those tired and cracking leather sleeves. It looks like brand new.&#34;
B000EQAVJ0|5|Just perfect
B00EDSTV00|5|My wife says she loves it!
B002A18DL0|5|These are adorable. Very easy to apply. The color is great and they really cute on my car window. Not too big and not too small. The perfect size.
B00317055O|1|This battery did not come with sulfuric battery acid.  I had to buy some separately and then had to calculate the proper concertration.  What I forgot was the you are always supposed to add water first then add acid to the water.  I did the reverse and the reaction I got was very energetic.  So energetic that it warped the case and ruined the battery.  If you want a better battery at not much more money (you actually pay less because with this battery you also have to pay for acid, and it's also tax free and shipping free) search for MotoBatt MB10U (maintenance free) at impactbattery dot com
B0045YQILW|5|thanks
B0013FMW84|1|Would have liked to try this, but unfortunately, the Post Office doesn't seem to know how to get it to me.    I bought it again - this time UPS got it right to my door.  I used some of it as a \\"de-carbonizing soak\\" in an older motor, which seemed to work rather well.  However, if you're adding this to your gas tank and thinking that the built-in dosing tank will help make that easy, think again.  The dual-spout design doesn't allow you to get the container close enough to the gas filler neck.  So, instead of cleaning your injectors, you're cleaning this stuff off the side of your car.
B00804IG4U|5|Sounds great but for a 2013 gsxr mid pipe is a little long so can sticks out a little far and clamp won't mount to rear foot peg for support. But looks good and sounds bad ass
B000QG0FYE|5|love very cheap easy to put on sounds and looks great I would buy it again.... Honda is the only way to go
B000ZAOJBG|5|These are very good quality seat covers.  Very sturdy and comfortable, made such a difference in the comfort and appearance of our jeep!
B000GV51BG|4|Looks Good working Good !
B006MB5JWU|1|first these are not as easy as it shows to get on your tires but once i did get them on they did work<br /> FOR A TOTAL OF 21 MILES!<br />i live 3.6 miles from work, all back roads, i put these on  thursday morning early we had about 8 inches of snow (the town just does not want to plow this year) and they worked pretty well, the pavement was NOT visibile and i drive like a granny (new 2013 veloster which is my baby) when i say drive like a granny i mean not above 20 mph  any time in this nasty weather.<br />i got home later no problem,.<br />next day still snow on my hill & big time in my driveway and ice on the roads the entire trip to work so my speed was about 15 mph friday am and pm (again i only drive about 7 miles round trip)<br />today we had a snow storm and it fell at about 1 inch per hour roads horrible but i had to run out in it, about 3 inches of packed snow (again the town has done little) and accidents every where, i drove for about 3 miles to my destination (the last 2 of which felt more and more slippery but the snow was  pounding down so i figured it must be the snow worsening)<br />AND TA DA!!!! the &#34;impossible to fall off&#34; snow donuts were not only off but torn to shreds (i was only driving 10 mph the roads and visibilty were horrible!<br /><br />soooo after pulling one off which was attached by a thread and cutting the other one off which was wedged somewhere in my  18 inch low profile rim i was furious.<br /><br />i understood when i purchased these that they are not for anything but serious snow and ice and can not (and were not at any time) be driven on bare pavement and NEVER above 30 mph, well i maxed at 20 mph, traveled less than 21 miles total (over 3 days of terrible weather and threw $80+ out into the snow!<br /><br />i have used chains before and am very comfortable attaching them, these were much better and easier  to put on and did not damage my rims & true  they did not fall off .......but tore off!<br /><br />was truly hoping to get through a few more wks of occaisional use in only deep snow if needed until my bonus comes in  (then i am getting rims and snow tires)<br /><br />not even going to try and send them back for a replacement or refund as i do not have all the pieces and the stuff i did have i tossed away, then parked in a lot down the street after i could  not make it up the hill to my house.<br /><br />again DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! JUNK JUNK JUNK! very unhappy, i am the first reviewer of any kind for these things and this is the last time i will be the first to try something new.....better to wait and see a review.<br /><br />happy new year from a very soggy, snow covered customer!
B000KL3DUS|5|Love these things. Bought them to save my factory floor mats from the winter slush and salt. They may just be full timers though. Great protection for your vehicle's carpet.
B00G04CNIC|5|I have purchased four separate shipments of these already, and they have all been of top quality. I like to disperse them at the local parishes. Shipments were received quite promptly.
B00B7CLYBE|5|Have been paying exorbitant prices at the dealership for my fleet of trucks. The quality of this product is excellent and I am very satisfied
B00651C998|5|Works like a champ!
B00CUN607W|5|Fit great do the job of protecting key fob from scratching.
B004MF95AA|5|Used with BMW type power sockets on my motorcycles. Stays rigid when inserted.  Expanding tip hold strong against road/trail bumps.  Holds the SAE plug equipped electronic devices easily.
B008FCE3BC|5|very good product can't be beat.
B001NZZ8NA|5|Well made and perfect fit!
B00NQI9P04|1|The unit wouldn't fully charge...sort of a basic expectation for a battery.  I returned it for credit rather than replacement.  I didn't want to chance another unit with QA that poor.
B0040DUCGA|5|Reason I bought this is the mirror is not convex, DO NOT BUY CONVEX MIRROR! you will lose the sense of how far an object is.<br />flat mirror gives you the similar distance feeling you have now, but just wider view.<br />make sure check the dimension and draw on the box, cut it, put it on your rear mirror, feel the size. because this breaodway brand has some other sizes too.<br />I like this mirror!!
B009B6IPIS|5|Love this shifter absolutely perfect
B00JHUBUZ8|5|Products were of high quality! Very pleased with purchase. Used them on a bike frame, worked perfectly!! Shipping took awhile, but it was understandable given the distance they had to travel!
B00NFNZ982|5|Air pump works perfectly.
B000E4CO06|5|perfect fit
B008X1D6BS|1|SURE DIDN'T FIT MY CR-V VENTS.  ALSO THE FRONT MESH POCKET DOES NOT ALLOW ANYTHING BUT MAYBE A SINGLE KEY IN IT.  WILL BE SENDING IT BACK
B0009IBJE4|5|Best charger I've ever purchased.  Set and forget it's fully automatic
B000NOUQSY|5|This provides a really nice stream from the shower head.  It turns completely off with the switch so you can shampoo and soap up saving water.  Haven't showered with it yet but it functions beautifully.  Great upgrade and purchase!
B001447VB2|5|Great stuff!
B002P8APRI|5|TYC 1360131 Chevrolet Lumina Passenger Side Power Non-Heated Replacement... Excellent quality and correct to the size of the model 97 chevy lumina 97
B008Z4CH1S|5|Best windshield I have ever had on any motorcycle I have every owned. Easy install just wish they had made it a little more clear that you had to buy the vent instead of hiding that detail in the small print.
B001F0LW0Q|5|NO PROBLEMS
B00KXMTYHU|2|They are really nice to the fact they turn on instantly. Not nearly as bright as an aftermarket HID. The beam does not spead out like a normal headlight. Not worth the money.
B000EVYHOU|1|It's cheap for a reason. On the unit I purchased, the slightest bit of pressure on the gauge from securing it in place freezes the needle in place. It works great as long as you don't plan on mounting it. Also the website printed on the dial makes it look low class, and not in a good ratrod sort of way. Illumination is very yellow and very bright at the top of the gauge and very dark at the bottom. Get a VDO, or a gauge from an old tractor, but don't waste time on this.
B000BY6HCA|4|Fits well and covers the windshield area just fine.
B0010DZZSI|3|Received wrong size for a 2009 Corolla.
B000BO6MFC|5|I bought this along with the Blue Magic 800 Leather & Vinyl Cleaner.  Both were just what I was looking for and cleaned and conditioned my leather/vinyl sofa.
B00I80FR6Q|5|Does what it says. No problems staying up.  Took others advice and closely followed the instructions.  Clean surface a must
B00A4G7102|5|great
B000TKHMWK|5|Great Product- Built well and very handy.  I use it for camping and have it handy for power outage, it keps the phones and TV's running  It is like a little generator, except lighter and quiet, I recommend this product- lots of uses!
B00H1ES6S6|5|Great lights. Fit my 2015 Jeep Cherokee and the color looks great.<br />I had purchased 10 led lights from eBay because the listing said they were white and they even showed a picture with the color. The price was the same as these. They ended up looking more blue than anything once I installed them and honestly, they weren't bright at all.<br />After reading the reviews on here, I decided to purchase these. Once I installed the first bulb, I immediately saw a difference from these bulbs compared to the eBay bulbs and even the stock bulbs. They were brighter and didn't have that blueish tint to them. I am more than satisfied with them. I'm not sure how people can complain about these lights, especially for the price. Make sure you get these, prime makes this purchase even sweeter. Enjoy!
B00OGN85UO|1|Put both rear axles on 5 minutes in trying them out one broke it was malfunction sent back didn't get paid for had to fight with Amazon to get money back.
B0009IQZX4|4|Fits my 06 & 07 arctic cat 400s, and much cheaper than ac's filters.
B001AVQN72|3|i purchased this HID kit for my 2004 cadillac escalade and installation was really easy with minimal tools. the only problem i had with the lights was that on occasions i would have to click my lights on and off a couple of times because the bulb wouldnt come on or it would come on and right back off a couple of seconds later
B008Y396MI|5|just what i needed...thanks
B003ZS37K4|5|I needed a hitch and lights to handle my five x eight utility trailer and this was perfect for that. This was the best price for a light wires that I could find. This was easy to install.
B001DRLPP8|5|Bought and used several times for my OM642 Diesel.  Fits perfectly, includes O-rings, no quality issues, etc.  Don't forget to get the right filter wrench socket thing to remove the oil filter housing if this is your first time DIY.
B00I87ZXM2|5|Great jack for the money!  Very sturdy and easy to store.
B004SNJPV0|5|Our toilet was only one year ols and started leaking.  That made us unhappy as we were camping when it started leaking.  When we got home we ordered this Valve.  It now works fine and we are very happy.  Sure hope it doesn't start leaking again in one year!
B0085CQI10|4|Clear vision, good for my sensitive eyes.  A bit too large for my face so it irritates my nose after a while.
B002FYS14Q|3|The lowbeam is very poor in dark situations, but they do look cool!
B00651BY08|5|The antennae doesn't whack my garage like the stock cherokee xj one. No noticeable difference in signal. But I live in a metropolis area.
B000FGI34E|5|Well worth the cost!! I plan not to use any more paper filters since I've nstalled this one!!  I would recommend to purchase the oil when you purchase the filter so you have it on hand after it is time to clean and re-install.
B009I3514K|1|Disintegrated after 1 season :(. Disappointed.
B0058EHH18|2|The color is exactly as shown. The mats themselves I guess you get what you pay for. The mats already have the material/threads balling up and coming off, it looks like big fur balls all over my car. They will not stay down on your floorboard at all, they slide all over, even on your carpet. They obviously do not have hooks to hook them on your floorboards, which was fine with me as i expected them not to have those, but because of the way the bottom is made, you don't stand a chance of them staying in one spot on the floor.<br /><br />These just really seem poorly made all the way around. I would not recommend these to anyone unless you just cannot afford to get better ones.
B00265FXFY|5|These suckers are bright!  I would definitely buy these again.
B001C9WTUC|5|Worked well, had a problem with another vendor, but no problem with Amazon
B00LOZ9AQA|5|great lugnuts
B002UIPMSA|5|You need the Quarantine Restraint cargo net system for your pickup.    The Quarantine Restraint system is the best product of its kind on the market.  Without looking at any instructions it was on the bed, fully covered the load in 10 minutes.  The carabineer hooks and multiple hook options on the net make a tight fit without any loosening while on the road.  The superb quality and coverage meets our state transportation regulations for fully covered cargo.  This is the only truck bed cargo net system you will ever need for your truck.  Comes with carry case and is easily put back after use.    I've tried just about every other cargo net system.  Almost everything available is the bungee style system.  After years of buying \\"tangle free\\" bungee style truck bed cargo net restraints, they are never tangle free and take me at least 30 frustrating minutes just to get it untangled enough to put it on.  All those bungees are going in the trash.
B001KS25VS|5|I bought these to replace the wipers I had gotten with my car when I bought it last year. I had tried a different brand of wipers, but the aesthetics were really off with the other ones. I found these and bought them hoping they'd look better. They work beautifully and look like they came with the car! I love them! When I need to replace the rear wiper, I will be buying Valeo, too! Thanks!
B002M47A1Y|2|I bought this kit about four months ago and the install was really smooth. Unfortunately, the passenger side light has already got droplets of water on the inside of the lens and I am very disappointed by this performance.
B000FGCY7Q|4|I changed this filter to avoid having to buy an expensive eom for my BMW, it has worked as expected, I haven't seen a big increa in mileag, but he car does seem to have a bi more pickup
B002OUPFOU|5|Great product does exactly what it's supposed to.
B0038G45NG|5|And mess free as well, with a quick wipe from a rag with well place catch bin.  Installed these on all of my cars and love the ability to easily change the oil.
B0091VFMF2|5|I only needed the driver's side mat, why pay Honda more than $160 to get 4?  So far, they're holding up well.  I'm half tempted to order another set or two just to have on hand for the future.  While these are black, not the dark gray of the OEM mats, you'd be hard pressed to notice a difference.  Fit my needs perfectly.
B00AAIHFGO|4|Its not as bright as Id like but the purpose I use mine for are &#34;map lights&#34; so a super bright light wouldnt be practical anyway.
B000CGM1D6|5|The module itself was easy to install but getting to it....well that's a whole different story... (PITA!!!!). Anyway, the module wiring exactly matched my factory harness on my 2000 Sierra 4x4 so it was as simple as cutting the existing connector off and splicing the provided connector onto my harness. All the necessary hardware to make this splice is provided with this module. If your wiring does not match the new connector, the instruction manual that comes with the module illustrates how to properly connect the new connector. I also purchased a new lock ring [[ASIN:B001NZZAGU ACDelco TR14 Ring Fuel Sendor]] and new fuel line retainer clips [[ASIN:B00066UKGM Dorman 800-016 Fuel Line Retaining Clip Assortment for GM/Chrysler]] because my truck is 12 years old and I figured it would be easier to replace everything with all new parts. If you decide to order the fuel line retaining clips, make sure you get the one from the link I added because you will need BOTH (3/8\\" and 5/16\\") sizes. I also went ahead and purchased a new fuel filter [[ASIN:B000C9SR90 ACDelco GF652 Fuel Filter]] as well so I could have all new parts from the pump to the filter. OK, I decided to remove the bed of my truck instead of dropping the tank (again, 12 year old plastic parts and Murphy's Law). Let me warn you...this is still a PITA regardless of whether dropping the tank OR removing the bed. I ended up purchasing a 1-ton engine hoist and a load leveler in order to remove the bed. If you have 3 good buddies to help you lift off the bed, then you may not need to spend any extra money (except for beverages for your buddies of course). Even though I spent the extra money it was WAY LESS than what the dealer wanted for this job (but I can see now why they charge so much). As usual Amazon came through and everything arrived faster than I expected. This module is great and worked like a champ. The fuel gauge worked immediately and the truck cranked right up and idled like it was new again. Thanks again to Amazon for having quality parts and fast shipping!ain to Amazon for having quality parts and fast shipping!
B004LGGOPO|1|I have used Beck Arnley parts on my Mercedes and always thought them to be quality parts.  Not any more. This pump is poorly built and I don't see how a company can sell poor quality parts and not think it will affect their reputation. Amazon was not a problem, I paid $3.99 for 24 hour shipping and it was at my doorstep 21 hours later. I needed this pump urgently for my wife's 1991 BMW 325i. The mounting ring is very poorly attached and fell off when I turned the pump into place by hand using a lubricated 0-ring gasket (included). The ring should be strong and there is no way to reattach it. I did not hit the ring with anything to mount the pump, just turned it by hand and it fell off. Since I needed it urgently and it was already broken, I took the pump apart and tinned and soldered the ring back in place. Then I found that when I tried to mount the fuel sender (no gasket included for that and hard to find), it hit the weld for the standpipe that holds the electric pump. This had nothing to do with me soldering the ring back on. I had to use 2 generic 0-rings stacked to get it to seal. The sending unit also hit the plastic connector for the wires to go to the pump. I did not want to grind on my sending unit to get it to clear, so I took a Dremel to the plastic connector on this pump. I had to grind so much of the connector away that I ground through the seal and caused a leak. My wife really needed this car and drove it like that while the factory Bosch pump (which I should have ordered all along) was being shipped. Anything over 1/2 tank of gas caused gas to leak all over and her side of the garage still smells like gasoline. The electric part of the pump did pump fuel and the car ran. When I finally got the factory Bosch pump and replaced the electric pump itself on the old pump housing, it fit like it should have (although the wires were reversed on that pump and it took me awhile to figure it out). The fuel pump on the E30 BMWs is under the rear passenger seatand is thankfully easy to get to.  When I replaced the junk Beck Arnley pump being reviewed here with the Bosch pump, I found that the mounting ring had fallen off again and the pump was hanging into the tank by the fuel lines and wiring only and gasoline was sloshing everywhere. I build my own engines and transmissions and have a paint booth in my shop.  I know junk when I see it.  This pump is junk and Beck Arnley should not be surprised if their reputation falters due to selling parts like this one. This would have been a disaster if I had to drop the fuel tank to install this pump or if I didn't already have good mechanical skills. Just to be clear...do not buy this pump! This is a substandard piece of equipment and this whole process was aggravating and seemingly neverending. I have never written a bad review on anything before, but no one should have to go through what I did. I had to give it one star because I couldn't give it less. Again, Amazon held their end of the bargain in shipping this fast. I did not return the pump because I took it apart to tin and solder it, ground the standpipe weld down and the plastic connector down to get the sender to fit. I destroyed this pump trying to fix it and had already recycled the box. If you do buy this pump, save the packaging, because you WILL be sending it back.
B000RBILIU|5|I have several flashlights of various sizes and types.  This one is compact and very bright with sharp focus, unlike LED type flashlights.  Best price anywhere was on Amazon.
B0016OXBVY|5|I use it to keep the dust off the new Samsung Blu-Ray player we recently purchased. It gets the job done
B007EEVJ4G|1|Mounted right up looked good but float is stuck fills intake box with gas if u don't shut gas off  now I see why every where else wanted 300 dollars and this one was 75. U get what upay for  a piece of s***
B004X96DW8|5|Had way too many rock chips to begin with but I took my time and my car looks brand new after a clay bar and touch up paint. Get it.
B00M32816I|5|Very easy install. Easy wiring, Everything was in the kit, including a rubber grommet for the wire through the floor. Very satisfied with this product!
B00802G1C6|5|I was a little skeptical. These things work great and are very easy to install. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Would definitely recommend. I will deffinitely be ordering another set for my fog lights come spring.
B003JBCMEE|5|Great part. Got the firewall mount for my truck. Made checking and filling trans a breeze! No more climbing into the engine room with a qt of oil and a funnel.
B002D4BERY|3|Pretty expensive for a little piece of plastic
B002WN585K|4|The CribClicker is a great idea.  No need to dismount the bike to get into the garage anymore.  Very easy to install, took ten minutes for the transmitter and five for the receiver.  Only difficulty is getting the semi-responsive headlight circuit on my bike to properly activate the transmitter.  It's easy at night when I can see the headlight, not so much during the day.  Still a pretty nice accessory for the bike.
B002GTOEBY|5|Came as described and added a great look to my '06 Honda CBR! It's also going to become very useful when i put my bike away for the winter :( looks sharp and i would recommend to anyone.
B000C8ZAQY|5|nice heavy clamp
B00GUF74HQ|5|I love this thing. Anyone who has a truck should buy. I've already convinced 4 of my other buddies to add to their truck. A must have.
B00G9FWHVA|5|I like it, it is well built.
B008G4RMT4|5|when i bought this it was for my Chrysler 300 that was a couple of years ago i just recently got a new car and im still using these. to make a long story short i love this and it has lasted me a really long time
B0007LDXLA|4|Great way to get snow off the car with worrying about scratching the finish.  Simply push the snow off.  Takes off large amount of snow at once without having to go over the same spot over and over again.  Love it.
B0006SH4IM|5|With my detailing business I have used a lot of soaps and the Meguiars hyper wash is the best. Works really well with a foam gun
B00MYF7ZZC|5|this is exactly what i was looking for!  i am using it to hold my loose but necessary items i use every day in my car...it holds everything i perfectly, it sits still on the floor board of my back seat...i love it...AND when i travel, i can use it for trash!  LOVE!
B00BSGLBQW|5|We are full timers in our 5th Wheel RV and do some boon docking when out on the road. These give great light and are very easy on the battery. We have replaced all of the bulbs in our rig and love them.
B0075KB3W2|5|Good for my laptop, love the sticker, it's so cute! I love Soul Eater and I also have a Hatsune Miku one too &#60;3
B0010AYJEC|5|Perfect addition !!!!
B0041LN1L4|5|I had this on my brand new Prius C and there was a white scuff mark on the BUMP SHOX instead of my new little car - first time I took it out and street parked!  I've had many comments about this product and people have taken photos of it so they can purchase one.  HIGHLY recommend this, especially for Chicago!
B000PAM9KO|5|Right size sent promptly. Filters are more expensive if bought at dealerships. Fram is a great product. Very pleased.
B00K35R9UQ|4|good
B00KBQCFQA|3|its ok the simply reason it might be for a scooter more the a Buell blast....it works you might have to adjust the screw on the back so it will honk...the construct is ok too by no mean original equipment or OEM to the pros...other then that the shipping was preety good got there within 2 weeks..which is cool considering it come from across seas...
B000C7YQHY|4|This product works great.  The one problem i would say is the key only goes in one way and it is some times hard to figure out. Stant should make the key doubled-meaning like a car key. Both sides have teeth so there is no up or down.  Over all--A GREAT PRODUCT
B001PQBVO2|5|Whether you call this BMW OEM or Weathertech, it's the high quality you'd expect from BMW.<br /><br />When you receive this, the packaging is all BMW OEM in every way.  When you take the mats out, there's no \\"WeatherTech\\" branding whatsoever, only BMW.  If you look closely at the molding underneath, it will say MacNeil Automotive.  If you look-up MacNeil Automotive, you will see that one of their brands is WeatherTech, which is famous for their rugged rubber mats in every car magazine advertisement section.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the color is a bit more darker/brown than the existing cloth mats you're replacing.  I don't care personally, they still look high quality and the fitment is perfect.  If you look very closely at the picture you'll see the \\"tan\\" on the door sill and the \\"brown\\" of the mats, to see the contrast.<br /><br />This was an easy 5-stars because they also give you 4 of the floormat locking tabs.  You untwist your old and unsightly Velcro holding tabs and then just twist these in.  They positively hold your mats in place.<br /><br />My original mats were 12 years old, these mats help make my car feel like-new again and their high quality ruggedness means they'll more than likely outlast the life of the car and potentially any nuclear attacks.
B0041QEQSG|5|So far been happy with product, although I don't see anything that says Covingtons anywhere (mine has Bassani) written on it. It appears the same.  The packing was excellent and shipping was fast.  The copied pictures were hard to view though and I think a few changes need to be made to the install process such as installing the plugs into the headers 1st, putting the top chrome piece on the rear head pipe(semi tight) before mounting to head. Also if you have a heat deflector on the left side of the engine it will have to go, or it will really need to be cut way down. Spark plug changes will be a little different, not too bad though. Seat back rest lever should be checked on some bikes. I also suggest new circlips into the head even though they say you can use the old ones, my bike only had 3800 miles and my circlips were rusty enough were it made it hard to install them even after cleaning off the rust. Otherwise the pipes have a nice crack when you hit the throttle and the good old potato-potato at idle.
B000CQBICG|1|I found the hydrometer fill line very hard to locate and view. Plus,after using it one time and rinsing the hydrometer with running water I noticed water absorption underneath the information gauging labels. One label became wrinkled after rubbing it lightly to dry. I'm disappointed about the durability of this product.
B000HBIAGS|5|gets any kind of grease out excellently!!
B004ZF4BV0|5|Works great real AC ballasts.
B000KG8KB0|5|Have gotten lots of use out of this. Talked to Actron the other day,doesn't need upgrading after 4 years. Gave me the replacement model number to tell my friends.
B001GMX9OK|5|ez install
B005YST6DU|4|Nice, solid box. Looks great.
B00563S1HA|5|Work's great. Took a bit to figure out how to program. But all is well.
B000CIOYRA|3|It would work for my b3000, or ranger  with the 3.0 if you don't know. but it is a hard plastic I wouldn't mind putting it on but I would like something a little stronger feeling to it since I am hard on my truck
B004SB1YH0|5|easy to use and lasts well after cleaning the windows.  a must have for inside or out side cleaning jobs
B006TYZKYW|5|Good product for the price.
B0067UDCQ6|4|Same as my previous review for the other part, not for the automatic model 1.0 engine.
B000GU5LSK|5|Looks great.  Fits great.
B0039L9PSU|5|This is an excellent tool to have on the workbench. Has helped greatly splitting engine cases and works very well.
B000R3X0WA|5|After looking at other reviewer's comments and trying other generic windshield covers (and failing), I decided to give this product a try. We thought of purchasing a windshield cover directly from Mazda, but Mazda's cover was temporarily out of stock and for the same price, we decided to try the Heatshield. I have been using this product for about one month and so far have been very impressed. One major frustration that I experienced with other manufacturer's generic covers is the size of the shade. Regardless of the size chosen, the shade would never fit well and would always fall down. With the HEATSHIELD, the custom fit is made for the Mazda CX-9 and it fits perfectly! The custom fit hugs every inch of the window which not only increases performance by eliminating any light to enter but also makes the \\"look\\" very professional and sharp. The quality of materials used on the HEATSHIELD is a lot nicer than any other brand that I have used before. Overall, the car is much cooler and I don't experience the \\"heat wave\\" when I open my door now so I am very happy and would recommend this product to family and friends.
B00514C27E|5|Looks great! Easy to use!
B00TZF06VO|5|As advertised, easy repair, to bad the nylon gears don't last.
B009VNMSE8|3|Nice looking gage at a good price.  But it's NOT stainless steel.  So pass on it if you're really looking for stainless, like I was.  Haven't checked its calibration yet, so I don't know how accurate it is.
B002XLHUQG|5|Good product! Does the job.
B0000950PX|1|I made the mistake of purchasing this product only to find out that it was only ready to use in the car, not in my office.  The converter required to make it work in my office cost nearly as much as the refrigerator itself!  Do yourself a favor and buy one of the ones that is ready to plug directly into the outlet in your wall, unless you want to use it in the car.
B00BBGM9JC|4|Good value for the money. However the mats could definitely be thicker and heavier. Overall I'm pleased.
B003Z814SQ|5|Fits right, easy to install and uninstall.  Makes the car look awesome!<br /><br />Check your local laws before ordering, or you'll sound like the rating next to me.  In AZ it's legal.<br /><br />They velcro (using 3m automotive velcro) right onto the lights and come off real easy (not sure why you'd want to take them off).
B006QH54WU|1|M34 blue top. the warranty is two years. mine just died and won't hold charge after 25 months of light use. on a mastercraft boat used 4-5 months during summer and disconnected during winter. ANY battery should last longer than that. AND STUPID ME, i bought this to replace the SAME BLUE top that lasted for the previous 2 yrs. i guess it's time to try another brand
B000IXUBIA|5|Perfect fit fixed my check engine light on the spot.
B000760FX4|5|They were just what my husband was looking for to give our travel trailer more stability.. Great price.
B000E4QM7C|5|Excellent product. Very happy with the supplier. Have recommend to all friends and family. Definitely my first stop shop in the future
B007TG7HVI|4|Worked for around 9 months before falling apart.  Not bad...  Worked great before it fell apart.
B0007VYMUQ|5|This was shipped quickly, it got here fast. Works really good for the 55 gallon barrel . I can control the flow as i am filling smaller containters. I highly reccommend this .
B004NVA7SW|3|Not flush mount for yamaha r6 to small but there nice if you can get them to fit somehow
B00B8KOZZW|4|Easy install just plug and play. Would have been even nicer if there was more LEDs going down the sides. But over all good product.Nice clean look and i liked the fact that the back up light is on the bottom so the light does better lighting the area behind the truck.Good DVD instructions.
B000EBICI2|2|Was somewhat disappointed after opening the Amazon box. The seat cushion came in a zippered vinyl like bag that was torn- don;t know if this was a &#34;re-packaged&#34; item or not, and there was one loose broken bead that fell out of the torn part of the bag as I began to take the Beaded Seat Cushion our of the vinyl bag. The Bead Seat Cushion fit okay on the driver's seat, and the large elastic band slid over the rear part of the seat without difficulty. The four short stretch bands on the bottom portion of the seat cushion barely reached one another- so the two short stretch bands in the bottom front are suppose to &#34;easily&#34; connect to the other two short stretch bands in the rear under the front bucket seat…… not so……. would not recommend this product for purchase given the shortness of the 4 bottom stretch bands… when connected they then cause the cushion to take on a warped or poor fitting… so I chose not to use the 4 bottom stretch bands.
B000VUC51G|5|This was a Christmas present that I had sent.  The recipient said it was a perfect fit!  He love it
B00F9LPJ8S|5|Bought this for my 2006 Hayabusa from another website (better price) and now the bike leaps to life. As an unexpected bonus, it comes with a little bit of foam on one side of the nuts which puts them up higher in the little slots they go in. Because the little foam piece makes the nuts sit a little higher, the included screws can easily reach the threads - nice touch (and why didn't the battery industry think of this years ago?). As far as battery life goes, who knows as I've only had it for a few weeks but I have 2 other similar lithium batteries for other bikes and they all perform well.
B009FUF6DM|3|The colors bleed a lot. It has dyed other products that accidentally got washed with it. The white is now a light green.
B004M02RL4|5|It takes two people to install, but it makes the truck look beefier and nice I suppose, if this is is your need or desire to have. Install is not that difficult, it's more time consuming than anything else.
B000LW1TRU|4|I like this mask. Not sure about how waterproof it is, as I have not yet had the 'opportunity' to find that out. As far as it being windproof, when I ride my bicycle, I can hear the wind, but not feel it (In other words, it's EXCELLENT at blocking wind). You should get a skull cap (if you're wearing a helmet of any kind) or a knit cap of some kind if your just wearing the mask alone, as it has no coverage of the top of your head. Also, it only goes from your forehead to just under your chin, so it won't cover your neck, either. However, it does a great job of covering your ears and keeping you warm, and you can adjust the fit with the Velcro at the back, so it's not too tight or loose. It only comes in one size, and as I'm not certain of the size of my head (though I've been told it's larger than normal, and I need an XL with hats) it fits me fine. I think it could fit anybody from a 10-year old on.
B00BY1W9VW|5|Great product. I used them to rewire my turn signal circuit on my motorcycle. They fit together well and seem like they will keep out the water and dirt.
B00480J4I2|5|PERFECT
B00HNDE10M|5|Nice sticker for my car, a little pricey but the quality is very good.
B002OUVL6G|5|This item was as described.  It arrived on time.  It is easy to use and store.  Great way to protect my trailer's air conditioner from power fluctuations.
B000IZ3M3O|5|Was what I needed. Good price, right part. You may also need a Vapor Canister Vent Solenoid.
B007KPSFKU|5|I know it says for a harley... how ever I put it on my vulcan.<br />took some time to shape it and put it back together but i did and it fit
B006BE0ZBS|5|Great response on shipping...took to a  local ACE Hardware and they weren't sure they wanted to tackle it, but they did and it worked perfect after programming it to my car.
B000F5LIW4|5|My husband is very happy with this.
B000I4JPZE|5|Works only if you have a tandem axle trailer, but then it is a much better solution to lift one wheel then a traditional &#34;jack&#34;. However, you need to test if your trailer assemblies will work. It greatly depends on what kind of suspension system your trailer has and how much lift is required to free the tire from the ground. So if you know somebody who has one. The height lift can be increased when adding a 2x12 piece of board underneath, which gives you another 1/1/2 inch lift if this is what you need to have the wheel completely of the ground.can be
B000VB8C80|1|They did not fit the make and model of my car.
B002XA0PW8|5|I liked the item however a word to the maker . Wiccan and Pagan should never be in the same sentence as accult or satan . They are not the same .
B00BN4B3ZI|5|I'm moving &#34;down&#34; from a H-D full face helmet.  This 3/4 helmet is a good safety trade off as it greatly enhances visibility with added comfort on hot days as a plus.  The HJC FG-JET is of quality construction and affordable at the same time.  I bet that if they slapped a Harley-Davidson sticker on it they would sell for over $300.00.  No need for that, of course.  I will be buying a second one for the Mrs.
B004P1WNBE|3|I didn't notice at the time of purchase that it would not work with the fold forward seat on the driver side.  Either the listing has been updated or it is completely my fault.  Either way, I didn't research enough before picking this up.  After the attempted installation which failed, I picked up some seat risers and tried again.  I'm really happy with the seat risers, but it still didn't fit.  After searching, I saw that Tuffy makes a model with the flip forward seat (http://www.amazon.com/Tuffy-03-06-Conceal-Security-Drawer/dp/B00FI8I75E). I plan on trying this one out, but I'm going to watch for a best price, as I have seen it cheaper on other sites.<br /><br />I have not found a use for this box yet.  I may just sell it on a forum or make a good lock box for the house.  The quality and construction are great. the lining is removable and I would recommend using something a little nicer if you plan to store a firearm inside.  The lock seems sturdy.  If it fit my vehicle, I would rate it higher, but I don't think the disclaimer was very obvious (as many others have had the same issue).  I don't know many Jeepers who own a TJ and don't have a flip forward driver seat.
B000BGJX88|4|This arrived quickly and overall quality looks good. Works as described. It's mostly plastic so you need to treat it accordingly. Make sure you use flat head screws installing. Tapered screws will crack the housing if you tighten too much.
B0012QRXMO|4|I chose these floor mats because they were the correct color and although they are not &#34;custom&#34; fit to my car I only use them in wet Winter months (I live in a very dry area) which only last 2-3 months out of the year.  They work well and have great function for protecting my fabric fitted mats.
B00T74VX24|5|Excellent item
B001UCEMVA|4|beautiful, a perfect fit, not a problem and the shipping was ultra fast! Thank you for leaving me cool in Arizona!
B0001WTY0E|4|So far I like it..Would have been nice to have some sort of instructions. Came with nothing! It came with one tent pole n I have no idea where it is ment to go!
B0001UZUW2|5|Yes it is cheap!  Yes it is awesome!  Yes one of the two I had has broken, but only because it got stepped on.  Have had over a year and if you knew how many flies I have killed then you would  would not even consider the one star reviews.  This thing could sell for 20 bucks and I would still buy it because it gets the job done better then anything else out there.  I live in West Texas so I know fly killers and this is it!
B0001XPC8Q|5|Got it in time for me to get it for Christmas.  Right size and works great in my 1999 Dodge Caravan.  Just the right size and holds my travel mug perfectly.
B00547IVXM|3|Stopped working after 3 months.
B000CINV88|4|Okay Just did a brake job on my Touareg so far no squeaks.
B00B2A2JMO|1|I bought these and they were great, but about a week into using they stopped working. Their great if you don't get a dud
B00MH8EUBS|5|Outstanding Shock...
B000TK5SGW|5|ok
B00YWGSKBY|1|This is by far the worst item I've ever bought off amazon. When I received the package one of the headlights was missing a bracket so I had to make one work from an old headlight and both side lights were broken. The mounting bracket on one was broken and the cover was coming apart on both. Needed to use them to get my truck back on the road so I had to superglue everything together. I won't be surprised if they come off going down the road! I've always had good luck with Amazon but these are pure junk! And the customer service so far is awful! You'd think they would rush you another set but no! They want you to take all kinds of pics and email them in and so they can &#34;see what they can do&#34;! I guess I should have took pics before supergluing them back together but I was aggravated and just needed to get my truck together as the old ones I had were broken from hiring a dear. Anyway don't buy these unless you are pretty handy with the super glue!
B000CBLWIG|5|Works Great and a good price to match
B004K8YK72|5|I have a 2011 ford F150 and this plate holder is perfect, did not need any tools to install, it snaps into place. Very glad I went with this plat holder
B001PWA0IO|3|It works well at first, but then overtime the bolt wiggles loose. To me, that's the weak link of this. Shrugs, at least it's cheap in price.
B005SB6S3Y|5|Arrived quickly just in time for my trip.  Installed easily complete instructions were easy to follow.  I did not use the sway control attachment though my trailer was already drilled for installation.  For the price this hitch does what it is supposed to.  I would recommend.
B004P5G2GM|5|These things are pretty handy, especially when traveling.  You know - I have my cell phone, she has hers, she has her kindle, I have my drink, she has hers, etc.  Bought two - one foe each car.
B000C41L6Q|1|Was listed as a drivers side front window motor for a 98 Caddy. It is for the passenger side front window for a 98 Caddy. Couldn't use. Didn't think it was returnable so I bought another and put that one in the garage.
B001QWP7Z4|3|was a pain to get on had to drill and tap a bunch of custom holes under the hood to get it to work.
B002LPFCBY|4|great kit - good price - same tool as from the tool truck just better priced. I love to support local but when they are double the price we have a hard time with that.
B00KTJ3L62|5|Good job!
B0070CWE64|1|THIS ITEM HAD A TEAR ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKED OLD AND DUSTY DEFINITELY NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED
B002P2TWNM|4|Got the jack foot and it looks well constructed and solid.  Kind of wish they included an inner diameter of the foot in the description so that I could have known it would not work for me.  I wanted it for my pop up camper jack which is apparently a 1000 lb jack and is about 1/4\\" diameter too small to use this foot.
B00EP3PU76|4|Looks good.  Only thing is while it's probably not an issue, I did notice when installing these that there is a spot for a 3rd middle bracket on the frame that's not utilized.  For extra support, it would be nice.  Looks good though!
B009C0MNAY|5|nice bag
B00KJ8C1AK|4|Easy to install if you work on trucks to begin with. I have never done one before and it took me 2 hrs. And that's because I didn't read the instructions before I jacked up the truck. Its only been on the truck for a week but no problems. Had to adjust the steering wheel but on the Ram it is super easy. Makes the truck look tough.
B007W4OQV6|5|Was just as ordered. Easy to install with own hardware. Harley and Yamaha fit great....
B000C9G7OM|3|It did not come with all of the springs listed. Was missing some
B006UH5X90|5|very smooth ride with no bottoming out
B00318NUUA|5|The overhead light in my 2004 Honda Accord was out.  I was very depressed about it because I could not see anything when my doors opened.  One day, I decided to man up and order this replacement lamp.  I popped it in and now, a light turns on when I open my car doors.  What a time to be alive!
B001ECWM2W|2|Installed with both sides being done at the same time and had the alignment, had to replace one side and got another alignment, then a month later had to do the opposite side and get the alignment again.  At least Monroe covered the warrenty and finnally the cost of the third alignment.
B00488GO8W|1|I completely agree with the other two reviewers that remarked about the poor quality. I also owned this keychain for about two months, only had the Jeep key on it, and the blade broke off. It is attached by a small screw not unlike that which goes in eyeglasses. I attempted to fix it twice, the screw head finally stripped, and it's just not worth anymore time. Save your money!!
B000EGAM0I|3|Will have to see with time if it works
B002BQJC0K|2|If you carefully look at these gloves, you will see a small flap near the wrist area. This flap is attached via velcro to the glove In order to adjust the fit of the glove around the wrist. On my third time using these gloves, this flap ripped almost completely off when I pulled on it in order to tighten the fit around my wrist. So given that I had barely used the gloves when this happened,  I cannot really recommend these gloves.  The only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because even with the flap ripped,  I have been able to continue to use the gloves, and they do actually keep my hands warm. But really for motorcycle gloves I expected something more rugged. These gloves seem more like regular gloves you would find at Walmart,  that have been slightly modified to look the part of real motorcycle gear. I am a bit new to the motorcycle ridding thing, but one thing I have been finding out the hard way is that if you try to go cheap on your gear you will wind up buying the same item twice - once when you go for the cheap version,  then again when you find that the cheap version has been found to be inadequate.
B001N729FS|4|I didn't have a problem clamping the switch to the battery or tightening the existing battery cable to the switch.  Due to the size of the battery and thickness of the existing clamp, it was difficult to find a position that didn't cause the switch to bend.  When unscrewed (disconnected) the switch feels like it might break.  No issue when connected though.
B0085Y1FMA|5|great product have purchased one in the past and will definitely purchase in the future, saves shoes and provides great shifter feel.
B002JFEETW|4|Good pair of sunglasses given the price.  It certainly wasn't as well made as the Ray-Bans they were replacing, I would consider it a good value.
B00EJY28B2|4|&#34;LOVE&#34;  the sticker!  thou it has to be on the outside of the car, where car washing and weather will strip it off eventually .<br />Would  &#34;LOVE&#34;  one that can be glued to the inside to  MAKE it last longer.<br />JAN CONTI
B003RWP2GA|1|I guess all impalas with power locks didn't come with remotes because the new remote instructions say toggle stereo to program setting and my factory radio doesn't have it. Guess I lose.
B00UNTU3VO|5|Totally satisfied.
B001IWLL4I|5|WORKS AND FITS GREAT
B001GS0DNO|5|These are the best yet, very easy to install and fit neat. These fit so much better than the last ones, they fit close to the window and do not protrude nearly like the old kind. Gives a custom factory made look, plus they work great for keeping the hot Texas sun from cooking the inside.
B000OKLSRK|2|Poor Lighting !!!<br />Thanks LuKs
B00AQCOGKC|1|Don't know if this is Amazon or the manufacturer's fault but I ordered blue and was sent red. The plugs are color-coded so shouldn't be that hard to get it right
B00KJNYEZU|5|Works perfectly!!!!
B000JWQ8JG|5|Did quite a bit of soul searching before I opted for the Curt 20k Q5 5th wheel hitch. I also bought the special rail mounting brackets for my 09 GMC Sierra Dually. I had the rails installed professionally as there is quite a bit of work installing rails on my specific truck. That cost me $240.00 and that was money well spent. I installed the 7-way outlet my self using a T-harness that plugs into the truck 7-way outlet system. That was quite easy to do except for the drilling of the 2 1/8\\" hole. I bought a metal hole saw for the 2 1/8\\" hole.    The hitch comes in three pieces: The head assembly, the side brackets and the side arms/feet. From here it was pretty straight forward. The side brackets bolt to the side arms/feet with two bolts on each side. I choose the mid mounting holes (there are 3 sets). This turned out to be the right choice because once the 5th wheel was mounted on the hitch, the 5th wheel was dead level. The top of the bed dropped 2.5 inches due to the trailer load and would be slightly more except that I have air springs installed on the truck. The air springs only needed 5 PSI.    Dropping the head assembly onto the brackets is quite simple and straight forward. This unit is extremely rugged. My 5th wheel has a wet weight of 14K and I opted for the 20k because for the price the Curt was less than most other 20k hitches.    It took me awhile to do the couple and uncouple deal but once I got it figured out I was a happy camper (no pun intended). Coupling requires that the 5ht wheel pin/slide plate be at just the right height. For me that was 1\\" lower than the top of the hitch on the truck. All in all this is a great hitch and it looks good to boot. So, for under a $1000 (including the rail install), I think this is the way to go.
B001S80ZV2|5|2011 -This item was purchased to replace original equipment in my 2007 Chevy Impala.  This installed easily and work just as it should have.  The original part had a plastic bushing that failed when the wipers were iced up.  I wish I could have found the bushing but they must not exist.  So I purchaded this and it work fine.  FYI, the chevy dealership wanted to charge me $175 dollars for this part, not including labor to install.  I went to 3 big name autoparts stores in my area (Wisconsin) and they all told me I had to goto the dealership to find this part.  Easy to install and at $75 much cheaper that the one from the dealership.  I recomend doing this yourself, you'll save money.<br /><br />UPDATE - Jan 30,2014<br />Guess what?  The dang thing broke again.  I really wish Chevy would recall this really poor design.  I'll buying another one right now.
B001S7ZT5A|5|it will get rich those bug in the winshiel, nice and clean, better than alot of brand, and thankyou,,,,,,,
B000CFOF5Y|5|Much power. Actually increases horsepower. Improved fuel consumption. More horsepower means you have to give less fuel to get the same result. I think the increase in power is between 10 and 15 horsepower.  Plus you save by not having to buy the factory filter.
B001C6JCBO|5|It fit fine!!
B0019FEM9K|5|Rode through unavoidably deep water on a city street that covered the toes and my feet stayed dry!  Been through one 30 minute medium rain and two 30 minute light rains.  Does not burn or melt on my oil cooled pipes.  No problems.  Great purchase.<br />Wish it was orange, more reflective and brighter, sizing runs a little small, & the rubber sole could be stickier, but you can't get everything.<br />Would purchase again.
B004U8JH84|5|Great stuff and best price at MB
B001GJ7HCI|5|WORKS WELL.
B004UTCVFO|5|Looks perfect on the back of my H
B009DK39OC|4|Easy to mount, lined up properly with the factory location,  It does not come with any hardware, so a trip to the store to get proper screws to mount the bracket to the bumper and screws to mount the license plate.
B005LTIU9S|5|Just used this to replace my leaky AC valve.<br />It was very easy. I was a little concerned that I might get the core out and not be able to get a new one in, but it was no problem.<br />I did the low side first while the unit was on so the pressure was lower. On the high side I figured I might as well replace that one too while I was there. That one is best replaced with the unit off.<br />Topped off the unit with more gas and new caps. Hopefully it will be good for a few more years.
B00GNG9N30|4|Excellent
B001O1L166|4|I purchased this through Amazon as it was much cheaper than the Dealer Price.  If I had to do it over again I would purchase a WeatherTech Cargo liner instead.  The honda liner is flexible and flimsy.  The WeatherTech brand lner I purchased for my wife is solid, perfect fitting, and durable.
B00ATRV3Z0|5|I have a 2013 CRV EX-L.  I received my order yesterday afternoon and have to say that shipping was really fast, 2 days faster than the estimate and was in good condition when it arrived.  My order did come with instructions, which were clear enough for me to install the bars in 15 minutes.<br />Here are some tips when installing:<br />lay the two crossbars one in front of the other, the longer of the two goes in front; look down the length of the crossbar and ensure that the bar will be sloped towards the back of the vehicle (like an airplane wing); hand-start all 4 screws prior to tightening- the end caps on the bars will pull out slightly as you tighten making a perfect fit; the screws have a P1 head, so make sure you use a P1 screwdriver to minimize the chance of stripping the screws<br /><br />That's it.  It really is that simple to install these crossbars.<br /><br />They fit perfectly and look great.  I can't tell if it added any more noise to the drive since the CRV isn't the quietest SUV on the road.  I'm just waiting for my Yakima JayLow kayak mount to arrive and I'll be all set.
B00C8YXH9C|1|Worked initially when I opened the package to test it. Then a month later let my brother use it for his road trip and they wouldn't work.
B00G4AB4MS|5|Nice bike rack.  Will do the job I need it to do
B000BO71UC|5|Nice!
B009E9K5QM|2|First I received the wrong item and No &#34;free&#34; instructions, wrote a bad review, got a phone call saying is be sent the right item and emailed the instructions. I did eventually receive the right item, it appears anyway bc it is STILL useless without the instructions I Never received on how to program the thing! So I have it 2 stars bc I don't actually know if it will even work or if I wasted $30!
B00COYNY2Q|5|Bought it for my husband as a stocking stuffer and he loved it. Good quality, not a sticker which is great because key chains rarely survive on my husband's keys.
B0006HP9X0|5|As with any MSD product, it's pure perfection! And just plug wires with NGK plugs I saw at least 8 horse power gain!
B001FAI9XE|3|These cover some imperfections on the rear of my tub nicely and provide some light protection while adding some aesthetic improvement.  They were a real pain to install though because the holes didn't line up right.  Because of this they aren't sitting perfectly flat against the tub and I have some funny gaps in places.  I wouldn't really recommend unless you're willing to re-drill some of the holes and have a not-so-perfect fit.
B00SIBI8IO|1|Warning New York State residentsIt<br />It is against the law in the state of New York to have plastic or glass over your license plate -buyers beware....
B00M8P2BFW|5|Everything was just like they said.
B001DKSNI2|5|NEEDED SOME ADJUSTMENT TO THE LICENSE FRAME TO MAKE FIT THE CURVE ,BUT LOOKS GREAT ONCE INSTALLED.
B004C6I7WG|3|I recently bought 2 of these hats. One fits me, the other doesn't.  Perhaps that's why the reviews are mixed: quality control.  I compared the two hats.  The one that fits is made of thinner leather and has a smaller seam allowance, where the top and the band come together.  This has the effect of making the top a little larger and may account for why this one fits and the other doesn't. So, if it doesn't fit, exchange it!
B00K850T3U|5|Item just as described
B003CW4ZOK|5|had to convince a local mechanic to do it and they wouldnt garauntee it would work with my 2008 mazda 3 if I didnt buy though them. Works fine and has for the last year.
B005V5EUC8|3|To hard to put in.  I could not even get my local body guy to deal with them.  I retuned them.  They do look good however.  They will charge a restocking fee.  I think it was was a bit excessive.
B00BITHO74|5|Fit and color matched have no complaints with the part and install was straight forward. Would order again without hesitation.
B008XX8IR8|1|Got a lip, didn't even come close to fitting
B007J0V7MO|5|Super bright fit perfect!
B0043AV4NK|3|Works
B000WJ64O0|5|I bought this steering wheel cover to hide the peeling leather on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited steering wheel. I measured the inside dimensions of the wheel, 15\\". I did not have to heat or stretch the new wheel cover, it fit perfectly and looks great. It's also much easier to keep clean with interior protectant.
B00BB6LN9O|5|These have a strong feel, good on vibration.  I will buy these again.
B009QT1KLO|5|Good case price.  I never have a problem starting up the motor.  I will not be putting regular gasoline through the engine unless I am operating it for very long periods of time (It does become expensive to use this fuel).  This seems to be a much cleaner and more refined gas.  I wish I had used this brand of fuel for my new chainsaw; I could have avoided starter problems that I now have.  If you are purchasing a new motor, this fuel is the way to break it in.
B00DN84REQ|2|This doesnt work well with Kensun Kits and 2001 E39.. i had to cut parts of this adapter and had to get creative in order to make it fit... not worth the money and time. Dont buy if you dont want to spend more time than necessary.
B001CMZ6Y0|5|When looking to upgrade your spark plug wires, this may be the missing link if you have a Pertronix distributor. Older models come with the female plug that limits your selection of wires. This cap solves the problem.
B006THWK06|5|I thought for 50 bucks it would get me buy for a while till I could afford a good givi box..... No need for that this box is awsome!!!!! Better than pictured and better than described!! Best money I've spent in years!!
B004N2O3RC|5|Same wattage as stock light,wanted whiter beam color to match led trim around new nissan rouge headlight,I recommend this product..
B001DRNNY4|2|The one I received was made in Korea. The filter is a tad too big.  I had to really force it to get it into the filter housing of my Toyota Tercel.  I'm all for a snug fit, but this is way too tight.  Will be looking for another brand when its time to replace this filter.
B000BUTD8Y|5|This propane cover was half that of the one at my local rv dealer. The white is actually bright white unlike some of the other reviews. There are eyelet straps in the bottom for a bungie cord. The flip up top seems okay, but I have a hybrid camper, so the bed is practically on top of the cover. I can manage to open it and reach in to turn the valves on or off, but it's impossible to see anything, so I just tend to wait until the bed is up and pull the whole cover off. It fits snuggly and I do use a bungie cord, but I probably wouldn't have to. Don't waist your money at the rv store!!!
B00JA3BMDW|5|Great product, practical and fairly accurate.
B00J04AICW|5|Very good
B006H34BUY|4|I've only been using this for a week or so but I LOVE it!  I have tried many interior &#34;wands&#34; however many of them leaves small remnants of their own behind when using (such as the red colored one that is highly reviewed on Amazon).  This wand wipes dust/dirt off the dash amazingly and really works well for quick dusting your stereo and other parts of your car!  The only thing that I would say is a &#34;downside&#34; of this wand is the handle feels pretty cheap and I'm worried about how it will also over time.  That is why I would give it 4 stars rather than 5.  However I would still highly recommend for anyone who is a little OCD about their car like me :)
B004JCEA1K|5|Smooth transaction. Item was labelled properly as Wix 49450 air filter / cabin air filter. This fit my 2012 Kia Optima SX perfectly with no issues. Item was in sealed package. Shipping was quick and without error. Great transaction.
B005N6XC8I|2|I am a size small and I ordered the medium for extra room. I could barely get the shirt on.
B006YBAVA8|5|Great!!! Couldnt wait to get !!!
B00SUTHIVM|5|Just picked 2 of these up and they are great! Just fyi I got them at harbor and freight for 12 bucks.
B00158SFNK|5|Excellent fit--fast service--satisfied
B00PIV8J36|5|The item took a while to get here, and probably got lost somewhere along the line, however Monica was very understanding about it and shipped the item out as soon as she could. The sticker itself is very nice, clean and resembles the picture perfectly.
