B002YI74U0|5|We've been using this for about 5 years now and it works GREAT!!! It out performs all the other products on the market that we've tried.
B00ISCPSC2|4|Fit well, use caution installing, grippies are sharp!
B00KB47G9I|5|It delivered very quickly and I'm very happy it looks like a very nice machine I like all the options on it
B0084UJH8Y|5|Fit perfectly, no drilling, looks factory.
B00BNX89QA|5|Works with my car.
B00029KC2K|5|Very Sticky. Used it for heat shield on my Mini Cooper. All Good!!
B003Z9T33I|5|I've had this a couple of months now and haven't been disappointed. I wouldn't buy it for the gas mileage benefits people talk about. But for a cover it is very nice. The latches work well and removing it is a breeze. I love it!
B000TYWI16|4|Need to include end links in kit due to added thickness of bars.
B002TUGTRC|5|Incredibly good product and top notch construction.  Very happy with ease of installation and look on my motorcycle.
B00DDZIU4C|1|The smell lasted like 2 days.  Would not purchase again.
B003172AAW|5|fit well, bit smaller than factory filter.looks great.2014 Harley ultra twin cooled and now oil cooled too.oil pressure stayed the same and it seems<br />standard oil filter anti drain back valve not needed,as this filter does not have.no noise at start up or minimal (normal)hyd tick for 1-2 seconds
B00KMYYQ36|3|Great waterproofing, but no UV protection. After reading mixed advertising claims about its UV protection, I contacted the company. Their reply was that &#34;since its a topical coating, it gives a degree of UV protection, but no inhibitors are added. &#34;<br />Its the best waterprooker I've used but the ads are misleading about UV and I consider their response rhetorical.
B000CPZWZQ|5|Just what I needed
B003JU71YG|4|Highly recommend for anyone changing their transmission fluid on an older vehicle.
B00BDVHT0O|5|I bought it for a range rover sport with the 4.4 v8 worked great dealer quality for aftermarket price
B006PAZ0IG|5|been using this coil for over a year, works the same as the factory coil that came in the lexus rx 300. buy this.
B0009YDQEE|4|Very nice mats for the price.
B000CN9ALA|5|Great product. Thanks very much.
B00BYJNWBU|5|nice
B001KW00NY|5|Loved it!!! Very good for the price. Really recommend getting the 2 master lock 12ft straps and the mat, to go under the cargo bag.
B00L4G91V8|5|Replaced a GE capacitor with this one that was 1/3 of the price. Installed myself today and it works great.
B009DJB7F6|5|Great quality, and solved my issue!
B00V59GCOS|4|good product
B000BNZPSI|1|Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. First off the supplied screw isn't long enough to mount it and it doesn't even give a false sense of security. The cheap bezel that comes with the kit almost falls off without even touching it, leaving the lock rods right there. I was able to remove the bezel and with a small pair of pliers open the tailgate in less then 20 seconds.
B004J2NGU6|5|This added AUTO-HEADLIGHTS feature to my 2010 Mustang that has the light sensor in the middle of the dash.  This one doesn't have the fog light switch which is exactly what I wanted since I don't have fog lights. Made by FORD.  Love it.  It was so fun to install.  No tools.  5 minutes.  Search for videos or instructions for replacing your old switch.  Some use tools or pry against the dash.  I didn't need to do either.  I just pulled on the old switch by pulling on the center knob and it will pivot from the bottom and the top will come away from the dash.  I pulled and used fingernail to pull out on the top.  EZPZ.
B010E599UM|5|Beautiful. Bought 10 to give to friends n family
B0012ETJ1O|1|If you go to Sylvania website you will see the lifespan of these bulbs is rated at 150 hrs which might explain why some experience failure after a short period of time
B008G1WI4G|5|Fit and look awesome
B00IGDP5MQ|5|perfect
B000F5JM0O|4|Just received the tool but have used similar pliers and is the best way to remove spring hose clamps. I will update the review once I've had the chance to use it.
B000C36BGW|5|Belt fit my 1999 Camaro Z28 perfectly.
B00JRPBCJ2|3|don't care for the cheap plastic!
B004SX5HM6|3|The Lights are little bit flimsy but they have worked pretty well till now. They are visible during day but not as great as Lamphus ones. Then again, this whole set is less expensive than a single 4 LED Lamphus Light Head. So I guess you get what you pay for. I do have a separate controller for the light:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008VXSX7U/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_62<br />The stock one is not that great. You have to push the controller button every time you turn on the lights and that can be very annoying. I would suggest to spend a little bit more money and get the above controller. Also for someone who does not know anything about car electrical wiring these lights can be difficult to install as they don't come with proper instructions.
B00FJDL0J8|5|Great product for tires and black auto trim. Last much longer than armor all. It's viscous but goes in smoothly and does not streak and spot the truck when you drive. I apply it with a sponge.<br />I'm impressed at how long this product keeps the black looking terrific.
B009432Y1C|2|Take good care of her.
B000CO9P9Q|2|Their a little weak, not much better than the worn shocks I replaced.
B006EGAIII|1|The worst vehicle ramps I have ever used. Actually, I haven't used them, they slide and slide and slide, so I haven't really used them yet. I have tried to figure a way to use them, but so far, no luck. The ramp &#34;angle&#34; is also too steep which adds to the sliding problem. I tried to build a ramp with plywood, but that didn't help any. Not sure what to do with them now, probably just another &#34;dust catcher&#34;.
B004C443R6|4|Good
B00496VQPO|5|Solved emissions problem.  No issues what so ever.
B004INIUQ6|1|This said it would fit my 2015 Hyundai Sonata but it doesn't. This product fits 11-14&#34; and my Windows are 15&#34;  I'm past the 30 day return because I wanted to wait until I could tint my Windows before installing these so I'm out nearly 50 bucks. Not happy.
B003C1D0L0|1|This shield is complete junk.  While it fits the helmet appropriately, I was only able to wear this shield on one ride, as the insects that struck the face shield, pitted it.  I wiped the shield as was discussed in other reviews, and now the shield is unusable, as the finish is rubbed off in areas with only gentle pressure with a soft cloth.  In my opinion, I will pay extra money in order to get a shield that will last more than only one use in compared to this overpriced junk!!!!!
B000AUU6R2|4|it was a knock off but it did the job
B00K6X5HT0|5|I have a GS Corvette. My detail guy told me to use this product and nothing else. It is truly amazing. I have my Vette ceramic coated and it is a breeze to spray it down and wipe it off. I do that daily. If you use it on your windshield it acts like RainX-water just beads up and flies off the windshield. BTW It's an all purpose product. I use it on my windows in the house and the quartz countertops in my kitchen and bathrooms.
B000C5FQY8|4|Would love to give this Motorcraft water pump five stars as it was an exact replacement for my Ford Focus SVT however the package was missing the four bolts that were supposed to be within it.
B003IOITIK|5|Excellent reader; works every time.
8900702866|4|works great
B003IOITIK|4|works fine
B00REJXVEW|5|Excelente
B004V714NU|5|Bought for my 2005 night train Exactly what it said fits great and quiet.
B0087NB1IW|4|Works great with my speed and strength helmet. I do wish it had better instructions because it took me a while to get the headphones placed appropriately. It's easy to use between GPS and music. The phone calls work great they hear me clearly and I hear them clearly. Sometimes Siri on the iPhone doesn't understand clearly. I am overall satisfied with this product. I have yet to test the intercom on it because I don't rise with anyone that has an intercom
B00EC1QUX4|5|I was a bit reluctant to order this because of some reviews I saw. Like it didn't fit without forcing it or that it was not packaged good and there was damage. But, I ordered it anyway because the price was so good. I received it very quickly with NO damage at all. Last night I installed it and it fit great with no problems. It looks so good on my Ruckus. I am very pleased with this product.
B0066SMIYQ|1|Did not fit at all. Alignments were off a bit which would have been workable had the piping not been too long. There was no possible way to get it in without re bending and somehow shortening the tubing to the banjo to go around the rack system and re angling the banjo section properly. Looks very close, which I compared as much as possible before removing the old one.  Now that I have drained everything and have it all taken apart, I can't do anything but try to find a correct one to install before I can drive again. Poor quality department in manufacturing.
B00FZHFNPU|5|Perfect replacement part for my 2007 Dodge Nitro SXT!
B0010T6SC4|5|Great fit .great price
B00HJ07MFU|5|Took care of my ABS dashboard light. Works fine.
B00266Z8MQ|1|They looked good when looking at the headlights from front of vehicle, but did not produce any sort of beam. I Couldn't see the road at all only reflection off signs and lane markers.
B001DRJMZI|5|Original equipment filter for Volkswagen, well built quality part.
B009F463Z8|3|I recently purchased these hatch supports for my 2004 Nissan 350z. Even though this product isn't supported by Amazon Prime, it got here in two days. The installation was straight forward just keep in mind the Lift Supports Depot hatch ball screw is 13 mm, not 12 mm like the oem. I opted for the stronger supports because I have the Nismo wing and was hoping my trunk would pop open when I hit the trunk release. Unfortunately, I still have to press the button two times and manually lift the hatch. This was a little disappointing, but at least my hatch will stay open now.
B002WNEROS|5|Perfect fit. Sturdy.  Works well.
B003YJJHI0|2|Used a few times and a crack developed in the metal with the orange grip that screws it onto the facet causing it to leak.
B003S0B9EA|5|This was exactly what I was looking for. I used to have a hanger that I put my suit jackets on but it kept falling during the car ride. I recommend this product to any person who has to wear suits for their job, and travels a great deal in the car.
B0033QNZZ0|5|Best price for a phosphate free antifreeze/coolant.
B000E3XIPM|5|Awesome! Haven't had a penny of gas stolen since install. Has already paid for itself
B00IUWLZMW|5|Works for me. Probably will buy another.
B00EDELV6G|5|Fits great
B001TXWNLQ|5|A ok
B00A7RORXM|5|Works as advertised , now have cd audio quality in my Lexus is300. Much better than fm transmitter quality or cassette aux adapter quality . Plugged right back into head unit , about 30min install. Hiding small receiver in glove box .Charges my iPhone and plays great quality music with no distortion or fuzzy feedback. Would highly recommend
B000FGEF6Y|2|The cost accurately reflects the cheap material and construction. The cup holder thingies are flimsy and difficult to adjust.  It will do for now as I only use my truck infrequently to haul and I really just wanted a place to put a drink on my bench seat.  I would not recommend or buy again.  I will look for a better made product when this one breaks, which probably won't be too long.
B00C6OHG14|5|Right part, fast delivery.
B000UD6BN2|5|Fits nice without pressure. Great for under a motorcycle helmut.
B00MQ186JI|5|Great product.
B00FU9FKB0|5|fits good
B00JN2N5C6|1|It was NOT what I needed- I was maile an antenna that didn't fit my Mini Cooper! It was a bad experience because before it ordered the antenna I made sure that I read the paragraph that states &#34;make sure it fits your model&#34; and after within 14 day for it I be delivered from china it didn't fit!! Bottom line I still NEED an antenna that fits my Mini Cooper
B006ACYYK4|4|Do u get right and left for that price
B00S4YA1K8|5|YES this item is perfect
B00R19G8RW|5|great tool used it very often
B00JN0U4SQ|1|it just look good that's all, nothing fonctional!
B0000AY9V5|5|This winch was a replacement for an original Fulton winch, the rating was 100lbs. more than the original winch. Very pleased with the performance .
B00JMXASIA|4|Good but they have to be trimmed to fit in the indented area.
B00331SGPO|5|My trunk looks official now. Fit perfect, like a glove
B00FFUGRGQ|5|Could have instructions. But everything else was spot on. Works great.
B000F3XZWC|5|Perfect feel and weight, this thing is great.
B005JJ0D22|5|Good product.
B001KS8710|3|Mirror worked out  pretty goood..
B009EKVOSY|5|Fits perfectly!
B00FBKJ2BW|4|It came quick and worked perfect.
B001PYLEFU|5|Good quality replacement at reasonable cost shipped quickly
B00TUKYREQ|4|This was an inexpensive package that fit my new yellow Kia Soul and gave it a bit of color on the inside as well.
B009613RT0|4|bolts needed a little tightening, but fits perfect
B00AERSDWG|5|This came at a perfect time, I'm using it on everyone's car lol
B000WJDFZQ|3|Uni filters are always the way to go. Oil them up and put them on and it gives a little boost of power to any atv, dirt bike, or scooter. But this one has a smaller inner diameter than stated. It's only a few millimeters smaller but for me it was just too small to use. But I'm keeping it because sooner or later it'll fit something. And this is a great price compared to other places.
B00439Q05S|5|Pretty easy installation and the pack includes everything you need. My only complaint/concern is how will I open the lid if it fails... other than that I'm happy with the purchase.
B002E363SY|5|Fit exactly in 2001 GMC Sierra.  Solved my &#34;low coolant&#34; warning light issue as well.
B001Y8L65U|2|The product does not have the same adjustment handle as advertised by the picture.  The manufacturer switched the product.  It's more difficult to adjust the support.
B000FOJSHW|5|Okay
B00KTHVTCW|5|Worked great, easy to program.
B00AN6XUC6|5|Carry one under my seat and never worry about my kickstand digging into a soft surface.
B00THH9I7I|4|Works.
B000B8LKVY|5|The cap fits the extension tank of 2004 Jeep Liberty 3.7 perfectly. Hopefully I'll never find out if the pressure rating is right, but at least it goes on and off just as easily as the OEM one.
B0066T97TO|3|Looks good , Quality is Questionable tho !
B002Y35NRQ|5|These are great. Same Identical coils with the Toyota part number sanded off and about 30 bucks cheaper. Supra idles stronger and smoother, pulls harder all the way to redline.
B004SCETXU|5|My 2000 Chevrolet Silverado did not come with a front license plate bracket, just two holes drilled into the bumper with nylon nuts inserted in the holes to attach the place. I removed the license plate and placed the bracket on the bumper. The holes on the bracket matched up with the same two holes that originally held the license plate so I used the old license plate screws and attached the bracket. Then I used to bolts (my own) to attach the license plate to the bracket. Worked perfectly.<br />Can't believe I waited 15 years to purchase a bracket (during which time I went thru three sets of license plates because they became bent and twisted in a car wash) but then I didn't shop at Amazon years ago and I didn't want to pay the dealer or parts store price for a sturdy bracket. For $10.48 it is a great bracket
B001FAM3O0|2|Just love how it says &#34;Incl. Hardware&#34;. How am I supposed to instal without any of that? Especially when I read that it says it comes with hardware.
B001DBVPY0|5|easy installation. came with everything you need to bolt right up in less than an hour
B00BGBICVG|5|great...
B00K72C1T4|5|I use this with my tractor and it works very well. Battery is fully charged when needed and charger is easy to use. I hooked the spare leads that came with the battery charger to the battery and the quick disconnect feature works very well. I would be happy to buy one again.
B003V55TCA|5|Wonderful addition to our car. Thank you SO MUCH!
B004DRYQ3I|5|fit was exactly as advertised, and unlike the other reviews the adjusters worked
B000ER47ZS|1|This looked really crudely drawn, so I threw it away.
B003YKXTV0|5|Good price
B00Y85UM7O|5|These are fantastic.  I go on road trips and sleep in my car.  1st generation Scion XB....but in the summer, it can be hot and stuffy unless you open the windows.  These are great for car camping, as you can roll down the windows,  let the  fresh air in  and keep the mosquitoes and flies out!
B00IKJPVMU|1|Do not buy. I ordered these left and right sway bar links for my 2004 Honda Civic EX and they were not identical; One looked like a generic version of OEM and the other looked like the Moog one in the picture (which it clearly wasn't moog). After a month the rubber came off and exposed the joints to the elements. Buy something else.
B009902Y4C|4|Works good
B00CF280LM|5|Installed these on my 2000 Cougar, looks fantastic. Did have to figure out where the hell to put the ballast and stuff however, also one of the ballasts does a kinda loud hum when starting up and slowly dims over time. Not sure how worried i should be but time will tell.
B000CPI0QO|5|Great +++
B009SGHGAY|1|Part was dead new, installed it no signal completey dead
B00J00X5YO|5|Excellent oil I have used it for years without any problems
B00V30J86I|1|My wife refused to use it
B00S75GNMO|5|Awesome product works great easy to install and great conversation starter
B00F26ZKAW|5|Just as expected
B006OQ35GU|5|good to see when tank is clean using the tank flush hook-up.
B0068MUI1U|5|great filter
B0049OOY4G|5|Thanks it's great
B004KEIU1S|5|They seem cheap, but they have done a great job of keeping dirt out and keeping the tire light sensors from coming on.
B0106NWDW8|4|Great product they had delivery before the date.
B001G9KC1G|5|this makes me regret not having found this product back when i had my previous bike.  i almost never washed it because it was such a hassle.  the appearance had to get to the point of embarrassment before i took the trouble.  this is almost NO effort.  rinse the bike, spray on soap, leave for 15 seconds, rinse off.  the hard part was just toweling down the bike to prevent water spots.  15 minutes tops.  you can really see where you missed cleaning,  the shine is so different than the dirty areas.  no wax in it, though, otherwise i would have wanted to give this six stars out of five.
B000CPJLJO|5|GREAT PRODUCT COLOR IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED
B00GJKXW8M|5|First Kawell lights I have purchased and I couldn't be happier. The second i had them in and saw how bright they were I was already shopping for my next set. Far better then any of that Autozone or Walmart crap. And cheaper too. You would be nuts to get anything else.
B0083SL82A|3|Inexpensive, burt wouldn't work on my bike without major mods.  I gave them away to someone who could use them - the 7/8 bar must be hollow, with no fixture as mine had to hold the OEM bar-ends.
B002UV1FUQ|5|Excellent performance. Easy to install and set ride heigth Without Playing with the spring load.!
B002E3648I|5|I had a 2002 Altima with a P1456 Evap control code.  I ordered this valve and replaced it along with the charcoal canister (due to seized bolts).  Drove the car through its Evap monitor and it passed.  The valve works perfectly, and it comes with a new O-ring and bolts, which I was a little afraid would be missing. I had the part shipped over night and it was at my front door the next day, for 4 bucks! If your Altima is driving you crazy with this Evap code, you won't be disappointed (assuming this is what your car needs of course)
B005WIS2M8|5|We camp offtin and this was a way of internment. Doesn't take up to much space and packs well.
B00AAXKQME|5|seems higher quality than the original part.  fits like a glove, works well,
B008E9110W|5|Really bright as descripted
B00BEDNXTW|2|I purchased these from Amazon Dealz Warehouse earlier in the year, but had my first chance to use one during my last camp out of the season.<br />I wasn't overly impressed. I bought them because I down sized my rig and had less space to store jugs of water, so I figured I'd try these. After hooking it up my first use of water was for the toilet....thank goodness. When I flushed the water was black I guess from crushed activated charcoal. Then I noticed that the water had a brown tint to it after that. This is not common for the camp ground I was at, but I checked other sites that were empty, and that water was brown too. Wound up  buying some gallon jugs of water for consumption for our cooking, coffee, and the dog.<br /> The charcoal issue I can deal with, just run water through before the first use, but it didn't filter well on the tainted issue. I did pull the filter off and the water was a darker brown, But I guess I also need to find storage room for consumption water and a better in line filter for brushing teeth, shaving, and washing.
B005E3AWJW|5|Worked great
B002T644SW|5|all the part need to fix the problem, must be a common  problem, wind catches these disks and strips the plastic teeth.
B002GQDABM|5|I purchased this net to go over our stuff in the roof rack. It is made well and looks great.<br />Plus the cost is well worth it.
B002TS2ZSG|5|Outstanding
B00171Q3HU|5|works great thanks
B000IYY7S4|5|Half the price the dealers wanted and a perfect swap for my 2009 Chevy Traverse
B0023VDVP0|5|Great product
B000EDQR3M|4|Attached on the RV screen door to prvent grandchilds from destroing the screen.
B007QV5U7Y|5|Excellent wrench holder at a great price. Very happy with purchase.
B009D5WV9Q|5|Nice product, good construction, fits very well. Some of my friends told me they can get this cheaper, I've had some of the cheaper ones in the past, and they're nowhere as  nice as this one. You get to pay for.
B008E7RELE|5|Installed this on a 94 jeep cherokee sport with no issues,good quality.
B0009TCRB2|5|saved my bacon
B000CRBQKE|5|i can't say enough about these clamps. They work well and look great. They also never need to be re tightened.<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks and limitations though.<br /><br />First and most important is you must be able to get at the clamp with a heat gun. That access must be all of the way around or mostly so.<br /><br />The other issue is that they must be destroyed to remove them. These are a bit pricey (one drawback) and if you frequently need to remove that hose this is clamping it would get expensive to keep changing them.<br /><br />Still though I use these anywhere I can and anywhere they make sense.
B00RFLIVZS|5|Works great
B00MJ7SZK4|1|The product looked great when I had them installed. They had a cool different look on the car that no one else had. It was not hard to install, and the wiring was very easy.<br /><br />Then about 2 months after the install is what makes this a 1 star. Almost the entire Left side lights went dark. The Right side of the cars is perfect, but the other side has already gone out. So I was kinda bummed, but figured there is at least a 3 month warranty on them right? They are LED's they should have a year, but if not at least 3 months.<br /><br />So I email iJDMTOY about the issue, they tell me that they have a 90 day Warranty, I purchased them May 16th, 2015 so the 90th day should be Aug 16th 2015. I am writing this review on Aug 7th, 2015 which is still in the product Warranty period that they told me via email. They received the photos that I will include here, and they tell me that I need to remove my current product and ship back them the defective one so they may test the item. Once they determine that the item I shipped them back is defective they will issue a new one. That is all fine, however it takes 3+ hours to remove the bumper and then you need to reinstall it, which for those who are counting that would require me to remove the bumper an extra time when I know it will be unnecessary. To me it just makes complete sense that you would rather have your customer do less work as needed, send them out the replacement product that EVERY other company does in the US, and have the customer return to you the defective item. So I called up iJDMTOY and they said that is their policy, I will next time think twice before I buy another LED product from them, and I am worried about the stuff I have already purchased through them.
B00KTHQR0Q|5|Shipped at noted. Had keys reset and the new fob worked as it should.
B002NGCO30|5|Great product! Worked wonders on our coin trip !
B00NRVFAD6|5|Product seems great - delivered on time, their in but headlights don't work, do not know if it's the bulbs or my Lincoln Zephyr, probably not anything wrong with the bulbs, have to take it to the Ford dealership to see what's up with my low beams. sigh
B00FRHODI6|4|Very good wiper blades and good price.  I would buy these again.
B005LHN248|5|I love it!!!!
B008971VOK|5|Very nice!
B00G12XNN2|5|Must use heat gun, looks good, hard as nails after applied
B004M4WHHE|2|kinda cheap looking
B00EZ9Y33W|5|It works great as one would expect.<br />For my purposes it wasn't exactly what I needed,  but since it had a switch, fuse, and relay I bought it.<br />I ended up doing some cutting and soldering  to use this harness on my 1986 Honda V65 Magna motorcycle.<br />I'm quite pleased with the switch since it is being used outdoors. We got 5 inches of rain the other night and<br />I had parked my bike outside.  In the morning the switched worked just fine so it would appear to be watertight.<br />I have NOT hit it with the pressure washer at the car wash yet though...  I fully expect to buy another one when<br />I install driving lights on my 1983 Honda V65 Magna.
B004SL8432|5|Work great
B003BZD03K|5|keeps the kink out of my hose on my camper
B00L1S0JU6|5|This is an excellent drying towel. It is really absorbent and does leave any lint. I love it. It is huge so that I could easily dry my entire SUV with it. It does beat the chamois as it absorbs the water without leaving  any smudges or scratches.
B00KMR3F8U|5|Very easy to install and works wonderfully. Very Bright. I opted out of using the mounting brackets because where I mounted it seems it will stay out of some of the elements and the double stick tape seems very very high quality. Just make sure to wipe down the area you are sticking it with window cleaner or rubbing alcohol to remove any wax.
B00NHW8UDM|5|Fit and work perfectly. No issues. Also, some of the factory bearings are only sealed on one side, these are fully sealed and roll smoothly.
B00MPF2KU6|3|It sucks that it doesn't come with screws. I looks cheap but I'm settling since it's just for my 95' Corolla
B000C1MWAS|5|So bmpin
B00J0DTFCC|5|Very nice
B007DFWO40|5|Got exactly what was shown. No problems with delivery. Thanks.
B00KTJ1PLU|5|It took me 3 tries and then it worked.<br />I turned the key to run and then to off 4 times really fast, waited for the chimes to stop, pressed a button on the fob and it worked.<br />Great price too.<br />Thanks!
B001O0TO5C|5|So awesome
B00407CK5W|4|Fit perfectly, exact replacement on my RV
B002R0OIUO|5|Fast, free shipping. Great price & product.
B002IV4ZW8|4|Excellent lock set.  Make sure to lubricate with graphite spray every so often.
B00CU6B6A0|3|Works well
B002CXAQ02|5|Great product, nice packaging
B000C024DO|5|Just installed this on my 95 SC300 5 speed this evening. Works as expected. No problems installing it. I also installed it with a Centric Parts 136.44210 clutch main cylinder at the same time. Both seem to be working fine and fixed my problem of the clutch not returning to the top position after full depression. Remember to flush out all the old fluid completely! It was pretty nasty after 205K miles.  The pin was a bit hard to get into the rubber boot, I used some silicone ultra disk brake lube and that worked fine.  I used this stuff because it doesn't degrade rubber like some lubes do.
B00SXKS9FW|5|love it , fit perfect , excellent product !!!
B000SL4AA2|1|It only works for Like 2 or 3 times  then it dont work
B00UCHRENW|5|A simple addition to my F150 with an impactful aggressive look.. Easy to install. I had no idea how to install the lights prior to opening the package and i managed to install them in 30 min thats including time to hunt for two tools. Strongly recommend!
B009FU5G6O|5|Perfect replacement for the factory struts on my 2004 Mini Cooper s. Easy to install. The ride is much smoother now, and the cornering has been improved.
B0075XI71O|4|Excellent. Thanks.
B004GELT0G|4|good product, received fast,
B00192JGN0|5|Does the job!
B002696FA2|5|Works great.
B0002SR8AK|4|It did the trick in a difficult situation
B000LG27GS|5|I bought this as a replacement for my Gibson muffler on my Dakota. Everything was the same only I had to adapt from 2.5&#34; up to 3&#34; for the muffler inlet. Other than that, it works fine.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|these wash well.  does exactly what it says it will do.
B00JLJPKNI|5|I haven't installed this yet (my original one is still working) but it arrived on time and looks as it should.  I'll update the review once I install the part.
B002OUMVWY|5|Excellent quality at a great price, good fittings with no leaks. I would reccomed to anyone needing a replacement .
B00V30J86I|1|Not good to install so it will hold items and yet be able to retrieve them when needed.
B00B57V99S|5|I was very well pleased with my benz dashboard cover. The delivery took a little bit longer than I anticipated.
B00TQ07IOQ|1|Mats are thin and look very cheap, I had to gave them away
B004LGPHE8|5|So have had this radiator for a couple of months already and this radiator is great it is the original size as the old one. They make a thinner radiator that works the same as this one and is cheaper, but would probably have less cooling capacity due to the thinner design, I rather pay the extra get it as original as possible and avoid a bad day like leaking coolant and blowing a head gasket or something.
B005GL8RRG|5|Excellent shipper received earlier than told.  Fitted the car excellent.  Would recommend product and shipper
B00AVXR2YS|5|Work perfectly. Very smooth.
B005IUC60E|5|Worked like a charm. Kept tool, especially the thread cutting tip, well oiled. I used the Chrysler Top End carbon cleaner to soak the plugs for 24 hours. I slowly worked the plugs back and forth. ..loosen 1/4 turn, then tighten 1/4 turn. Only broke 1 plug. It broke on the 1st 1/4 turn before it even soaked. I also used a torque wrench, set at 30 ft lbs. I read in several places the plugs usually break at 33 ft lbs. The Chrysler carbon cutter almost totally desolved all the build up. Go SLOW!!
B00CMMV45Y|4|I bought this for an MSF training class.  The helmet worked well.  Fit was a little large.  Have used it rain or shine.
B0041PRK80|3|Yes if fit, had to bend it so the poles weren't pointing at me. The poles are 4 inches longer then I thought. And the 6x9 flags are to small for this. Looks better with larger ones. Measure before buying.
B008FCDCX2|5|Fits perfect. Went on a road trip and it covered the luggage in the back so when we stopped we didn't have to worry about people seeing the luggage.
B001H1I7Z6|5|Good stuff.
B0041U7IO6|5|This was easy to install. Just snapped right in and fits great.
B00QMVSTGI|5|Fit my f150 like a glove... Took a few minutes to figure how to wire but once I got that out of the way it worked like a champ!!
B00WKU2AZG|3|Cover I bought was a little short on length in order to secure it in the front and back of the car, even though I ordered the cover for the specific brand and year of my car. On the plus side, the cover was delivered quickly and packaging and instructions were good.
B001KOEBJ6|1|Left mirror broke at the top allen bolt on install, you could say it was user error, but it was definitely a little too easy to over tighten. I was able to generally complete install and am using it, for now, but the broken mirror still won't stay still in the bar-end despite the fully tightened adapter and matching size BikeMaster Clubman bars.
B004NKZON6|5|I have used this brand on both my Acura MDX and TL.  They are as good as original parts.  I have replaced the all coils on my TL for about a year, and they have been working very well.
B0052YAUOK|4|Great price.....good description.
B003YJCE9E|1|Failed to maintain high flow after two weeks of use.
B00K588W8Y|5|Has it been that long? Got these in December and it's now August. They've been from TX to WA, OR, UT, NM, MT, WY, OK and LA and with all the 'yuck' I've tracked in, they really do a great job of keeping the dirt/water/snow/slush/food etc. corralled and off the carpet. Just pick them up, dump them out and put them back in place; the high sides keep everything from spilling out. Plus, they don't show scuff marks like most of the other brands and really stay looking good. Fit is good, too with no 'where does this go?' experiences. Tip: be sure of what type of interior your car or truck is, especially with the various console choices that are available. Yes, they're a little pricey considering they're just injection-molded plastic but...it's really good injection molded plastic, so ya gets whatcha pays for. Go whole hog and get the front and rear;  you won't regret it, plus, you'll make back your investment plus some at trade-in time 'cause your carpets'll still look like new!
B00797MHGC|1|There is absolutely NOTHING even remotely \\"Roman\\" about, Mολον Λαβε..., kind of sad that it's described as such. Seller should really fix that...
B004DEBBPM|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B00EEGH7IE|5|Great product. Works perfectly & easy to install
B00MTZB4AE|5|Part was good quality, reasonably priced, prompt shipping. All around good deal.
B00QWT07HE|1|DO NOT BUY THIS! IT WILL RUIN YOUR CAR! THE ADHESIVE FLAKED MY CAR PAINT! NEVER BUY THIS CRAP IT WILL HURT YOU MORE THAN HELP. I NEED TO REPAINT MY CAR NOW.
B00P2D3VZG|1|Plastic cap falls off. Arrived broken.<br />Lamp does not turn off when car is off. Still responds to minute current. Not usable.
B00GHHU78A|5|Great +++
B007WEOFVM|5|Item was infact OEM, saved hundreds of dollars for my customer by servicing the A/C Clutch hub bearing instead of having to redo the entire A/C system
B003C1EWG2|5|OEM Arai quality, and fit. quick shipping and perfect for bright days but not too dark to make it work on darker days.
B00DT42U8O|5|Great sound
B001G7L2Y4|5|Can't wait to see how well it works for collecting metal debris next time I change my oil.  Fit perfectly!
B00HG1J4WQ|4|This is kind of hard for me to review because the stop sign is not really well built, but I can't live without it (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3)! There is just enough room for my car in the garage with very little room left over. I was constantly getting out of the car to check car placement before lowering the garage door. I didn't want the garage door to hit my car! I saw this at a relative's house and went home and ordered it right away, knowing it was the solution to my problem. It has made my life so much easier! I have had to make a few adjustments to keep it from making me crazy. First, I got a nice piece of black duct tape (to match the base) and taped it to the garage floor. Now it doesn't tip over (which it was prone to doing prior to my cheap fix). It is just top heavy, which causes the tipping problems, so the base needs to be weighted in some way or taped to the floor. Once you give it a little fix to counteract the top heavy part, you will have a stop sign which will show you the perfect place to park every time!
B000C2SAR6|5|It works!  fits and no issues
B00LO0M918|1|Installed in an RV.  They started making a funny smell.  Was trying to track it down when my 8yr old noticed smoke in the light fixtures.  Removed the lens to see what was happening and the blob fell apart since all the solder joints melted.  Could have started a fire.  These bulbs are either not for Automotive use, or they're dangerous.
B00IX0CTBW|5|Easy installation and works great.
B003X861OK|5|It was not the color I needed however, it is in fact a perfect fit. Turns out I didn't need it at all but I'm keeping it as a spare
B0008FUH46|2|This was not wide enough to fit the tongue on my 1969 Airstream so would not call it universal.
B0022Y7UC8|2|not a braking batwing rotor...<br />here is a picshowing the actual part:
B00FSXK734|4|Just like the original.
B000IE0F12|5|Very happy with these. They were actually a little smaller than I expected, which is nice for a Keychain /purse item. They are very light too. The clip to cover the seatbelts knife is very secure, you have to use some strength to pull it. I like that it won't accidentally fall off during normal key handling. We 'tested ' them with some newspaper. They work as described. Push in and it 'punches' a small spike out with enough force to mark the newspaper roll. The spike immediately reset and was ready to try again. Glad to find a made in usa product like this!
B00DSD7C66|5|Super cute and durable!
B007VYHHMM|5|works great this gasket.
B000F6F99G|5|Well packaged,  got it on time, works great.  A perfect parking tool.
B00CRHJQJU|1|Description says no cut but is not
B007NE9Y8K|4|Fits but a little to wide, but the screw holes do line up.
B000TYSACW|5|Easy to locate what I need through Amazon, works fine, no problems in shipping with everything thing I have bought!
B00GV876QQ|5|Perfect
B00F2ZKHFQ|5|works perfect , love it !!!
B00MIA2WT2|4|Good value, didn't fit quite right, had to modify mounting bracket on truck.  May have been because of the age of my truck. Installed on 89 Chevy R3500 truck
B007KPWYN4|1|This one must hit your fender even without lowering kit.
B0028PJ10K|5|We love using these.
B00RGZWIW0|5|It is a very nice way to keep the trunk nicer.  Built well.  Fair price.  I have reusable grocery bags folded up.  An umbrella.  A nice emergency kit (tools, jumpers, mylar blankets, etc...all in one place)
B00062YYUO|5|Easy swap for my 304 V8 - 1976 CJ7 with the stock Ford/motorcraft ECM w/horseshoe connector.
B000182EV4|5|Fit perfect, easy to install. Super fast delivery
B000Q753B8|4|works well  but you do need to put cold things in it will not make worm thing cold and add some thing frozen  helps a lot have not used the keep worm
B001GG09GW|5|I get lots of compliments on this bumper sticker. Very popular with the Star Wars fans.
B001A5SQJ6|5|Awesome product. Very good quality.
B00O0SRA7E|5|awesome thanks
B009AAJWZA|1|Cannot be programmed to a 2009 Kia Rio. I first took it to a tire shop. Drove the car about 20 miles and the TPMS light came back on. Took it back and they informed me I would have to take it back to a Kia dealer. Took it to the Kia dealer and they got the TPMS light to go off but said something about the sensor was not sending the right signal. Drove the car about 20 miles again and the TPMS light is back on. Called the Kia dealer and they said I needed to just buy the OEM sensors, that the dorman sensor will not work on this car.
B001TZBB3K|4|Nicely made towels.  Not quite lint-free.  Hopefully will sort themselves out after a few uses.  Glad to have them, though.
B0031I5Z6M|5|Excellent quality, quiet. Fast Delivery. Brakes like it should.
B0036FJ804|5|Awesome Hide-away strobe lights. I have managed to install only two of them but they are working fine till now. Also note that the cable length is fine for a car but may be not for trucks. Also I read a lot of reviews saying they got generic strobe lights but not the Wolo ones so be careful of the seller selling the item.
B00M1XBLHK|5|Exactly as described cool switch just remember you have to have a mounting bracket or do some very delicate cut out work to mount it.
B0013CY2LW|4|Worked perfectly in my 230 Challenger. Seadoo already had the cable roughed-in and fix right into the dash.
B000CN95W4|5|Muy buen producto.
B00S75GOK0|5|Perfect for changing my efi to a carb works great good power gain from a factory set up
B000GKJKGE|5|Awesome
B00M3L159Y|5|Wasn't sure if these would work or not for my 02 Mit Eclipse Spyder with 17 inch wheels, but they fit perfectly....The price was right and they arrived quicker that expected....even though they were coming from china.....
B00P1MJDZ0|2|Didnt fit my scooter
B00ASMWP0I|5|I was very skeptical about purchasing a battery online. I needed a battery for my quad and didn't want to pay a ton at dealers. I found this and decided why not. It came out to my house in a timely manner and fit and worked perfectly for a fraction of the cost.
B002G1TYMQ|4|good
B0068EOEAY|1|Don't waste your money, they don't last, and Progressive will not honor their 'lifetime' warranty.  If you foolishly purchase this part, be sure to keep your original parts, you'll need them.  Just a bad deal.  I thought this was an upgrade, but after installing exactly per the instructions, the monotubes seized (hydrolocked) after a season of mild use. Now I question the purchase of the 465 rear shock too.  There are better options out there for your motorcycle, don't waste your cash on Progressive components.
B002N5YEZM|5|This replacement leg fit perfectly, is easier to operate than the original one that broke and arrived in plenty of time for our next camping adventure..
B00AMMCF6S|5|I LOVE THESE MATS!!
B00DJ3N3SQ|5|Great item , good quality , fit with out problem ... excellent.
B001TI5IIQ|4|Did a great job but not equal amounts of product in the box to do again got a bunch of solution in the bottle part but only one simple &#34;pad&#34; needed to do the job
B001V8PRAS|5|Disappointing only one at this price. I bought a set of two used for only $20. Need two. one for both sides.
B00JBQR30O|5|Very good
B007TY86AQ|5|Perfect fit fast shipping
B00O2I5ILM|5|Like the mirror fits perfectly nit to big or small I have it in my brz quality of it seems good and very easy to install really recommend I'm gonna get a second one
B009RXWMNE|5|You need this
B00BCRM9RM|3|The front seats fit fine, but the back doesn't look great because the head rests are sewn in to the seat. Also there is no way the steering wheel cover would ever fit the big steering wheels on Pontiac grand prixs. Buyer beware because it said it was a match for my 08 grand prix, but I guess you get what you pay for
B00JHK821I|5|Exactly what I was looking for. All the essentials, no frills comes in a solid bag and the jumpers are well made. Great for the truck in emergencies.
B00FYX2MV8|2|It has a bad smell, such as PVC
B000BPWTKS|5|As expected
B00CBTRMZ4|5|Exactly what it said it would do , so far so good
B00ESZEZJK|5|Great light weight back support
B00XPL88NC|5|fast good sale
B001AIZ5HY|5|It works as described, I restored my nephew's head light back to the original look.
B00K6BR99I|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B00S77HKPG|5|Looks good on the back of my wife's Roadster
B001KSAPQK|5|Fit and held up great.
B007ZGBR1I|4|Good looking set of shocks and springs. The install instructions could be better but getting them in was considerably easier than getting the old ones out. Wish they included a mount so you didn't have to reuse/file down the old one. Takes about an hr per shock installation...  Little bit less with the rears.
B000C9QU5I|3|Made in China, they fit ok, but are a bit different than original equipment. Hopefully the AC Delco quality is better than most sealed bearings I've used from China.
B00MVHDF70|5|Perfect fit. Great product, easy install.
B00AM1Y3X2|1|Whally-world has this for the same price and you don't have to pay $100 per year for a worthless service!
B00GL9OTE2|4|Worked very well. Follow directions, and tips they give, and application is easy.
B00B0DGRF8|5|Love it.
B00JY66CDU|2|Nice<br />But the key not fit in case<br />Can not stick in
B000ZIZHKK|5|This MSD Blaster Coil-on-Plug was a direct fit, and works flawlessly! This product does fit 1999 Ford F-150 5.4 unlike the description says, the best thing to do is cross check different parts sits ie summit, jegs etc, make sure the part numbers match and there you go!
B004HYRI9Q|2|Nice product. It just did not fit the stake bed holes did not line up had to send it back
B00G2QXHO2|1|I am giving this product 1 star ONLY because I had to paint it. The design is solid, easy to install but the color was faded and awful. It looked like my sun faded hood latches. I ended up doing a lot of taping and had to spend an extra 80.00 in paint. I am not sure if it comes standard all faded like that or if I just got a defected product.
B00GRDPMG6|5|was for my 24ft. boat trailer, well you can't miss it in the dark now!!! great price and had enough for 2 smaller trailers.<br />sticks well no peeling so far and no bubbles underneath.
B005FMU21U|5|work perfect
B005JPGTNI|5|Used for clear coat sanding on my rifle. Works great.
B00XAU6ML8|5|Excellent prices and unbeatable prices.  Expedite delivery and superb customer service.
B00AZ4U146|5|Work great! Have them on my 06 stratus, easy to install and work as they should :)
B00CU4TSJS|5|very well made, the detail is very impressive normally these bells are kind of cheap looking but this one is great!
B00RV83UUG|5|Light bar is great! It's like taking day light with you. Received it fast and well packed.only down fall is it is 21 inches long. 24 inches is with the brackets. Also didn't like how the box was labeled led light bar and left at my mailbox but luckily no one took it.<br />Over all very happy with it and have no real complaints.
B006M4TZ4K|5|Great product!  Excellent quality and perfectly fit for my 2008 Enclave.
B009D3APSC|5|Exactly what I needed after using a wrong chemical (brake clean) to clean off diesel soot - turned the plastic screws into mush.
B004SF0ZLC|2|Amazon list these caps as fitting a Chevy 2500 HD. They do fit the hub cap but are too short to reach the lug nut. Can't return since I opened the packaging.
B002JEEV9G|4|Customer pleased on the new look! It's a lot better than what she have!
B00332GOIO|5|What I've come to expect from Wade. Looks great and install firm and snug in less than 10 minutes.
B000GRMLCC|4|Look good and fit plenty. Installation is easy. The only gripe I have is they don't hold their shape around the zipper portion well so they end up looking all distorted when you put things in them. Some heavy duty wire reinforcement along the edge of the zippers would help.
B00CMR79H6|5|Good fit after you trim out for the sub.
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Very solid construction.  Installed on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  One thing that made the installation easier was loosening the bolts on the side of the bumper and placing a couple of spacers on either side to hold the bumper out.  Gives a little more room to get at the nuts and bolts because the space is tight.  I did NOT need to lower the exhaust or remove the tow hook.  All in all took less than 30 minutes and I am not the most mechanical guy.  Probably saved $500 bucks by doing it myself instead of taking it to the dealer.
B00U2NHLTI|1|Fits perfectly, looks AMAZING, and the color is very close to the factory HIDs (just ever so slightly more blue).  Factory HID color is 4300K, these are 5000K.<br /><br />*8 MONTH UPDATE*  Yes, fit perfectly, looked amazing...BUT...lasted 8 months.  The issues I am having are not untypical of others (i.e. flicker, or not illuminate at all).  In fact, I removed them from our 2015 Challenger and installed them in our 2007 Azera.  At first they worked perfectly...4 days later, same issue.  The intermittent on/off or flicker wasn't left or right specific either.  $120 wasted.
B001QEDSOE|5|Great bag
B000BYB1GM|5|Fit nicely on my 79 trans am.
B001F9H5XK|5|Amazing price! Absolutely perfect!
B0007M3094|5|As promised - what you expect from Curt
B000NK9CRO|5|Great product, easy to install.
B00I15AW5E|5|Working great!  For a very good price
B003G0KA56|5|fits nicely
B00KCYLLNO|4|Many looks. Much subdued. Only gripe is that it's advertised as &#34;die cut&#34; which it's not. It's just a straight sticker.
B0033DQ91U|2|The Water Pump was not threaded
B009E2Z3FM|5|perfect fit
B00JH2FO1C|4|Very easy to program but after programming both new key fob and existing key fob doors locked and unlocked but remote start did not function on either fob and check engine light was on. From Buffalo NY so remote start is too important.  Was about to return item but after driving approx. 40 or 45 miles somehow everything reset and now both remotes function properly and check engine light is off. If you have this issue try driving about half hour.
B00VOMEK9K|5|I bought the kingdom hearts heart logo decal alone and it didn't feel like much so I added this decal right next to it and it looks great now tbh
B00JBI8MRA|5|Install was fairly easy. Looks totally awesome. Cheap and functional. Some reviews say you can't see the brake lights  when the lights are on, that is not true, you can clearly see when the brakes are engaged een when the lights are on. These are worth it. I have a 2002 e46 m3 coup.
B007S0LDME|5|Its all we use and now free freight better yet. We are full time RVers.
B00HND017Y|5|Love the stickers. They look good, yet low key.
B004ZF4S72|5|Very pleased with these lights.  Very bright.
B004ETN0P0|5|Bought this for my camper.  Loved it.  Then bought it for my son to use on his boat.  He says it's the best.  He uses it on his truck, too.  So take my son's word on it, since he is the picky, picky one on his truck and boat.
B00KTJIPO0|2|This worked well for a month. It seems like right after the return time was expired it just stopped working. I tested all signals going in and all were working properly. There was no signal coming out of the controller. I wrote the Hopkins manufacturing and towing several times and didn't get a response. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was cheap to begin with but to not respond to an inquiry to support probably should cost every star.
B0000CBIK5|5|works well
B00NOKPPK8|5|We put it on our side by side and it is awesome
B008BE04C6|1|Very Disappointed - My OEM bulbs lasted over 2 years.  I replaced both bulbs and they lasted only 4 months.  Both went out within weeks of each other.  The vision was good while it lasted<br />I would not recommend this product based upon my experience
B00R6KWH2Q|5|Fit bike rack perfectly
B0046BPE7I|5|NICE!!
B00IUXQM38|5|Looks great and works great.
B00BU9G3G0|5|Why better looking in person :)
B00NMXM76C|1|will these fit a 03 1500 Chevy
B00KRQPLGK|5|my neighbors  like this sticker)
B000QIIQVQ|5|Handle fit as advertised. Very happy.
B00IJEA7IY|5|Quick delivery, perfect match great price for a great replacement
B00ONGX9Z0|2|Perfect fit for my 1991 Previa LE.  My original muffler lasted 365,000 miles but failed at the end of the pipe which attaches to the cat. converter.  Be aware the bolts attaching this are probably horribly rusted and frozen--and may need penetrating oil and heroics to remove.  Have new bolts and nuts available as the old ones will very likely be unserviceable.  Also, have a new exhaust gasket on hand.  I used the Walker 31374 gasket from Amazon which was perfect (it is reversible so don't worry which side faces front).  The new muffler will produce odor for the first 25-30 miles which is normal.  It should disappear entirely.  UPDATE:  After a month of use this muffler began a constant loud rattle, even at idle.  It sounds metallic--like a piece of a baffle broke loose from a bad weld.  It is quite loud when standing outside the vehicle and on close inspection it is clearly originating from the muffler.  I checked all connections and supports and they are sound.  Luckily, when actually driving the vehicle the sound is not obvious from the driver's seat--hence, I did not give it one star.  I may have to replace the whole unit.  Although it costs 2-3 times as much, I guess I'll have to buy an OEM Toyota muffler.  My original one lasted almost 365,000 miles and only failed when the exhaust pipe flange rusted out.
B00469L32A|5|Easy to use.
B008VL67BG|5|Great deal on these.  Half the price of Home Depot.
B000221LHW|4|Item has been installed and appears to be working just fine.  I really do appreciate the printed instructions that came with it.  This is a rather technical repair/replacement operation, without that sheet of directions I'm afraid things would have been toast.  I realize this was a small purchase, but if big purchased item handle same way, I'm sold for next item needed for my project.<br />Happy Camper
B00ZJVC7OW|5|Fantastically bright and solid line of sight for 100 yards plus.
B002MKWAYK|5|worked great
B0009H52B6|5|good price
B009AA2GQC|5|The item was as expected it worked perfectly and my airbag sensor lights went off
B0036QZ8VQ|5|Fantastic deal and was exactly what I needed to wheel strip my bike.
B005C5BL9C|1|Your picture does not match what you shipped and now needs to be returned ... Hubby is not very pleased !
B00CZG8YR8|4|works wll in car hauling trailer and rv dry camping , low power usage
B00AEUZGGY|5|Love love love my new helmet!! DOT certified with a cool design & the price was great!!
B0052FRP24|3|I gave it 3 stars for the price compared to going elsewhere, but realize that the threadings don't fit the original factory screws from the original handle on my 1999 Camry. This made a real challenge when trying to affix the handle to the door. The shade is slightly off from my car, but not super noticeable (I mean it's 16 years old - I got bigger problems)!
B000ARPVMU|5|Great filter, have used in the past.
B000C1Q6MS|3|I have a 2004 Camry 2.4L and installed these. I love the stopping power and low brake dust they generate. They're good brakes but I do have one complaint...these pads have a slightly shorter backplate than they should. For 3-months I've been trying to figure out why my suspension was making noise. I found a few things wrong, but no suspension problems. The shroud in the wheel well was missing fasteners, so I thought that was the problem. Wrong. I figured out last night that the pads are a bit too short and slide up and down in the caliper...which translates into vertical movement as you hit small bumps or cracks in the road (anything that jolts the car). I could've figured this all out much sooner had I not done other work to my car within days of changing the pads...including changing the tires, finding that the tire shop pulled the shroud out for some reason, being told to get an alignment, etc. For whatever reason it occurred to me last night that the pads could be creating the noise. So beware. I've been changing pads for years, so it isn't that I don't know what I'm doing. Clips are all installed, etc. I hope this helps saves someone time, money, and blood pressure points.
B003H6HYJY|5|looks great just like new
B00JIHC36K|4|Not that bright
B000B8Y016|5|I like that the brush and scraper are on the same side. Makes scraping and brushing snow easier.
B00FATTT1W|5|Nice way to show that I'm a Christian as I drive down the road.
B00KFJSEW2|5|Works great!
B00AB2PBU6|5|I am very happy 😊 with my new seat covers!! For the price you can't go wrong!!!! I am going to order the bucket seat cover for my back seat as well! Can't wait! And thank you to the seller!
B00ZC5YQVM|5|Even though there's no photos, this is exactly what AA has listed on their website. It comes with the bolts for the NV3550 and AX15 together so you don't even need to pick up mounting bolts for it. Fit perfectly for my 3550 swap on the YJ, stock Peugeot torque arm and transmission mount.
B00XKEZU62|3|Definitely not no cut, had to drill a hole in the right side fairing, but easy installation, even though no instructions were provided. Although one of the slider pucks has a pretty major mold defect, basically looks like the bike has already hit the pavement. But for the low cost of this product i guess i cant complain to much, as if and when i do actually drop my bike the frame sliders should do their job and save me major damage.
B00C977VNG|5|Simple to install and looks amazing
B0024ECAE4|1|These cam locks are NOT 7/8&#34;. The packaging says 7/8&#34; but the actual size is 5/8&#34;.
B0087NB2OU|5|Great product we use it on a yacht to communicate among 4 crewmen great noise cancelling we can even talk from bridge to engine room while underway and the engine noise is cancelled out fairly well
B00NR2FVRA|5|Worked great, easy install.
B004NV4E2W|5|Awesome replacements looks factory
B006GJYLFY|5|When I bought a ten year old SeaDoo Ski Boat in San Diego it looked like it was BRAND NEW.  AND, that of course is why I bought it!<br />I ask the previous owner if he kept it stored inside a garage etc... And he said, NO, just covered BUT he made sure after every use he sprayed it inside and out with Boat Bling CS Conditioner.  He gave me a half full spray bottle reluctantly saying it was real expensive BUT worth every penny.  I've had the boat two years now and do exactly as instructed and the boat WE USE IN SALT WATER still looks like new.  I used it on all my cars inside and out and they look great and the upholstery feels like new.<br />I have a 1999 ISUSU VI-CROSS with the black plastic trim around the wheel wells etc. I was delighted to find out the black plastic trim which was kinda faded looked new when I spray it with the Boat Bling CS.  Take a chance, and you'll think it's a miracle product like I do.
B00SXA2CMI|4|Fits as expected...
B00LBFC4VQ|4|Looks great, installed easy 10mm wrench is a lot easier to loosen blots and tighten. The down side received by FedEx after opening box pulled out grille there was damage luckily was able to bend grille into place without chipping paint.
B00VIIB2Q4|5|Was exactly as described
B000CQBMP4|5|I have been using this as a movable fixed point anchor for my warn winch while moving rocks
B00A80C564|4|muy buen producto
B004G08K9I|1|BEWARE, I just purchased this grease gun and the very first time I used it, it got stuck on the grease fitting and in an attempt to remove it from the fitting it snapped off the fitting.  I couldn't remove the broken fitting from the coupler no matter what I tried: screw drivers, pliers, vise grips, and a lot of four letter words.  I ended up buying a new coupler from NAPA Auto Parts ($4) which worked fine (as well as a new grease fitting).  I had to extract the broken fitting using a screw extractor and what was supposed to be a simple lube job turned into an ordeal.  The gun itself, is sturdy and well made, but the coupler is defective and makes the whole gun worthless!  Avoid the frustration.
B009I9CAJS|5|The best in high grade crude.
B00T0TZ2FA|5|I Love my Decal
B00M78820I|5|I'm thoroughly enjoying my car shade. I love the silver and black colors. They match the interior of my car and fits my Toyota Yaris hatchback nicely. I still have a little trouble folding the shade. I'll have to keep practicing. It's a great, quality product that I highly recommend.
B005CHT4W6|5|great oil
B00E6VLVXO|5|Very nice quality
B000R3WQPM|5|Summer is brutal here. This fits perfectly and keeps a lot of heat-producing light out.
B00062YVKC|5|Just what I expected from Auto Meter.  A little shorter than the original, but works great.
B000GKEZBY|4|Quite good quality.
B00D329DI2|5|No problem
B001AZH6H4|1|Plastic not secure
B005DUXZBS|5|Looks awesome and works awesome
B008ZTX0BO|2|There are many pros and cons with this helmet. The colors are nice, the combination of brown leather and alternative colors are attractive. But I am afraid it stops there. First of all, the fit and feel is very cheep. It sits on top of your head, instead of hugging it. I am a M size and all my helmets, from the most expensive ones to the very cheep ones, always been M, this M barely sits on my head. the back has a low cut that gives you the feeling the helmet is about to pop out of your head. The visor is probably the biggest let down. When it is up, you hear the whistle of the wind and when you put it down, you get more wind into your eyes than when up.  Overall, I am not happy at all, I had it shipped to Costa Rica and it just not possible for me to send it back, so I guess it will just collect dust until I give it to somebody.
B000C2QSKM|5|Seems to be working fine so far, I'm a little nervous because it took forever for it to charge to full (like 1.25 hours to fill 2.31lbs of 132a) but once it's been charged it's blowing cool and working. Note the front clutch is different than the original compressor on my 2005 f150 but everything seems to be working fine and a great price.
B000C9J3M0|5|Great price !!
B006ZS291Y|5|This is the best car wash ,love it ,no spats
B006B7YLX8|5|Easy fit!  Took me about 40mins to install.  Truck sounds great with better gas pedal response.
B00C2E1G9Q|5|Exactly as pictured, prompt delivery!
B000C9SR90|4|great fuel filter, nothing different about it all though it says professional fuel filter, its the same if you went and bought it at one of your local part stores, I just bought this one cause I purchased a whole in tank kit for a 1990 Chevy K1500, works great no problems.
B000C5I474|1|The description reads, &#34;Front right AND left&#34;, but it is untrue.  It should read front right OR left.  I bought this as a kit.... disappointed.
B0097A70GQ|5|Love it!
B009NTZX74|5|I did not but this for myself, I got it for my daughter in ok city and she loves it.
B003B3HW4U|4|Pricier that most but so far they are good.  Gas mileage improvement was noticeable.  Vehicle performance also improved.
B000CF8VYA|5|fit was perfect and very easy to install
B000X2IUKM|5|Does exactly what is promised. Has relieved my sciatica almost completely when sitting at home or in the car. Great product
B005BNYY26|5|Great replacement cover. I liked the smoke better than the original opaque. Even though it looks dark, it lets some light in. Some here say the plastic is thin. Yes, it is thinner than our OEM cover. But it appears to be sufficient to last a long time. The hinge is simple, bendable metal. Removal is done by bending the curved piece at the end of the hinge and sliding the cover towards the opposite side. Install is the same idea; When you have it in place, you simply bend the little end piece into a small curly-cue and that keeps the hinge from sliding out either way.<br /> CONFIRM FITMENT. The description of the vent lid could have had more specifications. Many here ask about sizing. The manufacturer refers to this cover as a 14x14 size. That alone won't give you much confidence that you have the right cover. I have included pics to help you confirm this will work on your unit. I also installed a new vinyl seal. Ventline #BVD0455-01, 51&#34; length.<br /> Overall, I was very satisfied with the new cover and it's a terrific value. Saved plenty of money and time over taking it to the RV dealer.
B00Y19WKG8|4|Quality Vinyl. Little hard to apply, but looks good after.
B000765MHI|5|Nice fan for helm air on boat.  Loud, but strong. Super long cord for DC outlet.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Good value, works as advertised, and looks great with the other black chrome on my Wrangler.
B00GHT6CKA|5|ok
B0070Y34M0|1|Just bad. No razor as shown in pics. The film is permanently creased from being rolled up. On top of that even if you can get it to stay on for more than a minute by applying it curve-towards glass, it will peel fall off in a day or two. Don't go with the cheapest option for tint, it will show. I contacted lexen and they want me to send them a picture. NOPE.
B00O84WNNG|4|OK BUT NEED MORE AMPS
B00CJ6J3Y2|5|Bought this intercooler for my 2014 Focus ST. My charge temps stay within 15* of ambient and return to ambient very quickly.<br /><br />For some reason my intercooler didn't come with the white 'M' logo painted on, but that's not a big deal. Very happy with this purchase.
B009S9RURU|5|This one is the best I've got so far<br />My wife saw it on my car and right she wanted one for her car, it's a great deal and highly detailed, we've had it on our cars for almost 2yrs now and it's still holding strong in Florida's sun.<br />(one neon green sticker one white) color did Not fade and the reactions are awesome.<br /><br />Will definitely buy again for future vehicles<br />Thanks again Amazon for another great purchase and service
B0023V7CI2|5|Perfect fit.  When this replacement lamp came it made changing out the broken one easy and it fit lime a glove.
B00J5LXYXK|5|Highly recomend... I recive it early than the shipping date.. Thanks
B006B2Y1A6|5|Love it works perfect
B009WDU4NY|5|This belt absolutely does fit Buell Ulysses XB12XT contrary to any suggestions otherwise. It is a Goodyear belt. It also fits my 2005 softail deuce. AMAZON should change it so that it recognises this part as correct for this motorcycle. good price and prompt delivery by this seller. Cheers
B004D0EAUE|5|Received on time and works great. I have had it in for about a month now and works as a new item should. Thank you so much for the great deal !!!
B000BZI4JS|1|Does not fit my SVT Focus although Amazon says it does.  Body of sensor is significantly larger than OE unit and drive shaft interferes with installation.  This will be going back.  An NTK or Denso O2 sensor is same size as OE unit.
B00UIOJD7O|5|Just as pictured. Good quality...fit fine ... fast delivery. Very happy with this plate frame!
B00QGNSD6S|5|Fit great, very good condition. A good value
B000XECJES|5|It works good...
B004ZIWJ70|5|Just what I needed...<br />Love the price
B00PJ50WGS|1|Very unhappy came folded and damaged
B00KFRIPW8|5|My wife love it
B000BUQODG|5|Very nice and easy to install. Can leave the vent up even while traveling with no worries about water damage.
B00EKEGRVS|1|Bought this for my wife and it broke the first day. I realize it's 'inexpensive'....but, gee whiz....things like this can add up.
B00M8TB5C8|5|Love it
B00H554R98|5|worked like a charm and with little effort
B00MVPWQZO|5|Wheeler is alive again thanks
B00HRSTRAW|5|All parts are plug and play 100%.<br />Took about 20minutes total to plug everything in.<br />Tools needed, screwdriver(used a drill), flathead, thin knife (to pry).<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!<br />*note: if you're having trouble fitting the led bulb, pry the plastic circular cover w/ thin knife, and put the led bulb male end into the &#34;hole&#34; that you can't fit it back into, then plug into female end wire.
B00FZM5332|5|I received products in  good condition and time. It take about 5 minutes to install. And work like a brand new. Bottom line save me a couple hundred dollars if I take my suv to Toyota dealer.
B0002JN182|5|I was swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 truck and getting the old pump off the engine was a pain that required a special tool to pull off the pressure fitted pulley to get to the bolts that held it in the frame. After that little ordeal it seemed foolish to put that old pump back in so I replaced it. The quart I purchased was just under 5-bucks and the same price as the closet auto parts store that is 40-miles away. It wasn’t enough to top off the new pump & hoses but when I can back for another quart the price was over 6-bucks in just a few days. I did get another quart in town at the lower price and everything seems fine with the pump and steering.
B0052SF0LO|1|Does not work, worked for 3 nights and just stopped working.
B003U7ZY9M|5|good product, value as expected
B00P73KWE4|4|Item was a tad different than I expected but that was my fault . Easy to assemble and install .
B000CRO4IK|5|This was just what I was looking for to help with loose change when paying at drive through eating places.
B000B8LKSW|5|Worked perfectly in my 2004 Grand Cherokee. What more can I say? It's an oil-fill cap. It's made in the USA and it's doing the job it was asked to do. Pretty much sums it up.
B0062TP14I|5|very nice
B000C7Y5JS|4|had to file down for it to fit my application but knew that before the order.  worked as I expected.
B000UKKS8O|5|Oil filter.  Filters oil... needed one got 1
B004VLIZJW|5|Came fast, was about the same price as other websites, and after a few months of being on my MDX I haven't noticed any deterioration or abnormal wear. Ride improved a LOT after replacing my 180k mile original set,
B00MW8G4L2|4|Work just as good as the originals. However the back piece of metal  that makes the battery connection had to be swapped from the original keys. Seemed  kind  of odd that I had to do that, but it was not a big deal.
B004AIHCMW|4|It was hard to install but it does the job
B009DK01D4|5|great fitmeant
B003VDX5D2|4|Just what we needed for our Ram 2500.  It does need a couple of pads or bumpers to prevent rattling.  We used a couple of rubber bumpers made for chair feet and they work great.
B007THZMWI|5|For the money you can't beat this meter.  Its no Fluke but it dosnt carry the price tag either.
B00JQZONQM|5|Great product
B002IZJ7CW|2|Lacks the quality from previous wing couplings.
B001AGKZW6|5|nice muffler
B004C443R6|3|A bit tight.....
B003KFR1HM|5|I would recommend buying these if your going to change the front struts on your vehicle.  but I would recommend taking to a garage if your not mechanic savvy. this can be a dangerous situation changing out struts and strut mounting kit on the top of the struts.
B003SZ3COU|5|Good replacement bad,works like new!
B00EN34U9W|4|I love this line as its terribly true! Good buy for the money, the only downside was that the print was a bit blocky up close but not evident at a distance, and would probably only be noticed by the best of automobile tailgaters.
B004964A5W|5|Works great
B002ENKESE|3|MUCH lighter than pictured. Not taupe at all. Staples in the set left large holes in the mats.
B00SLKIHRE|5|Evaporator was exact fit installed A/C works great
B0017OANWI|3|They arent very blue, nor all that bright. I wanted the blue look for my headlights and this did not meet my expectations. The color of these lights looks almost exactly light any regular haolgen lights. Just a tiny bit whiter. It's ok.
B00UVXDIS2|5|Bought these for my wife's car, after a little figuring and checking, the application went very well.  Fun!
B002DW0454|2|They sure do look like Honda parts, but if they are, I think Honda has used a really cheap plastic. They just seem to move a bit too much (light weight) and tend to crumple up (bend). Really do not like them, but I will keep them nonetheless.
B00842A7F4|3|I got the wrong size. It may be put in good use someday...
B00FP0G5EK|5|Great
B00C0SQ8KG|2|&#34;Waterproof&#34; this happened after one car wash... Little sad because it was a great bar, but I'd like to know if refundable, bar is only 2 weeks old
B00TQHHCTK|4|Can be a bit temperamental to use and zero out, but gives accurate readings.  Would buy again
B00RW279W6|5|Love it. Looks great on the Jeep!
B00CDAFT6K|4|Will be trying them out seriously on a long road trip. For now, they fit the windows of our 2012 Malibu, and the suction cups work well. Ordered them to protect our fur-baby from the harsh sun and intense heat of road travel. Probably a good idea for people babies, too.
B0002SA528|5|Quality material, constructed very well and fit nicely on my '87 Jeep Wrangler. Very happy with my purchase. Exceeded my expectations.
B00826OVWW|5|arrived early and exactly as advertised, very useful!
B00ONHB6CW|5|Very good!
B0027QR2SI|5|Hangs over front seat so backseat passengers have a trash bag. Good for kids, doesn't take up much space.
B005O2ZUDQ|5|Not too dark even at night, good shade for the day... Great!
B003D4KA32|5|fit perfit on my 2002 range rover.
B0013LF3ES|5|Item shipped fast and worked great.  I had to move my motorcycle from California to Colorado and I couldn't of done it without the canyon Dancer!!
B00OZVD46C|2|First off they are made in ( Communist China) With a company named Smittybilt you would think is was made in USA. The door ripped right threw the adjustable stitches stopping at the last one, leaving the door wide open. I guess you get what you pay for. I don't mind paying for quality and items made from America.
B000CPI6VI|5|Product is as advertised.  Works great connecting my EZ-Loader trailer to my Honda Pilot.
B00UFERZKO|5|Awesome inverter. I have an issue with my AC fuse blowing on my truck so I wanted the accessory to attach to the battery directly. It's bigger than I thought, but the fan is also quieter than I thought. Can't wait to take it camping.
B00CFPJEPU|2|item badly scratched upon arrival, looks like it's been dragged on the ground.
B002LEYCGG|5|satisfy
B000B8GAOQ|5|nice !!!
B00C59RT30|5|Being used on an auxiliary diesel fuel tank. So far working well.
B008CPZLRW|4|good
B005NLQAHS|5|Works as advertised. Does the job in all three of my vehicles with the &#34;Torque&#34; app. Highly recommend
B00AYXM4DY|5|I had to write a review due to the reviews from others about this being a scam.... No it's not!  Watch the video people, that is posted on Amazon. I am female and completed an H3 Hummer with product left over!  Both Bumpers, all trim top and bottom, sides and 2nd coat. Follow directions watch the video!!!!!!  I was so worried about using this, after receiving the product and reading reviews, I put the box away for months. Just want to say I regret not using it sooner!!  It's so easy!
B0000AY4YJ|5|I think I found my new favorite vinyl cleaner for my boat.  Smells good, really cleans it, and protects it.  Very happy with this stuff and will stick with it
B009MAH3A4|5|👍 - This says it all!
B000BOAX1G|5|Can't imagine driving without them. When I do (in others vehicles) i seriously feel unsafe.
B000C57KEM|5|Shipped fast , fit great (95 camry 4cyl). Saved money!
B00NIMFTOE|5|outstanding
B0001EW4B8|5|Great visor!!! Well designed for perfect match
B005OL7K4E|5|OK
B001FJTAGK|5|Original OEM shocks started to leak at 145k miles. I heard about these on the Honda Pilot owners forum. They are good replacements at a great price. There are many how to fit videos on youtube. It took under an hour to do both side but if you have any rust it could take longer. Ride height is slightly higher then OEM. They ride fine but I've only just fitted them. No bangs or knocks that other reviewers have.  As other writers have posted there was some light rust on the surface of these shocks when they were received.
B00B72CYUY|4|Rating 4 stars because of the product discription  didn't say this was only one light. But these things are bright as hell
B0012RGA72|5|Easy as pie my only change to the instructions for 2008 jeep would be to pull hard straight out on taillight as the tabs have a rounded head that push into place
B007CJ6M72|5|Quick and easy install. Only issue i had was not realizing the mounting hardware can be reused from current window regulator motor. Luckily i figured it out and installed with no problems.
B00CPA6KE8|5|I couldn't believe how much oil recovery in such a short time. This product works great!
B000CPZZ3U|4|the price was the only complaint...for outdoor use  on a boat or trailer works good.!
B00HE1BY2Q|1|The programming is kind of BAD!!  The programmer only works 3 times!  What a rip off!  They do not tell you that when you are looking to buy it!!
B00GZHC0KU|5|These lights put out a good range and good color.  Buy from Amazon for the value.... about 40% off my best local bricks-and-mortar store.
B00BD5GZK0|3|there's no where to attach the straps to which stinks so i ended up taking the driver bottom seat one off. I have to keep tucking them in but overall it's ok
B00NUKX5BS|4|The exact part we needed to repair our RV plumbing problem.
B005JU61D6|5|FIT PERFECT
B001PW9ZUI|1|Junk!!! Broke within the first month.
B00W31VMYC|5|I have an older Jeep with a sporadic check engine light.  Since that light can mean anything from low oil to any of a handful of sensors, I thought  this bluetooth OBD scan tool would be useful.  It is and I'm quite happy with it.  Took a bit to find the right app - using this with an Android tablet (though it will also work on a Windows pc).  Easy install.  Within a very short time I was looking over the diagnostic to find out I had two issues:  O2 sensor and some heater/thermostat sensor.  Very useful and just in time to have my mechanic pinpoint the issues before the next inspection.  I really like that it's blue tooth so there's no cable where you have to dangle the other half.  I've since tried it on a few of my friends cars and they were suitably impressed.  I think I may have found some new customers for this.
B00K8NEBOK|5|Great quality
B00BFWQ96G|5|I can't see how anyhow could rate it any less. For the price of $24, you're getting far and above what you're paying for. Obviously, they're not as bright as the emergency lights on ems or fire vehicles, but once again, they're bright enough for what you're paying. It's a perfect price.<br /><br />P.S. Consider how window tinting may affect your results.
B007EXOVSI|5|perfect fit
B00A7EQJC2|5|Good tools.
B00RPVDA90|3|I'm sure it's okay but i thought this could have been used for GAMA SONIC portable fans but it didn't. Read and reread the description and it indicated it was for the GAMA SONIC but it had a lip where the original didn't and wouldn't fit unless my husband cut the plastic in the fan.
B00784VI52|1|NOT for a '94 Caravan!  The wiring scheme is not correct!
B00SSKUHAC|5|Fits and works perfect.
B0095D34YM|5|Workes as intended for my m3.
B001O07VI4|5|satisfy
B00KHUQGGA|1|This item has a TERRIBLE smell. The package only came with the steering wheel cover, no seatbelt pads. And it didn't even fit!!!
B00NTOCPVG|5|These are the best!!!!!!
B000C9UJYQ|5|Good
B002YKI51U|5|Works like it's supposed to.
B001GH5ORK|5|Great price and easy install!
B00310P3FI|5|They fit Perfect on my 2005 350z  an they were easy to install..it gives my Z a way better look
B003NBFKDK|5|went together so well and with the 1.25 / 2&#34; adapter works well on my dodge caravan.
B000RD91GO|5|Great product fit right in hummer h3.
B0031HNHPY|1|This filter is much larger than the housing and damn near impossible to fit - unless one crushes the filter and force fit  it into the housing.
B00OFU33PU|5|Well made and sturdy, exactly what I was looking for.  Love that it has two cold compartments for groceries in summer.
B0101U6OVW|5|Placed this on the rear hatch window; it's just the right size to show my support, but not so large to obstruct my view.
B00QRJMMP4|4|Great price and great fit - a little padding for just in case and fits under my jeans
B003JSJS5I|1|This replaced a two bank Guest marine charger that died after several years of intermittent use.  I decided to try another brand, as I have had several Guest chargers that did not last.<br /><br />Worked great out of the box.  Charged 2 banks of brand new 12 volt deep cycle flooded batteries.  I was suspicious when one bank consistently took considerably longer to charge then the other.  I unplugged the charger and tried again.  Two fully charged banks.  One bank LED turned green quickly, other bank LED stayed red overnight.  Was going to switch leads between batteries, to see if it was a battery issue or a lead issue.  No need.  The next time I plugged it in it didn't work at all.  I just returned it for a replacement, but after reading the other 1 star reviews, I wonder if I should even give them a second chance, or just switch over to another brand.<br /><br />So I got the replacement charger and kept an eye on it, charging on weekends after using the boat.  Seemed to work consistently.  So I decided to leave it plugged in to maintain, as I was not going to use the boat for a couple of weeks, and wanted the batteries charged when I used it next.  I have always done this with Newmar and Guest chargers in the past.  When I checked my batteries after a few weeks, they were dry.  The charger had boiled off TWO gallons of water.  TWO GALLONS.  I have never ever seen this before, on batteries that were completely topped off and just needed maintenance.  Needless to say, the batteries are shot, the charger is going overboard, money lost, lesson learned.  Never Ever buy a Noco Charger again!!!!
B00MN963JS|3|Material is not as thick as I thought and the skull doesn't look that great on when it gets stretched out
B00KJALXDE|1|Wrong handle in package, even though the label said it was for a Jeep drivers side door, it was for the passenger side door. Labeled incorrectly and wrong handle..
B00HFLH5LE|5|Everything from the purchase to the operation was surprising. The Switch is inexpensive, easy to install; and, works great. If there are several for sale, you'll find no disappointment with this purchase .......
B0092ZWDNG|5|I love the Sunshade. I wish it had the &#34;Suction Cups&#34; to hold it to the windshield it fits loose to the windshield but the fit is custom and nice. Compared to what's available in the stores this is a great buy. Still the suction cups would have been great.
B008FCE8IA|4|Overall good product as advertised.  Some screws did not thread easily into the metal plate which holds the cross bar on, but didn't eventually  thread with some effort.  The rack is not very  wide so 2 sup or kayaks is not possible  so if that's what you  need might want to  look  into Yakima  or Thule.  This is what  you  need if you only have the plastic  rails the cross  bars will not work alone with out the c brackets  which are provided in this  package.
B008Y2F69Q|5|Good product with fast delivery
B00V4049K2|5|This product is for sure worth the purchase price!! When I received this I was skeptical if it would work, as I smoke in my car during the work week, and do not like my car to be or smell smokey when my children ride with me somewhere and this has helped!!! My car smells fresh everytime I get in. I also like that you can set it in direct sunlight once a month for a few hours, and this bad boy will work for up to 1 year!!! I will be purchasing one of these for my husbands van,(He uses it for his band=stinky boys)!! I cant wait to see how well it works for him.
B00FZODVQQ|4|Good fit, needs more screws to be complete!
B008FCE5D8|4|Instructions not useful. Try watching youtube videos. Part is sturdy and durable.
B00K958C92|1|Is not waterproof only had it on for a couple of months and some of the lights already went out.
B00JMCCMJ4|5|Best oil ever!
B006LB52G4|5|sweet, good fitment. easy to install
B011AKY2VG|1|Just bought these had read the description where it says it an entire kit including gas struts. Not true only 2 springs and the 4 caps are included.  Only what is pictured.  Dont believe the description.  8/8/15
B00IBMPF5Y|5|very strong support, easy install
B001GN6QQW|5|Install was easy once I got the rusty s.crew off the old one.  Seems like OEM quality
B00IKSMA70|5|It works out great for what I needed it for.
B00YVQD4A2|5|I really like this!  I wear the larger sunglasses that fit over regular glasses AND I have 2 pair that I wear depending how bright it is.  It is wonderful to have them so readily available on my sunvisor and if I want to change from one pair to the other there is no problem anymore.
B00WU0BHUA|5|I love this stuff and love the price!
B006P124VQ|5|This rack will hold two bikes securely. The rack is quite heavy and the welds appear strong.  Fits well with a class II hitch on a rav4. The screw on hitch pin can be a pain when removing after short trips, but i'm sure on a long trip i'd be glad it was there.  All in all a good buy for the price, especially if you need to carry a women's bike without a horizontal frame bar.
B00BG4A518|5|Metal tire valve stem caps. The Ford emblem accents the color of the flame blue truck. Free shipping received in about 6 days.
B008VHUIQK|5|Fast shipping and great price.
B007H8DIG6|5|Works perfect. Might be a couple degrees off but my AC works again and that's all I care about.
B00651OAVS|5|I can't tell you how easy this product is to use....first time user, and hopefully a repeat customer.  I replaced all the lines on our 66 Comet, and it was really easy to use, both in flaring and installing.  I don't know exactly on how it'll work because the car is still in my shop awaiting some front suspension work, but will update when finished.  I'm hoping for all fittings to be leak free.
B001L1MGEU|5|love it
B00U8NK7ZC|3|Did not solve my air issue along my window, but put it to use elsewhere and at least it did not go to waste.
B00RDJEUMA|2|It's smaller than I thought it it was going to be  Just wish it was a little bit bigger
B001LQL5UG|5|A1A  EXCELENT
B001NZZMCW|5|Half the price the dealers wanted and a perfect swap for my 2009 Chevy Traverse
B00JS0BJHG|5|It fits great and I really like it but I was hoping to hear the turbo better and I don't really notice a difference. I will be installing a downpipe soon andaybe that will help
B000AUOIOE|5|Loved these lights! Could see so much better!
B000KECV1M|5|Badass!
B0036G97DG|5|Fast shipping good product fits an FJR like a glove
B0075VU64M|4|Good Quality Sticker
B00BZAGVX4|5|Sweet! fully charged easy to install and off I go. Great product!!
B0030HUGSQ|5|Fast great perfect fit
B00RUE2WOG|3|The mirrors are good and the convex design allows you to have a wider view behind you and to the side. Installation was somewhat annoying on my 2014 Yamaha R1. I assume this would fit perfectly on a bike with 10mm bolts but the description says it fits 8mm as well. I had to buy a washer for this to use with my stock 8mm bolts, and it's still a bit iffy. Without the washer, if you wiggle the mirror then the bolt comes completely loose and the mirrors hang upside down. With the washer its a bit more stable but still not 100%. If you have a bike with 8mm bar end bolts, then I wouldn't recommend this.
B00BCRMAAS|1|You know its worth spending a bIt more money in something that will last a long time than this cheep material - DO NOT invest your money on something that is not going to last. As soon as you slide of from the seat, it repeatedly moves and ends up having to constantly  readjust, not worth the time.
B007KPWNBC|5|It went on easy and fit perfect
B000CQOIQ4|5|just as described. love it
B001G4X4LQ|4|Nice hitch, sturdy.  Only wish it would fold up.
B00F8O9ESC|5|Easy to put on, and looks awesome! Love that we didn't have to drill holes in my mini!!
B00USTWYFC|5|I got it for my mom, she loves it! It's super cute. You get exactly what you see. Great buy
B002PQMMY4|4|Good
B000VKOD9S|5|Loved being able to install myself! Fit great!
B00UX1X3ZU|1|Awful quality! Lock doesn't work.<br />The cover itself doesn't fit properly: Pins are too short. So it is all wiggly-waggly.<br />I'm very disappointed.<br />My car is VW GTI VR 2004.
B00L9IJ9EA|5|Great quality and fitting wis perfict
B008HY8XYG|5|Worked perfectly.
B00D3QTGFI|5|fits perfectly on my audi a6 c6
B004GCANWS|5|Perfect
B000BVRZ74|5|Smells very toxic/potent. I used it in my bathroom glass door to repel the water and the smell got me really dizzy even with the air vent on.
B00P3GDD8M|5|perfect OEM part.Directions included..easy to install.
B000VKZNQA|5|Awesome product.  Perfect fit.
B00PVNSGVQ|5|Great keychain, good quality make, I recommended this to all BMW owners.
B00PX1IW6K|1|These are like tie downs for a boat, not for kitchens.
B00192QB9M|5|Be sure to wire correctly. I purchased not female and male thinking wire connection would be alike but after studying the diagram it requires different wiring. Best way to wire is to plug both into each other and Compare Where all colors and ground wrest belong.
B0049HGOYG|1|They forget to tell you that this module needs to be programed so you still need to go to a dealer.  The product is OK I guess.
B000C9WJ8K|5|A great filter for a 43 year old garden tractor that slowly loses its prime. The filter is larger than the standard filter and if I run out of fuel all I have to do is look down at filter to make sure that it is the problem. I will purchase another when needs replaced.
B00W5X6EJ6|3|Item Was A Day Or Two Late, But Other Than That It Was Perfect.
B0000AXNMO|5|Have been using this product for nearly 30 years. I've tried similar products, but nothing holds up or gives the performance of Rain-X. Works great on glass showers too!
B00MXV6SVE|2|I saw in the description that these could be used as driving lights (I was assuming as replacement headlights)  These look great as far as color but I cant see 10 feet in front of me when driving at night.  They didn't work when I plugged them in at first but I had read somewhere that the polarity had to be reversed, so I cut the factory wires, added 2 leaders/pigtails and reversed the leads and they came on...funny thing is, after my truck is off, they flicker or strobe constantly...VERY noticeable at night but not so much during the day. I wouldn't recommend for headlight replacement at ALL, but cosmetically the look good enough for DRL or projection fog lamps
B001DKT0DO|4|I have been using this for past 4 months and i didn't have any issues. It's good and i like it... There was no manual how to use it, where i need find videos in Youtube how to fix it.. Otherwise it's a good product i got couple more and given to my friends as well..
B00D1SWLEG|2|I bought these Alpena LED strips to replace 2 strips on my motorcycle.  The previous owner had installed several amber, red and white LED strips, all Alpena brand.  The strips I'll be replace still work but they are decomposing and falling apart.  The red and white LED strips are all fine but all of the clear covering over the amber strips has become very soft, some even gooey and sticky to the point that the cover material will come off on my clothes if I brush up against them, they collect lint and debris and the covering is peeling off from the underlying LEDs and circuit strip.  When I opened the package of new amber strips today, I found that the clear covering on these new strips is also somewhat tacky to the touch right out of the box.  I don't expect these amber LED strips will hold up any better that the defective ones that came on the motorcycle.  I did email Alpena weeks ago about the problem to see if it was due to a production problem with the ones that I had or if there was a solution to the stickyness problem.  I have not received a response.  Also, these LED strips cost probably twice what they should cost (that is if they had a good quality covering) because Alpena unnecessarily includes a battery pack and a push button switch with every package hardwired to the LED strips.  The battery pack and switch are there just so you can test the LED strips and see how extremely bright they are compared to other brands.  Of course they're very bright.  The battery pack supplied with the LED strips contain 10 each 1.5v batteries totaling 15v basically over driving the LEDs compared to a real world application in a 12v circuit.  All of this extra hardware will get cut off and thrown away when you install the LED strips unless you're a hobbyist wanting extra 15v battery packs and switches lying around to experiment with.  All I need are the LED strips not the useless extra hardware and cost.  There are at least 7 pairs of the LED strips installed on my bike.  That makes 7 switches, 7 battery boxes, 70 little batteries and the associated hard-wiring production costs that got tossed out.  Environmentally irresponsible and unnecessarily expensive.  Bottom line is that the covering is poor quality and will become a nuisance eventually.  The products over priced and deceptively marketed by over-driving the LEDs to justify the higher price.  I will go ahead and replace the two defective strips on my bike just because the old ones look so bad with the lint and debris encrusted covering hanging off flapping in the wind but I will find another vendor's solution to replace the rest of the defective Alpena amber LED strips.
B00IA5QTL6|5|Awesome product. Perfect fit and perfectly tuned! Truck runs like a sewing machine now ! And best of all it was half the price of competitors! Thanks ! I'm happy to leave positive feedback :)
B0002LWHJO|5|The shield fits my V70 perfectly and does what it is supposed to do. When rolled up, it is a little bit long, but it's the size of the windshield, so it's to be expected. It's not too bulky when rolled up and I just toss it in the back seat. The velcro strap to keep it rolled is a nice touch. I would recommend.
B00GBBCTT2|5|nice fit, plus its cheap
B0010Z4MDK|5|I am very happy with my purchase experience.  I only get it a few days so I do not know how long it will last yet.  My old radioshack one lasted me 6 years.  I ordered it on saturday and get that on Tuesday.  I am at southern california.  It comes with F1 adapters which I need to replace for my security system.  Same dimension as my old radioshack 12v 5Ah battery.  Great price too.
B0057PFJW2|4|I love these seat covers they are comfortable and don't ever get too hot in the sun tho they are black which I liked. Not anymore difficult to put on than any other seat cover, pretty standard. The only thing is if you have a separate head rest on top rather than one solid seat, the top has extra material hanging off both sides of that headrest. But still does not look bad and I would recommend this to anyone looking to put a little nightmare in their car.
B001OCXHZS|4|As other people have mentioned, it is not shiny like shown in the picture. Also the screws on the side were about 0.5&#34; too short and the stake pocket hole mounts didn't really fit so i had to buy some 3/8&#34; washers. $2.00 overall at home depot. All in all, this is a great deal.
B000EQ74BI|5|Easy to install....saved a bunch of $$ doing it myself....just keeping the car in good condition.
B00Z08MJOC|5|exxxelent brighter than the stock bulbs AAA+++
B00GBVHPNW|1|They hurt the tips of your fingers inside and they rub all of your knuckles raw, especially if they get wet. I do not regiment these gloves to anyone I'm not even giving them away I'm throwing them out.
B00FB3L09Q|5|Very bright and love to blind other drivers
B007ZGE7MO|5|Great!!! fixes well kept dirt inside mat really good.
B008JCW9GY|5|Easy to locate what I need through Amazon, works fine, no problems in shipping with everything thing I have bought!
B00E5A4ANO|1|The clutch lever is not made properly because once installed it does not his the switch that that needs to be hit therefore the motorcycle won't start. No good for the gsxr 1000
B0096J7VAI|5|Pretty Awesome Rear Parking Lights. Easy to install.
B00BJCN08M|3|My bucket dollies came with the plastic screws just as someone else said they might.  The picture shows metal screws.  You really have to crank the screws in to keep it attached to the bucket which caves the side of my plastic buckets in.  If you bump something they will come off.  I use these to put tools in a bucket and roll around in a pit that usually has some water in it.  What I am going to do is drill holes in my buckets where these plastic screws meet the side of the bucket and let them stick through like a pin and then they will not come off.  They do roll around nice.  I just have a different use for them I guess.
B007NZA3TS|4|Seem to work great.  Have had them in for a couple of months now.  No installation instructions, so make sure you know what you're doing.  Installation on my Hyundai Tucson was difficult, but these fit perfectly.
B000M5YYIW|3|Nothing special, just restocking supplies
B00D3298A0|5|Heavy duty, nice looking floor mats at a good price.
B007R4M3KC|5|I absolutely love these spray bottles. They are a bit more expensive, but I have ordered and used them several times, and I have ZERO issues with leakage, as I do when using some of the cheaper bottles.
B00061SGTK|1|look good did not work,will not buy again
B000K02904|5|2004 chevy silverado z71 with a 5.3L v8. Does what it's supposed to.
B004U00QR8|5|Good product but pricey.
B00DUMWB0C|1|One star because I received the wrong sticker. Got the &#34;Marine Mom&#34; one instead of this one. Yeah...great. I'll be looking real tough with my &#34;Marine Mom&#34; on my truck...lol. Don't feel like bothering returning a bumper sticker. You win.
B000V8VZ78|5|I received a sample for evaluating and all opinions are my own.<br /><br />  If you look at the original picture of my leather couch, it was covered with kid gunk. The leather had a lot of scratches and ashy areas too.<br />I first used European Leather's Deep Cleaner prior to using this treatment. It needed to be thoroughly cleaned. I tested a small area on the side of a cushion prior to massaging this in.<br /><br />  Surprisingly, the 2in1 features of the Restorer both worked. It removed a lot more of the grime and conditioned my leather nicely at the same time. The scratches from nails (dog and kids) were not visible anymore, the color of the leather deepened (restored), and the leather felt more supple, like a perfectly worn-in baseball glove.<br /><br />  For me, it definitely cleaned way better than some of the stuff I bought off the shelf at the &#34;Big-Box&#34; store.
B00ALOW8FK|5|perfect fit thanks
B000X3EP8M|5|Awesome product
B001EOV492|5|Just as described. Good quality

B0002HRBSU|5|Awesome product
B00BU44TOI|5|Excellent product and I can feel the difference in performance.  A must have for any vehicle.
B0087Q58XI|5|Running a 62 tooth sprocket with this 13 tooth clutch on a mini bike with 14&#34; tires.  Clutch slips quite a bit when starting from a dead stop, but no issues with overheating.
B00OA9ACYG|5|Great spray bottles!  The reason these are so sought after is due to 1/2 the effort needed to spray. The liquid comes out as you squeeze and also as you release. For someone using all day like a car Detailer, this would cut down on the hand/wrist strain. Color coding allows for different liquids in each to be quickly and easily identifiable.
B00MF7M6CQ|5|Easy to locate what I need through Amazon, works fine, no problems in shipping with everything thing I have bought!
B00Z7KIZPA|2|It is way too small for a larger purse and doesn't fit well in a large SUV that has the 40/20/40 front seat. It is made for a car with the smaller gap between the seats.
B00ABKN6WI|5|Good product! Delivered as described and easy to use.
B008OK2ESE|5|works great
B007UMCHXE|4|Shipped fast.  Made well

B00N18CD5I|1|Did not work at all !  Had  dim lights but no Bright-lights . No instructions .
B000CQDRRA|5|Perfect - just what I needed
B000S6V37A|4|love it but you can't fit 33&#34; as advertised 265/70r17 scrub even after modifying my factory mudflaps 265/65r17 should tuck perfectly
B000CSEV6E|5|my next purchase will be to you.
B008G2XMD6|4|Came fast, worked great. Like everyone else said, a little filing on the post with my leatherman file made it slide into place. A file less install would have made it a 5 star product.
B0001XPC8Q|3|just doesn't fit like I hoped
B006ZBOBO4|5|Perfect fit, simple to install, simple to use, and durable.
B00YTLJ59I|5|Cheap,Great quality and the Paint looks nice
B000MDZLQ8|5|Fits perfect. Looks great
B000O388KM|5|It's exactly wanted, an official M109R tank bra
B0014O41NS|5|Excellent product, if you have a strong doggy who wants to be in the front seat on your lap as you are trying to drive. Easy to install and remove.
B00O2I5ILM|4|I liked that it is super easy to attach and remove! It stays on extremely well!! However, I also can not pull<br />my visor all the way down. Plus the anti glare feature, which I like and appreciate at night, makes everything<br />look darker and a little strange during day time. I am still adjusting to everything appearing closer.<br />I thought one SUV was trying to climb in the back of my SUV. I still like it. I just need to get used to it.
B00KXMEMVI|5|Excellent!
B00RC2JBY0|1|Don't like the application of decal at all. Much prefer the vinyl ones that adhere to the OUTSIDE of the window.
B004RFKBEO|5|We love it, The Bike rack is perfect for our use and it was surprisingly sturdy as well. I would differently recommend this product.
B004A69H8G|5|Works great easy to install and I've never had an issue from an msd product
B003D1MZGU|5|These fit perfectly in my 2010 Accord even though Amazon's website said they wouldn't fit. I took a chance and I'm glad I did. Now I can actually make use of my door pocket. These should come standard in Hondas. At least there is something out there for that purpose.
B0002NIKFC|5|love these mats, they look good in my Camaro, I would say yes to anyone who wants a nice set of mats, they are thick and durable
B000TYQB1Y|1|Bought this new here on Amazon and 6 months later its bad again, throwing the VSS code. I will see if Amazon will exchange or return. Seems It should last longer than 6 months.
B001LHVOVK|4|It works! It is a great resource to have and can save you some money at the garage.
B007V2CPWG|5|works fine with no problems. Very well built and heavy duty. Worth the extra price over cheap knock offs.
B00S9RD3AU|5|Bought these a month ago and they're still looking great.. To be honest I was surprised of how how high quality the feel. Fit and finish is perfect. Only thing I didn't realize is that these come with the smoked lenses, which doesn't look bad at all but wish I would've payed better attention and got the standard clear lenses. Whenever I get a chance, I'll buy the clear lense headlights from this seller
B00P1N8QU2|4|good quality.  was hoping they'd be as good as some of the other reviews said they were and they are.  sort of a short to medium nap but otherwise sturdy.  will probably purchase again.
B00VUH7ZR8|5|Installed it as a docking light on our pontoon boat. Works perfectly! Note: Not used as 'driving light'. Generally not legal for that.
B004UR34RA|5|still have my f-150 ride until i hook up fifthwheel 30 foot. it like nothing behind you
B0018MITR0|3|It was not as thick as it looks in the picture.  Unfortunately, I left it on a paratransit trip to my doctor appointment.  But, it all worked out since my next purchase led to me buying the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me!
B00I7WZCG0|5|Fits perfectly & looks great!
B00030D25W|5|Worked as advertised no problems, quick shipping too.
B00YI3IGA6|5|Even though the back windows of my SUV are tinted, the summer sun can be brutal.  We had considered replacing the tint with a darker tint, but then we discovered ShadeSox.  I was immediately impressed with the quality of the ShadeSox.  They are very well made of black nylon mesh and so easy to install.  You hold up the ShadeSox to find which end is the “big end” and the “shorter end.”  The “big end” goes on the hinged end of the door, the “shorter end” goes on the handle end of the door.  Now, just slide it down over the window and you're done.  I was so happy when given the opportunity to purchase during a promotion, to evaluate and share my own unbiased opinion through a review.
B0041TR3BK|5|Excellent, The exchange for the initial damaged one went smoothly
B000EQTX5I|5|They preform great
B00PJH4V0E|1|Product does not fit 1984 Chevy S-10 pickup as claimed. Unable to bolt mirrors on with adapter plate sent. Bolts to hold mirror on OEM are from outside of vehicle, mirror with adapter plate from inside. Would have to drill thru door/window pillar. Mirrors are for sale if anybody wants them...
B00JNCIC0Q|5|this keychain is very well built and beautiful
B0068FUU38|2|I've had a while to test this out now and all I can say is whooptydo. My bike does run better with it. It didn't eliminate the pops completely, but it works. I notice when my stryker runs like crap and pops a lot, at a stop light I'll have to turn the key off for about 2 seconds, and then back on, and the tuner resets itself, and then it runs better and what do you know, no more pops. You'd think at 80 times per second as it states, that it would &#34;auto correct&#34; the tune since it is an &#34;auto tuner&#34; right cobra? I also have cobra speedster swept pipes and have found the air leak which cobra claims to be the cause for the &#34;still popping&#34; on deceleration issue right at the clamp after the O2 sensor. The clamp broke twice because of poor manufacturing in attempts to correcting the issue which still exists now. I'd have to take it off and take it to a shop to weld the sob shut and air tight. What are your thoughts on that cobra? Back to the tuner issue. I think an auto tuner is good if it is actually auto tuning, but it takes the power out of the users hands since it eliminates your ability to correct an issue yourself. The other tuners are cheaper, and you can adjust it yourself to correct any issues you cannot with an &#34;auto&#34; tuner. I experience surges every now and then, weird, at 80 times per second and with a cost four hundred plus, I shouldn't have to feel that crap.
B00KYU9M8M|4|Works fine. Don't like having to drill for back holes.
B00642ARHO|5|Love this item, bought it for my boyfriend and he pit it on his hydro flask and it looks awesome!
B00UYBIU3Y|5|this seat fits perfect and is a great addition
B00U3FUHWI|5|Muy buenos
B008WAEZYM|4|Decent value for the money.  Two things to keep on hand, though:  Loctite Blue and an array of cotter pins from your local hardware.  Regarding the cotter pins, some of the factory ones were so undersized, I was able to pass the entire pin through the hole in the bolt without restriction.  If you detect a lot of slop when wiggling the pin in the hole, up-size from your own supply.  Use of cotter pins is often determined by the safety quotient of the bolt being secured.  Clearly, this is no place to skimp.  I would highly recommend frequent checking of wheel lugs and nuts, too.  I doped up the lugs with Loctite after discovering looseness.  Why the factory would use flat washers instead of lock washers at the wheels is beyond me.  Having said all of that, the grandkids' grins, per dollar spent, made the purchase very worthwhile.  Once you learn the idiosyncrasies, these are loads of fun.
B005H13SKQ|5|These are prefect. They are easy to install and work great. They have a turn signal on the side of the mirror
B001DBVPY0|3|This product did improve my horsepower and mileage. Only problem is at about 2200 RPM there is such a loud noise from the engine that it makes its way into the cabin and you can hardly hear anyone in the cabin talk to you. It's very and annoying. Other than that the product has worked fine if you avoid said RPM.
B0041PYGGO|5|fit the factory spotlights on the yamaha star 1100 perfectly.
B003VCI61O|5|Headline says it all. Put it on a 1998 Mercury Mountaineer. It fit perfectly.
B005DQ5C2C|3|These are high quality spacers but they don't have the rounded lug nuts to perfectly center the wheel. It's not that important, it just made putting them on slightly more difficult. I put these on a sportsman 500 and they have held up great.
B00F7NEREU|3|The elastic strap that goes around the back of the seat is way too small; it almost broke the first time that I had to forcibly stretch it to go over the seat.  I imagine it will not last very long since it is far too tight.  Why can't Zone Tech look at the actual size of most seats in cars today?
B007NQMFWU|5|Does exactly what it says, straightforward and easy to install, only difficulty at all was actually pulling out the old smog pump junk. If you're ditching the stock exhaust (you'll wish you'd done it sooner), this kit is a no brained must have.
B0057QZPZ2|5|Great jack. Should have gotten one a long time ago.
B000ALDXV2|5|As expected.
B00683W092|5|Wire connector not much to say
B0068MX3HG|5|Fit perfect, seems like a well made F]filter.
B00AWN5OEM|1|I just purchased these seat covers. The picture is beautiful. When mine came one elastic was broke. I tried pulling one piece of elastic and it broke also. Elastic is very thin and hooks are too small and cheap! I had to sew a thick piece of elastic on one side and feed under the seat to sew on the other side. Wasn't worth the money. Would not recommend!
B0032GQCWO|5|best camper product on amazon. looks great on my vintage aluminum camper. very well constructed. no plastic here.
B001DH81QY|5|Came quickly and working good. Small crack in the radiator didn't help and was able to replace reasonably with this purchase rather than taking to a shop.  Although a cracked head was the real problem. No leaks, mixing oil or other signs of head problems but that is what the problem was.
B0014URZF8|1|Had to return.  Not for my vehicle.  According to Amazon the vehicle uses these; however, once I had the old ones in hand noticed that they are completely different.  Had to run to the local auto parts store to purchase a new set.
B0006SH4KU|3|SEEMS TO REMOVE THE DIRT WELL BUT HAS A STRONG LINGERING ODOR.....NOT BAD BUT I DON'T WANT IT LINGERING IN MY HOME ALL DAY.  THE ODOR IS STRONG SO I WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN AND WILL USE IT ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE OF WINDOWS.  THE DETAILER THAT USES THIS PRODUCT ON THE INSIDES OF CARS MUST GET ALOT OF COMMENTS.....I GUESS HIS RESPONSE IS......JUST DRIVE WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN FOR A FEW HUNDRED MILES.....LOL  BACK TO WINDEX FOR ME
B004C443P8|4|Fits great.
B006HY8DC0|5|Great decal! Easy to apply and looks fabulous!
B003DNL8YI|4|Good quality.
B001BSM986|1|The 1st set filled up with water within a month.  The 2nd set filled with water within a day. Not worth the hassle of mounting and unmounting multiple times.  Will never buy another Recon product again!
B00697VFZW|5|Found it's place on my back window. For the whole world to see!
B00OAAB13G|5|125cc Pit bike sounds awesome and seems to give a little more low end torque
B00G0PJMP8|5|Perfect fit 2008 MDX
B008HRX5PU|5|Fits perfectly! just like any other Berk Technology product.
B0068C4KPK|5|Excellent product.
B00029JK78|5|Easy to cut, crimp and boot giving you a custom fit. Have enough left over for my sleds and motorcycles too!<br /><br />I did not use a table vise, i used a battery/slip lock pliers and worked great plus much faster.
B00NWF5RUI|4|worked great, would recommend.  went on you tube to get clear instructions as to how to use.  not sure why shipping it with clear instructions would be so hard, only downside.
B00WL11AMS|4|This portable compressor is great! Never used one before but it works like a charm. Product is great quality, I can tell it's built sturdy because of the weight for being compact. Had a flat tire the other day and this compressor got me going in less than 5 minutes. Only reason I'm not giving this a full 5 star rating is because of the pressure gauge, it's off by 5 psi. I put enough air in my tire to get to 35 psi according to the built in gauge, but when I tested it with a manual gauge, it read 40 psi. But other than that, it's perfect and very handy to keep inside the car with you. I got this product for free, thank you.
B0028JBEBK|5|Perfect fit, and as usual great quality from HeatShield
B00757IGYS|1|i live in FL and there are no hills or mountains and this antenna cannot even pickup the local HD radio station without static. Im upset with this purchase
B000WEMH4G|5|Fast delivery and made very rugged should last for a long time. Highly recommend
B0000AY4YT|4|Works good
B000J2JE7Y|5|perfect fit
B003NU9O0G|5|Received item quick.  Worked as specified.  I've only had to use it once so far, but glad I have it available for future use.
B000EALHHG|1|Even though I applied it several times IAW directions; didn't touch my years old transmission oil stains in concrete.
B00BH449ZU|5|They will treat you right
B0032FTS4E|5|Perfect fit, fast shipping!
B0045GUGHM|4|Brake performance: THE BEST EVER!  I thought my car had disappointingly soft brakes when I bought it.  Apparently, I just had bad brake pads!  EBC pads made a night and day difference. Dust: So far it is generating quite a bit of dust.  If the dust issue goes away after a few months, I will post an update and increase the rating to 5 starts.
B0082ACE3G|4|This tonneau cover was installed in less than 10 minutes.  It looks great.  Within a week after installing, took it on a 2,000 mile trip through all kinds of rain and wind with luggage underneath it.  Not a drop of water was found anywhere inside the bed through it all!  The only &#34;complaint&#34; that I have is that at speeds over 70 MPH the wind causes the cover to flap against the frame some, and this results in some noise.  This also seems to happen in certain wind conditions.  It is installed correctly, and my opinion (I am a mechanical engineer and registered PE) this is expected given the design.  The noise wasn't annoying.  For the price this is a great cover.
B00PA6TGSQ|5|Excellent
B00077ZDWQ|3|The extender fits my new Subaru Outback, but not perfectly. It jiggles quite a bit which is unnerving with my bikes hanging off the back. Also I am not excited about the pin hole location, the extender should have two pin holes so that it can be pushed father into the hitch for a tighter fit.
B00T5EV4ZM|5|Hope he is used in some capacity if he doesn,t make prez.
B000HBGI8K|5|Used this as a replacement for the extremely expensive Nissan sealant. I used this as recommended by a fellow Nissan owner and it has worked great. Not a single complaint. For those that don't know, Not all of these sealants are the same. Don't cheap out. Just because it's Permotex does not mean it's the one you need.
B00PGCD8WY|4|easy install. strong!!
B0093PGT7Q|1|This DOES NOT fit a 2007 Harley Roadking,  It does not have the indent on the clutch lever that allows for stating the bike when in gear.<br />Thanks for wasting my time.
B0016H0O6G|3|These are not good quality lights. If you are looking for some cheap kit to get your by this is it. If you are looking for something that will last you need to keep looking and expect to spend more. I bought them knowing what I should expect. I'm happy with what I got. I'm just giving an honest review. I can't give dollar store items the same rating that I would give a quality product.
B0068ERAG4|5|This helmet is great!
B000FIXQXK|5|Essential for anyone that wrenches on stuff.
B00HULYKGM|5|Fit perfectly in 2005 Jag X-Type
B00D568AN0|5|works perfect
B0002Q7TP6|5|Fast shipping great price and a perfect fit
B004GDNV8A|1|The product does not correspond to what the image shows.It does not come with a lock and keys.
B0021KZFCA|5|Perfect for headlight restoration! Very good quality and strong materials!
B00S4B1IUI|5|diagnosed and erased the airbag light on my 2011 Smart Fortwo in a snap. Item paid for itself compared to what the dealer quoted me to diagnose. Seems like a great tool for the hobby DYI car mechanic. Consider buy one for another make and model as well.
B000CPJLEY|5|have a GM 4L60 1996 chevy. had intermittent late 4th gear up shift. put this product in after sucking out 10OZ, and no more late upshifts been over a month now.
B00HTP8N0I|5|ok
B00UYNII5C|1|my recommendation is to spend the extra money on something brand name. This flew off my bike while doing 30 mph. What ever is used for adhesive does not hold. Absolute garbage and a waste of money. I could have went to the local store and bought something that will last a life time.
B00JF9IJ7I|5|We just got back from our first visit to Ceti Alpha 6. No Klingons to report. Tribbles behaved themselves.
B000Q3OTQC|5|I am impressed.  I can feel the difference.  Highly recommended
B002VI2YG2|5|Perfect ....... Easy to install
B000GZPH2U|5|i agree with others, this is a great product. it can be moved to where it's needed with reasonable effort.
B0100FL5N0|5|I just installed by BackRack on my 2005 Ford SuperDuty.  I LOVE this product.  It totally changes the look of my truck not to mention the functionality.  I also installed a light bar and work lights on my BackRack so that I didn't have to drill into by bedrails or roof.  It is very durable and made from heavy steel, very well made!!!!  If you are looking for some protection for your rear window and/or need to install a variety of lights on your truck, this is a MUST BUY!!!.
B009UPLIG6|5|easy to install and works perfectly
B00VAIPU8S|5|Good gloves.
B00IPZZMAA|5|installed on my scooter. it works fine.
B00I8ITN22|5|Works as it should.
B00GC42ZH4|5|needed small amount of triming but overall good
B006VFMOTI|1|The size is INCORRECT, 6x6x10? ITS 3 inches by 3 inches. Get it right.
B007SO0YDE|5|proud mama
B001GJ3FIS|1|This product is not worth the money. It only lasted for about 20 hours of total use, then it leaked and lost pressure. No recommended.
B00823FSRC|5|Works perfectly as advertised and I have no complaints. It is well worth the cost and I have used it for approximately 7 months in all many different conditions. You just need to make certain that the kayak is well secured to the cart via a cleat or fitting and the tie down strap.
B004I1B5WE|5|Replaced a cracked foglight on my 2007 TL. This was a perfect match. Looks identical. I would recommend also buying these (Acura Front Bumper Push Type Retainers 91503-SZ3-003) on Amazon for around five bucks in case you mess up a few removing them. Oh yes, you need to remove the front bumper to replace the lamp. No way around it. Took me 45 mins for the whole repair. It was actually a lot easier than I expected. No special tools needed (10mm socket and a flathead and phillips screwdriver. Make sure to remove the power wires from the lamp (they are clipped to the foglamp housing) before pulling the bumper off.  Update: 9/1/16 - it's been a year and no issues with condensation, lens still clear. No regrets on this as an alternative to an OEM part.
B000C80AGY|5|Even though Amazon lists it as such, this thermostat is NOT a proper fit to a Volvo S80 2.8L (2000, in particular). Otherwise, the unit works great.  I spoke to Stant and they told me they test it either for 30,000 cycles or miles, I don't remember which.  In any case, I had this unit installed in my vehicle for almost 100k miles without problems (if I wasn't doing routine maintenance on related parts, I think it would go another 100k!).  The key to longevity is to keep your coolant clean, using good quality coolant mixed with distilled water, NOT tap water!!!
B00NVBW5EY|5|Love this product!!!  No more CRUMBS on the floor between the seat and the console.  Such a hard place to vacuum.  Now I can catch them before they fall.
B00OUNGVP6|1|Look Cheap, Will not put on my Bike........ but might get some sort of use (kids Go-Cart)....
B00HS0YABA|1|Don't work trash
B00B3YLG5K|5|OK
B0015I0LQO|5|I ordered the size one number up based on recommendations and I got it right on the money! they fit perfect! I'm size 10 and I ordered size 11. They look great and good quality. I love fox products and I do expect the same great quality on every product and this one was no exception. The boots feel very comfortable and they are almost broken in right out of the box. I have been waking around the house with them and so far so good. Very happy with this purchase. If you think that they are expensive, well, What about a visit to the ER. I have tried them on the bike around my neighborhood and they seem to be OK, I had a bit of trouble shifting up a bit but I'm sure it's a matter of getting used. As soon as I try them on the field I'll update this review. So far 5 stars!  Get these boots you won't regret it.
B00L32L4A4|5|Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service
B001U8QS9I|5|After 20 years I decided to replace the seat covers in my Jeep. The old saddle blanket ones were still holding up, but the stretch material was all s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d out and I was tired of them (they also had 20 years of dirt). A new set would cost me over a hundred dollars!! These seat covers by FB Group cost what the old ones did 20 years ago! Yea, you get what you pay for, but I didn't want to pay that much and was ready for a change. The reviews were pretty good, so I got them. Believe the reviews! Amazon said they would fit my '94 Jeep...well, it depends on how you define &#34;fit.&#34; But they were much easier to install than my old ones had been, they did fit better, and the manufacturer provided way more hardware than I needed (a first!), oh, yea, you get a back seat cover too which I never had! I recommend without qualification to any owner of a Wrangler style pre 1994 Jeep.
B001AHQ8LM|1|These brakes did not fit as specified (2010 VW Jetta TDI).
B00CXMN1VS|5|arrived on time and worked; however, the spark plugs were not the same as my current ones.
B00068VBX6|4|Looks great!  High end look to it
B00VT2NR5S|1|The description on these lights is wrong. It says they are 5.2 inches when in actuality, they are 4 inches long which is too short for the side markers I need.
B0068G0028|5|Good fit no struggle looks really good on the bike thanks 5 out of 5
B00S8ODZPC|5|Really glad I got these! For the price you cant go wrong. They look great and the shipping was fast  All around very pleased with my purchase .
B00CEXKBS2|3|They look nice but having problem with one of  them sticking in place, at times I have to glue it back in place.
B00UVMV7S6|1|This key fob would not program to my car using the seller’s instructions. Also the bottom half of the key fob has small cracks were it snaps to the other half. The seller was not helpful at all…Not worth your time or money…
B0082X2R30|2|Nice quality but way too big for my stock America seat. Keep it for my aussie horse saddle instead. Prompt and efficient service so no complaints about the seller.
B001O0A8KC|5|As described
B00G4S0UES|1|I tried to use this touch-up paint, and it was dried up right out of the bottle. Since it was too late to return it, I tried adding some thinner at which point it turned into a gooey mess. Then I tried using it on a small area of my truck,and the color was totally wrong. Luckily, I was able to remove it before any permanent damage was done. I am extremely disappointed in this product. It is complete garbage, and I would give it less than one star if I could.
B000GV1QP6|5|Nice retrofit on k75. Looks almost exactly like original and improves the ride a lot. Why are these things so expensive?
B008Y2RZ7W|2|Too small for key fob; had to return it
B00VQKCOV6|5|Love it! Excellent quality sticker.
B006EGAIII|5|Strong ! Inexpensive  ! And far better than the metal ones.
B001R5NB4E|5|Perfect fit
B004VS5OW6|5|Works and fits fine, no issues.
B005A8MNFC|4|Seems. To be what. I was looking. For
B0050NGB32|5|fits and works
B003TVR3Z2|5|I have not installed in my Rat Rod yet but kit looks very straight forward and a simple installation !!!
B006N98KD6|5|Exelent
B00SKWM95Y|5|I'm using these on a 08 Civic coupe and the installation took all of 15 minutes. Not bad at all. I'm using them for DRL!
B00DE7NE0E|5|Perfect oem fit.
B00199DPWQ|5|What can be said, If you buy quality you will get quality.
B0073MF7L0|5|does a good job of keeping it cool  like to buy another one for a similar vehicle !!
B000C9JAGE|5|worked great!
B00BFDG06E|5|Well, it fit perfectly but let's see if it solves the annoying check engine light problem in my 2001 Civic EX.  My Honda dealer recommended changing it along with the evaporative canister and related valves (which are on order).
B007ZDXX4K|5|love it
B00LBNL3VK|5|Seems brighter than the standard incandescent, plus a nicer white light.  I'm using them on license plate lamps on my volt.  One of the units started flickering. I unplugged it, and swapped. It lights for about a second, then begins flickering again.  I contacted the seller, and they shipped a replacement within 24 hours of my email
9099000766|4|Fast service and nice product for what it was. I would have liked to see instructions included. I realize it should be self explanatory,however, cleaning prep of the surface and care instruction would be nice.
B00NF1PT8O|4|i LOOK A JUST LIKE THE ONE THAT CAME ON THE TRANSMISSION. Had trouble getting the drain plug out of the pan. Because they had painted the drain bolt and pan together. Then they had heat treated the paint to protect the pan.This make the bolt hard to loosen.
B000P57HWY|5|It was an excellent purchase, works great in the bike.
B005EL3UES|2|It was a great product but did not fit my motorcycle.  I really wish that it would have fit my model Harley but It seems that this Bag will only fit a Road King and not a Heritage Softail as it states it will.  Had to return it for a refund.
B008TXHZ58|5|A must have.
B00DSO9ISU|5|Works with my I-Pass perfectly.
B00ANZHG4U|2|Leaves microfibers when using, also found a much better deal at Costco
B0074OL2I4|5|Worked out well
B00JBI8LGM|4|Very pleased with these for the price. They fit well and look good
B000EM0FRW|1|Received and installed this starter July 19, 2015 after 3 weeks of use it has failed..... guaranteed but what the hell still needs to be replaced
B008XB9BJY|5|When we got our motorhome in Jan 2015 we immediately set about making it efficient and eco friendly.  Solar electricity, a composting toilet and LED bulbs.  The first ones I got, for the fixtures with bayonet posts, were AWFUL. Within a month they began to lose lights and finally when each was down to 3 out of 15 little lights and a candle would have provided more illumination, I looked for new ones.  So far, so good.  I like the color (warm white as opposed to bright white/blueish) and they are working well.  We've had them for a month so unless something changes I am giving them 5 stars-they work and they give a nice light.
B00FR2JF0W|4|Works well
B002RYBS76|1|Dented/damaged cans
B0082ACE3G|4|Great fit on our 2011 Titan. Easy to use and install. We used it on a trip to the beach. It rained very hard during the trip there and our things got just a little wet at the tailgate end. Otherwise, no complaints!
B00J6FJFLU|5|Awesome pads !
B0016INGEC|4|Perfect
B000765MHI|1|BURNED OUT MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM! $500 Repair bill!!! used for three minutes and when cranked truck back up ... ZAPP! ASE Master mechanic said it absolutely was this device being plugged into lighter when truck was started up - said he had never seen such damage to master fuses and ignition coil done so fast - they had done a full inspection 2 weeks earlier as part of normal maintenance and upkeep
B00B2A2REE|1|Defective! Lasted 1 week
B005SULSLC|5|Quality is good....NICE
B0012GTVVA|3|Put on my RV screen door to use as handle. Works good, kind of small distance between the bracket and the door for my large hands.
B008O0WO7K|5|This works very well
B003WKHMBA|3|Unfortunately it said it would fit the 2015 KIA Soul, but it truly doesn't. I am still using the font covers; although they are not well-fitted and the back seat didn't work at all according to my local Car Care Center guys who told me to send it all back, but since it an inexpensive set and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning, I kept it anyway to use the front in order to avoid the all black interior. Plus if you are considering, know that the yellow is more a bright sunshine yellow and not golden yellow like in the picture, which would have better matched my exterior, but I guess you get what you pay for and they were cheap.
B00QHU4DQE|5|Looks great
B000CONYJI|5|Building a BBC and decided to use this and made three return holes for oil to drain back to pan. 2 in front and one in the rear. If you use this without drain boles, the oil will fill up in the lifter galley. The screen prevents oil from going through, but air blows right through. That's the advantage. Went right in, very sticky epoxy, clear expiration date. By the way, the picture is wrong. These are long strips of screen with one round piece for the front.
B00WFJ0MF2|5|Durable and depandable
B005636AEG|4|2016 RDX AWD Base 48&#34; fits.  The width of the Parking Armor just fits width wise in the trunk of the RDX. The top part of the Parking Armor that normally sits on the top of bumper can't on the RDX, but allows you to hang the pad all the way down length wise.  The pad covers about 80% of the bumper, beside the sides of the bumper.  This is the biggest downside of the Parking Armor since the sides are one of the more common places people dent/scuff when pulling out from behind you.  The water proof material seems durable and the straps have the same steel cables found in competitors like BumperBully BUT hands down Parking Armor is superior is padding.  BumperBully might protect against light taps and from scratching but doesn't offer the padding and softness that foam can.  What would you rather run into? A thin rubber mat or a 2&#34; thick foam pad?  Just too bad they could make one that extended more on the sides of the bumper.  Please note this will not work on Cars/SUV with visible exhausts or bumpers that have the license plate in the middle of it.  Anyone drive with this on?  The site says never to do this and says it could result in injury or death lol.  Live in NYC and bought it last night got it the next day.  Fast shipping
B002M4AZFW|5|easy to install very happy with savings and quality oem product .
B001KPW3V8|5|works very good
B000C9G04E|5|This item was better than I expected !
B00OWS4IQ8|5|great top.
B000NU2V22|5|As advertised
B00Q3MRHUU|5|Looks great on my car. I have a grape colored pt cruiser and this license plate frame matches perfectly, I purchased purple. It was very easy to install. I just unscrewed the plate put this frame over it and replaced. I recommend this plate frame to anyone who wants a cool looking license plate.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange of an honest and unbiased review.
B003ZF1GJQ|5|Working good. Read a lot about this product and it has been awesome
B00UMQ5P8O|4|Looks good but fits loose
B0062IJOJ2|5|It was perfect just what I need.
B0013VT5N8|5|Awesome, great, love it
B007GPZQ2E|1|Does not fit q5
B005CLQ3RQ|4|Worked great but need to check the key hole, I didn't so mine is off but it's okay as I don't lock it anyway.
B001MQ01PK|5|This product is amazing. It takes patience and a lot of elbow grease. I worked on my pipes that had about 6&#34; of blue and gold discoloration on them for a good 10-15 min. While it was working well I found that if you are very carful and take your time you can use the buffer wheel on a dremmel. This took it from probably a 2 hr job to about a half hr. This product is worth every penny. $17 for blue job or $480 for new pipes. I'll go with the $17!
B00DQ8N6LI|5|Works on a 2007 335i.
B0064IU5FW|5|Really brought out the best of my 2001 Silverado z71. My truck used to have trouble with the mud grapplers on it but now I can get up to speed and hold a good cruise with no struggle from the engine. Really like the data log option really helps dial in the tune if you have more bolt-on performance upgrades like myself. Also the Diablo can have custom tunes loaded onto it for more specific applications through Lewis at diablew tuning. Looking forward to getting my custom tune in from him.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Solid must have in your car! Bought mine since noticing battery started to show signs of weakness. Was little concerned at first but anxious to test it. So when the battery died it fired it up instantly on the first crank. This is perfect.
B00SUT2UVA|5|OOFIT Ignition Coil CDI Regulator Rectifier has a great voltage regulator that is definitely part of the package. You will find that your ATV can work its way through the muddy woods when you are using this great rectifier. You need to be able to keep the ATV on its feet. The key is to make sure that the ATV is able to make it past the warranty.
B001KR7BHC|3|Please note:  You will need to order TWO of these if you're replacing the plug wires on your Miata.  Package contains only one boot.
B000EDUUG2|5|Wife loves this in our camper
B00CFALFXY|5|Work great
B00609Z776|5|This is one of the few times that I have taken the time to write a review. In a nutshell..... I love this helmet. This is the third helmet of this make and model that I own. Like most  riders I own multiple helmets, different colors and styles. The fit is perfect and the internal sun shade is useful especially for someone that wears glasses.  The fit is perfect and comfortable. The price is too nice to ignore.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00OOL67B2|5|Bought this for a co-worker and he installed it on his BMW i3. He loves it! Frame took about 2 business days to get.
B0056YRAEO|5|Perfect fit on stock 2007 KTM 990 Adventure REAR brakes.  Took no more than 5 minutes to replace originals with 24000 miles to these.<br /><br />Nice to have my pedal back, i did exchange all the fluid in the system and sanded down the disc in a circular motion on both sides and rinse after install with non chlorinated brake cleaner.
B00C6MYQYG|5|Will continue to buy it next time.
B000VKRQEM|5|Great +++
B0085G9U3Y|5|Best tail lens. Fits perfectly for my 96 stang.  Easy to install.
B003SKCARK|4|Which one is better between obenauf's with Huberds ?
B009S4SZFG|5|Works well.
B00ZC20NUS|5|I was truly impressed with how easy to use and effective this tool is. Its shape allows for a comfortable grip in any situation, whether it is checking tire pressure or utilizing any of the other tools available. All in all, it is a gadget like no other, convenient in almost any type of situation and safe and easy to use.
B00IPDQWLK|5|:)
B0016ZL3XG|5|Great quality fast shipping but I sold my truck before I was able to install :(
B00MH8EUBS|5|They are Bilsteins, that pretty much says it all. Excellent shocks, wish I had replaced my old shocks sooner. They soak up the bumps and dips from unimproved roadways without feeling too stiff, ride is comfortable with positive control. My Tacoma prerunner no longer feels &#34;skitish&#34; on bumpy roads.  Installed them on the stock setting, the front end lifted slightly and the truck now sits level vice slightly nose down with stock shocks.
B0002SRCMO|5|Good product
B00BPF54K0|5|work for me
B0015YCE5Y|5|Did the trick, just what I expected!
B00HYHX8GA|5|Put these in my new 2015 Ford Escape because I have light carpets, they fit perfectly, the cargo one was a little long and my automatic door didn't want to close but I did not need to cut it Dow, I waited for it to sit it the car and become more pliable and was able to slide it back far enough to clear the hatch sensor
B000CQFV74|5|Worked great.  Just as described. Thanks
B008G21WWO|3|I installed these headlight assemblies myself and two days later one of the running lights quit on me.  I took the assembly out and wiggled the bulb and it finally came back on. Hopefully, this will take care of the problem.  Have not driven the car since I made this adjustment but still feel that I got my monies worth.  .
B00891EDCS|5|These floor mats are awesome, the rear mats are a bit big for my Chevy Trailblazer, but they still are durable and heavy duty, I would recommend them to anyone looking for good floor mats for their car
B00B2IEY0G|5|Awesome!!!  Fast shipping too
B00AN8XH2W|3|Not real
B000UHD74E|1|Was not happy with this product mainly because I was expecting an aerosol spray to come from the nozzle and instead sprayed a white liquid. Smell was decent but lasted 2 weeks only and can already smell the mustiness slowly returning. Not sure if the product was defective or not...
B006TNF9JE|5|This is just what we needed - the original mirror was loosing its tinting fluid and was a mess.  This fit just right and the wires were just the right length.
B00OJOYKEK|4|Not bad. Very soapy tho
B00BTLEHSK|1|Very Cheap material (Plastic costume material) while installing straps ripped off with very little pull.
B0086S057G|5|It's perfect :-)
B00CNX98RI|5|Very good fit
B00XXLZ2EM|5|Really like these. They are durable, soft and absorbent. I use them at work and at home. They have held up to all my hard tssks. They clean up very well. I just throw them in the washing machine.
B000BQYH6Q|4|Only thing decent that came with the RhinoGear, RhinoRamps Vehicle Ramps. Doesn't make the purchase worth it, but oh well.<br />Don't buy the RhinoRamps unless you want to waste your money for a set of wheel chocks.
B005VKK612|5|Thanks<br />More than wonderful service<br />fast shipping<br />high quality<br />Thanks very much
B000C8NTB2|5|Nice OEM replacement.
B00GONFTTE|5|Great product for the $ used as a driving light on my motorcycle between the forks under the triple tree. Fills in all the gaps around the headlight at night.
B00JKCN4J8|2|I expected this to fit better for a custom product, ill fitting overall, seemed to be missing a tab or velcro on one piece to get it to fit properly. Disappointing, after trying these and the neoprene caltrend, we opted for a coverking product.
B002JH7PEQ|1|When using cup holder power inverter radio receives a lot of feedback - STATIC.  Wish I could return for my money back.
B004T4U3MS|3|Purchased for my daughter has her first helmet... it okay - I will get her a better one next time, But for her first helmet, she likes it.
B001CEG90I|4|Easy to install (strictly a function of the car's design--not the filter). Hard to tell if it's any better filter than the OEM, but it's doing the job.
B004RH9CGK|5|Genuine mopar part, fits like a glove
B00I8IP28G|4|Does the job on my 2014 Mazda 6.
B00IUWM59O|5|Bought 5 of these wired 4 in series to 48volts for ebike put other one in motorcycle nice with digital read out
B0002M9IFO|5|Nice and tight
B00MARZUI8|5|I was extremely happy with the product, very strong product and makes the car look so much better then having to drill holes in the front bumper, I highly recommend the no holes license plate mount!!
B0002U2V1O|4|Gave my truck a wax job.  Came it great.  Only thing is make sure you do a panel at a time.  Was tough to come off.
B003UXFNTW|5|good
B0000AY50X|5|Great polish. I used this product to clean and polish my boat while still in the water. This product cleaned all lift oxidation and water marks while leaving a brilliant shine.
B00KMD9QBO|5|Steering wheel fits perfect on my 2011 dodge avenger and sunshade fits also!
B0074BG5YS|5|Perfect fit, for installation you have to slide this thing down from the top, so go ahead and buy a small container of gear grease or oil if you don't have some on hand
B0099M2RYC|5|We have a motorhome and while we were out camping we ran into a man probably in his eighties.  We were both at the dump station and he started chatting with my husband. The older man asked if we ever have trouble with odor from our black tank. He recommended unique. He said he used to buy it locally but now he has to go on the www to order it. I just laughed but then as we were driving off, I was already on the www looking for it! This stuff is great! Thanks to the older gentleman for passing on a little of his rv wisdom.
B003072EO0|5|I use these gloves when handling weed killer and other household chemicals. I really like the length and the quality is top notch.
B00GG9FB8U|5|20170221<br /><br />Added another picture from Noc 2016 and my car got damaged(dent and scratches)<br /><br />For my first wash(Range rover evoque), I have filled the bucket with 3 gallons of water and a half gallon sprayer also mixed with this green liquid. Moreover, just 2 microfiber mitts and towels.<br /><br />I'm amazed that how clean and shinny without bubbles wash and applying another layer of wax.<br /><br />For my next wash, I will get 5 microfiber mitts and towels, one for each section, top, front, two sides and the back.<br /><br />Here is the picture of 1 day after and ~40miles driving.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />By the way, I haven't wash the car for more than a month and I park on the street, so I am very happy with this rinseless wash result.
B00DRR7HCW|5|excellent product,will use it again
B00IVLOD26|5|excellent product,first time using it and I will now use it again
B000CD6GLM|3|Does not wipe the rain off my corolla!
B001DRHMMS|5|Perfect for my 2006 BMW 330i. Saved money also by not buying it from the dealer who wanted $150, including installation.
B002ZBWKAU|5|good product & easy to use
B0096IYDQO|5|Worked great for my 2015 Dodge Ram 1500 to install HID lights and eliminate the flicker.
B0045XRK06|5|Very useful..I have an extra battery charger stick and I use it along with this USB stick light..so I use it for low light situation when I work on sound systems!! Works great..lots of light and can be aimed exactly where needed due to the flexability of the neck!!
B00HN4CXWY|5|Very strong and appears well-made.
B000KYMS24|5|These are heavy duty foot pegs.  I have them as my passenger foot pegs on my 2014 Heritage Classic and have gotten so many compliments on them when they're in the 'up' position.  Makes the bike look very cool.  Highly recommended if you're after that look.
B00CHDKKF8|2|It is only half of the splash shield not the whole wheel liner only the front haft still missing the back half it  only cover front part
B009IQF3DQ|5|Awsome! Very bright, very cool, i love them, a big step from the 8000k i had....
B00DNX92TQ|5|For less than $30.00 you have the function of tank bags that cost up to $150.00'
B004C1XP82|5|These pipes are amazing. Especially if you are coming from stock. The sound is good and throaty but not obnoxious. An additional note if coming from a completely stock bike: The bike rides a lot more smooth and feels like there's more power on tap =). Also the chugging at lower RPMs was noticeably reduced.
B00CODCS0G|5|Good qaulity vest.  Shipped fast.  It holds my smith and Wesson mp shield tightly and does not fall out.
B000BVRZ74|4|Certainly this product is helpful but there is some room for improvement.  I will continue to buy it though until something better comes along.
B00BTLEIIY|3|Not fantastic.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Shortly after installing, two of the strap to cover connections tore, and now the cover moves around to much.  These might be a good short-term fix, but if you looking for a lasting solution, consider something a bit more substantial.
B00NS1IA78|5|Great instructions included in package and as long as you follow them this is an easy install. Great product that I'd recommend to anyone with this bike.
B00199F2XG|5|Part worked as it should.  Shipping was prompt.
B0055A6IVK|5|What can I say about a simple adapter? Does what its supposed to do ...I'm happy as a clam.
B0010DQV6S|5|This was a good replacement...perfect fit and solved the illusive noise from this area...even when the old one when removed appeared to be ok.
B001SGFJFG|5|Yep!! Can't beat the price. Working great!!!!
B0067UAMIM|4|Good part
B00062YOKO|5|Good quality, easy to install.
B00OU5LOT2|5|Absolutely amazing value/quality. Vivid color. 16 colors. Dimmer controls. 2 remotes. 1 in car handheld and 1 keychain remote. Easy installation. Plenty of everything and anything you need to install it. Easily installed without any issue. Absolutely awesome vivid good looking colors. Mood-setter. Gamechanger. Get it.
B005VPS358|5|These were a perfect fit.  Had absolutely no problems putting them in my 1996 Cherokee.<br />For anybody thinking of replacing their old leaf springs, make sure to spray PB Blaster into both the front and rear areas on their vehicle where the bolts go a few weeks before attempting the replacement. Doing so really helped me. Also, I recommend using only hand tools (breaker bar, ratchet & socket) when taking the bolts out -- and go SLOWLY. The bolts will have rusted quite a bit, and they generate a huge amount of friction coming out; if you're not careful, you run the risk of breaking the bolts.
B000GS1GXG|5|Coming from a womans mouth.. it's not too loud... louder than the stock pipes... but not a rumble... it seems to fit my 650 vstar but has one area that looks like it is missing a bracket...seller sends very fast..
B00WZA243O|5|Love the adjustability. I like that they are slightly thicker than the factory levers. That's is a personal preference though.
B0065J3368|5|Works great. Easy to use. No more difficulty reading the air gauge in low light conditions.
B009MAT9C4|5|This is a great product, definitely custom and well worth the price. It fits my 2014 CT windshield perfectly to block out all of the sun. It greatly reduces the heat in the car and will come in very handy on Monday when the high is supposed to reach 108*.
B00ARJQWLU|5|Direct drop in a 2006 Hyundai Elantra GLS, corrected one of the fault codes and improved engine performance
B000KL742Q|5|So glad I purchased this WeatherTech floorliner.  Recommended by both our automotive mechanic and body shop owner!  Very easy to install--fit right in place--look great!!  Perfect for the stuff that gets tracked into my vehicle because I work on a horse farm.  Highly recommend!  Great service from the company in shipping them!
B00077WFXQ|1|If you have the rear cargo shelf, you would have to buy 2 of these!  one for the shelf when its laying down, and one for the cargo area when the shelf is up.  At least this is how it was explained to me.  Not worth it IMO
B003UT3S6Q|5|Easy to use and very effective. But a bit expensive.
B00MV6WDYC|5|Showered up earlier than expected and love my goggles
B00JIIZCM6|5|Great product, perfect for our leather couch and car seats. Shortly after ordering the cleaner, I ordered the Leather Nova Leather conditioner spray to give it an extra level of protection (and help prevent the scratches on the couch from our dog cr getting worse!)
B005LOS60Q|5|Fit perfect for my F150 Fx4
B000HEBR3I|5|Loved it work great !!!!!
B00W2VRCLU|1|only works at stock boost .......... was no good at 24psi
B000C5DZWI|4|Did what I needed it to do.
B003MX9198|5|I have a 1992 F 350 I installed a clutch and then bought this van it fits perfect A+
B00YQRQ6N8|5|Good sander
B001INN73U|5|Delivery on time not destroyed
B00CIV0I24|5|Look great an fit great
B00QFEJVG4|5|Fit perfect for my Honda CRV 2014.  Just what we needed for when we go shopping to keep all of our things in place.
B0091OE6K6|3|Meh. Doesn't stay in place after you exit the car. Get back in the car again and re-set it.
B004KG2828|5|Thanks
B000BUU5Z4|4|Easy to install and hold things in place.
B000C9OEOW|4|good belt and fit
B000S2WD00|5|Great
B001DCH2FK|4|So far very quiet and smooth.  I would purchase again
B00CMUCHHK|5|Perfect for my 2005 Chevy 2500 hd. Went in in minutes and fixed my hard to start problem
B00BYGU8MY|5|10mins installation, careful with the stock ones, otherwise you have a great chance to chip or break them. Love the clean OEM look now. Plug and play.
B00K7XNEE4|4|Looks good.  Easy to clean.  Good price.
B00IYZ9B26|5|Very nice made the bike feel brand new
B000M5Y72A|5|Brighter than the ones in the car.
B004C443P8|2|Sizes don't work...
B004HLWPO2|5|The item came in well packed and it fixed perfect!  Easy connection, no problems at all!  Thank you sir!
B00FRHOMNM|2|Wipers had difficulty managing the curves at the corners of the windshield leaving gaps. When cold, large areas of the windshield did not clear, very poor performance in snowy conditions. Wipers needed a lot of water to clear away, mist was just spread thinly resulting in a haze that was hard to see through. Didn't last one year, they are now worn, streaky and noisy. Will never buy these again. Going back to the Trico or Bosch brands.
B0049HKFIM|5|Worked perfect!
B001RMT90W|5|Great deal. Better than i expected for the price. Easy install, lamps included and fast delivery.
B009PIKC4C|4|Pretty great liners, fit my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee nicely. They are nice and rugged. I had a really tight fit on the passenger liner, but other than that, they are great. They provide good coverage, much better than the stock matts. Other reviews note how they look scuffed after barely any use, and it's true, but It doesn't bother me, they're there to protect my carpets, not look pretty, and you can clean them up.
B0068OZ25K|5|Shipped fast, works great! Programming directions were weird, but they worked just fine. Definitely saved a LOT of money vs dealer! Almost identical to factory remote. Had to look on back to see any difference. Even came with battery included! Whaaaaat?
B00DIDAY6Q|5|Have about 4,000 miles on the kit and so far have no complaints.  Need to give careful thought to bracket placement and hose routing.  Had to bend end tabs a slight bend to minimize hose angles.  Makes it quick and easy to service air in tires and provides quick access to TPMS transmitters. Highly recommended!
B000CPHZUG|5|Looks good
B00NHMDRD0|5|Awesome works good as expected
B00EPACI10|5|These are authentic Denso coilpacks which work perfectly in my 2010 Saab 9-5 Aero.  Although I realized that my car's issue was not the coilpacks (it was the spark plugs) after I purchased the coilpacks, but these coilpacks are working perfectly on my car and I kept them as 3 spare coilpacks in the trunk won't hurt (for when a coilpack fails).  These coilpacks are much more reliable than the Bosch coilpacks which are used in Saab 9-3 Aero.  I wish these could be installed on the 9-3 as well, but they don't fit in the 2.8L 9-3. Note: if you want to change coilpacks on 2010/2011 Saab 9-5/9-4x, ignore the WIS instructions asking for removal of the athrottle body and the air intake.  Just unbolt the power steering fluid reservoir and force the rear-left coilpack out.  The coilpack WILL come out by force.  Just be carefull about the vacuum hoses. I have done it three times for changing the plugs so far, and no issues ever occurred.  The worst case is that you break the coilpack (which is very unlikely), and the replacement coil is cheap!  Save yourself the trouble of removing the air intake and replacing all those gaskets!  The gaskets cost much more than a new coilpack, let alone the trouble of removing it!
B000GOJW9A|5|Awesome part,  had my old one out and this one in on ten minutes. Works perfectly.
B004YA50Z2|5|This helmet is awesome!!! A lot of sources for air to circulate. The tinted extra retractable eye shield is what I have been looking for. The modular feature is a relief to have on a helmet.
B0068OZ25K|3|buen producto
B00TZF06VO|5|Just what I needed to get the garage door functioning again! Thanks
B000C9GZUS|5|Nice product, works fine.!
B00062ZIOU|4|Great stuff
B000RMPKEC|5|Great color for my needs, smooth finish.
B00BN44HQU|5|I love it! Totally sexy, sturdy and cool, just like my classic '57 Chevy sedan I got it for.
B002FYBA9E|5|The headlight fits perfectly with the dealer's manufactured part.
B001GMX8YQ|5|Crash installé world as expected
B000C2E9RQ|5|Worked perfectly, seems to be excellent quality.
B00B43GZQ0|5|Great item!!!!! Perfect!!!!
B0094AOMY2|5|Simple to use, It does everything that was promised.<br />and it works!
B00CKIHT1S|5|Perfect addition to my work trailer.  I'm able to extend my work hours,which is good and bad.
B00JVUFDOS|2|These are for an 07 model
B00DSUEQ86|5|Love it!!!!❤️❤️❤️
B00FW1JYKE|1|Junk! don't buy, only 2 out of the pack didn't have burned LED's in them. Save your money.
B00H8EFWGI|5|Really easy install! They Look Amazing much brighter than stock! I will do this on all my vehicles!
B0035R0X9I|5|these shocks are amazing, they are better than the factory struts, I would recommend these to a friend or anyone looking to replace worn out struts. these were so much cheaper than going to my local auto parts stores.  if you have never turned a bolt, I would not recommend you taking or working on front struts by your self, this is and can be a dangerous situation.
B00BPD8R74|5|Arrived as expected and no issues with the spark plugs.
B0019BXA6U|1|I would give it zero stars but it won't let me. When you replace the fog light it does fit into the acrew component of the bumper. However, the fog light cover does not fit at all over the new fog light. I tried to clip in the black cover for an hour and there was no way it would fit. It looked like crap without the fog light housing cover so I could not use th fog lights at all. The make is similar but it truly does not fit the bumper. I have an e46 2002 m3 and the fogs were really disappointing.
B00FALVU8A|5|Worth the buy!
B004PILLZG|3|Sound and heat reduction was very good.  The adhesive could have been a little better.  Installed on the engine cover in my class A motor home.  The places it bonded best was where I could use a small roller to put pressure as it was mounted.
B002K5JAN6|5|nice
B00E6TXW6U|5|Purchased Phoenix system mainly to bleed clutch, which worked very well. Have not used it for brakes, but it should work equally as well.
B004I0S37A|5|Great Headlight, Fit perfect on my 2004 Silverado, no wobble nice and tight!  Highly recommend!
B0052FRX9E|5|Fit as expected and works
B0002JMPRK|1|Absolutely useless because it did not come with a nozzle.  I am not sure how other people apply this product (maybe they sniff it) but without a nozzle you cannot spray anything.  Maybe its a magical can with a phone app to activate?  or maybe it activates when a reality TV show is on?  MORONS!
B004ZF4930|5|Very pleased with these headlights. The instructions weren't really the clearest, but it's pretty straight forward to figure out. I ordered the 6000k bi-xenon bulbs (model H13) for my 05 f250 and the hardest part was finding a ground for each side and finding a place to mount the ballast. Everything plugs right in and is secure. They are blue at first, but once they warm up, they are white with BARELY a hint of blue. The picture of the lights are after just turning them on so they appear more blue than they will be once they warm up.
B003072EO0|4|Good fit; well-made.
B000E4B8CQ|5|Perfect! You can see everything. It's definitely worth the buy. Especially if you don't do anything wrong and you're still worried about those harassing cops.
B008A7U13G|1|Not anything like I expected.
B00LG07MZE|5|I'm glad I got the jumbo, it fits my Jeep Cherokee windshield. Not perfect, but for the price it does the job. You just have to make sure to push your visors right up against it and let the two circles kind of overlap to get full coverage.<br /><br />I was going to order the one custom fitted for the jeep but it was more expensive and not available through Prime. Glad I decided to try this one. I recommend it.
B00VU7KAN4|4|Quick and easy to install...just as long as you have the 2&#34; lift to go with it. Looks nice and I don't notice any difference in control or ride
B001TIZZVQ|5|I use these in all my Jeeps they work great!
B00NEL6HUE|5|Good auality Nd fit, far superior over the OE filter
B005MZZ63Y|5|Top-notch. The magnetic back is very convenient, and the design is first rate.
B001N729FS|3|Does not work like I thought it would you have to completely unscrew and pull it out to disconnect it and it tarnished way to fast put de-ox on it right away
B0029V9DRY|1|It came apart at the top seam 100 miles into our 1300 mile trip while it was raining. Everything got wet and several items were lost along the highway. We had to find a store off the highway and buy another before continuing. It was awful!
B001G6FMUA|1|The relay  arrived on time. I believe it was defective because the car would not go faster than 3000 RPM. Very disappointed.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Great ramps just what i needed to get my riding mower in my shed.Light weight and they fold easly,great set of ramps.
B008YKVJSU|4|I bought this scoop to install a cold air intake into my car and wow what a diferance! I would say with the cold air intake getting air directly from this scoop my car has gained at least 10 or so hp. I know for a fact that responce time and acceloration have increased. The only problem i had with this product at all was the actual size. I planned for something that was 20 inches long by 14 inches deep and it happened to be 8 inches deep so i was dissappointed there but with the increases i got i am totally impressed!
B00LAAVHRY|5|Works great faster then I thought
B004G08K9I|5|This is a great small grease gun, useful for carrying in a toolbox.  I have two, with different types of grease in each, and have had no issues.  No leaking, failures, or other issues.  I'd recommend getting the flex hose available for this gun, it doesn't come with one but the flexibility and extra length is very useful.
B002UC8LZW|5|This is our third one.  The first was not secured in it's place and dropped onto the road while we were driving on terrible roads and the wires burned through.  We bought a new one and then my husband did not secure it well enough when I we took the RV without the tow car and it dropped and the driving wore through the aluminum end and ruined it.  So, the products is great...we are the problem.
B004R660NY|5|Worked well along with DA power system.
B007S3KIDQ|4|Still waiting on the opportunity to use them in the field, but at home they work great. They do require a little addjusting to get them aligned well, but that is all.
B004ZQUUMS|5|Perfect Fit!!!
B00U87UHV2|5|Fit perfectly, don't be afraid of this product!
B000C9DHBI|3|It work what suppose to
B009TB525Y|5|Great!  Matches and fits beautifully in a 2012 Acura MDX with parchment interior.  The backing &#34;sticks&#34; to the carpet, so no unexpected moving around. Folds in three sections.
B00OOJGMOQ|5|Love it!!! Great quality! Great price!
B00DE922Q4|5|Excelent
B00MR57TXM|1|Received today and installed. Installation was very tight. Back-up sensor stop working after installation. Now I have to go to the dealership to find out why.
B00BYWY4AA|5|Fantastic easy to install with a little mechanical know how sounds like a 4 barrel carb . My truck definitely runs smoother and idles better . Great upgrade !!
B000CSIRJ6|5|They're spark plugs and they're exactly what I happen to use in every 2 stroke I own.
B00VCJTL62|4|worked just fine will buy again
B0066RHLJY|3|Normally, i would not buy a URO parts brand, but the price difference between this and OEM was too compelling. Its working so far.
B00QK6ZPS0|5|Excellent fit.
B0023VGZ3K|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00HDJD47C|5|Perfect fit, as expected .
B00EJDYXE8|5|Great pants
B00BITHS16|5|Used for a 2007 Honda CR-V. Fits perfectly and filters well. Very easy to install and a lot cheaper than going to the local auto supply store.
B000E7BBL6|5|ok
B00CGAHGDQ|5|Excellent
B000GOHUS0|5|Purchased for an '01 Lancer. Great fit, worked flawless. Have had no problems with my A/c ever since. I recommend this product.
B00QQ40PIG|5|Took a bit to get it to work but it is a priceless piece of equipment!
B004XRVQCC|5|So far so good
B0013UCQVM|1|pod doesnt fit 07 sierra dash! does nothing for truck. save your money.
B00HB0WUB4|2|i was confused by this product.
B00P9HE05U|5|I wanted a small dish rack for my babies  bottle accessories . I been searching few month in all possible stores . I have purchased and returned few .<br />And I am beyond happy with this little one .<br />Probably some RV kitchens are bigger than mine , and this dish rack is fits perfectly in my counter , and deep enough to keep all bottle accessories , pacifiers , teethers e.t.c. from my twins .
B00H8DFKS4|4|I have a 2010 f150 xlt. They are much brighter than the oem bulbs, but they don't fit as snug as they should. I just installed them and am having problems already with them cutting in and out.
B00Y5L7FLW|5|makes me laugh every time I read it and makes everyone else laugh also.  you gotta love Jugs!  The sticker of course
B009V1EISO|5|Exactly as advertised. Saved me $200+ over replacing two battery backup surge protectors.
