B00ERIUO02|3.0|PRISM isn't an album that I'd call bad but it has way too many forgettable tracks on it to be classed as anything better then average - the 'filler' songs just make all of the tracks lump together and become empty noise. Also; I personally think that the way the soft-rock inspired instrumentals have been infused with dancehall synths just seems clumsy, so doesn't work for me on a lot of the tracks.<br /><br />The four most personal songs on PRISM [Unconditionally, Ghost, Love Me, and By The Grace Of God] are by far the best. These songs are all raw & emotional lyrically, the music on them doesn't sound as disjointed as it does on the other tracks, and Katy is vocally strong on them. Having said that I don't think they would make the best choices for singles, as they don't have a pop-friendly hook for radio. Unconditionally has been picked as the second single which I think is a mistake.... I'd class lead single Roar, This Is How We Do, International Smile, and the pre-album release Dark Horse as above average. I don't find them as strong as my previous picks, but the lyrical content is interesting & catchy, and Katy's vocals are good - these tracks would probably be top picks for future singles, as they are what I think of as very radio-friendly.<br /><br />The other tracks? Birthday is kinda cringy, and is memorable to me as it very similar to Rihanna's Birthday Cake - it's just less explicit. None of the remaining songs stand out to me in either a great or bad way, so I wish that I hadn't become caught up in the pre-release hype and had saved a few pounds by ordering the regular version instead of the deluxe version - I'm listening to the album as I write this and the three bonus tracks are all unmemorable, even after just listening to them.
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|Not Pearl Jams best album, but solid. There are some good, catchy songs. I am glad they didn't revert to the experimental stuff from the past and kept their original sound.

1416955070|1.0|I hate this book overall for its blatant plagiarism and lack of originality, but that's all been said before. So here is why I hate the book based on the first few pages of the book, because it's just that bad.<br /><br />I tried to like this book. I really did. But it became clear pretty much in the first three pages that this was, in actuality, going to be a hellish and boring ride (I didn't even catch on to the plagiarism until later on). Has Cassandra Clare ever actually been in a club? Has she ever even seen people dance? How about people dancing inside a club wearing club clothes? I'm assuming she has not. One of the first things you learn when you start to write is to write what you know. This is a great lesson because<br /><br />1. It prevents writers from misrepresenting people from demographics other than their own. Take Memoirs of a Geisha, for example. Is it a well-written book? Oh yes. Is it a steaming pile of appropriative and exoticized excrement? Absolutely. It's an American white man's poorly executed and uneducated attempt to understand and communicate how certain aspects of Japanese culture work. It's insulting and stupid. At least Memoirs of a Geisha is an entertaining read if you ignore the idiocy. City of Bones? Not so much. Of course, misrepresenting alt club culture is not as severe as misrepresenting the culture of an entire country, but it is important to remember that alt culture is often used as an escape and safe haven for those who feel ostracized. To make a mockery of it is to degrade it.<br /><br />2. Most people can tell when a writer has no idea what they are saying. In my opinion, this makes the writer not only careless but dishonest. Why wouldn't you do a little research before putting embarrassingly pathetic descriptions of an unfamiliar setting into your book? It's like Cassandra Clare is trying too hard but simultaneously not trying at all. Remarkable. How does she do it.<br /><br />I don't like reading books by people who clearly didn't even try. Books are not like pizza, which is good no matter how carelessly it is made. I want to read books by educated, original, creative, understanding, observant writers. Cassandra Clare is not one of them. City of Bones is a pile of trash and I would rather use it as a door stop than read it again. Unfortunately, I borrowed it from the library, which means I had to put it back, which means other people will likely read it.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The movie was slow moving & boring. Wasn't near the action I had expected for the duration of the film. Plot was feasible.

B003KGBIS4|4.0|Recommended for fans of Wes Andersson. Not totally an arthouse flick, but then not totally an ordinary Hollywood film either.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have not done the &#34;experiments&#34; in this book yet, but plan to do so. I have, in the past done similar exercises, and in my own life, have used visualization and meditative techniques to tap into a divine consciousness. I ordered this book for myself and a friend--we are going to compare notes on our experiences. Pam Grout has a friendly, informal style of writing, as if a good friend is just sitting you down to share her knowledge, which is profound and expansive. Included are references to other writers, researchers, and many fascinating anecdotes. A book of this nature is &#34;preaching to the choir,&#34; since I have been spiritually inclined from childhood, but for others, who are new to the concepts, this book is a wonderful symposium of how to use thought energy effectively.

1476727651|5.0|I may be the only King fan who doesn't list The Shining as one of my top 5 favorites or one his absolute scariest. I still do enjoy the book a good deal but I've always found it a mite overrated. A mite, have you, don't get too worked up over it.<br /><br />Having just finished Doctor Sleep I can say I found it better than The Shining in that all of it's idea's came across more clearly than in the first book as far as it's supernatural happenings are concerned. What makes The Shining work is a sort of effortless flow King seemed to inject in it. You just get a sense he wrote the hell out of that book and loved it. That same feeling came across with this novel, which I didn't think was possible. King has been having a renaissance in the past handful of years with great works like Duma Key, Under the Dome, 11/22/63, Joyland and now Doctor Sleep. Each book has gotten progressively more confident (swap Duma Key with Dome as I found Key better) and Doctor Sleep feels like it belong snugly in with his earlier more streamlined gems like Salems Lot, Firestarter, Christine, The Dead Zone, Pet Sematary and The Shining. It has that same effortless, intangible energy and pull those novels have. This is the closest a King book has truly felt like old school King since Bag of Bones.<br /><br />King once again populates his novel with memorable, well drawn characters. The True Knot are also his most amusing and intriguing tangible villain(s) in a long while. The book is at times painfully depressing, humorous, exciting and yes, scary. Some have said this book doesn't have one ounce of the fear The Shining had. I disagree as I don't find The Shining as scary as most of his fans and do plenty of passages in Doctor Sleep are effectively frightening. Theses aren't the claustrophobic haunted house scares of the first book. These larger scares with a more real world bent to them.<br /><br />Oh, and don't expect The Shining 2. Like I said, this novel is larger in scope and location and has a stronger adventure vibe to it but Danny anchors it and the little call backs to the first novel make it feel like King wrote this right after The Shining. I was shocked at how he seemed to ease right back into this story.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is King at his most confident and imaginative.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|Would not let me down load any updates.<br />It would just take me back to the opening screen.<br />I am disappointed.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book creates it's own world for the reader to fall in love with. Social roles and heroism play a dramatic role in this book.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|C'mon guys.... really.<br /><br />Plug and Play my _ss!  They're calling for registry edits and and code level modifications to get it to be recognized.<br /><br />Very disappointed in Google for this not ready for prime time gadget. I guess they're too busy spying on everyone!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Old school Stephen king... Amazing! Closes the circle in a satisfactory way but I could see another book in this series...
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not exactly what I expected. Just finished and it did not make any remarkable memories. Many of my friends enjoyed the book.
B003N5ZIEM|2.0|My baby loved and destroyed our first copy of this book, so we ordered this thinking it was a hard cover version. It is not. It is flimsy and easily torn.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|My 3 year old son and myself saw Turbo in the theater and we loved it.  It's just such a boy movie. No offense to little girls but it's a little guy movie, not that girls wouldn't enjoy it.  We loved the storyline, the pace, and the graphics.  Great characters.  The storyline wasn't too advanced for my son and he sat through it without blinking.  Highly recommend.
B00127RAJY|3.0|But I'd love for Jillian to not talk so much. My 7-year old daughter once even commented on how much she talks through this video.<br /><br />I find Level 1 to be quite challenging, but I tend to exercise irregularly. Don't forget to purchase small hand weights.
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|The simple fact is this app went the route of quantity over quality. Its very boring and very shoddy.<br /><br />The positove is the app has many games,<br /><br />The negative, they are very poor games.<br /><br />I can see this game maybe worth 99 cents if the Dev actualy put some effort into polishing this app. As it stands, not worth it.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|Good old scare the pants off of you entertainment. Thanks to Amazon you can bring back vivid memories of when this one was in theatres frightening all who saw it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Excellent game, can't stop. So happy I can take it with me on my Kindle and not be stuck on my computer. Thanks.....
B002KJX4IE|5.0|While this movie is fantastic and is considered to be a family movie, be aware there is a point where the &#34;f&#34; word is used, which you might want to know if you have little ones watching. Other than that it's a fantastic film!
030758836X|1.0|Even though there are people as manipulative, conniving, and evil as the woman &#34;staring in this tale, the book seems to be aimed at introducing readers to evil behavior. I read the book for a book club, and I wish I had not read it. It was not only a waste of time, but it was a really uncomfortable read.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|Too wierd and science fiction for me.  Takes place 200 years in the future, my imigination cannot mix past, present and way into the future in one story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Super fun, and just the right amount of challenge.  I wish the challenges started a little sooner but for a free game, zero complaints here.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Enjoyed the story plot ,scenes and actors. Kept our attention during the movie . Was fast paced after initial start to the finish.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wish got lives quicker not everyone plays this anymore and I just started  cuz it  on kindle now, too addictive lol
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|most necessarily chromcast should be useful for casting screen on TV. I heard that they are working on it ? it can be rated five star only after that.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|needs more integration with computer to play any videos from hard disk, also nee more apps and pc applications  with support for chromecast
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Steinbeck's writing is as relative today as it was when he wrote The Grapes of Wrath.  How can you not love the writing of a master author?
1439110123|5.0|Great book, but if you'd like to save 18 bucks and the week or two it would take to finish this book, the book is available as an 8 part roughly 7 hour documentary on youtube.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|I  enjoyed the movie  reminded  me  of  days  gone  by  with the  team  so much  I  dont  watch  tv  much anymore except something on  TVLand  almost  much of  the time.
B009DH2PP4|1.0|The book is askew--printed at an angle such that the text runs down the page at about a 5-10 degree angle.  It is centered at the top but runs off the side of the page by the bottom, to the left on each left leaf and to the right on each right leaf.  Like a photocopy when the paper is lying crooked on the machine.  Due to the angle of the text, a few characters are missing from the last few lines of each page.  Even the cover is askew.  I've never seen a \\"pressing\\" this sloppy.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Good app for free. Easier to see and use then the one that comes with my android device. Nice to be able to recall a specific number in the formula if you mistype.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|My friends love this game. anyone, any age can play it. It's fantastic! I wanted more cards after playing the original a couple times. very creative game.
B00FPH6PRK|3.0|The movie was not what I thought. I had read that it was one of the scariest movies to come down the pike in a decade but it was not nearly as scary as I thought it was going to be. Taylor nailed it and that would be the only reason that I can justify this purchase. It should not to be compared to The Exorcist.
B0035HKWLW|3.0|my son who is 15 has never seen this until now. He enjoyed it. he now wants to watch a few other jim carrey films.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Found this author to be fresh.  Well developed characters, but not lost in the weeds. Starting this author's next book right away.
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|1. I cant believe they made 4 of these<br />2. I cant believe I watched it. :-(<br />3. I bet they make a 5th
B00DZJ82VC|1.0|Terrible dead sound. Not remastered. Don't waste your money. I have the remastered greatest hits and the songs on that 2 cd set from Moondance blow away this cd by a mile. Even the inside info says just what the old Moondance cd says as far as remastering. No person's name is listed. It reads cdd pre- mastered by wci record group. There's your clue right there, besides the poor sound.
B006LSZECO|4.0|From the first page to the last, the story kept my interest!  I honestly couldn't figure out where it would end.  I've already recommended it to a couple of friends and look forward to reading other Gillian Flynn books.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great absolutely awesome, Rocky is my idol since I was a child, its great to watch the movies in bluray, I love it
B008GWOVB8|2.0|I love musicals! Even teeny bopper musicals.<br />But the script for this was horrible, the acting was, well it wasn't, and the music just stank.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Jaden, and Will Smith team up in this scifi adventure. EXCELLENT viewing, fantastic storyline, where the alien world that is visited, is our own planet, long abandoned.
0307593525|5.0|I love this set! So nice to get both together! The hardbound volumes are easy to read and keep open while cooking. I have never tried French cooking before and have looked at many recipes, cookbooks, etc. I love the section describing all the &#34;basics&#34;. I was able to gather everything I needed and then simply browse and create as I chose.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a change from those calculators that try to do everything on one screen.  It makes no attempts to be more than a good four function calculator, and it does that effectively.  With its one level stack and visible history (like a paper calculator), it has a lot to recommend it.  If you have simple or even some slightly serious math to manage, this is a nice app.  Great for doing tips or MPG calculations.
B0040HO01Y|2.0|This literally put me to sleep! No, not entertaining at all. Way too much simpering for my tastes!<br />I am done.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I can't ever complain about how Ken Follett keeps me wanting more but as other reviewers observed, this book is not quite as tight or well-crafted as the first.  He wants to cover a long time span in this one so the character depth is not as rich and there are so many more people in this book that it does start feeling a little tough to keep track.  Still, viewing war from the individual and very human level made for some heart-wrenching moments.  I personally enjoy being shown this period in history through the eyes of others.  I might have preferred that Follett made this book into two separate books so each could be richer overall, but nonetheless I still love his story-telling ability, the emotional ties to characters, and the way he makes history come alive.  Despite this book falling short of the first I am eagerly awaiting the final book in the trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm sooooooooooo happy this is now on kindle! I like playing on a larger device. This just makes my addiction even worse!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|About as much calculator as you can work in your hand.  It has multiple screens for different areas of calculation.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Lots of action it this movie. It makes you believe that it probably did happen like the plot said. I know there was a disclamer but ???
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|I was kind of skeptical about watching this movie, but it is nit a bad movie. very funny and different
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love having this on my kindle. You never know when you might need one. I use it all the time.
B007EC27QM|3.0|Basic calculator -- pretty much what is already built into every Android Device. Maybe a bit prettier? For &#34;plus&#34; I was expecting a bit more than +, -, /, *, square root, square, reciprocal, and a Pi button. No parentheses to force order and does not follow standard mathematical order of operations. Pretty much the same capability as the cheap calculators they give away at conventions as swag. Got it as the free app of the day. I'd be really upset if I actually paid for this.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I loved this movie and Matt  Damon is the best actor ever,<br />the price  was cheap comparing to other online sites

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What can you say about a game that is played by everyone? I love this game and I am hooked. I even got my husband hooked on playing it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What a fun game! There is no need to buy anything extra. The free game is just fun without having to pay for anything extra.
B008Y212PI|5.0|You will get hooked fast. Keeps your mind working, very enjoyable.  I went back for more and down loaded the other programs they offer.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is a fast paced show with a great cast.  There is a surprise around every corner. Very entertaining, worth watching.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I only down loaded this game to play with a friend. I think it is more for a child then an adult.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I gave this game five stars because I really like running games and I really like that there's trains and subways. I would definitely recommend this game to any of my friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I was very surprised &amp; happy to see it when I turned on my kindle!  Good job and thanks again.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Surpassed all expectations. Loved it. Who knew that Jeremy Renner could make Hawkeye into one of the coolest superheroes out there.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone. good movie, bought this as a Christmas present. very pleased with the product and shipping.

006202406X|1.0|I do not know how to start! the book totaly destroyed my beautiful day! Here I thought I would enjoy the reading and see the happy ending! like \\"forever love\\" and everything! but NO! the ending was even worst than Shakespeare's tragedies! Honestly... I am happy that stopped here I am not going to buy the hardcover version as I was planning! She is the most depressive writer ever! probably thought that after THG and Twilight she would be original! did not work Veronica! it has an awful ending! :( I think I would not be able to sleep tonight!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this alarm clock.  User friendly.  Just as advertised.  The options help you to customize the features with different alarm sounds and volume control.  It's great.
B00AE2J1PE|3.0|Pretty good film about the moonshine era in rural Virginia.  Not too much character development.  I am still wondering who the protagonist was.  Good Cast, though.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Playing the game is really really cool and a lot of fun.Many difficult levels. I can highly recommend it. Highly addictive.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|excellent reading, just wished she hadn't used holy---- so much.but I did enjoy all 3 series, cant wait for the movie
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The vocabary was not that great in this book. Repetitive language. Overall, a great story. Definitely kept me reading! I will be reading the rest of the trilogy.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I was a little skeptical purchasing this album because I wasn't sure what to expect. And as a long time fan of PJ, I'll be the first to admit that it doesn't sound like \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vitalogy\\" but music evolves and that includes Pearl Jam. This has a little something for everyone and I've already listened to it several times all the way through and I find myself enjoying it more and more. In my opinion, it was well worth the purchase. Kudos to PJ!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for this to be available for Kindle Fire. Love it!! Very addictive. Fun. Link with Facebook to get extra lives and moves.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Well i just got this game and i liked the whole concept of the game<br />Its just the only thing is the camera<br />It sorta lags<br />But all in all its a nice game<br />Warning: after you get the fourth page dont turn around<br />Its a scary game and honesly i peed my pants<br />I recommend this game for any persone in for a night of bed wetting
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|There is always something new and challenging!  Love the color and constant action, but hate that chocolate and those time bombs.
B000S46QOM|5.0|A phenomenal compilation of some of the best tracks from The Doors! This is easily my favorite album in my vinyl collection. Saying that this one is solid from start to finish is an understatement. And the album artwork is also very cool. If you can get your hands on one of these, do yourself a favor and do it!
B003YTPS7O|3.0|The storyline is simple and sweet.<br />I can always look at Russell Crowe and beautiful scenery, and would recommend it to anyone else who likes those two things!
B009C7JS14|1.0|it was extreemly fiddily to use and confusing I hated using it and I thought i deleted it but i suppose not
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was one of the best I've read by S.King in a long time.  Really good, easy to read, it grasps you from the start
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|It's an okay movie, I guess I just don't  scare easy. The movie was too predictable to me at times.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I Was Surprised, Initially, By The lack Of Permissions! This Alone made Me Trust In Trying It! Once In, There Were So Many Training Games And Levels. They Were challenging, Fun And Could Be Completed With a Minimal Time Commitment! Give This One a Try!
B00BMR5HOO|2.0|this app is annoying to use it never showed me the area i wanted to look at and even though my kindle was connected to the internet it kept saying that it wasent
B00E6895M6|5.0|This album is amazing, I haven't stopped listening since it was released nearly a month ago! I have to say though, Strong Hand, which is only on the deluxe edition and not on this cd, has to be my favorite and I'm a bit surprised it wasn't in the normal album(especially seeing as the album got its name fromthat song)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush, play it on my phone and computer and now, finally, my kindle! Works great, colors are nice, updates perfectly w Facebook and other devices
B00E9E4E50|5.0|Valentina Lisitsa is a force that the self-considered inteligencia and the talentless critics appear incapable of reckoning with.<br /><br />They comment on her being a blonde haired Russian (Ukrainian actually) woman as if it was a criteria for mediocrity and a dime a dozen...She responds on the cover of this album with only her hands, hair, and a section of the keyboard glowing off an otherwise black image, her face almost unrecognizable in shadow.<br /><br />They say she plays the fan (an evil word) favorites (even more evil)...She responds in this album with a tapestry of sound from pieces (other than the Hungarian Rhapsody #12) that are rarely played and even less recorded.<br /><br />They do not like how she uses her sustain pedal, after all, it's a rule that you have to avoid its use at all costs...There is a section on this album where, in the Ballade #2, the sustain is used to an amazing effect as the slowly fading rumble of a sustained crescendo is the background to a sparse and pensive calming in the melody with a similarity to that of the bridge between the storm and Shepherds' Hymn of Beethoven's Symphony #6 (Oh my God!!did Beethoven actually write program music with descriptions of chirping birds and running stream, how embarrassing!).<br /><br />They complain that she talks to her audience instead of just playing, as if the artist is a machine and above, as they are (but below them, of course)the mere patrons in the audience who are enjoying the whole expierence of the moment.<br /><br />They are appalled that a \\"you-tube\\" personality could be taken seriously since the only way to greatness is by competitions where they (with their superior understanding) can tell you who should be on top.<br /><br />...and doing an interview while reclined on a sofa, her legs hanging over its arm??? That just is not the way you should conduct yourself if you are to represent the product of superior breeding!<br /><br />Filming practice sessions, in jeans, cotton shirt and without shoes...doesn't she know that you just magically play Rachmaninov without ever spending the time to practice...or make mistakes!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because not only do you just play. You get awesome challenges and you get a daily forward that rocks. And it's cool to get it now because it's halloween theme. You get cool characters and buy cool birds that help you get better points. This game is so awesome I am never getting rid of it. So make sure to get it now. Free in the app store.

B00E1LT41K|5.0|Most amazing mini-series I have ever had the pleasure to see. I am ordering this and re watching! I am also pre-ordering the next book in the series. This author is amazing and the movie was breathtaking. I am now in love with this era and all those who belong to it. Thank you BBC and thank you Starz.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's an interesting device for sure, but if you have a smart TV already it offers nothing for you. If you don't it only adds Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and Google TV/Movies to your TV and you have to control it all with a smartphone. That means there is a TON of lag...hit pause on your phone and it takes a second or two before it pauses. Doesn't sound bad but really annoying.<br /><br />It's also crashed netflix on my phone (Galaxy S3) a lot since it added the ChromeCast update to Netflix (yes, it uses your existing apps, just updates them).<br /><br />The price is right and it's nice and tiny so fits behind a wall mounted flat screen nicely but I'd suggest a Roku instead.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Ever since I read Malcolm Gladwell's breakthrough book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, I've been unable to resist any new book from this most devilishly clever of nonfiction writers. Gladwell's mind doesn't seem to work the way mine does, and, unless you're remarkably eccentric, I suspect the same could be said of you.<br /><br />David and Goliath is an excellent case in point. You might assume, as I so naturally did, that the Biblical tale of David and Goliath illustrates how the weak can overcome the strong. Certainly, that was how I was taught it as a child, and nothing I've learned since has led me to think otherwise. Leave it to Malcolm Gladwell to demonstrate that in reality this oft-told story demonstrates precisely the opposite. According to Gladwell (and to the numerous academic researchers whose work he cites), Goliath was massively vulnerable -- in large part precisely because he was truly a giant -- and David possessed an enormous advantage in his own right from the moment he walked onto the field of battle. The outcome of the battle was foreordained. Goliath's great strength was in fact no advantage at all.<br /><br />In this out-of-left-field manner, Gladwell draws diverse examples from all over the map to illustrate his principal points: overwhelming power can easily prove to be a disadvantage, while disability and weakness can lead to surprising success. Gladwell writes about how dyslexia has proven to be the hidden key to success among a great many highly successful people, including such notables as Richard Branson and Charles Schwab. Other examples in David and Goliath include the coach of an untalented middle-school girls' basketball team who led them to a national championship by virtue of a strategy born of his ignorance of basketball, to K-12 teachers who demonstrate how small classes can be disadvantageous and big classes sometimes much better, to the British troops sent to quell the Irish Troubles, only to discover that their exercise of power backfired horribly.<br /><br />David and Goliath is endlessly fascinating. It's fully worthy of Malcolm Gladwell's outstanding talent to illuminate our world in surprising ways.scover that their exercise of power backfired horribly.<br /><br />David and Goliath is endlessly fascinating. It's fully worthy of Malcolm Gladwell's outstanding talent to illuminate our world in surprising ways.

B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Great premise, terrible acting, no chemistry with actors. Hard to follow, it was like a bunch of people got together and all put in their own ideas, but did not tie them together. It was an OK time passing movie. Warning, contains constant violence. Ending was very flat.

006202406X|1.0|Why?  I don't understand.<br />The first two books were great.  This one is not.<br />I hate comparing hunger games to this series, because they are not the same, however my feelings toward both series' final books are the same, loathing!<br />Divergent was ruined because of this book.  Will I reread this series, no.  Will I see any of the movies, no.  Will I recommend this to any of my friends or family, no.  Will I read another book by Roth, probably not.  I feel as though my trust was misplaced in her, as an author.  I wish there could be a re-write.  I wish there were some way to fix the wrong!

B0091WNK8M|5.0|Classic 80s fun movie.  Pirates, treasure hunting, and getting chased by criminals.  What great fun to be had in Astoria, Oregon.  Who knew?!
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I saw the movie awhile back, was unimpressed, then got the book for a couple dollars in a KDD and read it. It's rare when a movie is better than a book, but this one is. Mainly because at least we have some decent scenery and Hawaiian music, and the book is oddly bereft of the ability to give any sense of Hawaii.  Also George Clooney is not bad.<br /><br />But the rest of movie is essentially a people drama, and the people suck.  And that's my complaint.  Who ARE these people?  Not just the woman herself, who has so much but couldn't be a decent wife and mother to her family, and take joy in what she had. Apparently, the wife whined about not having thrills and shopping sprees.  So being dissatisfied, does she do the adult thing? Talk to her husband, try to work it out, get a divorce if all else fails? No, she has an affair, and worse, one she schemes to set herself up monetarily with her lover, once her clueless husband dumps a big deal in his lap. Then she'll divorce huppy to spend the $$.  Alas, she's still thrill seeking, the deal undone, with one daughter is in a residential boarding school for drug use and the other with issues, when she gets herself in a fatal coma.<br /><br />The dad meanwhile, doesn't believe in living off trust funds.  That's why they'd been living on his income as a  lawyer.  Punahoe not being exactly a cheap school, with two tuitions as well the price of that house -- he worked a lot. This causes everyone, wife, kids, friends, to resent him because he works, when the rest of them seem to lay around and complain.  So I don't really see what the problem was with Clooney. I mean, the wife didn't work. She had a great life with what she had. What the heck did she have to complain about?<br /><br />Meanwhile the friends are dumping on Clooney, because that his wife was a lying cheat wasn't HER fault, because he was boring, busy working. With her having all those long days free, what else did she have to do but look for excitement?  Like I said, who ARE these people?  His wife's father too -- that his daughter is in a coma is not her fault for being stupid and reckless -- no, Clooney should have bought her more toys and boats and let her shop and she would have been satisfied spending his money, rather than seeking other thrills.<br /><br />Anyway, the plot revolves around their tying up the issues with the comatose wife, her relationships, the screwed up, entitled kids, and the husband, who seems like a decent straight up sort of guy with no flaws other than the fact that he spends his days working for a living, which is apparently too uncool to justify other human beings treat him with decency, not his kids, his wife, her parents, or his friends.<br /><br />There are some redeeming parts to the movie. The older girl does seem to grow up a bit. The husband gets more involved with his kids. It's nice to see Hawaii on film, and hear a little HAwaiian music.  The essential plot and characterization of the movie, though, like most of the people in the movie, were just not worth the time.
1419701533|5.0|I gave these books to an 8 year old boy as a birthday gift and he loved them! Other books had not kept his interest and it was difficult to get him to read books from cover to cover. The first day he started reading them, it was difficult to get him to put the book down. His mother was thrilled!
B003G4W49C|5.0|amazing book orson scott card did an amazing job on his first book of amazing books in the ender quintent the battleroom is really cool cant wait for the movie
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This was the first camel club book I have read from Baldacci so I did not totally have the background on all things camel club in the book but there is no need to have read the other related books. Honestly I thought this book was the best one so far I have read from Baldacci....much better of a read than his most recent The Hit. Definitely a page turner, better save some big chunks of time when you start reading it because you will not want to put it down until the end. This would be a great movie too, definitely read it!!
B002OSY2T6|3.0|My son got this about two years ago. He loved the music and the mirror but didn't do much else with it. In my opinion, the creators of this toy missed their goal.<br /><br />It is also very sensitive to vibrations in the house and will start playing randomly if someone walks by it.

B00D8JFO7O|5.0|Another cleverly wonderful singing nuns film!  Whoopi is great, as is Dame Maggie Smith and the late great Mary Wickes.  Really terrific updates of familiar songs with a twist.  I can't forget the film version of the hymns whenever we sing them in church!  And it's a film for all ages and not corny;  Just loads of toe-tapping fun!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|it is a very useful tool.it is a very good tool to add so you can have more than one way to search the web.
B001NESPHC|5.0|This is a great album.  Gardot wrote or co-wrote most of the songs.  I have encountered some singers who write songs which often result in good lyric, bad melody.  Melody has very good melodies for these songs and she sings them beautifully.  This album is a pleasure to listen to time after time.
B000N3AWDE|5.0|For Celine fans who are Anglophones, yes... French is RIFE with nasal vowels... and yes... Celine SINGS those same nasal vowels because they are PART of the French language.  The reviewers who seem to proclaim themselves experts on vocal tone and productions seem completely inept at identifying correct pop vocal styles as well as balance in placement within the language.  Is D'elles a perfect CD?  No... but then, no recording ever is.  This is an intriguing blend of ideas by some of the finest female lyricists and poets working in the popular genre, and the album reflects a clear departure from the \\"wounded female who can't live without her man\\" sort of songs that she's built a career on.  Each song is worth listening to in it's own right, and it was an interesting experiment for Celine to sing along with Maria Callas at the end of La Diva.  It makes me wonder what would happen if she recorded a legitimate classical crossover album. (not that I expect or suggest such a thing!)  The first three tracks are probably the strongest (as is often the case) but none of the tracks are badly sung or produced. I could do without the Irish penny whistle in one track, but it's just a personal preference.  A dear friend proclaimed how much she LIKED that same track because of that addition.  Fan of Celine?  Buy this album and enjoy it... even more so if you understand the nuance of the French language in pop music... Really like her English pop chart stuff and have a strong case of xenophobia to other languages?  Skip this album... and maybe consider getting a better education in world cultures, linguistics and music in general.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|In any years ago I was an avid Stephen King fan - he is such a great writer, no matter what he's writing about - so I never tired of him - but slowly got tired of the scary supernatural themes.  Years later I picked up Under The Dome - which wasn't easy in  itself, especially since I lugged it around everywhere,  That book did two things for me - convinced me to buy a Kindle, much easier to lug around - and more importantly, renewed my interest in King' s .books - under the Dome was so much more than a scary book - so many great elements to it - but I digress.<br />So when Dr Sleep came out - I jumped on it immediately, ( especially being a big fan of the Shining  many years ago. I guess I should have known it would be over the top with  supernatural  happenings, so my bad - but the bottom line is, I  still think King is a terrific writer - but I think I ' 've outgrown his books  I couldn't'- wait to finish it - & not in a good way..
B003XX2PPO|4.0|I would say Luis Miguel's best pop album was Amarte Es Un Placer (1999). However, this album is also a solid pop effort. Labios De Miel is a great opening song, Tres Palabras and No Existen limites are the best ballads on the album.<br /><br />This is a great album to listen to with a mixture of uptempo and ballads. Luis Miguel always delivers when it comes to vocals. It's surprising why he hasn't released a live cd/dvd since the year 2000.<br /><br />if you love his crooning voice then this self-titled effort is worth a listen!
0316204366|5.0|There is nothing else to say! Simply amazing!!

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read this book after watching the Netflix series (which is very different from the book).  I almost skipped the book after reading some of the unfavorable reviews.  I'm glad I decided to ignore them.  Contrary to the bad reviews, Piper does not constantly talk about being blonde, or about graduating from Smith.  And for those who claim the book is just \\"about Piper,\\" I wonder what you think a memoir IS?  This book was funny, engaging, and intelligent.  For those who could only pick it apart, I can only say that this book was written from her perspective.  To say she should have written it the way YOU think it should have been written is simply ludicrous.  Kudos to any woman who can serve time and keep her sense of humor.  Privileged or not.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|As expected, each story is a gem. Such clarity and sensitivity !Remarkable insight into human behavior  and relationships! This writer is a marvel.

1451626088|4.0|Ms. Gregory has a very smooth writing style. I have read several of her books and they all captivated me. The Kingmaker's Daughter was no exception. Here we see the War of the Roses from Anne Neville's viewpoint, and it is an interesting one to say the least. I wished we knew more of Anne, who pales next to the powerful personalities around her. Her life was short, but it was lived at the very heart of the conspiracies, battles and ever changing fortunes of this very interesting period in time. I recommend the book to all English history lovers, whether they agree with Ms. Gregory's conclusions or not.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The second of the reboot Star Trek series movies, Into Darkness is a film trying to make its own stamp in the Trek-verse while reaching out a hand to ST Original Series fans. The film is entertaining and I enjoyed it. I think it could have been much more though. Since the reboot is supposed to expose us to new story lines differing from the original series, I was hoping we would see a different story arc with Khan. Perhaps I am a homer of sorts though I cut my teeth on Next Generation, but I still believe the reboot films have lots of merit, compelling characters, and good stories.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle is a stand out artist, and definitely someone who would catch Prince's eye. They do some great work here, but the tracks she jams from her own mind are great also.  She is definitely not blandly commercial, but a true artist.

0545091020|5.0|I'd already seen the movie, and hadn't read the book, so I thought I'd try going straight to the audio book.  I wasn't disappointed.  The biggest down side is ripping the CD's, and even that was the easiest I've had it so far.  All that was wrong was it separated the cd's into different folders, which was only a problem because the music player would stop when it hit the end of a folder.<br />The voice actress was very good, and I clearly recognized all the characters she portrayed.  No complaints, really, and it's a good book.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor Review<br />By: Freddy<br />I read the Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell. This book was a very great read and I’d recommend it to anyone who is interested in joining the US Navy Seals. This book is emotional and very strong, so I’d recommend it only to people who are able to withstand very vivid war scenes. I can’t say more than it’s a non fiction story that’s very graphic and detailed.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this novel is the emotion in the story. After the death of his companion Mikey and his valiant effort to live on, Marcus thought of his last words “Roger that, sir” a call made by Mikey to save their lives was the most “valiant attempt to save his teammates.” The emotion of the story is off the charts, and it is all too real. This really tugs at the heart. Although the emotion that was evident in this novel at the end, we saw at the beginning how boring it was. We got an in depth look at how Navy Seals were raised up to become soldiers and the most elite fighting force in the US military arsenal. This was boring at times. I mean, yes it does give a strong look at what being a Seal took and it gave me a new perspective on this matter, but really, it would have been nicer to keep this description down to maybe a chapter, not 4 or 5. But, once this is over, you get a much better look at what the Seals had to deal with on the combat field and you get into the emotional part of the story. Less “hooyah Instructor Reno” a term used by Seals in Indoc training, and more about the valiant sacrifice that the Seals gave in 2005 in the Hindu Kush mountains, more about the Seals who died trying to protect their homeland, defend their ideals.<br /><br />Marcus Luttrell tells of the moving story of Afghan horror itself too. We see everything from abuse of children to tribal laws. The taliban killed Seals on the mountain and Marcus was lucky to live, but the cost of life was too immense. To be able to tell of this horrifying experience in the heart of the Hindu Kush takes more courage than I may possess, and frankly, this story is as valiant and as truthful as they come.

B005PK57IK|4.0|This show is one that we have wanted to see from the beginning (season 1, episode 1).  I am glad that we waited until we could follow the scripts in chronological order.  It provides an interesting insight in how the legal system works.  I especially enjoy how they map out their strategy, and the third season is full of strategy sessions .  Also there are very interesting characters to follow.  My favorite are Alicia, Colinda and Eli.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|A Statement of purpose second to none. An angry Springsteen with a relelntlessly tight E Street Band that stays with him through every musical and lyrical twist and turn. A stunner from the opening chords until the fadeout on the last tune. Brilliant Beyond Words

B001DF68MA|3.0|This thing is way flimsier than I thought it would be.  Installation is pretty easy to figure out.  My son is almost 2 years, about 24 lbs.  He'll probably be able to use it for one more year MAX.  This seat is pretty tiny.  I like that I can see my son constantly, but I think he would get more use in a trailer.  Also, when I made an abrupt stop he nearly smashed his head into the &#34;pedestal.&#34;  Thank God I had him in a helmet.  Ride with extreme caution.
B004XOINMQ|5.0|This is a great movie. I bought it because it is one of my favorites. The problem is that the only Blu-ray version that I could find in Amazon only has subtitles in French and Italian. Please somebody add subtitles in Spanish and/or English

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good magic effects.  So so story line.  Good acting on everyone's part.  More and more would be plentiful fun and interest.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoy the game and very addictive. Like the different challenges it give you but don't always like the extreme difficulty on some of the levels but then it is a game.
B00A6QPQDO|5.0|This is a great movie. I bought it because it is one of my favorites. The problem is that the only Blu-ray version that I could find in Amazon was release in German and the extras did not work on my blu-ray.
B00FF8OKJE|3.0|It's normally a pretty fun game. It's very active the first few levels but by the time you get to level 8 or so, the quests require you to be a higher level (10+) to complete. It can be pretty slow going higher up.<br /><br />A LOT of things require money that I feel should be free it at least some how achievable without paying real money. This includes the ability to build more than one thing at a time, certain defenses, etc. It takes a long time to be able to upgrade certain buildings or expand your castle.<br /><br />Also, there seems to be a lot of issues with the updates. I'm writing this right now because I've been locked out of the game. It lures you in to update now and receive 100 rubies (extra currency) but there's no way to surpass the dialog box and the update isn't available yet. This is a common occurance, it takes hours to be able to update.<br /><br />Ocerall, this could be a great game but they need to fix a few things before I consider it a great game.

I opted for the 7447 model as I do not need the larger Weber chimney, and did not want to store that monster. I do wish Weber had a medium sized chimney (between the 7447 and the larger 7416). Works great!

0670024856|4.0|I wrote a brief but scathing review of Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love so when The Signature of All Things arrived unsolicited I wasn't enthusiastic. When it finally reached the top of my review stack, I was willing to attempt it but I was fully expecting I would put it aside after a few chapters. However, to my surprise, I found The Signature Of All Things fascinating reading and was reluctant to put it down.<br /><br />Unfolding over a century from the late 1700's, The Signature of All Things is a fictional portrait of a remarkable woman and her extraordinary life. Alma Whittaker was born in 1800, the only surviving child of an austere Dutch mother and a father defined by his ambition and entrepreneurial talents. Blessed with rare intelligence, Henry and Beatrix 'encouraged a spirit of investigation in their daughter', and with the family seat of White Acre in Philadelphia offering endless opportunity for education, eventually developed a passion for the study of botany.<br /><br />While The Signature of All Things follows Alma's path of scientific exploration and curiosity, leading to a specific interest in Bryology (mosses) it also examines themes of family, love, philosophy, faith and loss. Alma's life's journey is absorbing in both its ordinary and extraordinary unraveling. She is challenged by her parent's adoption of a sister, Prudence, a friendship with the mercurial Retta, dashed romantic dreams, and the deaths of her parents. She struggles to understand her emotional and sexual desires and to resolve her shortcomings, to find personal fulfillment and finally to define her worth to the world at large.<br /><br />The writing of The Signature of All Things is lovely, with the tempo and elegance of the historical period. Gilbert's research is impressive, I don't have a green thumb at all but even so I was fascinated by the botanical information imparted during the story. My interest really only wavered during the time Alma spent in Tahiti, thankfully a brief interlude in what is otherwise a beautifully crafted novel.<br /><br />Intriguing, thought provoking and moving, The Signature of All Things is a compelling novel of historical fiction. I recommend you forgive Gilbert the conceit of Eat, Pray, Love and pick this up.ief interlude in what is otherwise a beautifully crafted novel.<br /><br />Intriguing, thought provoking and moving, The Signature of All Things is a compelling novel of historical fiction.

B008LV8TSU|3.0|I really enjoyed the imagination that went into this story.  Howl's castle is a one of a kind and really exercised the mind.  The book also developed a few interesting characters very well.  All in all though, I would have liked to see more plot development.  The book felt rushed, like the author was trying to hit a deadline and didn't have time to go back and proof read.  I'm not sure if I will be reading another book in this series.  I would like to see if this great concept takes off.

B00EMGUR60|5.0|Aftershock is a showcase album for Motorhead, as Lemmy, Phil Campbell, and Mikkey Dee demonstrate the versatility in their familiar sound.  The album opens with two straight ahead, forceful rockers, Heartbreaker and Coup de Grace.  They prove from the jump that, recent physical ailments aside, Lemmy is giving no ground on the rock `n' roll front.  These songs are only the beginning of a breathtaking sonic ride.<br /><br />Lost Woman Blues has a snaking, slinking groove; a wise blues performer would do well to cover this tune.  Dust and Glass is a slower tempo number in which Lemmy comes damn close to crooning.  Both songs are excellent, and the songs that respectively follow them, End of Time and Going to Mexico, are as fast as anything in the Motorhead canon.  Another highlight on Aftershock is Silence when You Speak to Me, the sonic equivalent of a marauding army.<br /><br />Aftershock starts off strong, and it never lets up.  It is solid Motorhead throughout.  Old fans should be anything but disappointed, and it isn't a bad beginning point for newcomers.  Get it.  Now.

B00177YA1K|5.0|Released in 1997 and based on “The Men in Black” comic book by Lowell Cunningham, the movie centers around an organization of agents tasked with monitoring extraterrestrial life inhabiting planet Earth.  The film was extremely well received and gained an Academy Award for Best Makeup as well as several sequels.  Stars of “The Men in Black” include:  Will Smith as Agent J., Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K., Vincent D’Onofrio as Edgar, Linda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel, and Rip Torn as Head Agent Zed, to name a few.<br /><br />The Story:  The movie opens on partners K. and D. tracking a truckload of illegal extraterrestrial immigrants across the U.S. border.  When a Border Patrol officer witnesses one of the aliens free of human disguise, K. and D. must intervene and blast the alien to smithereens.  To erase the memories of the spectators, K. uses a device called a neutralizer.  Feeling it is time to retire, D. requests to be neutralized as well, meaning K. must now find a new partner.  This scene gives the viewers insight into why an agency such as the MIB can exist without the rest of the population knowing.<br /><br />Back in New York, an off-duty police officer, James Edwards, is pursuing an alien disguised as human on foot.  James can tell this is no ordinary person as the chase involves jumping rooftops, but his suspicions are peaked when the fugitive blinks a second pair of eyelids and draws a strange weapon.  Agent K. debriefs James on the incident, and then leads him to an alien-in-disguise pawn shop to identify the weapon.  Once K. assesses the situation, he erases James’ memory but leaves him his card, beckoning James to apply for a job with the agency.<br /><br />Because the majority of the aliens supervised by MIB reside in New York City, it’s only natural than their underground headquarters is stationed there as well.  When James arrives to compete for the job, he is noticeable and comically out of place among the other applicants.  At the end of the trials, James is not among the applicants that get “flashy-thinged” (neutralized), and becomes K.’s new partner, Agent J.<br /><br />The MIB is investigating a sudden exodus of aliens from planet Earth when a tip leads them to Edgar’s farm where a UFO had crashed.  After the crash, the alien bug disguises himself in Edgar’s skin.  The fear conveyed is that the bug, a cockroach alien, is a member of a race at war with many other alien species.  Among these species are the Arquillians who’s prince exists among the humans of NYC.  When Edgar attacks the prince, his dying words tell J. that “the galaxy is on Orion’s belt.”  Things begin to fall into place as it is suspected that the bug has come to Earth to steal a missing galaxy capable of providing incredible amounts of energy, but at this point only Edgar knows that the galaxy is hidden on the collar of the prince’s cat, Orion.<br /><br />Dr. Laurel Weaver, a medical examiner, is performing an autopsy on the prince when she stumbles upon Orion who seems to be protecting the dead body.  The bug steals the galaxy from Orion’s neck, kidnapping Laurel in the process.  MIB is then caught in a crossfire when angered Arquillians threaten to obliterate Earth if the galaxy is not retrieved within the hour.  In need of a ride home, Edgar takes Laurel to a monument which is actually a pair of UFOs in disguise.  J. and K. manage to destroy one of the saucers, only to have the bug ingest their weapons.<br /><br />Leave it to Will Smith to find a way to further irritate the bug into swallowing K. so that he might retrieve his gun and blow the bug from the inside.  But the final blow comes from Laurel who locates J.’s gun and kills the wounded bug as he mounts his final attack.  Back at MIB, K. makes the decision to retire.  The movie comes full circle as J. neutralizes K.’s memory, and picks up a new lady partner, Agent L.  The close of the film shows that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is also inside of another alien’s gem.nother alien’s gem.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was the type of book I would expect from Stephen King with a very good exciting , yet unexpected ending
B003RV43X4|3.0|I'm somewhat of a mythology enthusiast, so I had to watch the movie.  While I was entertained, I really wasn't that impressed.  Perhaps my expectations were more centered around the mythology as depicted by Homer, but they got a few of the characters right.<br /><br />Basically, this is a remake of the 1981 \\"Clash of the Titans,\\" a movie inspired by Perseus from Greek Mythology.  This 2010 release was later followed by the 2012 sequel, \\"Wrath of the Titans.\\"  It's a good idea to have a little background going into the movie; when the gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades defeated the titans (the titans are the parents of the gods), these three split the realm for rule amongst themselves.  Poseidon commands the seas, Zeus the skies and heavens, but Hades, who felt tricked into his spoils, came to rule the underworld.  Because the power and immortality of the gods is fed by the faith of mortals, much of Greek Mythology centers around the gods attempting to trick mortals into abandoning one god for another.  And here is where the movie begins....<br /><br />However it came about, mortals eventually began to lose faith in the gods and Olympus altogether, but some take it a bit further and choose to smite the gods.  Perseus, a young man, is fishing with his family when Argos soldiers desecrate a memorial to Zeus.  In retaliation, Olympus sends the Furies to punish these men.  As collateral damage, Perseus' fishing boat is destroyed, killing his entire family.  The soldiers retrieve Perseus from the wreckage and bring him to the court of King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia so he may witness further, royal smiting.<br /><br />While among the court, Cassiopeia belligerently belittles Aphrodite by declaring her daughter, Andromeda, to be more beautiful.  [Enter Hades]  Hades appears before the court to display the power of the gods.  To punish the mortals, Hades calls for Andromeda to be sacrificed; if the mortals refuse, the Kraken will be unleashed on the city of Agros.  DUN DUN DUN... there's more.  Hades can't help but notice Perseus among the mortals, and perhaps this is Hades' own form of passive-aggressive revenge, but he just can't help exposing Perseus as a son of Zeus and demigod.  [I'll add that this isn't exactly how things happened in Mythological literature; this would be the point where Juno/Hera gets infuriated over Zeus's infidelity and unleashes her own wrath.]<br /><br />To help unravel Perseus' new identity, the nymph and Priestess of Hera in Argos, Io, visits Perseus.  She helps to put a few things into perspective for the new demigod and charges him to be the only one who might save the mortals from the gods.  Now that Perseus has been given his quest, he must venture to find the Stygian Witches in order to learn how to defeat the Kraken.  Meanwhile, we get a peek into Hades' true plot.  Zeus then finds his son, Perseus, and offers him a gift to assist him in his quest (Zeus no longer wishes for Hades' plot to go through).  Zeus grants to Perseus the Pegasus and an Olympian sword--still angry at his absent father, Perseus shuns the gifts for a while.<br /><br />[Spoiler alert:  Stop reading here if you don't want to know what happens]  Perseus uses his wit to trick the witches into revealing how the Kraken might be defeated; Perseus must seek Medusa's head which can be used to turn the Kraken into stone.  To find Medusa, Perseus and his gang (Io included?) gain passage into the underworld.  Pretty much everyone dies in this trial, Perseus being the exception.  This is a pretty important part of the movie because it is a turning point for Perseus; he begins to understand who he is and how he must use his powers.  From here on out, Perseus and Zeus work on their father-son relationship (to the dismay of Ares, but that's another story).  As Perseus mounts Pegasus, he couldn't look any more godly than as he rides off to save Andromeda, slay the Kraken, and release Zeus from the grip of Hades.N... there's more.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|She does a wonderful job with these characters and how the story unfolds. Of all the romances I've read, the nickname he gives her, Pigeon, has become my favorite of all time!
B00B52F278|4.0|While I preferred the first two seasons and the prequel, I was just as engaged in this season.  I think the only drop-off was knowing that it was the final season so while watching, I kept thinking \\"all these characters are going to die.\\"  Despite that notion, it was still full of surprises and much of the premise is fairly accurate to history (at least what we know of Spartacus.)<br /><br />\\"Spartacus:  War of the Damned\\" picks up where season two left off.  It has been about one year since the beginning of the slave rebellion initiated by the gladiators and slaves who overthrew the House of Batiatus.  As the rebellion swells, Spartacus, Crixus, Agron, and Gannicus agree they must find a larger base for their band of slaves.  In Rome, the senate desperately names Marcus Crassus leader of the Army against Spartacus.  Crassus enlists Gaius Julius Caesar into his army, along with Crassus' repulsive son, Tiberius.<br /><br />After Spartacus and his men take their city, they seek assistance from a gang of local pirates.  While meeting these pirates outside city walls, Tiberius leads an attack against the rebels but fails to hold his ranks.  Once rejoined with his father's army, Crassus commands a display of decimation for Tiberius and his men.  The slyness of Marcus Crassus begins to be revealed as he slips Caesar into the slave city as a spy pretended to be one of the rebels.  Caesar causes upset among the slaves, driving Crixus and Spartacus to quarrels over their purposes.<br /><br />Once the city falls at Crassus' hand, the rebel army becomes trapped in a snowy ridge; they begin to freeze and starve.  The rift between Spartacus and Crixus grows.  Spartacus devises a plan to lead his army over the snowy ridge.  Once escaped, the rebel army splits between Spartacus and Crixus.<br /><br />As far as overviewing the season, I have elected to stop here because the final 2-3 episodes wrap up the entire series--well worth the watch.  What I found most interesting about season 3 is the ability of the writers to truly expose the depth of the characters; those you may have previously thought you hated now become those you love, and vice versa.  This is a show that stays in the mind long after it's over because it is hard to definitively point to \\"what is right\\" and \\"what is wrong.\\"  I also thought some of the battle ploys used by each army were genius, and surprises are plenty.on 3 is the ability of the writers to truly expose the depth of the characters; those you may have previously thought you hated now become those you love, and vice versa.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|This is a good movie, highly unlikely and sad at times, but it's an original. The film is based on the book \\"I Am Legend\\", a science-fictiony, thriller/horrorish novel. My adjectives aren't great, but basically the story follows Robert Neville, a lieutenant colonel and virologist through post-apocalyptic struggles.<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie, a news clip is shown where a doctor is interviewed saying she believes the cure for cancer has been found, and has so far killed all cancer in over 1000 patients. A few months later, it seems that the virus used to kill cancer in these subjects has actually taken over their bodies; increased aggression is one of the many side effects that constitute a condition best described as evil-zombieism. The virus also spreads from person to person, but fortunately for Robert Neville, he appears to be one of few or none immune to the virus.<br /><br />For some time the government puts it's too scientists to work on a cure, but when the outbreak surges a cure has not been found. Neville and his family live in New York, where the bridges are to be blown for quarantine purposes. He says goodbye to his wife, daughter, and her puppy, Sam, as they are loaded into a helicopter to be taken from the island. Robert stats behind to concentrate on finding a cure, and at the last minute his daughter hands him Sam to keep him company. It's a good thing because soon he will be the only human left in Manhattan as the city is taken over by zombies.<br /><br />Over the next few years, Robert and Sam have a routine they practice which includes foraging, hunting, searching for survivors and searching for a cure, as well as protecting themselves against the horrors in the shadows. While the movie is horror in genre, it is also quite tragic. Neville falls deeper into the sorrow of pain and loss and loneliness. Will Smith does an excellent job of understating the mental trauma Neville experiences, but expresses it in a way that feels very real. For the remainder of the film, the search for a cure continues as the threat of death by zombie nears. I won't ruin any surprises but I really think this is a good movie, but be aware that it is very very sad and not easily shrugged away. I hope this review helps.or the remainder of the film, the search for a cure continues as the threat of death by zombie nears.

006202406X|1.0|I for some reason got mine yesterday--a day early. And I peeked into the end 'cause I was honestly bored of the series even during Insurgent and I had pre-ordered this before and didn't realize how boring the second book would be (plus I wasn't going to go through an entire book because I wanted to know what would happen and not because I was actually interested in it)...AND I FELL OUT OF MY SEAT AFTER READING THE EPILOGUE.<br />  To make sure I wasn't reading things wrong, I went back seven chapters and read from there and was able to figure out what had happened. I cried for three hours because this is the third time this has happened to me, but this has to be BY FAR the worst ending I have EVER seen. PLEASE, DON'T READ IT! I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO GO THROUGH WHAT I DID!<br />  Unfortunately, since I had gotten my copy early, I had no reviews to warn me not to read this (which is partially why I am making this review). Usually, before I order or read anything I'll check the reviews to make sure that I'm not reading something that will cause me as much heartbreak as this one did. The ending was uncalled for and absolutely, positively unnecessary. I took the book to school today to warn my friends. They didn't believe me, and so I showed them. ALL OF THEM FLIPPED! One of them was in denial and nearly cried. They had been waiting for this last book even longer than I had--and when I first got it and peeked, I thought it was a joke. I thought that somehow there'd be some extra epilogue, but there wasn't. At night, it haunted my dreams.I spent a lot of time wishing for memory serum because I just want to forget this devastating thing ever happened. My brain hurts from trying to erase the entire trilogy from my memory.<br />  Roth took a gun and shot the entire fandom down with this book. I am expecting a boatload of fanfictions this week on new versions of this ending, but as always, it won't be the same as the actual book.<br />  I'm one of those people that fallsin love with characters and get super attached--this ruined me. My mother had to make me popcorn to make me feel better and didn't understand why I was so upset. I will never be reading another one of Roth's books again and I will never make another mistake with an unfinished series, either.<br />  I seriously wish I'd stopped at the first book. The first book was PERFECT. The second, slightly less great, but the third? Never EVER reading another series again. I'm done. I've had the worst experiences with trilogies and I honestly don't know what in the world I was thinking when I picked this one up. Roth's writing isn't that great either, so there was really no point to putting myself through this crap again. Only single books for the Annelise now.  Just do yourself a favor and don't read it if you loved the first two. Please.

B001DF68MA|5.0|We purchased this for my almost 1 year old so that we could take bike rides as a family.  It's been great.  It was very easy to install and fits well on my bike.  The baby took a little while to get used to it but now she loves it.  Even the mention of a bike ride and she gets excited.  I like having her close where I can talk to her while we ride and she knows I am close and is therefore more comfortable.  I do find that I have to flare my legs out a bit while I'm riding and I'm wondering if adjusting the pedals on my bike might help with this very slight discomfort.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|I've loved nearly everything that has come from Donna in all its iterations and styles, though my favorite has always been her much earlier music from Moroder/Bellote. This album is a worthy effort to take all those great tunes and remix most of them them in a way that keeps their wonderful vocalistic stylings of Donna, yet make them unique and electronically upbeat and trippy.  I especially love the Cox/Moroder remix of Love to Love You and the Afrojack remix on I Feel Love. Powerful and fun. Unique and yet they still keep the same elements that made the originals so awesome and perfect.<br />The newly released La Dolce Vita reminds me sort of \\"I'm a Fire\\".  Not my favorite Donna tune, but a nice addition.<br /><br />A few disappointments though:<br />1) the decision to use another vocalist on Working the Midnight Shift, one of my all time favorites.  The vocalist sounds close enough to Donna (after remixing and such...) that I'm surprised they just didn't use Donna's vocals for the entire song, instead of just adding a small snippet of her soaring vocals in the middle).  The remix itself is not bad at all, just ashame they didn't use Donna for the entire song.<br />2) The MacArthur Park remix.....I'm not a big fan of the \\"Victor Calderone-y\\" pounding remixes, and the MacArthur Park mix is typical of L. Luke's (and V. Calderone's) style.  Giving that the original song is a soaring ballad, I'm thinking they could have laid off the typical pots and pans a bit more.<br />3) The I Feel Love Benga Remix -  The Benga remix of I Feel Love just doesn't have enough vocals and loses the Moroder up and down repetitive synthesizer notes that echo throughout the original song. Luckily this album included the Afrojack mix which is much, much better.<br />4) The Dim All the Lights remix - Just don't care for it.  Dim All the Lights was one of the first Donna Summer self-penned tunes that nearly made it to number one but was bumped out of the spot by, guess what?  The Enough is Enough collaboration with B. Streisand...go figure. Anyway, this was one of my favorite Donna tunes and the remix captured none of that original feel or tune I fell in love with.<br />5) On The Radio remix.....just don't care for it.  Retains little of the original tune and is sort of on the dark side.....<br /><br />Other than those misses, I really do like the album and it's nice that this gives me another Donna \\"fix\\" to get me through my workouts.  Donna will be greatly missed and this is a worthy effort to keep her music alive and well for generations to come.ough collaboration with B. Streisand...go figure.

The game looks and sounds great; although the music loops can get annoying, and after a while I prefer to play with the sound off.<br /><br />The only issue I have with the game is that some levels are very difficult and you can get stuck on the same level for quite some time.  Furthermore, you only have 5 \\"lives\\", and once you're out you have two options... pay 99 cents for +3 lives (no thanks), or simply wait -- the game credits you one life every 30 minutes.  So you can either fork over your hard-earned money, or you'll have to go do something else while you wait for your lives to replenish.  I just opt to wait, but it kills the momentum.<br /><br />So at times it does get frustrating, and there are too many occasions where the game developers ask you to purchase an add-on (which is understandable given that the game itself is a free download).  But overall, this is the most fun tablet-based game I've played.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Much of the fun of watching this beautifully produced series is seeing actual historical characters, such as Attorney General Harry Daugherty & the bizarrely crooked Gaston Means.  The series takes a very cynical, and probably accurate, view of 1920s politicians.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Well portrayed, interesting concept.  Plan to re-watch soon (over the winter) to pick up on any missed nuances overlooked in my first viewing.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great read! Constantly moving story. Exciting twists. Always a good bit of history in Dan Brown books. I like reading his books and then watching the movies when I'm done. The movies are never as good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this addicting and fun game and I'm so excited that it's finally available for Kindle Fire! The graphics are great and moves very smoothly. I'm very pleased.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Stupid plot and no point at all to the story. A waste of time. I was sorry I actually sat through it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game play is REALLY slow. It is a fun game!  Would be more fun if the invest point earned faster!!  Also, Its EXTRA annoying that every little thing you do causes a pop up box wanting you to post something to Facebook.  I shouldn't have to post to Facebook to get invest points!!
1401201911|5.0|deserves the 5 stars.<br />The story is not what I expected, very well written. would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Die hard Captain Kirk fan and love The Next Generation.  Although Capt Archer of this rendition is not in the league of the other too, I found myself drawn to the sub chanracters Tripp and Dr. Flox.  Never saw the series on TV and it is great having it on Amazon Prime!  Thank you Amazon.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you are a trekkie as I am, you will love this movie. Chris Pine does a great job of occasionally overacting in true William Shatner fashion.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This little fella serves its purpose.<br />I paid less than 5 USD including shipping.<br />I was able to use it once. The mechanism that holds the phone is so tight that when you try to place the phone you need to be careful or it will break in an instant.<br />That's what happened to me.<br />I'm being fair and giving it 4 stars because it's so affordable you can't request high quality.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|when you play the game u can feel the trills running throughout your body....get the app it is worth it
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Overall I enjoyed the Z movie. It is in many ways your typical Zombie flick. However, there were just enough twists, turns and action to keep the viewer entertained. I like Brad Pit movies, and this one worked for me. Not a classic, but worth the watch.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is one of those rare guys who is better live than any of the studio stuff. This was a great concert from start to finish.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is finally here!!!! Thank you Amazon!!!!!! I can give my son his iPod back. I love this game so much!
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is a fantastic download. Jehovah is constantly blessing us! I am in amazement as to the useability of the program, super simple!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Very good read. Typical page turner from Mr. King, and a very good twist on &#34;The Shining&#34;. I recommend it to King fans.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Would like to delete more at a time or delete all and be done with it. Too time consuming to delete few at a time.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Why Veronica Roth would end such a promising trilogy the way she has is beyond me. Yes okay she has shied away from the norm of ending it like a happy fairytale which was brave of her but the ending is just a tragedy. Wish I could write to Veronica and request my money back and the time I spent reading the books only to be so bitterly let down at the conclusion.<br />Even without the ending it wasn't an enjoyable read and I ended up flicking through most.<br /><br />I will not be watching the films nor reading anymore from the author who clearly has no qualms about letting her loyal fans down.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|I have read two Longmire novels and I will hesitate to read another one.  It had too many areas that really slowed to a crawl and then picked up again.  The novels aren't as interesting as the TV show.
B0089LOG02|3.0|Interesting look into a time in our history .  Children with out parents suffer no matter how much the state tries to help.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I was absolutely enthralled in this book and the rest of the series. I cannot wait for the next book to come out! I  waiting impatiently!!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|A crisp and forthright account of a complex and exceptional human being. Not often have I got a chance to read such a gripping biography. Greatly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|SUPER SUPER FUN I LOVE IT CAUSE MY MOM HAS IT I TRIED IT WAS REALLY REALLY FUN I JUST CAN'T STAND HOW FUN THIS IS.
1476729085|5.0|I loved this book, and may nerds unite every where. That is just a joke, but I loved the main character though he struggled to find a woman and had Asperger's he was none the less appealing. The best part of this book is that it was funny, as well as charming and slightly romantic. The premise of him trying to find a mate, and trying to do so methodically to only find a equally quirky Rosie was so much fun. This book has something for everyone including a great plot, lovable characters, insight into Asperger's and love!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE this game!  I have been anxiously waiting for it to be available on Kindle Fire! Now I can play on my desktop, phone AND Kindle! :-)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I would've gave it 5 stars if it had its own battery. Would be convient for the ppl who dont have usb outlets in their tvs
B001TH16DI|5.0|The picture and sound quality on these movies is outstanding. If you like Star Trek, this is a must have in your collection.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is my favorite version! I love this movie and I was so happy to get it in the mail.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is always good. Gets me where I want to go. Like it's breaks down of subjects or locations to choose from before entering what I want.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|SPOILERS.  Read at your own risk.<br /><br />I used to have this friend who loved the movie Moulin Rouge.  I watched it with her once and she turned it off about 30 minutes before the actual end of the movie.  She said she loved the movie, but not the ending, so she chooses not to watch the end.  That pretty much sums up how I feel about this book series.  I'm not a fan of the ending.  I understand that it's realistic, in keeping with the theme of the other books, that we are supposed to be proud of the sacrifices made by our main characters... I understand how I'm supposed to feel about it.  But, that's not how I actually felt.<br /><br />That aside, I had some plot issues.  How did no one notice the mother being dropped into Dauntless at 15?  What, the Dauntless just found another teenager roaming around and decided to go with it?<br /><br />When mom realizes that Tris is divergent - she doesn't use her hookups to get her out of there?  That seems weird.<br /><br />And if the divergent are SO important that they took risks to pull out single divergents from Dauntless, then why didn't anyone do more to intervene when they were being hunted down in Book 2?  It seems like it would have been really easy to extract the factionless divergent without any of the faction leaders catching on... but there isn't any real mention of that happening.  Unless I missed it when I stayed up to the wee hours of the morning to finish this book.<br /><br />Is George watching the screens?  If so, when he sees his sister Tori risking life and limb to avenge his death, he just what... That's pretty lame. Not very Dauntless either.  And not really in the whole \\"self sacrificing\\" theme to just watch her wilt with hatred over his \\"death\\" when he's, you know, not dead.<br /><br />And what is going on with the US government?  At first, there was all this explanation to our little crew of rebels about the government, but then... where the heck are they?  It just seemed like there was some buildhere into the government having a larger role... but it sorta fell flat for me.  Maybe I missed it?  I was pretty tired.  And I have to say, I don't really want to re read it, at least not right now.<br /><br />Yeah, maybe it wasn't such a great idea to release this book before the movie.  I'm not sure I want to see the tortured love story unfold on the big screen only to have it end this way.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I used it and I was never late to anything I love this app and its really simple to use
B00CM6ZLG8|4.0|Perfect combination of dance music and ballads. I have always liked her and own all previous albums she has made. Bravo for her growth as a person and an artist, it is quite apparent in her work.
030758836X|2.0|This book came recommended by several friends- have never read a book where there were no likeable characters. Perhaps this is the \\"catch\\" which made it a bestseller. Didn't care for the story, the characters and the ending was ridiculous. Certainly NOT going to see the movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has become my go-to each morning for personal time with God, as well as each evening for family devotions. I truly don't know what I'd  do without it. The accountability feature is priceless.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the real Candy Crush.  What's not to like?  Now I can play it on my Kindle too.  This may not be such a good thing.....
B00C5R8364|5.0|A great read. Technically detailed, a page turner and a must read for military. Non stop action with detailed historical facts.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like having this app on my kindle because it's like I'm viewing pins on my laptop but it's less over-stimulating than using computer
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really loved this book. I hesitated reading it for many reasons, but mostly because I wasn't looking to read a sad book. However, I am so glad I did. It is so much more than just a story about kids who have to face a devestatning prognosis.
B00846REIS|5.0|Gideon Cross is my favorite! This book is delicious. Read it in one day, you can't put it down. The mystery, the excitement and the love is just perfect. Highly recommended! The whole series is perfect. Be prepared to fall hard for him.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great action scenes,  plot and special F/X. Khan remake was pure evil not kind of corny like in Wrath of Khan. The caracter Sulu  should be brought back in a larger part in the next movie
0744014549|5.0|It's one of the biggest artbooks I've ever had, lots of pages and great work. Great quality concept art and book.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Haven't seen a documentary that made me want to be a rock star as much as this one.  Grohl does an excellent job with incredible interviews and a dynamic storyline.  8 stars out of 5
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|Requires a subscription ($) to use outside of your local network. I'll stick with the other solution in this space.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had so much fun with this game and can't wait for new levels!! It reminds me of the old Pc games Myst and Lighthouse.
B008JFUO36|4.0|To me the film is worth a five for the final third.  I maybe should have given it a 5, because without the first 2/3's you cannot get to the very satisfied ending.  Tom Cruise puts in another good performance with great physical stunts.  Plenty of action and twists that keep you anticipating other results which you do not expect.  Great premise and unexpected results.  The movie proves that humans are unpredictable.
B001TH16DI|5.0|What's not to like. I am a Trekkie from the first episode on TV. This was a welcome addition to my collection.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Hemingway isn't for the young. life has to hit you to get it. Otherwise it just seems like drinking and bull fights.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I feel like most of the \\"terrible\\" reviews are from people who didn't like the ending. I get that, but it was a realistic choice, and actually I applaud Veronica Roth because I am sure she knew there would be backlash. I actually liked the ending.<br /><br />Here's the thing, if you have read the first two book in the series, you SHOULD read the last one, and if you are thinking about starting the trilogy, you absolutely should because Divergent in particular is one of the best YA novels out there.<br /><br />The problem for me in this last book is that you are introduced to a world outside the city and it's never really clear what's going on with it. This is where a trilogy like Hunger Games really shines because Collins does a wonderful job introducing you to the world outside of district 12 along with Katniss.  I *think* this was Roth's intention but it didn't work at all for me (maybe because it's essentially crammed into one book that already has a lot else going on).  I still am fairly confused about what happened to the US re: genetic modifications and how the country is set up (is there a centralized government? Is it mostly genetically damaged people in all the cities? I'm just confused - could be because I was reading it at 2 AM).<br /><br />For a story that seemed so carefully planned out in the first two book, Allegiant seemed a little ad hoc at times. Tris's mom was able to just be dropped into Dauntless at age 15 and no one questioned where she came from? There was an effort to remove the divergent population but Tris's mom never thinks to remove her own daughter? Evelyn and Marcus just kind of come to an agreement? The diver gents are so important to the scientists and they just let the slaughter occur when they could have intervened with serum the whole time?  I would have preferred Roth to expand to a 4th book if she couldn't do the story justice in 3.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|You do not have to be a Star Trek fanatic to enjoy this new Star Trek film.  If you are not a Trekkie, so what.  This is worth a try; you may like the final result.  If you are a Trekkie and missed this film in the threater, shame on you.  The mission truly continues and for me I hope that more episodes are planned.  Scotty was my favorite character in this episode; he was a joy to watch.
B0056C6XIA|4.0|Gerbers Bear Grylls line is all good. They are well made and consistently meet standards. I have some other brand multitools and the quality has dropped significantly over the last several years this is not the case with this line of products. They are well made and stay that way.
B00006CXSS|1.0|I realize it is to late for a return. I did not open the pakage until a week ago. My mistake! When I tried to view it after a message appeared stating it could not be viewed because something was missing. I tried a different dvd player and it would not load. So I would caution anyone buying from this seller to examine your purchase immeditaly upon receipt.<br /> I was niave and assumed it was in &#34; like new condition &#34; as stated. I have never had to write a review before.<br /> BEWARE!!!
1781162646|2.0|It's a pleasant enough tale, but I just didn' feel the spark.  It seems that every once in a while King feels the need to prove he's a &#34;serious writer.&#34;  He's brilliant, a wonderful wordsmith and scares the hell out of me (and millions of other fans), so what's to prove?
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Jake Reacher does not get the girl.  What a shame that the producers and director forgot about Jack's masculinity.  They just brushed by Jack's ability to get the girl that he gets in every one of the Jack Reacher stories.  Other than that I was satisfied with the product.  6 foot 6 inches, 250 pounds,  that is not Tom Cruise.  However, I still think Tom does a good job of making Jack Reacher come alive on the Big Screen.  I would not mine if Tom Cruise did another Jack Reacher story.  I really LOVED seeing Lee Child do his cameo bit.  That reminds me of Clive Cussler and his cameo bits in many of his books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I tend to only read classic literature, but my parents of all people talked me into this series. I have now read the trilogy twice, but this book is my favorite I absolutely love it!
B00FXOQO6W|5.0|I didn't read comic books when I was growing up, so I can't say how faithful the current movie/TV franchise has been to them. I do think this is a great series on its own merits. The characters are interesting and have potential for growth and development, the dialogue is witty and the timing is excellent. There is plenty of action but not so much that you get bored with it (a problem I've had in some recent movies, especially, where I'm just waiting for the fight to get to its inevitable conclusion and move on with the plot).<br /><br />Joss, as always, delivers some unexpected but brilliant moments that I never saw coming.<br /><br />I'm really hoping ABC lets this one run for a while.
B0001I561E|5.0|I have a 2 year old and I am always trying to introduce him to the childhood movies I loved and this was one of them. He loves it as did I when I was younger!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The writing, casting and acting are all supurb!  Highly recommended to all who enjoy a good novel. After awhile the Downton family becomes an extension of your family.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Awesome app get clock love the music feature. Does a great job of waking me up. Slim doesn't use much memory.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|it's a gripping thriller which keeps viewers engaged through out the movie, however this movie is not close to reality. Nice to watch though.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This was a couldn't put it down book for me, I really can't say enough good about it! She has such a light enjoyable writing style and the information in this is truly amazing. Just read it, you will be happy you did.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is very informative to our personal study...<br />I am so happy we have access to this for our devices...
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Much better than Hangover 2, but nowhere near as good as the original. Way to much Mr. Chow. Good flick.
B007EECSFA|4.0|It started out a little slow, but quickly picked up.  Great twist at the end.  Want to go back and read it again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is so beast I just want to just beat all day if I could. I hope that everybody will download this game wand enjoy it
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Emotions will grow higher as more and more people finish this book. This is my personal interpretation of the story. Please don't throw me to the fringe if you disagree. ;) (And yes, there are obviously spoilers ahead.)<br /><br />Here’s my take on it. I just finished it about a half hour ago. This wasn't the best book I’ve ever read. For me, it seemed to lack that climactic feeling that I look forward to in the ending of a series or trilogy. But I still really enjoyed this book and thought it was an appropriate ending to the story.<br /><br />Naturally, people will be upset because of Tris’s death. But I personally felt that it was appropriate within the themes of the story. Maybe it’s because I suspected it ever since they announced the book would be split between Tris and Four’s POV, so it wasn't as hard of a blow to me. But I feel that some of the greatest themes throughout the trilogy were BRAVERY, SACRIFICE and FORGIVENESS. This is how I interpret the story.<br /><br />Tris seemed to embody and develop these themes to me. And I feel her death is meant to solidify these themes into the reader. She sacrificed herself. She realized there was a risk in going, but she took it. Even if the way she died wasn't how she suspected she might; when she made her mind to take Caleb’s place, she sacrificed herself. And I think her motives are important to consider. She did it because she loved her brother (maybe even forgave him for what he did), and also because she loved her family and friends. She did it because she was brave enough to love and to give to those she loved.<br /><br />I think you have to be somewhat brave, forgiving, charitable, honest and wise to LOVE, and I feel that’s who Tris was and what her sacrifice is meant to teach us.<br /><br />Just my thoughts. :)
1452115567|3.0|Photos were very cute, but the soft cover prints were not my expected quality.  Content is good, but not reproduced very well.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I didn't like the ending, but aside from that I thought the story was really boring. I wasn't interested in any of the new characters introduced or the answers we got.  Everything seemed really long and drawn out esp. when trying to explain &#34;why&#34; things were the way they were.  I kept reading expecting at some point things were going to get really good, it never did. I was expecting more.
B007IV11PM|5.0|Time isn't a straight line. It's all.. Bumpy-Wumpy. LOVE, LOVE!! The Doctor! Amazing season! Matt Smith is amazing and super fun through out the season. A MUST WATCH!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's about time, the long awaited kindle version. The only drawback that I've experienced is that the accumulated lives do not reflect. As far as working I enjoy passing the time with this addictive games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's what we have all been waiting for. I have to start from the beginning but I don't care. I'm so happy I can play Candy Crush on my Kindle Fire. Thank you!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great story line!!! Me and my husband sit with anticipation to see each episode of Walking dead. It's so scary and unpredictable
B0084AZXKK|4.0|It was very action packed with a lot of good characters<br />I would  recommend this to boys that are 9-14 maybe 15 years old other wise pretty good book.
B006LXQID8|5.0|She is charming and, though I'm usually annoyed with subtitles, didn't mind it one bit.  Clever and sweet and delightful.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I am not much of a Sy-Fi junckie, but I caught this show by chance and I am clad I did. This show is unique and great writting, charcters, and plot. I like that there isn't a show like this out there and if so I prob. wouldn't watch it. I don't like the idea of cloning, but I love this show. Sara kicks butt!!! I love the characters connection, it makes the show that much better and current I hope they bring this show back in the states.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|What can i say about Rocky Horror except Superb. In my opinion This musical is second to none when it comes to fun and entertainment...With stars galore and the soundtrack is excellent as well.I bought this awhile ago on here and i love it so much,recently upgraded to Rocky Horror on Blu Ray(which i also purchased on Amazon.com.)Trust me when i say,buy it,you wont regret it.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a great basic app and it doesn't glitch<br /><br /> and it has a lot of buttons that regular calculators don't have.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I stopped watching suits only when I ran out of episodes. I may try to talk my husband into watching so I have an excuse to watch it again.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Reza Aslan's&#34; Zealot&#34; is great fodder for discussion. What Aslan lays out as historical fact is reliable. What he makes of those facts, going beyond what is known or can be known, is interesting but not always convencing as evidence supporting a finding.  That is the &#34;findings&#34; are conjectures. Interesting conjectures, but in the end just well argued, often plausible conjectures. I highly recommend reading this book with others. I also recommend reading this book against scholary books on the historical Jesus. Among such books, I highly recommend &#34;Prophet and Teacher: An Introduction to the Historical Jesus,&#34; by William R. Herzog, 2006. I found nothing in Aslan's &#34;Zealot&#34; that I had not already read in Herzog. But Aslan's text is provocative and has the desired effect of bring people into conversation, questioning who they understand the historical Jesus to be.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Henry Tudor, a momma's boy? Wow...Hilarious! I loved seeing the mother (Elizabeth R) through her daughter's eyes. I am reading &#34;The Lady of the Rivers&#34; and it is painting a such a nice tale and a predecessor to this continuation. LOVE these books!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I especially love the idea of digital and analog desks...Kleon presents some refreshingly original advice here and that's always appreciated. I think I might steal a few of his ideas!!
B008Q08IV4|5.0|One of the best movies I have watched. It is the 4th time I watch it. Probably will watch more times in the future.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who was 10 at the time...she loves it. It was a challenge putting this together...especially when helping a child. Otherwise highly recommend for VW lovers...
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Timeless novel. The book is as relevant today as it was when it was published.Steinbeck is an author that all should read
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|I'm blown away by the album....not because it was fabulous....but because its literally the first DT album that I basically dont like. Tracks 1,2 and 5 are OK. But nothing to captivate you for a solid month like DT albums typically do. Track 9 is the best one (I like it) but it also has a couple spots in it where I'm thinking \\"goofy.\\" The rest of the album......BORING!!!!! The album is on my shelf already. And DT fans, who are used to convincing themselves that Labrie is a great singer and Portnoys departure doesn't matter will convince themselves that this album is the bomb as well. I dont know what happened, ADTOE was a GREAT LP. This one is an album full of fillers. I think ultimately...DT is losing me (its taken time for me to come to terms with Portnoy being gone...I really wanted to hold on to one of my favorite bands of all time). I miss Portnoy. His stage presence alone was tits! And he had personality that would shine thru on their albums. HE WAS HALF THE BAND!!! Mangini is just a supportive technical drummer. He just blends in the background for the most. He's exactly what the band wanted....submissive. This is why they didnt like Thomas Lang (my favorite drummer outside of Portnoy). And Labrie saying that Portnoy was a \\"part of THEIR past but they have moved on\\" is one of the most arrogant statements ever from a singer who ought to just shut up and count his blessings that he actually never was on American Idol. Ive struggled with Labrie thru the years (his singing in Glass Prison is a good example of FIRE HIM!) but always tolerated him because of the top shelf music. But after this album....I cant stand the singer again. Although, in his defense, these last two albums he's sounded way better. But if the music isnt there (like on this album) his nasaly whiney voice is that much more noticeable. Why does he pronounce and prolong all the words with a long E?! EEEEEEEEeeeeee........Foreseeeeeeeeeeeeee.......miseryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.......Cant you seeeeeeeeeeeeeee. \\"Annoyeeeeeeeeeeeing!!!\\" Other parts of his singing sound like a loud pushing it to the limit indecipherable \\"BLAH BLAH BLU BLAH BLU BLAH BLAH BLAH.\\" You know, the parts where you (as a DT fan) cross your fingers and hope that your friends will not say \\"I dont like the singer\\" when you show them the GREATEST band of the past 25 yrs. If only Russell Allen was their singer. And Rudess....STOP with the circus sounding keyboards! Just play the normal piano (like he did on ADToE) before torturing me with a measure of music that makes me think I'm at Disney World.<br />I'll still go see em' in concert when they come to town but I honestly dont see them as DT anymore. Maybe DT revisted...with only two original founders.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I'm new to the whole photography world and didn't want to go spending $120 on a backpack. This pack does everything i need it to. I carry around a tripod, external flash, 70-200mm, 50mm, and 28-80mm lens, filters batteries and charger, remote shutter release and all necessary cords with my 20d. I also carry around a mini laptop for when I'm travelling. Never had an issue with it. I take it on hikes so I can set up in some more remote places and it's perfect. The shoulder straps are padded enough that it's comfortable and the overall construction of the pack is definitely sturdy. Also, the entire interior is felt and velcro with removable straps so you can literally rearrange the entire interior to suit your needs, which i thought was cool. Definitely worth it for a beginner or someone that doesn't require the top of the line.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A fun, easy read that reinforces my belief about thoughts and words create your world!  We have endless possibilities on a road that can take us anywhere.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|I loved this movie. It wasn't only entertaining but the twists they placed in it kept me engaged and interested. Great performances by Jessie Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson. The group dynamic really carried this movie. If magic is you cup of tea this is the movie to see.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I can't wait to start from the beginning of the series!!! I love pendergast! Quite a bad ass! Starting on relic next
140006922X|5.0|this was an easy read but full of facinating insights into the history of jesus and his times.  i recomend it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Beautiful read! I love how the novel is so real, so true, so relative to what happens on in the real world and in some homes. I love how people can relate to this novel. Beautiful, beautiful! Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author and his novels are so life-like!
B00BRUPICM|4.0|Hmmm, it was hard to rate this book.  Definitely grabs you from the beginning to the end.  I loved all the twists and turns.  Camille, the 4'11 commandant cracked me up.  It had a bunch of horror, along with some humor.  This book was chosen in our book club for the month of October...definitely fit in with a Halloween theme!  Overall, it kept my attention, I liked the suspense, I enjoyed it, but definitely not one of my favorites.  A little too much on the gruesome side.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!!!!! It is super fun and full of adventure and excitement, but also a lot of comedy. I think this is the best book of the whole series!!!!! I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was skeptical when I picked this up but Mr. Card's introduction won me over. I never looked back and I feel I could easily relate or rather empathise with the characters of the book. Card made them all come alive for me, he made their struggles seem real. Definitely not the happiest book I've ever read but it was a book worth reading. A book I won't forget any time soon.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Get the game it's cool I like it :-) and it's a fun game to play and it's free go check it out
B00ERIUO02|5.0|before this album came out, I wasnt sure how good its gonna be, but I had some feelings that its gonna be alright, (cuz Katy Perry is a great singer) she is not perfect but she is her own person, and she is not afraid to be different and try different things, she does not give a crap what people think, she is fun, thats what makes her good artist/singer, she is not dirty or disturbing like most other singers are: like Miley Cyrus, cuz Miley just went too far at this point,<br /><br />now that abum (Prism)came out, I listened to every song, and I Love it!! and to be honest, it is not Perfect, but its still a great album, its Understandable why this album is so different from *teenage dream* Katy Perry has been going through so much.... past few years, break ups and a lot of sadness, it made this album a lot darker and different than Teenage Dream* but this album was still worth it!! Nobody is perfect, so dont expect everything to be perfect!<br />the best thing about Katy is: she Never gives up, she still keeps going and keeps on shining!!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Good fun for all ages even my four year old can play this game, the little dragon's  are so cute!
0374533555|1.0|I only made it through a few chapters.  The premise seemed interesting but the level of detail and analytics needed to get there were overblown.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I enjoyed reading the bookmark and the plot twists and turns kept you moving and off balance.<br />I always enjoy a reluctant hero who lives and lives up to the challenge.<br />There are tough concepts and lessons that are a part of the story that I found interesting and stimulating to read.<br />Great job! Looking forward to number 2!
0307476464|4.0|This book was quite a journey.  This is the first novel I read from this author and I am eager to explore more of his works.  I really appreciated his attention to detail and his element of fantasy and fun he added to every word he wrote.  I loved all the characters and how he developed them over time.  I  really appreciated how it was set in Japan, but he made several references to different countries and cultures.  The ending was perfect and was just how I was hoping it would all tie up.  The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was due to the length.  I don't mind a long book if I feel it is necessary to the story, but I felt like this could have been a few hundred pages less and still have the same impact.  Overall this is definitely worth a chance to get caught up and lost in Murakami's beautiful and fantastical world of 1Q84!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  Happy it is finally available on the kindle! ! Got my husband addicted to the game as well! !
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. Challenging myself and trying to beat the clock make this fun and it keeps my attention. One of the better Mahjong games out there.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT IS SO MUCH FUN BECAUSE YOU CAN GET SOOOO MANY LEVELS TO PLAY AND SUCH A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANIMALS TO HUNT AND SO MANY GUNS TO BUY U CAN ALSO UPGRADE YOUR GUNS TO MAKE THEM MORE POWERFUL U GOTTA GET THIS GAME
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Best match 3 I have found. Keeps me going for hours. I would definitely recommend  it for those who like the original Fruit Drops. Only drawback is that the game freezes sometime.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive. A great game to chill out in your bed before going to sleep. Also a great game for kids. I definitely recommend it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Like the game idea and all. Problem is it is just to small for me to really make out items on my Android or Kindle. Old eyes I guess. If you have excellent vision and like these kinds of games then give it a shot!
B00515M23M|4.0|This book is pretty good as it contains legendary works. But what absolutely drives me mad is that there is a huge synopsis/introduction at the beginning and I have to continually scroll through the book just to get to the works! If there was an easier way to get to the works, I would rate it 5 stars.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|I was very disappointed in this app.  It was very limited.  It got boring always seeing it with the same background setting.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|When I saw the trailers for this I was beyong excited! I grew up watching the animated series with my dad, how could this not be exciting??<br />1. I would say this (as one would expect) is amazing work by Steven Spielberg, but arguably not his best<br />2. The voice cast is phenominal, I always enjoy watching kids movies and being able to recognize the voices of actors. (The young adult crowd should without hesitation be able to hear Daniel Craig, Pegg and Frost!)<br />3. As others have mentioned, the movie plot blends classic Tintin stories into one master plot and the writing was tastefully and most importantly seamlessly done<br />4. The CGI can be quite magical, especially scenes that are zoom in/ out of either positive or negative space onto the next chapter.<br />5. What one might find disappointing with the CGI will quickly be forgotten with all the fine details in scenes much like the original Tintin series<br />6. Some liberties were taken on character representation, but I think that's a given when pumping new life into an old series, overall I think it was well done<br />7. Cameo, cameo, cameo, cameo...see if you can spot it! :)<br />8. Overall, I liked this as a family/ kids movie, as for the little kid in me that so much enjoyed the animated series, it missed the mark a little bit.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This one harkens back to the King of old. Loving the whole storyline, as usual King's way of bringing back characters from earlier stories always give me a thrill. The little reminders of what happened over in Dairy or remember that dog that went rabid killing all those folks and so on. All the little details that twist and turn in a mass of ribbons truly knotted in a big ball on the floor until one by one they line themselves up and tie up all the loose ends like a pretty bow. A perfect story with a beginning a middle and an end with lots to chew on throughout making a satisfying meal indeed. Shine on.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Excellent season with great episodes!  It had a great plot to it.  A season with the trials to try and close the gates of Hell.  Doesn't get better then that
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Awesome game that allows u to pay for free without buying in game things like other games that r free, download it, ur gonna love it
B000FC10MU|5.0|I never thought I'd read a book like this. Someone on Facebook recommeded it so I bought. Since I don't know mythology very well I was oblvious to some of the names. However, I could not put it down!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Hope more is coming. The graphics are beautiful, the puzzles were just challenging enough, and it was kind of spooky. Lots of engaging fun.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|My rating is unfair.  This is a 3 to 4 star movie.  Brad Pitt does a great job.  The scenery, special effects, etc are outstanding.<br /><br />My problem is the story.  The premise is fantastic.  The acting is good.  Where it misses the mark is in the telling of the story.  Something isn't there.<br /><br />Yes, I watched the whole thing on the edge of my seat and would have complained if someone turned to another channel, but having seen it, I wouldn't tell my friends, &#34;You have to see this.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is a lot of fun and very challenging, and I am thrilled it has finally come out on the kindle .....however, I cannot get it to sync with my Facebook account. Hoping for a quick fix!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Forget zombies and all the other fiction scary stuff.  This is the book that will grab your attention.  Very well written.  It really opened my eyes.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Good movie high definition was so awesome I only wished we had put the surround sound on !!! It was a good film all the way around!!
B0035JNTA6|4.0|Zoolander is a must see for any fan of Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson. Their comedic styles work so well together and make for a hilarious look at the world of male modeling.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|funny and dump, make me laught, talk like a dog should be, look very happy and healhy, but not as me
B005RUV0NY|5.0|This is a great series. The characters are so well thought out. This is so unpredictable & exciting to view.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, only wish king would update faster, since I also play on facebook and already on level 499.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love these games. Great way to lower your stress level. Easy to challenging, these are fun you don't want to miss.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter has been one of my favorite TV series since the beginning. Granted I don't care for Deb what so ever, this show still has me hooked. Michael C. Hall comes back again to play his rightful role of Dexter Morgan, our favorite serial killer. The role was meant for him and he shows how great of an actor he truly is. This season, along with every season deserves 5 stars because Dexter is a bad ass.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like the simplicity of the layout. It was easy to immediately set up half a dozen cities around the world. I would like to have lunar phases and personally would love to have other celestial tidbits like meteors and eclipse schedules. Nevertheless, this is an excellent app.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I was so excited to get this movie, and when it came, it was in perfect condition!! I'd buy it again!
B000TERDNO|5.0|I didn't even know Billy Idol had a cover of Don't You Forget About Me (okay, I'm not a hardcore Billy fan), but I LOVE it. Plus it has all of my old favorites. Great collection.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Jack Reacher is a great film. It is different from your usual detective type movie and watching the way that the character is portrayed by Tom Cruise is just amazing. I give it 5 stars because I can. :)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The books this movie was based on were written for young readers ( teens) but since I know a teacher- and she read them for her class I decided to take a peek. They are well-written and kept my attention-BUT BACK TO THE MOVIE- IT TOO, WAS very entertaining- My husband and I are no spring chickens but even he thought it was good. I'm looking forward to the sequel movie- the special effects in this first one were pretty good- it strayed a bit from the book but nevertheless I highly recommend it and the acting -excellent.There are some graphic scenes, though not comparable to ie, zombie genre- so no youngster viewers. AND it had a PLOT~
B00F880BWG|5.0|This is my favorite show on TV. Every episode has left me wanting more. You can go wrong with this show.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband as it is his all time favorite movie. He said he loved it :)
B000957O82|5.0|The movie is in excellent working condition with no issues...actually it was just as described by the seller so it was a good buy.  I just love this movie so i'm happy there were no scratches.  Played right though with no issues.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game,  simple concept that can  actually can be little challenging at times. The graphics are pretty good.  I enjoy playing in spurts when I need to kill 5-10min
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It is important to me that a writer peeks my interest in the first chapter of the book and The Husband's Secret did that.  I found myself wanting to read more and more to find out just what that &#34;secret&#34; was.  The ending was speculation and the characters in the book would never know what really caused the events which in a way was disappointing.  It was easy to identify with each character.  I would recommend this book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Where are you men of courage? One of the most powerfully and spiritually moving pictures a man can watch. I challenge any man to watch this movie. I'm sure I'm not the only one. In my case, it did more than just stir me. I was stirred to action. I now have custody of my two teenage kids because of the message in this movie. I have a God given responsibility to lead my family and I will. We moved to Albany about a year later and decided to check out the church, Sherwood Baptist. They really do walk the walk. They were never in this for the money, but for the message. I really hope they make another one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's such a addicting and fun game! I find myself playing this free game alot! For the price of nothing I think it's great. I recommend you get this app! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I heard about this game at work and was told everyone was playing. I can see why. Its fun and kind of addicting. its my new favorite!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game was so happy when it was finally offered for the kindle. What I would love to know is what happens to all the extra moves that your friend sends you that you never get to use.
B00825921I|3.0|I am really enjoying Jamaica Inn. I am enjoying the struggle of a young girl against her evil uncle and ineffectual aunt. I would definitely recommend it to other readers.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This book is well written and exposes various nuclear issues.  This is more appropriate today as we have had one General and one Admiral removed from control of nuclear weapons.  There are morale issues among the groups responsible for nuclear weapons.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazon prime is the best. i got season 3 of Downton Abbey for free because of having Amazon Prime. It is well worth the $70 per year and use it all the time. Season 3 is great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is like crack. Love it! Could do away with the tickets or go longer between levels. They are crazy challenging and keep you coming back for more.
B00E3I3KDE|5.0|Love all of the new songs (this disc is more upbeat, fun, great running tunes!) except I was pretty annoyed I had to spend 18.00 to get these 10 new songs when I already spent 13.00 last year to get the original disc.
B000I9X67M|4.0|Cute movie ... but what I love about it is the drum line &#34;duel&#34; at the end.  I bet I've watched that a hundred times.!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|There are no words to express how this book has already changed my life. Thank you! Totally enriched by reading the secret.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|It was absolutely hilarious! The entire family loved it!  It is a must see for everyone.  My children walk around quoting the movie.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Couldn't put it down and I'm already reading her next one. Had never read any of Kate Morton's novels but definitely a fan.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This film is rich in visual detail. You will enjoy watching it many times, and each time you will see something new, and this something new will add a new layer to the story. This also happens with the dialog, which at first listen is quite ordinary. On closer inspection, it too is full of nuance and humor. The big-name stars who appear in this film play characters who hint at their stereotypical character type but who are likeable for their quality as average folks. This is a great movie.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I just finished my speed read of ALLEGIANT & am in awe at the emotional punch that Veronica brought to the final book in the Divergent series. While I had expected it to be awesome - as based on my love of the first 2 books - I hadn't expected to feel so emotionally exhausted by the ending. BRAVO!!!
0679805273|5.0|I cannot adequately express how much I love this book. It's a wonderful graduation gift to my students and I read it to my classes at the end of every school year. Just, wonderful. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it but it's addictive because you only get 5 lives at a time and the boards can seem impossible.
B005MMY9A8|2.0|If you are looking for a movie that has lots of action with a very predictable plot, watch this movie. I can't believe Anthony Hopkins agreed to work in this film.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|In spite of dealing with some tough issues this was still a light and entertaining read that will have you laughing and crying at different points.  In the end the book left me feeling inspired.
B007HACDLK|5.0|All the action and excellent story writing we are all accustomed to in the Mitch Rapp series, with the requisite plot turns and some well developed new characters.
6305428042|4.0|This is just the greatest Halloween movie ever.  Ever. This should be shown on loop every Halloween the same way that &#34;A Christmas Story&#34; plays all day on Christmas Eve, or &#34;The Ten Commandments&#34; runs endlessly on Easter. You know this, I know this, at this point I'm just stating a fact we're all aware of. Buy this movie.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I've tried other calculators and this is the tried and true, easy-to-use, good basic calculator I come back to for quick figuring every time.  Had it for well over a year now, and it functions perfectly, never had a glitch, crash, or problem.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|It captures the emotions of battered women, and how they deal with trusting another human being.  Also in such a  small community there was so much love.  I enjoyed it.
B008B37C8Q|5.0|I just needed to make sure that it was the 1968 version instead of the 80s version, and it was.  Good buy.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|4.25-4.5 stars<br /><br />As Abby, a fairly wholesome looking girl,and her best friend, America, start their first year in college, Abby meets Travis Maddox, who happens to be the cousin and roommate to America's new boyfriend, Shepley. Due to the dorm's boiler giving out (and after losing a bet), Abby & America end up staying at Travis & Shepley's apartment for a month. Abby finds herself falling for Travis even though she knows she shouldn't since he's the school's walking one-night-stand and he appears to be everything from her past that she's trying to leave behind. Even though I am not big on underground fighting, I wanted to read this book anyway. I had heard MANY good things about it. The fighting wasn't that big a part of the book anyway so, it was all good. The part that bothered me the most was Abby's 'flip flopping' feelings for Travis. I was SO annoyed with her instant (and constant) 'change of heart' that I almost didn't want to finish the book but I loved Travis enough to keep reading. I have to admit, it was kind of hard to keep up with Travis' feelings in this book as well so it helped me to keep my irritation of Abby's uncertainty in check. All in all, It ended up being a very good read.<br /><br />****<br /><br />POV ... first person (single)<br /><br />stand alone or series... stand alone BUT has a 'companion book' (Walking Disaster)<br /><br />would I recommend it ... yes<br /><br />did it give me a book hangover... slight<br /><br />would I read it again ... yes
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game forever! love it! berry addictive and fun!  I am happy its finaly on amazon
0441172717|5.0|All universes are real, but some are more real than others. For example, those of Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS, Tad Williams' OTHERLAND, Edgar Rice Burroughs' TARZAN, Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer's RIVERWORLD...and the universe of Frank Herbert's DUNE.<br /><br />Dune is an ugly planet, mostly desert, with islands of barren rock. But it yields the most valuable commodity known. A psychotropic spice, used by some as a drug, but valued more highly as a necessity for interstellar travel. As natives and resources often are, on Dune they are exploited. It provides a convenient element of plot, and it is an invitation for a hero. Someone who will fight that exploitation. Someone who may be the prophesied messiah....<br /><br />Though written almost a half-century ago, DUNE still holds together well. But all art is a work in progress, and readers should be willing to make mental revisions. The author helps in that regard. Intelligent machines have been banned for centuries. So it is plausible that characters do not use computers.<br /><br />More releases are planned. For the chronological order of the 17 mainstream Dune novels that exist as I write, go here: http://www.amazon.com/Dune-Saga-Chronological-Order/lm/1COADLEGRZEOC . These Dune novels form one of the better science fiction series ever. But most of them are co-authored by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, who have received some undeservedly low review ratings. In his later books, Frank had the bad, boring habit of inserting commentary that was unessential to the story. Nevertheless, for maximum effect, all the books should be read.<br /><br />You do not NEED to read them in chronological order, but it is best. It helps to make the Dune universe real.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Thick, solid construction.  Comfortable handle.  Needed a multi-purpose knife that will stand up to abuse, cut wood and last... I think this one fits the bill.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A really wonderful piece of fiction. At times either heartbreaking or uplifting, sometimes both at once! My eleven-year-old read it and told me that I would really enjoy it - he was right.
B003M70O5O|5.0|My husband has been watching this show for a while, but I never thought I would.  I was wrong.  I watched the first season on prime and instantly became hooked.  Watched every episode in less than 2 weeks!  LOVE IT!!!
B00CKQ1092|5.0|The Dillinger Escape Plan were a band I didn't really understand in the beginning, but once I sat down to really listen to them, they grew on me in a big way. Every album they've put out has been fantastic and this one is no different. From the chaotic ricochet riffs to the Faith No More-esque songs, this album does not disappoint.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|PJ Back at it again. Another rockin' album full of great tunes. This band never lets us down; always a few surprises with each album!
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|This is a very funny movie about baseball and a team that has been a loser for a lot of years and now is going for  it all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing this game and would recommend it. Some of the levels are really hard and you stay on them forever.
0316187208|5.0|It's like a spaghetti western with swords.<br /><br />Story:<br />After returning home to her farm, headstrong Shy South and her hulking but sullen step-father Lamb, discover that they've been raided.  With their farm burned to the ground, and the children missing, they set off to hunt down the kidnappers.  The party eventually teams up with a wagon train of desperate prospectors as they trek across the plains searching for gold in them thar hills.  Their adventure takes them across a wild frontier full of natives, mercenaries, the inquisition, and betrayers.  A few characters from the First Law Trilogy return and it's great to see them.  There are some twists and turns and people get what's coming to them.<br /><br />World:<br />The world is similar to the old west, but the characters carry swords instead of guns.  Gunpowder and a cannon type weapon are introduced in this book and there's no magic.  With the themes of natives, a gold rush, wagon trains, a small dirt-water town, it feels more like a western, than a fantasy book.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Shy South is hard as nails, enjoys a good drink, and can negotiate a banker to tears.<br />Temple is a man of many talents, but his cowardice holds him back.<br />Dab Sweet is a legendary scout far past his prime.<br />Lamb is a shy giant of a man, who avoids confrontation... until pushed too far.<br />The characters are all fun to read and they play off of each other with witty dialogue and dry humor.<br /><br />Writing Style:<br />Joe Abercrombie is known for his gritty writing style, bloody violence, dark humor, and not-so happy endings.  Everything in this book is dirty, dusty, covered in puke, blood, or excrement.  But that's just the way it is on the frontier.  The action is extremely violent and bloody.  The humor is dry.  And at times, the story takes an unexpected turn away from things that are predictable and climactic, to throw the reader a curve ball.<br /><br />Action:<br />This book has less action than the other Abercrombie books, but there are raids, horseback battles, brawls, duels, and skirmishes.  The action is bloody and there's a bit of gore.  It's well written and you feel the characters struggle, the impact of the blades, and the injuries afterwards.<br /><br />Maturity: Adult<br />There's sex, swearing, adult themes, drinking, puking, killing, beating, decapitating, dismembering, and downright ornery characters.<br /><br />Overall:<br />This is a very good book.  The pace is uneven, but when there isn't any action, it's enjoyable to read the characters interacting with each other.  The action is violent.  The dialogue is funny.  The humor is dark.  The setting is right out of the gold rush.  The characters are shockingly ruthless... but true to their motives.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Joe Abercrombie's books, you'll like this one, even though it's much more western than medieval fantasy.  If you haven't read the First Law Trilogy, just know that you'll get a lot more out of this book if you read that first.  It's not completely necessary, but it helps!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!  Have been waiting for the Kindle version since the other one came out.  So glad you finally did it!
B000N5F6OW|4.0|Well shot adventure in that time. It's more close to real life than the latest computer generated movies. Relive that time and Enjoy it once before it's gone.
B000VYX8PE|3.0|Doesn't really strike me as a kid's book. Too many death threats and insinuations of harm to children for my taste.
B0012FHPXW|5.0|The vocals are almost haunting (in a good way).  I love the music and really don't know what else to type about this album.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Cute song. High quality recording. The song downloaded fast and still kept its high quality. I'm glad I downloaded this song.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love this game Sweet the minions are so cute. make some more levels. please.  I can notwait for the second. movie to come out. thanks
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|Very well done, true story Helen Hunt was fantastic. She was very believable in this roll. It was good enough to watch again.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|This was the first Die Hard movie that my wife watched and she enjoyed it, but it isn't near as good as the prior movies.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|I had no expectation for this movie other than the star billing. The movie was well done--kept my interest and was entertaining.<br />Gave opportunity for watcher to think through sub-plots and the end was great!<br />I like movies where everything is not laid out for the viewer--so we have to think about what is actually going on.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|Had this about 4 months now and I like it.<br />This little processor was better than I expected. Low power usage and good performance. I combined this with an MSI Motherboard, Corsair Vengeance Blue Ram, and Windows 7 64 bit Operating System, Seagate 6 Gb/s hard drive (See below for detailed parts).<br />Windows Experience Index shows 5.9 for total of system combined, but that's due to Hard Drive scoring only 5.9. I have the 6Gb/s Sata Drive but 5.9 is the highest score you can get for standard hard drive. The processor score is 6.2, Ram is 7.3, Graphics is 6.6, Gaming Graphics is 6.6, and Hard Drive is 5.9. Them are the scores on my system. This system works very well for me.<br />Note, After installing windows, be sure to properly install motherboard driver from CD that came with motherboard. If you get a score of 1.0, Reinstall board drivers. Now I have performance and saving on power bill too.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Why did Matthew have to die?  I know, I know, but the whole thing was so upsetting.  Just hope the deveiopers of the show will find someone equally as easy to like as he was.
B009F1DIOK|5.0|These three movies should go down as an old school epic. The undertaking was huge and it paid off big time. Longtime reader of the series and for the most part can't complain.
B00CHMBQRA|3.0|A cross between Bourne and Safe House.<br />Good fast paced action--predictable at times but not overdone.<br />Entertaining but not heart stopping.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|I hate that they tried to tape a Sci-Fi movie onto a coming of age father son story. The Science Fiction part of the movie is laughable, my children can write more believable stories. Many others have mentioned the glaring flaws in the story and I'm convinced that this was probably not a Sci-Fi movie to begin with but had those elements grafted on in an effort to attract that audience. Overall not a great movie.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|I loved reading this book so much that I put it down so as to extend the entrancement. The description of the 1880 goldfields is so vivid that I was transported there.  I so enjoyed the characterisations and interwoven plot.  Hooray for kindle. Reading a paper version of the 900 odd pages would have not been so much fun.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|I realize that the majority of the viewership was female, but this male LOVES this series. The quick wit and dialog is FANTASTIC!!! I miss this show and still watch the whole series about once a year.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Just wanted to post a review for this. It works well. I haven't had any problems with it. I downloaded it cause sometimes you need it and it was the first to come up.
0786948523|5.0|I love it, and I also bought the Player's Handbook, I've already got another version, and this one is for better reference.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I learned, I enjoyed. What more can one ask of a book? I'd recommend it highly.
B00F880BWG|5.0|You have to watch it from the first episode, but there is no better show on tv today. With the type of ratings it gets there can be no doubt.
B002JVWR9U|1.0|Received this is horrible condition, case and CDs. Also I received it in blu-ray, and I don't have a blu-ray player so I had to send it back.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love Sci-fi and this show fits the bill..  This is one of the best shows ever.  It has drama a love intetest and sci-fi, what more could you want.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a book that was hard to out down. I recommend the book to lovers of crime mysteries. It also would be appealing to those who enjoy stories about the legal system.
B003VDX6N6|5.0|Great show, but not one you can pick up in the middle. You'll want to watch it from episode one.
B006M4F67A|5.0|We like this for variety.  We play it in bed at night before we go to sleep.  Helps to clear our mind of daily things.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|One of the best Filesystem explorers that I ever had used.<br />Flexible, extensive, complete, easy to use and full of options.
B003L20IJW|5.0|This a wonderful movie with Emma Thompson, turning misbehaved children into caring helpful ones through consequences of their actions. Granted these are created by Nanny McFee, but it is a nice &#34;backup&#34; to the real world of consequences! My grandkids and I really really like this fun movie!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|If you are a trekie or enjoyed the first movie in this new Star Trek franchise then you should enjoy  this movie. It is rare that the previews don't give away too much, but in this case the previews gave away nothing.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This simple but challenging exercise in prediction is a great mind relaxer and makes time fly.  The images may not really relate to the background but it doesn't matter.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is just what I was looking for in a calculator. It is easy to use with all the basics.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Compelling and detailed, this book is an eye-opener to the inside workings of the Air Force, the Strategic Air Command, the DOD, and the government during a crucial time in the history of our country.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Fantastic movie!!!! The actors have down pat the mannerism and characteristics of the original cast. Great story, great acting, and great pacing!!!
0634022296|4.0|The content is great, but the book itself is some kind of hard to use, you can't open and check all the info in it
140006922X|5.0|As with many students over many decades I would give Reza Aslan and A+ for his excellent work.<br />I read the book thoroughly together with all of the end notes.<br />In spite of the A+ I would strongly differ with some of Reza's opinions.<br /><br />Jesus was not a radical Jewish nationalist. He was a radical Jewish internationalist.<br />Two swords do not make an armed revolution.<br />The Palm Sunday March was a demonstration in the manner of Gandhi and Martin Luther King.<br />His experience with the Syrophoenician woman was an example of his Socratic style and his<br />affirmation of his international mission.<br />The cleansing of the Temple was not a quasi-military action.<br />The people in his home town of Nazareth almost killed him because of his internationalist<br />position.<br /><br />The Kingdom of God was definitely sought on this earth...as it is in Heaven.<br />The Kingdom of God is the antithesis of Empire.<br />with a preferential option for the poor, a profound concern for those in mourning,<br />the triumph of the gentle, the merciful, those who work for peace, the single-minded,<br />and those who struggle for justice as they feed, the hungry, clothe the naked, give drink to the<br />thirsty, care for the sick and the imprisoned.<br /><br />In response to the opinions expressed by Reza Aslan, I offer two of my books:<br /><br />\\"IMAGINE NO RELIGION\\" AND \\"GUERRILLAS OF PEACE; LIBERATION THEOLOGY AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REVOLUTION.\\"<br /><br />Blase Bonpane, BA, Philosophy; MA,Religious Education; MA,Divinity; MA, Latin America, Georgetown University; Ph.D, Social Science, University of California, Irvine.
B00DMKFN34|5.0|We weren't sure whether or not our daughter was going to be ready for a theater experience (she's two).  But when we would watch Car (which at the time had become her favorite movie), she was always fascinated by the helicopter and the plane and she has loved planes since she was young and saw them at the airport.  So, we decided to chance it and take her to see Planes in the theaters.  She was very hesitant heading into the theater (I think since it was dark) even though we had been playing up the experience for several days.  But once the movie started, she sat forward the entire time and wouldn't stop yelling excitedly (thankfully the theater only had other families with small children and not movie reviewers with a chip on their shoulder).<br /><br />Yes, it is not Pixar's finest storyline, but who cares.  When I see the excitement in my daughter during the movie and when she asks if we can go again right after, that's all that matters to me.
B00CL50KDY|2.0|We got through the movie, but I wish we would have rented it instead of buying it. Not a horrible movie, but far from good too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush plus I like playing on my kindle better than my cell phone because it's bigger and more fun
B004EBZX6W|4.0|It provides great information and it is easy to pickup and use.  I would recommend it if you want to know more about what is going on with your WIFI environment..
B007EC27QM|5.0|Works for me. Basic calculations. I like the feature it stores your calculations in steps to refer back to it.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I first read the one star ratings.  Now I'm not qualified to compare ONCE with Dream Theater & Symphony X (from my perusal of their tunes), but it seems to me their sounds are distinctly different.  Nightwish with Tarja's operatic voice really take the best of both worlds, both opera & metal to create a new hybrid, almost as if the sum is greater than the parts.  The contrast of vocals kind of reminded me of Jesus Christ Superstar, another great production.  Nightwish & Tarja's performance are best caught live in their \\"Live at the Lowlands\\" full concert from 2005 (found only on-line and not for sale).
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am very happy to see it on Kindle fire HD. I am figuring it out as I go, because the instructions are quite limited and really need to be much more informative
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I finished it but I found it long at time. It is also hard to believe. Mr. Grish has written better books.
B0006JGFNQ|3.0|I got what I expected for the most part.  For the price, I thought the &#34;singing and dancing&#34; would be more than what it was. My son likes it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Love it. Good action and story line. Caution, you may get addicted to the show. Nice to see good production in tv shows.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It works both as a sequel, and a stand alone story. The way King weaves in. The AA sublet really flushes out the main character. It's a fast moving story, with interestingcharacters, and wetting knish. As a King fan since Carrie came out in the 70s, I can say this fits ineith dome of his best work.
B003G4W49C|5.0|We forget too quickly what it was like to be children when we become adults and succumb to the mundane and unimaginative expectations of society. Orson reopened my eyes and memories of the quick, imaginative and adaptive mind of children.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|Fun until the mandatory update shut the whole app down, since then endless loop to purchase the free app page
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I didnt hate it. The movie really isnt great, but its not a bad thing to put on when you need some filler in the backround. Im sure the younger crowd would go for it too.
B00EF9339M|5.0|This book really helps in many facets. It helps one understand the mind and how it works in getting things done. It also tells how to overcome obstacles
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Any one of the national lampoon vacation movies are awesome!! I would say Christmas and Vegas vacation are the best ones though!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Such a beautiful rendition of a Dr. Seuss classic. A must buy for the little ones. It would make a great gift as well.
B007EC27QM|5.0|very handy on my Kindle. love the large screen for these old eyes. I use it to balance my checkbook each morning over coffee.
1891252089|5.0|Very clear concise information!  Would recommend this book to anyone who is practicing or wanting to teach yoga.  The pictures help a lot too!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished reading this incredible book. I have never been so into a book like this one. I read a lot too. I don't want to ruin anything for you so just take my advice and get this book NOW!
B008EL25LE|4.0|The quality of the graphics is better than Askend 1, but when you are going to find the images clues is more hard than before, anyway is a great game!
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|Its not as good as the first one, but it is better than the second one. Its worth watching it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved it!!! Thought Steven King got a little too creepy for me, so haven't read him for a while. I was told about this book and downloaded it on my Kindle.Wow!!Was I glad I did!!
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|Is a good game for play a little If you're bored, you need to look the scene for a long time to get all misteries.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews of this song because it has a hard beat, great sound and fun to dance to. While I like &#34;Roar,&#34; it's a little boring compared to this, with much higher energy and tone.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|For the price you can not beat this deal. This movie is a must see and is sure to get you rolling on the floor laughing! Defiantly not kid appropriate movie, but great for the adults! Highly recommend!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I can only say that is the best keyboard application for Android :) It makes my life better saving me a lot of time.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|this movie is inspring and everyone should watch it at least once. the actors were amazing and inspiring :-) purchase!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I only paid about $9 for this movie, and for a Disney movie that's great! This movie brings back great childhood memories and i highly recommend this to anybody looking for a new Disney movie to watch!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited to finally have this on my kindle. Easier to see than my phone and not as bulky as my laptop.
B008DVJOG4|5.0|Always love getting Celine's cds just good music and her singing it so good nobody like her I've ever heard before
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book goes into the reasons why Wheat (the new Dwarf Stalk Big Headed Type) is destroying health in America and all over the world. It is not about sinister plots, but the results of unintended consequences.  It is a scary book to ready when you discover that 80% of the wheat grown in the world is this &#34;New Dwarf type.  It generates huge insulin output and results in weight gain, joint problems, intestinal problems and many more issues from celiac disease to heart problems.  This was an eye opening read that explains a lot about the massive obesity problems in our society.......and now emerging countries who are graduating to wheat base diets from rice and more primative grains.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|Nikita  has  been a favorite  of  mine  since this  first season .  Shes  a  kick ass  secret  agent  that went  against  her bosses and  now tries to  stop them no matter what the cost  .  Maggie  Q  is awesome  as the sleek  but dangerous  Nikita !  If you  like  quick  paced action and  a good  storyline thats easy to follow  .  Check it out  !
B00D8RYV52|4.0|highly recommend! !<br /> my 4 year old loves this game!<br />if you are Dr. panda lovers this game is a must!
B004XZR63M|1.0|There have been many reviews of this book that have adequately detailed its flaws. The flaws of the writer and in some of his theory. I give it one star because the author does inspire the reader to think. However, any real substance is lacking, and I would wager he has made more on selling sentiment and cliche in this book than he has in any other venture has has engaged in. To sum up the book, Be a salesman! Operate on the edge of what is ethical, telling yourself that you are benefiting society, and people who devote there time to an employer or as an employee are just a little less than you, and it makes it OK to take advantage of there work. Yeah, that about covers it!
0895260131|4.0|The  book  is just as  I expected  .  I feel  as  though  by reading  books like this  ,  they will  help  me  in my  debates  with  fellow  associates  on how  this  religion  is  not as its  being  projected  by the  media  !!
039916409X|5.0|It's refreshing to read about meeting the issue of not enough money, which is a common lament, head-on. Many coaches or teachers like to gloss over or couch struggles around money with &#34;spiritually correct&#34; terms such as &#34;prosperity&#34; or &#34;abundance.&#34; But author, success coach, and business consultant Margaret Lynch says quite frankly that addressing abundance or prosperity is not the same as addressing emotions around money. And if you want to use tapping to increase your wealth, which requires activating negative and positive unconscious beliefs and feelings around money, then you have to be specific.<br /><br />Tapping Into Wealth is an excellent addition to the field of information about tapping, providing both tools and a mentor. It is well thought out, well written, practical, and insightful. Reading it and following Lynch's tapping scripts, augmented by access to online videos, teaches how to harness the power of tapping, recognize and clear the blocks or fears, and succeed in key areas of life.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Once again the director has surpassed my expectations.  What a fantastic movie.  Give the other directors something to gloat about.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|I love this movie, I am a huge fan of Horror movies I give this a huge A+ :) The fact that this is a true story makes this even more awesome !
B0014JIFWG|5.0|The Bistro Crocs are all I wear in restaurants. I have worked front of house Fine Dining for a long time and they look nice and my feet dont kill me at the end of the day.
034580404X|5.0|I got this for my friend Evie, here are her words:  \\"I loved the narration of this book.  It made me feel like I was right there.  I liked the description of each character in the book.  I liked the banter between Ana and Christian.  It was very catchy and very intellectual.  I read all three books in great detail and I just want more of this (please, please, please!)!  The author has done such a great job.  I couldn't ask for a better book.  I'm hoping the movie's actors will fit the descriptions in the book as I already have them in my head.  There must be more than meets the eye with Christian growing with his family and he must have a lot more to say.  Thanks to the author for all the hard work.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I found the characters to be annoying and the ending implausible. Would not waste any time watching this even when bored. .. it won't help.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I was never that much of a Pink Floyd fan, but since I'm SO fascinated by the whole 'inner workings, thoughts, & decisions' that go into making classic albums - this did not disappoint! You really get more of an appreciation for the songs, the album, & the band!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it but I don't like it because I can't get unlimited money it is not fare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! now lut  me
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I love every creepy crawly minute of this series.  I missed it on TV due to the time it aired, so was glad to get it on DVD where i can enjoy it again and again.  Jessica Lange is superb.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great acting and story lines, bringing today's stories to life in the court room in a different Chicago political way.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I really like this and all the other flipping games.  I wish there was a way to mark tiles as spaces without actually breaking them or revealing mistakes.  But all in all good game
0399159347|1.0|I did not enjoy this book at all.  I felt I knew the end from just about the very beginning. I did not enjoy any of the characters.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek has never been better. This new take on the old characters is priceless. The effects are gorgeous and the storyline is fantastic.
1932735410|5.0|This book was awesome, I passed the exam and this book really helped me to focus on key topics. This book is well written and easy to understand
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Creepy, twisted, too much fun.  I really enjoyed Jessica Lange and Evan Peters in this.  The plots & twists and sickness of it all was great.
B0014JLYS8|2.0|Although they say men's 11, these are much narrower than other crocs bistros. Also, the heel cup doesn't seem as deep.
B006PAV1XO|3.0|Made me laugh but the dialogue and hard transitions need work. Storyline is a typical of a coming of age/love story
1612183956|2.0|So much happens in this book it's hard to keep track.  The beginning is strong, but it fizzles out & gets a little silly.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|works ok on my kindle fire. but the file size is 13megs. also runs ads . I don't want apps that go online. who knows what 13megs of programming code are doing.  I. uninstalled it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have been waiting for MONTHS for this book to come out. Then it came..... IT IS AWFUL! All she does is reuse the same plot setup about 3 times in the same book! Then, she kills TRIS! Dead. Gone. I cannot possibly list all of the faults in this book but my advice to you is that if you loved the first 2 books, stop there! Just leave it alone and accept it. I don't know how the book even got published. Very upset.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I love this CD.  I can't help but sing along to every song.  Any child of the 80's would enjoy it.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Thank you, thank you Paul!  Your New album is just awesome. I cant believe that after almost 50 years since the opening of I Saw Her Standing There in 1962....you are still here making beautiful music for the world to hear and love. Thank you Paul!!!  Your NEW album is one of your many, many best!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is one of the best books i have ever read!!! its amazing,and full of awesomeness! 3 cheers for Suzanne Collins! :)
1416550550|4.0|My first experience with Morton and I enjoyed it very much.  It's a heafty read, but it's never dull.  It flows very nice between past & present.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Y'all really need to have game modes like the computer as In game mode 0 and 1 so we can make an awesome world and then change it to survival
B00E0SX118|5.0|Great family movie. My husband and I enjoyed watching it with our kids. Touching father daughter story line. Very funny.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone dealing with an Alzheimer's patient or loved one with dementia. The findings of the book astounded me! I wish I had known this nine years ago when I was taking care of my dad who had this disease. It's too late for him, but not for me. I have sworn to do whatever I can to not go down that path myself and this book is my lifeline. I am extremely grateful to Dr. Perlmutter for writing it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|SK has written a masterful sequel. Bringing us up to date on Dan Torrance and his mother from &#34;The Shining&#34;.  Be aware, it follows the novel's ending, not the movie's. Well paced and constantly entertaining. Another SK gem.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The content is a little dry, and slow paced.  But it really provides an interesting look on a 'Zombie War' and how that would play out in modern times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded this for my young son. He loves it. I can hardly keep him off it. I bought him a few more pounds worth of tokens some days after downloading the app.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|I picked this up so I could get good footage with the go pro while diving.<br /><br />I found that the filter traps water bubbles upon entry or from the regulator, and that can spoil footage. I had to manually fix the filter by popping it off under water and tapping the air bubbles off. Otherwise it worked fine. The retention string can also float up and get in the way, but that also can be manually rectified.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|My father has been a huge Pink Martini fan for years, and a few years ago, we started following them when they were in Washington or Oregon. I've been to about 7 shows in the past few years, and I LOVE them! This album does not disappoint. So glad I pre-ordered it!
B004LQJPEG|5.0|Cinematography and directing at its best.  Great acting by Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider.  A drug-bust thriller that ties the continents together.
B00FEN000S|5.0|This movie is simply amazing! Lots of actions and giant ass robots! What's not to love?! I own three seprerate copies of it.
006202406X|1.0|SPOILERS BELOW! I was so so so excited for this book. I adored the first two, and stayed up all night to devour this one because I so desperately wanted Tris, after all her sacrifice and pain, to find resolution. After being inside her head for three books, routing for her, suffering with her, and loving her character, it was excruciating to have her die such a meaningless death. And then to see Tobias suffer and live in a world that Tris fought for without her. It was too much. So much heartbreak and disappointment. Tris fought long and hard and she deserved to see the new world that emerged because of her consistent bravery. She'd earned it, and we, as loyal readers, deserved a better ending too!
B00B19G01C|5.0|Good for a weekend at home. I would definitely recommend this movie and I'm glad I didn't watch it in theaters.
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|The problem with people who create apps like this is they assume that everybody knows what they know. This app is way too difficult for anyone starting brain challenges like this one.  do me a favor, dumb it down for us dummies. :-)<br /><br />peter
B00000DI06|5.0|Good recording.  Purchased to get the Requiem.  We will be singing this with the Virginia Choral Society next spring.  No problems getting it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never watched this series on television but always wanted to.  It's great to be able to watch an episode at my leisure.
B008EKMB82|5.0|A Tale for the Time Being was a runner up of the Man Booker Prize 2013, and it is easy to see why it was shortlisted for the award. It is hopping with literary life, ideas, techniques, voices and personae, as well as with definitive views on history, ethics,suicide, personal responsibility, quantum physics and Schr&ouml;dinger's cat.<br />It begins with a beguilingly seductive Edgar Allan Poe technique, that of discovering a set of manuscripts the sea washes up. While the author/detective unwinds the story, and her own, we become so involved with the fictional magic Ozeki exhibits, we forget to remember that she never explains how the manuscript ever got to sea in the first place. Within the context of the novel, this missing fact is never revealed, because we have been hooked on the magic of fictional creation. We are hoodwinked and do not mind.<br />We figure out how ghosts appear when required, just as they obligingly do in Haruki Murakami's fiction. We read the history of the training for kamikaze pilots in WWII, we ponder the pain and horror of &#34;ijime&#34;, the bullying described in a Japanese high school.  We learn of the spiritual practice and discipline required to become a Zen Buddhist nun, discover the extraordinary chansonniere Barbara, whose haunting song &#34;Le mal de vivre&#34; becomes the anthem of the text.<br />We are presented with ethical conundrums of various kinds:  the ethics of kamikaze pilots and their trainers, that of the 9/11 suicide bombers. We accompany  the weapons technologist who wishes to create an interface to his creations, so users are not seduced by the beauty of the technology, and remember that theirs is not a game but an ethical choice with life and death consequences.<br />The voice of Nao, the sixteen year old diarist is irresistible. Her American voice, her slang and her language make her come alive in this her painful Bildungsroman.<br />As with all fine fiction, with the pain and suffering, the disturbing elements oftragedy, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, 9/11, WWII and kamikaze pilots, the interplay of languages, ideas and cultures,  this is a great multilayered novel that we time beings can enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I recently replaced my lap top with my Kindle Fire and was so sad that I couldn't play Candy Crush any longer. It felt like Christmas morning when I woke up to the ad on my home screen. Let the finger sliding begin!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|the 1 thing that just did not seem right is that Elizabeth had a meltdown on the day the adoption. and the story really hinged on that
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|But I could not put this book down. I love the characters, the story, everything. I am the eighties. You must read this. I can see our future actually going there.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have always used cables, adapters and it is not comfortable and it watches awful. With google chrome I solved it. Excellent signal, no cables, high resolution... Cannot ask more!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|With an all-star cast, a fast-paced plot, and a witty script, it had my rapt attention the whole time. I rented it on Amazon's Instant service. Will be buying.
B005XUC398|1.0|In the first 20 minutes, which is as far as we got, almost nothing happened and the dialogue was overfilled with one four-letter word that seemed mostly out of place.  The boring characters just repeated that word over and over.  Definitely a total waste of time.
075669812X|5.0|We bought this for our 10 year old grandson.  He was very excited to receive it.  It was too expensive in our local stores so I checked it out on Amazon and was happy with the price.  Happy Grandma, Happy Grandson. :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Gets better each season. I really enjoy how they tie historical events into the plot line. It is a fantastic show.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This series was going downhill from Book number 5 &#34;Dead as a doornail&#34;. What a lame finale for a book that started out so well.
0060254920|5.0|The book was in good condition..better than expected. The cover had a small warp in it, but every page looked great.  Thanks!
B000JPRPAO|3.0|It is worth watching but is predictable in many spots. No major plot twists and direction is okay. Unrealistic in parts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg I have been waiting for this game forever!!! I play this game on my computer!!!! This is my most favorite computer game in the world!!! The level I am on is 117, and it is hard. The level my dad is on is level 147. Thanks Amazon for finally getting ccs (candy crush saga) on the kindled. :) I am one happy customer!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time. If you like Sudoku, you will enjoy this game. There are plenty of puzzles to choose from with multiple difficulties.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Liked this book very much. Read it in 2 1/2 days! Could not put it down! Still not sure what all the craziness about these books is! I will definitely be finishing the series!!!!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very interesting book. Recommend.  Let's you see into the past and what life would have been like as a slave and also<br />The limited control and freedom a woman would have had much like the slaves.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I am a big fan of her lyrics and powerful voice.  I have also been able to see her perform in concert, and have to say she can get the crowd excited about her music as well as anyone.<br /><br />This album contains her most well known early song &#34;Love Song&#34;, which I consider a classic.  While I do actually enjoy the polish of her more recent songs/albums, I also enjoy the selection on this album.  Full of energy and great lyrics, it is easy to see the foundation of a great musician already in place with this album.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Award winning drama that holds your attention start to finish.<br />Fast delivery from Amazon at a fair price. Good pick.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|simply a classic.. i could watch this over and over again and still not get bored with it! best movie ever
B0083Z614S|5.0|Just as good as I remembered from my childhood. A story that should be required for all school aged children.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Fun movie.  Lots of action. Ok for the family to watch.  Good cast of stars. Great series for super hero.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome so far. so happy on the kindle. Finally I guess everyone demanded to have this. it is addicting. Yeah!!!!!!
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|I think I would have liked this game much better if I felt like I had gotten the hang of how to play it. I know how to play solitaire but this seemed a little different. As I said in the title, the addition of the gopher and golf into the solitaire game is not to some people's preference. The game could have been helped by having a good explanation of how to play.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I love their harmonies,  and the energy they project. They have a great beat too. Waiting to buy their volume II.
B000FC11A6|5.0|While Stephenson's later books are tenderer and a little more well-knit, this is still a terrific romp.  I am in the stage of fandom where I go back and read all the early stuff because he can't write the new fast enough to suit me.<br /><br />The only thing bad about Neal's books are that his style requires such a huge investment in research (unless he just knows everything out of his head - doesn't seem possible) that he can't write enough books.  He needs to clone himself, and then assign one of him to George RR Martin.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I think it's a Very entertaining show.  I now it's not the most realistic show ever created, but for pure entertainment it's great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twists and turns and kept me on the edge of my seat. Couldn't put it down. Would recommend to everyone.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|A snappy imaginative novel for children!  Just in time for the upcoming winter weather! Children will get a kick out of this bedtime story! The illustrations add so much to the book as well! One that the little ones will ask you to reread!
B00ADS90EQ|4.0|Nice to see a movie that the main focus is not nudity/sex and still can make you smile and laugh!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read!  Couldn't put it down. Would have hoped for a different ending, though.  Could relate to the characters and what they were going through
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is good to get your reflexive going good and good for visualization skills I recamend this game for everyone 6 and up. Hope u like it as much as I did
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can be very challenging at times.  A warning to those who get easily frustrated though.  If you expect to breeze through this game, don't play this game.  Some of the levels can be a little hard.  Make that very hard.  I got stuck on level 65 for a month.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|Too violent and not a good idea to put into people's heads .  Felt compassion for the main character but wouldn't recommend it to others
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to see this game on the kindle. Due to injury I have not been on computer much so having this on kindle is great.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|She is always wonderful and I know that her CD&#34;s will be remarkable!  A mimimun of words to like a produce is stupid!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I absolutely love it, it is addicting. would highly recommend this game for everyone and anyyone. can play this game for hours.
B00ECLU346|4.0|Missed them so much, I couldn't wait until they did it again. Once again they did not let us down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for Candy Crush to arrive on Kindle. So much better on bigger screen. My 8 yr old daughter can now play her own game.
B005LAIIGW|1.0|Gravity has scenes of peril that are incredibly repetitive and fairly predictable.  There are several scenes with debris crashing into the vessel and a fire starts on the ship: like that has never been done before.  The main character becomes delusional but in the end makes a snap decision to ensure survival.  Is that not the premise of most space thrillers in which people are stuck in space?<br />The only reason why such a rendition of this age old story works for Gravity is due to the heroine not actually being a heroine but an incompetent and suicidal woman who has not yet completely given up on life.  In a nonchalant delivery; back story and character development is given in which viewers learn Bulluck's character never passed her flight simulator, has a lost child, has no loved ones, but holds a doctorate.  Presumably, a doctorate is all that is needed to make into space for this film.  Because very early in the story it is revealed that Bulluck's character does not follow orders and is very unobservant of her peers.  This is where the film's logic completely is swept away for competent viewers would question how did Bulluck's character ever get cleared to go on the mission?  In real life Bulluck's character never would have been allowed to go due to: employer's notes of incompetency during her training, disregard for orders, and a psych eval stating she's suicidal.<br />And why after over a decade of viewing strong competent females from sci-fi/fantasy films/TV including: The Matrix, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Stargate SG-1, and The Hunger Games; are viewers presented with a female lead that is incompetent, unobservant, and suicidal???<br />Because the writers and produces practice Misogyny?  That is the only reasonable explanation because competent writers and producers would have realized that in the year 2013: women should be competent, pensive, observant, and independent.  And those writers/producers would realize that the story and perils ofGravity are so illogical that only a stupid, self hating, person could be the star: it should have been the male character portrayed by George Clooney.<br />Gravity is a slap in the face to viewers expecting a good, logical, and probable story that caters to the ideals of gender equality.  For those who want to see the same story of Gravity but delivered in a much better manner: watch the Stargate SG-1 episode: \\"Grace.\\"<br />And for those who want to watch a good space movie that is based of true events: watch Apollo 13.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|A movie you will want to watch over and over. I loved  everything about this movie.  The ending will blow you away and everything from the beginning to end will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fantastic!  Couldn't put it down. Amazing character development. I had never read The Shining and decided to pick it up. So glad I did!  Both books were outstanding!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So much better than the first one!!! Lots more suspense and plot to the book. Can't wait to read the next one
B003U69IX6|4.0|What a new spin on a history lesson. Great family movie for all.  This could actually learn just a little bit of mythology here.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|works fine with netflix and youtube, but most tvs already have those apps preinstalled (smart tv) nowadays. needs to work with more apps to become indispensable. good value if you dont have smart tv i guess.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Am so excited to see this is finally available on the kindle fire.  I am addicted to this game!!  Now they just need to get Farm heroes saga and pet rescue saga and I will be set
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Perfect romance, perfect love story, perfect family story. Fell in love with the movie.  Loved the characters, loved the storyline, loved the ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app, simple to use and love how it shows the workings!No annoying ads to contend with either! . .
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I am so excited that this is finally available on the kindle fire.  Love this game now just need to get Pet rescue saga and farm heroes saga
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I love how it was a perfect family movie. Just enough for the kids and left enough story lines to fly over their heads to crack up the adults
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a superb storyteller... rich, detailed, evocative. He portrays Afghanistan in an honest, harrowing light. It's a rich read... his best book yet!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for new levels. Very fun and challenging. Good way to relax. Like that there is no time limit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use if for grading papers in my second grade class.  It is simple easy to use and no hassle from ads.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The higher the level of play the harder it gets and is a challenge.<br />Run out lives much to quickly!
B002RI9TB4|5.0|Dreadfully tragic and beautifully written. I remember the starvation in Biafra in the news but it was so far away. And so we go on saying that, the Sudan, Syria .... We have to take some responsibility for each other but also stop corruption first as all our help can end up on someone's black market.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this I spend a couple of hours going through the food and drink, crafts, and home, these are my favorites
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It really makes you think. I think on some of the rooms they should have hints. But really need to update because I went through the rooms fast.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I give  it a 5. It takes a lot of common sense to solve each floor, not to mention good for analysis and logic. I hope there will be  more floors to come.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|The calculator is super duper wack!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's super duper wack!!!!!!!!$$$$. I wish u could just talk into it that would be better.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|It's a good game but I don't like how you have to wait to play more matches. Otherwise I like the controls and game play
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game on my phone for quite a while and really have enjoyed it. This Kindle version is WONDERFUL!  I say I'm not addicted to the game but this version could change that!  I don't ordinarily rate apps but this is worth a 5. Download it and let the fun begin!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this game, but I just wish that there were less in-game purchases that you need to make.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|so i dont know ill keep trying ill let u all know so that way u can see for yourselfs
B00G32QIEG|5.0|GREAT cast fun story.  Fast paced enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.  I rented the standard definition version and it was flawless.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Love James Rollins! The research done for this book was amazing. So relevant to our GMO food problem today. I especially like how he weaves his stories with historical overtones. Will probably read this one again.
B008BQ8YHQ|1.0|Disappointed by the language and sex. Will not continue watching this season any longer. Enjoyed no commercials and having access to complete season.
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|As a mother of a bilingual child and a bilingual speech-language pathologist I cannot say enough good things about this book!<br /><br />What you can expect from this book is organized practical ideas on developing a plan for your child/children to be bilingual. Many books and articles focus on why being bilingual is important. While Ms. Bourgogne addresses those issues, the bulk of the book is on practical ideas to give your children the necessary exposure to become bilingual.<br /><br />She starts by breaking down for the reader that as parent you set your own bilingualism goals for your child. Maybe you just want them to at least understand a second language, or you may want them to be fluent and biliterate in both languages. Once you have a goal she has a plethora of ideas on how to achieve that goal.<br /><br />You may have questions such as \\"when do you start exposing your child to a second language? What is the best way to do it? Although there are no right and wrong ways, Ms. Bourgogne  will expose you to the many different ways you can do it. Whether you are monolingual parents raising bilingual children, expats, a couple planning an international adoption, a trilingual family, maybe a single parent trying to raise a bilingual child. She has specific and practical ideas for each of these situations.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite aspect of this book is that Ms. Bourgogne actually includes names of websites for international book swapping, or international magazine subscriptions. As a parent one of my biggest goals is biliteracy and I loved getting ideas on how to encourage my child to learn to read and write in our home language.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book to have if you are planning to raise bilingual children, if you are already raising bilingual children and I think it would also make a great baby shower present!!!<br /><br />Disclaimer: This book was given to me by the author in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own
B009APMNB0|5.0|I run a business, and do a lot of graphics work.  I also do photo editing and video recording, and need good color coordination between monitors.  I use 3 to 4 monitors, and it always frustrated me that one \\"perfect\\" colored photo would look \\"off\\" on a different monitor.  This little tool fixed all of that, and synced all of my monitors to the same (true) color.<br />It was super easy to use (simply insert the CD into your drive, access it and auto run it...)  Plug in the counter weighted mouse-sized tool to a USB and place it on the monitor within the guided lines.  It ran automatically (upon \\"start\\") and you can move between monitors until all monitors are correctly synced.<br /><br />I'm really thrilled with this.  I know I'd have paid a LOT more at Best Buy (the last time I priced it, it was well over 100 bucks for the cheapest model).  Amazon, this is a keeper :)
B0089LOG02|5.0|Although a fiction story, this book had quite a bit of history of a time most of us don't think about.  Was fast reading and very enjoyable.  Anyone who has a little interest in any kind of history would enjoy this book.
0385743564|5.0|Mr. Sanderson's writing has 3 key qualities:<br /><br />1)  Really Clear Writing<br />  No pages of esoteric descriptions, the story is immediately understood and moves.<br />  You can picture his word mentally very well.<br />2)  Novel Creativity<br />  He has a way of creating something new yet feeling as if you are familiar with it.<br />3)  Clean Classical Sci Fi<br />  Doesn't kill your favorite characters or have xxx papered all over for cheeky sales<br /><br />His characters, dialogue and interplay are adequate and he continues to improve at them, which is in my opinion his only weakness as a writer.  Namely the characters, while distinct in description and personality, are not as original in dialogue.  Or to be more to the point, their deviations from each other appear forced and not natural.<br /><br />Sanderson's writing to me has great plots, excellent plot development, superb endings, good character development, good enough characters, and average character dialogue.<br /><br />In the order of his other novels, I'd place this books quality as third after:<br />1. Way Of Kings<br />2. Mistborn: The Final Empire<br />3. SteelHeart<br /><br />I try and find inconsistencies in his stories.  For example, the city is plunged into darkness, so all the plants die.  But lichen grows on imported rocks.  Can lichen grow without sunlight?  I don't think so, since it's 1/2 a photosynthetic organism.  If I'm wrong, correct me.  However, that was the only one that struck me in the entire novel, and dead lichen can cling a looong time on a rock, so maybe it's not inconsistent at all seen in that light. (like the pun?)<br /><br />I'm dearly waiting for his second Storm Archive novel, but if he's going to get sidetracked by other novel ideas (another!), which is frustrating, this one was worth the delay!
B00ARF92HK|2.0|I knew it would be violent, but my wife and I couldn't make it through the first half hour. Gratuitous.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I know that movies rarely resemble the book -- but this movies should not have even been named World War Z.  There was absolutely NO build, no beginning, no end --- just one big, flat middle!
B00CSSRPGY|1.0|I made the mistake of listening to only one sample before purchasing this. Most of the songs are so stylized they are difficult to even to listen to. Give me one of my Chet Baker's albums instead of this mockery. Sometimes I surprise myself by the mistakes I make, but this is one of those to learn from: Know what  you are buying before you pay for it.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Love this show and how they keep it going and keep it exciting, I will never understand -- but I will love every minute of it -- and do!
0375869026|5.0|A friend at work read this book for her book club.  She always tells me what they are reading and sometimes I am glad that I DON'T HAVE TO read the assignment.  (lol!)  But I am SO GLAD she told me about this book.<br /><br />I checked it out from the local library as an ebook.  I read it and loved it so much that I ordered the hardback from amazon to give to an 11 year old girl who is having a birthday this week.<br /><br />There is so much good to learn from this book for a child, and many adults can use the reminder as well.<br />I may end up having to order the kindle version for myself, as I can see myself wanting to read this one again.  Normally I do not buy books for myself, as I read too much and there is no way I can afford to buy all the books that I read.  But when something special comes along... sometimes I just have to have it to keep forever.  I think that may be the case with this book... it made me laugh and cry.<br /><br />THANKS to the author for this fantastic book.
B00BKRON5K|4.0|A little too much scientific information, but interesting. Now to find out if the weight loss theory works. Not having any problems eliminating bread/ grain or other complex carbs.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is an entertaining game, with simplicity and challenge in good balance.  I understand how it has received its &quot;addictive&quot; reputation, but the time outs are annoying enough to cause it to lose one star.  I get tired of being asked to buy options at every turn.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I was hopeful that such a large name in movies would have produced a better Zombie movie, but alas I was wrong.<br /><br />I think the YouTube Honesty Trailer really covers a lot of reasons this movie fails to make its mark.<br /><br />Too much luck going on here took away the possibility of this being a reality which detracted from it's enjoyment.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|This movie was like a combination of movie icons from Godzilla, Real Steel and Robot Jox brought into a slightly futuristic technology. The show is about an alien invasion that is coming through a rift in the Pacific Ocean.  The alien is cloning dinosaur sized monsters with the intent to take over and loot the planets resources. Humanity unites and builds giant human-controlled robots to counter the attack and try to save Earth. These robots are humanity's last stand. This sounds simplistic but if you enjoy these type of movies, the action is much more complex. The detail of the robots and the monster's are well done. The pace and action kept the show moving quickly.<br /><br />My family did enjoy this show, it kept us glued to our seats from the very beginning. This doesn't happen too often, Usually when we watch movies at home there are moments that are slow and we get up and move around and do other things until it catches our attention again. Shows that entertain and absorb attention fully are a rarity anymore. For us, it was fun two hours.
B00D2ZF24O|1.0|I think that someone thought the cinematics would make this a good movie:  They were wrong.  I think a better director may have made it better.<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br />Trying to put a reality spin against this I can't see a possible way that the star child in this movie would have made it in Ranger school with his level of anxiety issues.  It's like movies lately only overact so people can catch on.  I have to believe people are smarter than that and don't require this kind of over the top acting to get a simple point across.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love these movies and I could not pass up the excellent price for all these movies in Blu-ray.  Excellent Quality.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|We had over 1500 slides our father had taken as we grew up. I first checked on having them converted and found that a little expensive. I did a search and found this DBTech converter on Amazon for a very reasonible price. It took a while to learn how to set it up properly, but once it was set up it was easy to use. These slides were over 40 years old and after converting they looked as good as when they were taken. This product is well worth the price.
159463176X|3.0|I've noticed that other reviewers cut this author a lot of slack for contrived and emotionally manipulative plots, but I'm not that generous.  This book meanders hither and thither, all over the world, back and forth in time, and among characters that are sometimes loosely connected, at best.  There's too much going on here for me.  It's almost as though he didn't have enough material for the primary plot, and so he whisked in a few others.  The main story is that of the separation of two young siblings, which I think is a more heartbreaking storyline than the loss of a child.  Abdullah adores his young sister Pari, but their father allows a wealthy couple in Kabul to adopt Pari so that he can perhaps somehow manage to provide for the rest of his family in a small Afghan village.  The central question then is whether or not brother and sister will ever reunite.  Two of the other story lines involve young girls with medical issues.  Roshi has a cracked skull and gains the sympathy of two cousins, Timur and Idris, both of whom have the means to get her the neurosurgery that she needs.  Idris resents Timur and the flamboyant manner in which he makes known his many good works.  Timur's lack of humility, however, is of no consequence to those he helps; their gratitude is boundless.  I get it:  it's better to perform acts of kindness and brag about it than to do nothing at all.  The other girl is Thalia.  Her plight inspires Markos to abandon photography and pursue a career in plastic surgery, the spoils of which allow him to correct cleft palates in poverty-stricken areas.  The strongest image that I will take away from this book is that of a child horribly disfigured by a dog and whose mother can barely bring herself to look at her.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|With very few exceptions, we've all sung along to the Beatles at some time or other. It's hard not to. Their music is catchy, timeless, brilliant and unforgettable. Over the past half century, there have been countless interpretations of Lennon and McCartney's creations, but let's face it, there's no substitute for the real thing ... until now, that is.<br /><br />Sometimes, once every few decades, a musician comes along who, with his sheer skill and creative genius, is able to re-interpret the works of the old masters and turn them into something new, different and very very clever. Al Di Meola is just such a musician, and his latest album 'All Your Life (A Tribute to the Beatles)', is a superlative work of passion that could only be achieved by someone who has mastered his craft and can truly be called one of the greatest guitarist of all time along with Paco de Lucia, John McLaughlin, Jimi Hendrix and the late, great, Gary Moore.<br /><br />'All Your Life' is not simply an acoustic interpretation of Beatles music. It's a love affair with the guitar and its infinite complexities and possibilities. Anyone who has listened to Al Di Meola will know that his ability to move effortlessly between Spanish, Latin American, jazz (with its many flavours) and rock is legendary. With 'All Your Life', Al has combined them all to produce an album which can only be marvelled at. If you love the guitar and you appreciate music of the highest order (regardless of whether you like the Beatles or not), 'All Your Life (A Tribute to the Beatles)' by Al Di Meola is a must for your collection. The Beatles have never be interpreted like this before, and I doubt they will ever be again. My personal favourite is Eleanor Rigby, but don't let me influence you, listen for yourself. This album will blow your mind.
B000XXGMUQ|3.0|I normally wear a size 13 even in timberland but these seem to run a little large. Was afraid to exchange for 12 considering they may be to small. Who knows.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like this app.  It makes tracking my grocery spending easy while shopping, figuring tips or splitting checks when out to dinner.
B0046B4VXQ|3.0|I never saw it when it was new I was too scared. I hoped to prepare myself for the new Carrie movie but it won't help at all. Special effects are so much better now!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Playing this game gives me a tooth ache lmfao no seriously it just reminds me of bejeweled, which I absolutely loved, only this game kinda has a story line.I just don't know if the story ever ends
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this because I thought Iron Man 2 was dumb and boring.  However, Iron Man 3 is awesome!!!  Possibly even better than the original!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I liked Doctor Sleep. Enjoyed learning what happened after The Shining. Not quite as long or as descriptive as most King books. Characters moved in and out of the story pretty quickly. I'm always waiting for the next King novel. This one did not disappoint!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found this biography very interesting, having no background knowledge of Steve Jobs or Apple previously.  It details how Apple came about, his management style and dealings and his family. Recommended.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|The first novel of this genre I ever read was the Twighlight series. I loved the stories, got tired of the lengthy descriptions of angst, physical appearances of the heroes and heroines. I mean, alright already, Edward was a very good looking vampire, but do I have to read about it every time he enters the story? These books fortunately don't do that. They have a compelling story line. The heroes and villains are well characterized. I am enjoying the entire series.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|i thought it was very good. highly recommend it for losing weight and getting your blood sugar numbers down.it guides on what type foods to eat and when.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A good read for during those late night breastfeeding sessions. And I'm writing this because amazon requires so many words.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of Grishams best. Must read!!! I couldn't put it down! Well worth the money. Complex, fun, wild, edgy. Delicious.
B000JCSBU0|4.0|It all seems like fun and games in the beginning but spirals down, way down in the end. This one leaves you a bit shocked.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I was surprised at how good I thought the story was and the effects were really well done.  I think the movie is a good bookend to the original Wizard of Oz and can stand with it over time.  The 3D effects are definitely worth the purchase of the 3D version.  Enjoy!
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I like it because it because it's challenging, not for kids.  Use it or lose it, right?  Much better than another mindless zap the bubbles type game.
B001UAPVDU|5.0|The live performances included on this CD are very good! They are sung very well, I like the setting the songs have for them and how they sound live. Gaga is a great performer and singer.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Best movie I've seen in years.  The girlfriend picked this out at random from the rental store.<br />Neither of us knew anything about it.  That turned out to make it all the more enjoyable.<br />If I had been briefed on the story, I might of groaned &#34;french chick flick.&#34;  This is the best<br />french film I have seen since &#34;Coup De Torchon&#34; which came out decades ago.  Forget any<br />bias against french films and just get the dvd and watch a masterpiece.  And don't read the<br />spoiler reviews that give away too much of the story.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|There is something beautiful in the pictures included in this book, I love the high quality paper it is printed on. The book is HEAVY. And there's so many pictures, I really like it, it's artistic and makes an amazing gift for any Gaga fan. Also it can be used as a weapon because it's so heavy. The book has so many purposes, but I wouldn't recommend using it as a weapon because you may bend some of the pages or ruin the cover slip.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Totally enjoyed this book.  Hilarious.  Thnaks.  This was perfect.  Thanks so much for a great price and quality product -
B0086AYAQ6|5.0|Valentina Lisitsa set out to record in her Royal Albert Hall recital well known romantic piano pieces by well known classical composers. Even though these pieces were recorded many times over by other performers  they were all very well performed by her. The sound quality of the recording was excellent, much better than the numerous U tube videos she has made. For what she set out to do I give her a five star rating.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|It is fun to see musical film again.  It has many redolent and memorable songs from the past.  Would recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't know where the story was going to go but the ending felt a bit anti-climactic.  I felt like I had to analyze the whole series to really make any sense of why it ended this way.  For entertainment purposes, however, I did enjoy it.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Addicting yes, fun mildly, mostly it's tapping screen to pop algae or sand dollars to earn quantities to buy coral and plants for your reef.  There are mystery plants that use larger quantities of earned sand dollars and algae, yet they are RARE. They say it and mean it. You have to spend money to advance faster and I've done both ways it's actually more enjoyable without rushing and purchasing extra sand dollars and pearls and algae. I did notice without paying my rare plants are even rarer. Again mindless time wasting addicting game, yet strangely satisfying to build reef, be aware that money spent gives you better rare plants. Can be pricey for some.
B001F5M9MG|5.0|I grew up listening to these guys. They may be known by most for their rock, but their catalog is much more than just a few rock songs.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Love the book.  Much better than the movie.  An incredible story of love, faith and mutual respect.  Highly recommended.  If you read the book, the movie will disappoint you.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Sometimes when I watch a movie, I simply want pure entertainment--no complicated plot, no social commentary, and no political agenda.  As a science-fiction film, &#34;After Earth&#34; satisfied both my desire for fantasy and my curiosity about scientific possibilities.  Did it matter that Will Smith was not the star character?  No.  Was I thoroughly engaged by the story?  Yes.  What I enjoyed most about this movie is what I enjoy most about classical jazz:  straight, no chaser!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|If you love Niel Gaiman books (and I do) you will enjoy this book.  Not as good as American Gods, Neverwhere or Stardust but if you are a loyal fan, it is a must.
B00563K3DA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is a quick read and one that I will likely read again.  I have continued to ponder many aspects of this story and realize that I need to apply them in my own life.  Looking forward to the discussion of this book at my reading group next week.
B002ZP1STK|5.0|I have always loved music but August Rush took me into  a most exhilarating dimension  of sound which turned the entire everyday world into a musical  instrument. I can never look at the guitar the same way as before, including the one leaning on the wall behind me.I am excited by the thought that I, too,, can make magic.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have loved this show from the first episode. I am continually impressed by their story writing. They never rest on their laurels. This season is no exception to that rule. As a newcomer, I would be able to follow the story. As a long-time fan, I'm rewarded by ever deepening relationships, characters that change and grow, and the occasional 2 - 3 episode story arc that shakes up the cop-show paradigm.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|The vocalizations of this group are just amazing.  Their voices are beautiful and blend so wonderfully, you don't realize you are listening to a capella.  My only complaint is that the album is so short!  I want more!
B007SVPZMW|5.0|Cute game. Of course it's a no brainier but the graphics are cute. Good for a couple of plays in the dr office.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for months to play Candy crush on my Kindle. Finally been released to download! Having fun all week playing it!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I've always loved the Piano Guys' musical arrangements, so when I found out they were releasing a Christmas album I just had to get it! Certainly did not disappoint. I just finished listening to the entire album and it's just fantastic. If you're looking for pop-like radio music, this isn't it. It's almost entirely JUST musical instruments and no voice, which I love, but that's my preference. :)
0575024119|5.0|Bought this for my mother - she LOVES Daphne du Maurier and especially &#34;Frenchman's Creek&#34;. What a deal - 4 books for the price of one!
B00821OX98|3.0|Falling Skies is something that's less gruesome than Walking Dead and more interesting than Revolution (at least what I saw in the first season).  It has some of the Lost elements without the deeper layering of characters that I liked on Lost. I watch it on Amazon Prime - not all that excited about their offerings because they have less than Netflix- but it's definitely a good choice if you like sci-fi on a lazy evening after work.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I am so sorry they shutdown this show.  It was a good mixture of comedy, syfy and drama. The cast truly clicked!
B001NUO1HE|2.0|I was hoping for a movie packed with awesome diving scenes... we got a few but that was it.  Slightly disappointed.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I loved this book because it was very interesting it had many twists and turns I choses this rating because I love mystery book hope u love it to.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The story continues but I felt that it fizzled at the end. My least favorite of the three in this trilogy.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|Well I know this movie didnt get good reviews.  But I liked it.  I thought they both did a good job.  I liked the way Will Smith acted in this movie.  Hard core Ranger.  His son was good to.  The ending was easy to figure out, but I enjoyed watching it.  Watching the events unfold till the end.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A great show with top notch production values. The performances are consistently excellent. Suits continues to deliver the goods. Watch it!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I've always been a Stephen King fan, but , of late, I have thought the writing a bit weaker, the plots less interesting.  However, King scores a hit with this novel.  I won't give away plot details, but the Central figure is none other than Danny Torrance of The Shining.<br /><br />After a few looks back to time with his murderous father and sickly mom, we find that Danny is nothing but a fairly worthless drunk as an adult who will stoop to almost anything to get that next drink.  Then, due to his shining and a vision of another who is badly in need of his help, Dan must try to find his way.<br /><br />Because this is King, there are other beings involved here (not quite human), but they seem plausible enough.<br /><br />The dialogue is quick and crisp.  And the reader gets invested in many of the secondary characters, even a few of the &#34;evil&#34; ones.<br /><br />Tough to put down once you know where we're all headed--  if you like King, and good writing, get this one!
B00FKQ38OE|5.0|Paul McCartney is so upbeat and it's very infectious.<br />He never demands it, but people around him just can't help supporting him, enjoying what he does and sing along with him.  There is always a song in my heart and he put most of them in there.<br />Even his latest CD. I find myself humming a song, thinking of the words and then I realize it's from the new CD. How does he do that - make such memorable catchy songs? Is there a studied contrived science to it?<br />How can he just spontaneously create a melody that gets in your heart and mind and makes you happy?<br />The title song, New. is just lovely and finishes with beautiful vocal harmonies.<br />Still amazing after all these years.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It's really a perfect gift.I appreciate this calculator with the MEMORY function capability.<br />The original calculator on my Samsung S4 Live companion did not have a memory function.<br />Any way, I recommend this standard calculator to averyone.<br />Christian
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Just watched the entire series - loved it!!  It's fun and captivating.  The plot sounds silly but somehow they make it interesting.  I'm an atheist and if you had told me that I'd really enjoy a tv show which relies heavily on the Bible, I'd have thought you were crazy.  In this show it's more of a reference book.<br /><br />Love the actors. They manage to pull this plot off and they're really easy on the eyes.The sense of humor of the writers is truly enjoyable. Eg;  an angel gets injured and when you see his wings they're all damaged and scraggly.  Lots of things you have to look for and sometimes watch the episodes multiple times.<br /><br />It's gory but I don't mind that.  It's not for kids, imo.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Kind of a brainless movie...lots of noise and special effects.  Fun for a lazy day.  Won't need to see it again any time soon.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Welcome back the classic Stephen King novel.  I felt like I was welcoming an old friend.  More of the same please.
1568987846|5.0|This is a great book to peruse during some down-time during the day.  There's something so soothing and relaxing about looking through this grown-up picture book.  There's an enticing story behind the foundation of this book/blog, too - very cool!  I would recommend this to anyone who has an appreciation for photography, color, and art in general.  It's really the perfect book to keep out on a coffee table!
B008602KQI|3.0|Subject of movie was a bit disturbing, which made it hard to really hard to get into the plot.<br />The young actors played their roles well.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book was not what I was expecting and that turned out to be a-ok. I've never really read anything of the sci-fi or super hero genre before, but still was very impressed, as usual, with his writing. I'm generally a fantasy only kinda gal, but I can't wait for the next book in this series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting a long time to finally get this app on my Kindle.  Absolutely love it.Don't know anyone who hasn't tried it that isn't forever hooked.<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />Maddi
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|GET IT RIGHT NOW you will find it hard not to mention of it its awesome and the most important thing is that the game is challenging
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is totally amazing!  It is very hard to walk away from.  Just wish it was a little bit longer,,,but I am not quite to the end yet!  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good challenge!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it is sooooooooo much fun to read I finished it in about two days I recommend it for all kids that can read
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Classic lee child.  Not quite as good as some, but still an enjoyable read.  Jack r. You just gotta love.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is very fun and the video is even funnier I recommend it to a lot of peaple I promise you will love the game my kid will find the Kendal and take it from me and play this game for many hours
B000JMKQX0|2.0|My husband and I saw the movie and loved it! I didn't realize the book was nothing like the movie. The book was too disjointed and all over the place for me. Couldn't even finish reading it.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|A story like this makes you appreciate what we have. I could not bring myself to read a tale like this too often. Although it kept my interest it ripped my heart out at times
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Without spoiling the book for someone who hasn't read it yet, I'll just say that I love how this book told both sides of the story.<br />I would recommend it to a friend.
0307341577|5.0|Dark Places has so many twists. I never guessed what was comming next. This is a great page turner. I have recommend this book to everyone.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Nashville came out with a bang!<br />The music numbers are presented by captivating artists.<br />This isn't your old &#34;Tear In My Beer&#34; country twang; these artists are talented, and the songs are mellow, but powerful.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love and hate how they characterized the Districts, but it made sense, painful though it might be. I loved the books, and though there are always a few things that are not or can not be conveyed to the screen, I think they did an excellent job transposing this for the theaters. I will watch this over and over again.. until the next one comes out.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I love how this book was clean enough for my teenage daughter to read, and how it also grabs and holds your attention.<br />This is the first book by Sparks that I've read.<br />I read this book for a book club I'm in. When I was discussing it with another member of the club, we both agreed that the ending was too predictable during the climax of the story.<br />I still read on passionately, hoping that I hadn't guessed the outcome prematurely. Hoping I was wrong.<br />I still liked the book though, and I will give Sparks another chance, because I really want to like him more.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|It is difficult to follow the line of the story....movie is only based on visual effects. Not relevant to my taste.
B0060CXN2O|5.0|The Parent trap is and oldie but very good funny movie. Recommend to any and all age  groups. like the submarine  parts.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am way to addicted to this game. I really appreciate all the little touches that they put in each scene. However, I don't like that you are almost obligated to purchase coins/bananas to advance in the game. I do like the weekly contests even if some of them are a little ridiculous to meet.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|The one thing that stands out, is the awesome special effects. The main character grows into his captain's position and he saves<br />the planet at the end. How DirectTV only gave it 2.5 stars is beyond comprehension. Maybe they don't like veterans.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|the app is every bit as good as the game. the only downfall is, just like in the real game, it tries to force you to buy things. Lets see how far i can get before it makes me purchase something to move forward.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|I like scifi, but this didn't grab me.  I found myself mostly bored or at least getting up and doing something else.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I usually do not &#34;get into&#34; shows like this but after the first episode I was hooked. Not only was it entertaining but it was Family friendly on TV which was very unusual.  I look forward to the start of next season in January.  It was delightful and the characters were fully developed.
B001BANK32|5.0|I understand why Steven king was unhappy with the movie version of his novel. after seeing the movie and then reading the novel, the movie missed the major points of the novel. The movie concentrated on the &#34;horror&#34; points, while the novel delved into the phycological aspects of the main person,Jack.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen is yet an unappreciated writer. What?<br /><br />Yes, he's sold megatons, movie deals, etc., but when it comes to discussion of great American novelists, it's still wink-wink, nudge-nudge for this artist. Yes, he's not a dialogue master, nor has his character development yet reached the plateau of masterful, but when one considers story telling prose, I submit there is and has been none better.<br /><br />His latest is familiar, not because it's a sequel but because it follows form. Evil is half baked, but pure, and personal demons overcome to confront and eventually beat that Bad. Dan is an improvement in realized character, and it's plain King cares about him.<br /><br />But, read Stephen King to revisit that state of involvement
B00ECUARO8|5.0|McConaughey is great in this movie, another role that proves he is a serious actor.  The young actors that played Ellis and Neckbone were great and I hope they have futures in the business.  It was good storytelling.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I'm 53, but I was still moved by the honesty in this young adult book.  A very true description of the realities of poverty and the hopelessness that comes with it.
B000VSYDRM|1.0|This was a great movie up until the really confusing ending. The ending was so bad that it messed up the beginning of the movie which was excellent
B00E9PMML2|5.0|Love that all 6 discs come in one case so t hey  take up less room and make less mess.  Movies are the same as you remember.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This is a great classic for all children. I remember singing that song when I was a child. Now my son is singing the same song!
B009AP2G26|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!!!!! I am obsessed with Glee:) it's sooo awesome and makes me happy! Btw Klaine forever and always! yeah baby!
B001E6X4W0|5.0|Great movie, esp if u a brad pitt or tom cruise fan. Stoey of how certain vampires went through our history.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|it is the best why did you cancel it fox. if you are a star trek fan you will love
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I haven't read it yet so I have no idea. I've heard it's great though. I excited for the narrator to be death
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is as scary and thrilling as The Shining.  I am so glad Stephen King came out with this.  It completes a story (The Shining) that I wasn't even aware needed completion.  It's great :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow! The book took so many exciting turns, I couldn't put it down! Very dark and twisted at times, but I couldn't stop thinking about both characters! Definitely recommend.
1442362537|2.0|Says I would be able to play it on my computer. Played the first disk, but the 2nd disk did not play at all. very disappointed.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Hosseini is such a compelling writer! Some of the book was hard to get through, I more than once caught myself yelling at the book, but I couldn't put the book down, and at the end I'm glad I didn't. Easily one of my favorite books!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game and challenging. It keeps me thinking what moves I need to do to accomplish a goal. Even little kids can play and they enjoy the colors.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|This is the old version where the audio wasn't working properly. The new version can be bought here from Amazon<br />[[ASIN:B00FEXL4BM Madonna The MDNA Tour Blu ray]]<br />The sound is great. Some people complain about the \\"grain\\" in the video. They used a high-contrast on the video but the detail is great. Many movies go for the high-contrast (300) some people don't like it, some people don't mind it. It can always be adjusted for your own preference. I am surprised Amazon hasn't combined the links so people can more easily find the new fixed version. Instead people  may still be buying the defective version from other sellers.<br /><br />Buy the new version!
B005544TRQ|3.0|Started out as an  interesting series but then it just got old. Same story every week, just different characters. Has to be something better to watch.
B0018RE7DU|2.0|The movie was too slow moving.The acting in parts was just a step above amateurish. The story line was weak.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetle... This movie was a staple of my childhood and not much as changed. Michael Keaton for the win.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game and how I can interact with my friends to help them or they help me achieve the next level.
0399165274|5.0|A chilling yet captivating story.  A very good read.This book gives you some very good insights into how some things work in our nation's capitol.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Finally got this for kindle and was truly excited til I got to level 35 and found out I had to pay to go on.  I am so disappointed and wish I would have known b4 I downloaded it because I wouldn't have.<br /><br />Bad form King Games
B001EBWINQ|5.0|I can watch it over and over and never get bored.  The quality of the Amazon download through Prime is the best I've seen
B009RX85N0|5.0|I just love the Once upon a time series.  Each season just gets better and better.  I just love it!
B008XG1X18|2.0|The idea behind Pinterest is good, but I like instructions and patterns.  If you can create from pictures you'll be okay
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I was nervous for this album especially because I LOVED and still do love Teenage Dream, but I really DO like all of the songs! They are so varying in style and topic. Many just have an Earthy nostalgic feel.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I am a lover of Spider Solitaire and this is fun on my Kindle Fire 8.9 that I recently purchased.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Okay, I want to start off on how in love I was with the first two books. The characters were amazingly realistic and easy to relate to. Four and Tris were adorable together and I loved every scene including them. This book was a freaking waste of money and so heartbreaking. Never have I cried so much over an ending. I was left speechless and furious with the ending. Mrs. Roth was absolutely trying to kill her readers and make them hate her. I don `t think I`'ll ever read one of her novels again. Goodbye novellas from Four`s point of view. **SPOILER ALERT** Tris is shot and killed saving everyone else. Caleb should have died! The epilogue was atrocious and underdeveloped. The novel altogether was disappointingly repetitive and similar to Insurgent. Don`t read it if you don`t want your heart shattered to pieces. I would advise imagining your own ending to the series. Big waste of money. So disappointed. After months of anticipation we get this crappy excuse of a satisfying conclusion. Farewell Divergent!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad it's finally on the Appstore. My dad and my uncle and my friends have been playing it for ages and I would be the only one without candy crush. But here it is so yay!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a kindle fire, and this app has been missing, and I've really missed out. Now it's here, and I love it! It works really good, is super fun, and connects really easy to FB so I can play with friends. My 5yo son even likes playing it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This app is awesome! So awesome I can't describe it. Except for that it is add greer and fun. : )
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that I can play this on my Kindle.  I like having it on a bigger screen .  Love it
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game great graphics and fun to play.<br />I would recommend it for any hunting fan.<br />Don't miss out on the fun.
B0015416CG|5.0|I have loved this movie for years, and it stands up surprisingly well to the test of time.  While the fashions and technology are dated, all you have to do is explain it as happening in the past.  My 14 and 17 yo daughters thought it was a very good movie, although I had to explain that the years would have to be adjusted to make it work.  The action sequences are quite good, and the early part of the movie where the police don't believe the time-travel premise is completely believable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for making this app for the kindle fire I love this game so much lol and it's so fun!!!! Keep up the great work
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I like this watch because it looks good and it is not too bulky. This is my first automatic watch. I did some research and read some reviews on the watch. A few people had the complaint that the watch ran to slow or fast. I find that if I do a time check once a week the time is accurate.
1465414444|4.0|I really like the book it got plenty of already known information about the lore of the World of Warcraft, but also contained some new information that even brought an experienced lore nerd like myself to a great read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't play it.  My wife has just learned to play and she loves it. She has been losing a lot of sleep since she started to play Candy Crush.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Cover art was spot on.  Two versions of soul sacrifice!  But hey, music like food is a matter of taste. I'm playing it  as I type.
B003F48E4W|4.0|I had seen this years ago when it came out in theaters and I remembered that I liked it, so decided to watch it again.  It is definitely a bit creepy as vampire movies go, but Corey Haim and Corey Feldman really add great humor to this movie!  It is fun to watch and the plot is unique.  Worth watching!
1476734941|4.0|The suggestion inside is something that I can do long term and a lifestlye change.  I which I had this many years ago.  I have shared it with friends and they also think this is the best solution to losing weight without starving yourself.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is the second time I read this book because I was going to read his new one, &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; and wanted to re-read this one in preparation. I had forgotton some of the subtleties of the book and found it just as satisfying as when I first read it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I can play this game on Kindle.  Very addictive no matter the platform.  App works great.  Easy to access.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Asphalt is the best racing games on tablet that I've played. Gameloft delivers most every time with their games and this is not an exception. They don't overpower you with purchase add-ons, and work to make your experience with them the best. So I just got the update and now we'll see.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I ignored this game for a long time, then I noticed friends that should know better were playing.  I was surprised to find not only is it fun, it's addicting.  It's NOT at all a Bejeweled rip off, there are many levels with many different challenges that go way beyond Bejewelled.  Nor do you have to pay to pass levels - any of them can be passed with no extras. Some will take a lot of tries, but if I can do them with no help, anyone can.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Despite the weak script, I enjoyed all of the action of the 250 ft. Jaegars. The other dimensional creatures were interesting and so very reminiscent of Godzilla! Really fun to watch and draw analogies in other, earlier sci fi creature features. Worth watching again just for the sheer fun of it.
B0026772N8|3.0|I guess there was just too much that was arcane to me and I found myself bored through much of the read.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the storyline but the acting by Jaden Smith left me a bit unconvinced in his believability of experience. Perhaps I am being a bit hard on his character. I'm not sure that I would have reacted in any different manner at 15; I would have been food for the critters. . .  The CGI was great! Will Smith played a believable father.
B003B02PF4|3.0|Very good through most of the book, I felt the story fell apart in the final chapters and needed a  good rewrite of the ending.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great drama and storytelling. Excellent main characters. The stories can get a tad unbelievable, but that's OK because the series is highly entertaining. I think more people would be interested in taking a look at this series if it had a more appealing, seductive title. I love Archie Punjabi's character, Kalinda.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|excellent book. Love all of the intertwined characters .  Will definitely recommend this book to my friends they will love it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Use this to stream video from my computer and IPod to my home theater (110&#34; screen & projector)  Quick and easy setup and even came with 3 free months of netflix.  Great little device!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I read this book basically in one day, the book pulled all the characters together at the end which was very clever.  If you do not read it quickly though you may forget the characters they tend to switch thru out the book.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Love this movie- and I am going to Greece next summer -gets me in the mood for the trip. Scenery is so pretty.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm glad I was able to return my kindle book after reading the ending. This book is not worth its price.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This game starts out simple  and becomes pretty challenging. It requires some scanning and planning before starting a level, then fast (or leisurely) implementation. The graphics are cute.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I've always had problems with this app. Even with my last phone. The main thing, is that the map never loads. Get the free app, it works flawlessly!!
B00G32OER4|5.0|This was genuinely creepy. There were a few obvious gimmicky scares, such as sudden noises, but the overall atmosphere was still very effective. All of the characters did well, but Vera Farmiga was a standout scene stealer. I would highly recommend this film to horror movie fans or supernatarual affectionados.
B00F6JKT7O|4.0|A return to the Heartwork and Necrotisim era. Harmonizing guitars. Aggressive. Back to greatness, a solid album after a very long hiatus. Very glad they put this out.
B006M6NV0M|5.0|Certainly not a film for those who detest violence of any kind!  But, oh my goodness what fun these actors have in this action/good guy vs. bad guy/funny flick.  It's full tilt testosterone.
B001EX81ZI|5.0|This item works with the Avent Natural line. Be wary of other items, especially those posted pictures without the packing, as that makes it easier to tell what you're getting. There is another similar item, but those are for the Classic line.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I agree with others, patience will let you play free.  I'm enjoying this game very much and recommend to any one who enjoys HOGs.  Also includes a variety of puzzles. Truly a unique experience..
B00555X8OA|4.0|I came o this book after watching the Long-Now SALT presentation by the author. His work is important, particularly for those who are engaged heavily in human decison making. I found the book to be well written, not overly dense or academic, and the examples were poignant and topical. But, for all this, it is a long book and I suspect some readers will drop out along the way simply because the subject is not capturing enough of their attention.
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw this movie at the theatre but still want the DVD as the movie was so cool. Can't wait to see the part 2!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted! I would play morning, noon and night. This is a great game. I'm glad that it's finally available on kindle
1885167776|5.0|Very good book. I'm still digesting it. This would be especially good for any business owner or anyone striving to operate at peak performance.
B00ARF92HK|2.0|The fact that Dredd never takes his helmet off should tell you that this movie is all about the female Judge.  This movie could have been better but you never really feel like you are emotional connected with the main characters.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Ok, I love giant robots, and when I saw this movie I had a great time.  This movie is a lot of fun.  The special effects are great, the sound is fantastic, there is plenty of comedic relief, its just fun!  I pre-ordered it as I knew I was going to want it in my collection.  I have recommended it to several friends, however, they did not like it as much as I do.<br /><br />That said, it is a 'fun' movie, but not a 'good' movie.  It will not win any awards for its great script, or for performances.  A lot of people will not be interested, or will walk away from this, like my mom did.<br /><br />But if you are like me and love Neon Genesis Evangellion, and Gundam Wing, and pretty much anything with giant robots, then you will at least have a lot of fun watching this!
B004K4IZ54|4.0|Great film, a must have. Beautiful images although 3D stuff is not as stunning as you might expect. Still a great deal
B00DZHX7ZU|4.0|There are some very good tracks, some tracks you already have, and some other tracks that are not great (probably why they didn't end up on a normal album).<br /><br />This album is a smaller version of the giant b-side package that came out a few years ago.  If you are a big Pumpkins fan like me, then you should at least have this, and at most buy the giant b-side package.  There are a few good tracks here, and if you pick up the CD on sale then it is worth adding to your collection.  If you are not a crazy Pumpkins fan, then it is probably best to pass on this.<br /><br />Get their main releases first, buy this if you like everything else.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is what 3D was made for. Lots of action and explicit scenes. You never forget it is a 3d movie built to be 3d.
B0087240Z4|3.0|This album is ok, but definitely the last Pumpkins album I will buy.  This one is about as good as the last album, so not great.  There are a few catchy tracks here, but nothing like their old stuff.  I wish I had not bothered buying this CD or the last.  And I wish even more that they had not released it under the Pumpkins name, this should just be more Billy Corgan solo stuff.  As far as writing songs BC seems to be passed his prime in my opinion.  Some die-hard fans might get pissed at me for saying that, but I don't think anyone would disagree that this is not as good as the old stuff by far.<br /><br />I would recommend listening to it on a streaming service before buying it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|For novelist John Green, it seems as though the fourth novel is the charm. The Fault in Our Stars is the fourth book written by the author, and received by far the most positive public reaction of all of his books. The novel rose to #1 on the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble bestseller lists in June 2011. Quickly rising to the number one New York Times Best Seller, teens all over the nation became captivated by the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster, a teenager living with cancer.<br />Warning all readers! All emotions, from laughter to tears will be provoked while reading the story of Hazel. John Green manages to portray a sorrow-filled story in a humorous and thought-provoking way.<br />  Hazel Grace has the mind of a regular teenager; however her body is not as healthy as a typical one. Diagnosed with Stage 4 thyroid cancer at a young age of thirteen, along with tumors in her lungs, she has learned to live with treatments and the frightening life of a cancer patient. Phalanxifor, a new drug on the market, has kept her alive for four years. Now a seventeen year old, Hazel is forced to carry an oxygen tank around. Hazel is definitely not a typical teenager due to both her illness as well as her frighteningly morbid view on the world<br />  Green keeps the readers smiling through the perspective of witty Hazel. Both her brutal honesty and realistic view on life capture the reader from page one. As Hazel introduces herself, she describes her experience at a support group for teens with cancer which is \\"boring as hell\\". She explains that she \\"Didn't want to take the elevator, because taking the elevator is a Last Days activity at Support Group.\\" Hazel is able to depict such a morbid scene in a refreshing way that opens a door of comprehension into a world that all audiences may not otherwise understand.<br /> The true beauty of the story is when Augustus Waters, a happy-go-lucky survivor of cancer meets Hazel. A whole new kind of romance is introduced to the world of literature. Hazel and \\"Gus\\" immediately hit it off, and continue in a relationship of deep understanding. The book follows the plot of these two teenagers in love, and with a beautiful balance of dry humor, romance and thought-provoking perspectives on life, John Green draws the reader in, creating literature that will make a difference in lives of many young Americans.<br />  Green portrays a romance based on support in times of tragedy. It is hard not to melt over the true affection that Gus has for Hazel. The book shows the difficulty of loving someone who does not know how much time they have on this earth. The unconditional love that these two share in times of tragedy will captivate you. \\"I'll fight it. I'll fight it for you. Don't you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I'm okay. I'll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time.\\" Not only is this romance extremely meaningful, but the fact that both teens have survived cancer for so long provides life perspectives that provoke self-reflection. As Gus so perfectly and simply says, \\"The real heroes anyway aren't the people doing things; the real heroes are the people NOTICING things, paying attention.\\" All readers will be forced to think about life in a larger perspective, and notice the heartbreaking truth of love in a mortal world.<br />  To read this story is to have one's perspectives changed forever. This must-read has been called \\"a blend of melancholy, sweet, philosophical and funny\\" by The New York Times. It also states that the book \\"stays the course of tragic realism\\". It is impossible to put this unique book down. Once you do, the loving and thoughtful story of Hazel and Gus will stick with you for quite some time. A captivating and emotional read, The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best young adult novels in the market today.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game so glad it is finally available on my Kindle......thank you so much for hearing our calls for this game.
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|There is no question that 2012 proved to be a year of absolute sadness for Disco and dance music. The world lost Robin Gibb of The Bee Gees to cancer, and Donna Summer who silently suffered from cancer from the aftermath of 9/11. But if there is one thing Donna was able to excel with was a inferno of a remarkable voice and strength that proved to be remarkable and set the tone that so many artists of today look at music. But Donna was overlooked in reward as well in life as well, with a posthumous induction in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame that could've been done for her while she was still alive. Now a new dance collection of Donna's music is out remixed but not refined.<br /><br />Love To Love You Donna is a collection of some of her biggest hits remixed for a younger generation of Dance music lovers. Though it will appeal to the hardest core fans of Donna Summer as well, it won't actually appeal in the feeling of Donna in heart as it could. The album does include some good remixes including a well-built rendition of Love To You Baby, Dim The Lights and Love Is In Control (Finger On The Trigger.) The songs are fair, but do not ignite as good as the original songs had done for years. Not only that, but several of Donna Summers' classics were not remixed either, so it would turn off some of her fans without hearing a version of She Works Hard For The Money or No More Tears (Enough Is Enough) with the great Barbara Streisand either. It falls short of appealing universally that match past hits albums of Donna Summers' legacy that have worked well like The Journey: The Best Of Donna Summer that was released in 2003.<br /><br />Overall, what you do get with Love To Love You Donna is not exactly more than what you pay for in the dance. Her voice definitely flows with the best in divas that came out in the 70's. But this collection is not exactly a must buy for those new to Donna Summer in her voice and rhythm and heart. Dance remix collections can most likely be a miss as was the case with Pnau Vs. Elton John when they did Good Morning To The Night, set to Elton John's classics last year. That was a waste of money and time. This collection is mostly a split value for Donna Summer and her legacy in song.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C-<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Remastering & Remixing: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2-was the case with Pnau Vs.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|We ordered the goodle Chromcast with great anticipation that it would enable us to access programs on our TV. We were very disappointed that it did not work. Problem was that our TV was not HDMI capable. There was nothing in the information about Google Chromcast that informed us about this potential problem. Consequently we had to send the unit back and consider some other type of possibility.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is super awesome and fun. yeah, I guess you could say I love it so much, I am speechless.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|I purchased this doll for my 5 year old daughter, but not from Amazon.  She loves Barbies, Monster High dolls, and various other dolls.  She plays with Draculaura quite often and sometimes sleeps with this doll. The doll seems to be sturdy and durable.  Her outfit is cute, including her sleep mask and shoes, and the other Monster High dolls can fit into her clothes and vice versa.  The Dead Tired Draculaura I bought came with a book/magazine but that is all; there was no picture of an ice cream carton or anything else as shown here.  I have no complaints about this doll, nor does my daughter.  I will say this: the slippers/shoes can sometimes be difficult to get onto the doll's feet and you have to be somewhat forceful until the feet click into the shoes.  My 5 year old cannot do this on her own and needs assistance; however, an adult can get the slippers/shoes onto Draculaura's feet.  Overall, I think this is a great doll for the price and my daughter loves it.  I recommend it to any Monster High fan and will continue to purchase Monster High dolls for my daughter.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|This is by far the best game I've played on my kindle and I love it. It is very replayable and I have got to admitted the humor is edgy and fun. It is challenging without being frustrating. It is worth the $3 by far.
0385523394|4.0|Not finished yet but so far so great! What a great insight into a completely different world. Some are strong women who made mistakes and try to make the best of a bad situation. Piper feels their inner strength and finds the good. A great lesson learned.

B00156ZWV0|5.0|Just recently bought this boxed set after having read the reviews here.  In short, this is a fabulous collection.  Granted it would have been nice to have libretti, but for only $2 a CD I will not complain.  I have new versions of old favorites and new works I have never heard before.  This set is a treasure trove for someone new to RVW and for those of us who already have a VW collection there are still some wonderful gems to find.<br /><br />We can quibble about economics and the cost of printing texts.  We can grouse about the recording quality.  To be honest, I can look texts up on the Internet and my ear just isn't that fine to detect old versus new recordings.  What we have here is a set of 30 CDs for $2 per CD.  Take it or leave it.  I decided to take it and I'm glad I did.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|after Michael Myer's first attack on Laurie Strode (played again by Jamie Lee Curtis), \\"The Bogeyman\\" follows her to the hospital that same Halloween night to continue his reign of terror killing literally everyone as he makes his way to the one person He Came Home for...his baby sister. The only person standing in his way is Dr Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) who searches relentlessly for a way of destroying Michael once and for all.<br /><br />as for the the Blu-ray itself i must applaud Universal for doing such a good job not only restoring this classic for HD transfer, but also including for the 1st time ever newly remastered 5.1 audio. the Shout! Factory version only includes a Mono track. anyway the video quality is far better than the DVD counterpart that i've been watching all these years leaving me wonder what kind of crap have i been watching before? this version really stands out cause i've noticed certain things within the movie i never caught watching the crumby DVD version. the audio really stands out now a lot with the new 5.1 mix and really makes watching the film back to back with the original Halloween that much better!! the disc also comes with a ton of extra features that were never available on DVD either so you're definitely getting your money's worth and getting the better version of Halloween II on Blu-ray. sure you're not getting the extended T.V. cut with it but i think it's worth the sacrifice to get the Theatrical version with 5.1 audio. hope this review helps
B004N6369Y|2.0|I continue to buy Danielle Steele novels but have no idea why.  Her writing is pathetic now. Not only was this book poorly written, but it was also incredibly boring, predictable, and more importantly, pointless. I really miss her early work where she balanced tragedy and heart. I loved her earlier work. But I am officially done buying books.

B009YN2M7S|5.0|Read it! It was very good , :) five stars<br /><br />I am required to write more ... But there you have it a review
B000HT3P7E|2.0|I never watched this show while it was on TV.  I barely heard about it, and the few things I heard, such as its premise, didn't interest me, so I gave it a pass.  But then, so many people recommended it to me, I decided to give it a go on Netflix.<br /><br />So, I have to say, it was really, REALLY hard to get into it.  I mean, yes, the first season had some funny moments and interesting characters, but I found main character Ted Mosby to be so irritatingly unlikable that it turned me off all the time.  Whenever I started getting into the show the guy did something incredibly stupid, and not the kind of stupid thing that's funny, like what Friends' Joey Tribianni might do.  I'm talking about the kind of stupid thing  that makes you rage and despise the guy for being such an obnoxious jerk.<br /><br />The only time I found Ted likable was in the penultimate episode of the season, and it was only because they forced all the other characters into being even more unlikable jerks, so Ted turned out to be the only straight man in the episode.  It all changed in the last episode, in which the plot involves Ted wanting to get back with the girl he likes (Robin) by trying to make a rain dance in order to summon rain and prevent her from taking a flight.  I was already increasingly raging at the guy's egotistical ignoring of everyone else's feelings and his constant attempts to turn the tides of fate to his side without any care for what others wanted, so when he ACTUALLY made it rain and the episode treated that as a good thing, I said \\"That's it!  I'm through with this stupid show!\\"<br /><br />But then...<br /><br />The episode ended into sort of a cliffhanger.  Ted got to be with Robin despite the fact that he did not deserve it, but his best friend Marshall got abandoned by his fianc&eacute;e Lily, and I felt really sad for him, since he was the only character I felt sympathy for.  So I decided to give the second season a go, at least to see if there was some justice, the tables turned and the guy who really deserved to be happy (Marshall) got his happiness back.<br /><br />And something completely unexpected happened.  From season two on, the show was AMAZING.  Everything I hated from the first season was gone and everything I liked returned in droves.  Ted was no longer a jackass, Robin was no longer useless, and everone showed new interesting sides to them.  Heck, even that stupid rain dance scene was actually retconned to be just a coincidence in later seasons.  Plus, the show was now really FUNNY.  Season one had some laughs here and there, but rarely anything laugh-out-loud funny.  Since the first episode of season two, though, the show has been hilarious.<br /><br />I don't know what happened.  I don't know if the first season was written by someone else, or whomever wrote it realized it was crap and decided to make it all better later, but I can tell that every season I've watched non-stop since the first once (I'm at sixth right now) has been absolutely amazing and truly deserving of a 5-star rating.  So, I say, while it's impossible to ignore the first season if you intend to get the story, everything becomes much, much better later and it's worth to go through this rough start in order to get to the next, impeccable seasons.s turned and the guy who really deserved to be happy (Marshall) got his happiness back.<br /><br />And something completely unexpected happened.

0399230033|5.0|This book is one of Dolly's Imagination Library books and my son got it when he was about 15 months old. He's now 20 months and loves this book still. There are very few words, but the story is full from the pictures. My son loves practicing what Gorilla does with saying &#34;Shhhh,&#34; yawning by patting his open mouth, and giggling &#34;heee heee heee&#34; when Mrs. Zookeeper (as we call her) discovers him in her bed. His favorite part is identifying all the animals, the balloon, moon, keys, flashlight, Mr. Zookeeper and all the other details. He recognizes the animals in the book when shown real pictures (even the armadillo). He loves following the balloon as it makes its trip to the moon. Just a lovely story.

B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I wish there were more books like this. I happened to read this book at a major time of transition in my life and directly after I had read some plot-driven drivel. This was the perfect antidote to both of those things. Usually in reading books geared towards younger audiences the emphasis is on how flawless the silly characters' appearances are. Here I was so refreshed to have a main male character who was easy-going, friendly, and respectful. I immediately felt connected to the characters and their situations. They felt real. Like people that I could have been friends with in college.<br /><br />Further, I loved the style of Ms. Rowell's writing; never once did I feel like a piece of the book didn't fit. And having grown up in the Harry Potter generation, I really bonded with the fan-fiction aspects, even though I hadn't really encountered any fan-fic before this book.<br /><br />I cannot praise this book high enough. I am recommending it to all of my friends.
B000ICXQII|5.0|This movie is amazing in just about every way. james woods is a porn president who gets obsesses with a non pornographic video tape that literally moves. at one point he develops a slit on his stomach so you can put this highly addictive videodrome cassette directly in his chest. this movie is the 80's-est! this movie is really weird, but great. you may have never heard of it,  but if you enjoy dated,strange movies, then i encourage it!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This book is hard to review. On the one hand, I did like it. It was extremely well researched and the mythological/paranormal aspects of the book were very well developed and often unique. I was immediately sucked into the romance between Diana and Matthew and loved reading about their courtship in the steadily climbing action of the first half of the book.<br /><br />From there, I am really torn about the remainder of the story. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book. But I am not sure I will buy the second one. I would maybe consider getting it at the library. There were just so many little things in the plot that felt off. On the flip-side of the well-researched mythology is the fact that the concepts important to understanding the conflicts in the book are sometimes complicated and scientific. I found it hard to understand and like I had suddenly hopped into a research meeting that I wasn't prepared for. That aside, the courtship of Diana and Matthew that I found so riveting for the first half abruptly morphs into the second half of Twilight. Running away from bad guys. Suddenly completely in love and... married? It felt rushed and unnatural. And, on top of that the last quarter of the book felt like the third Lord of the Rings movie... there were so many times the book felt like it was ending, only to have another not-very-exciting series of events occur.<br /><br />My overall assessment is that this book is fun enough to justify buying. Just with the awareness that its not that different from the rest of the genre.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Thanks to Downey. Lots of boom boom, but I guess that is to be expected. And the other actors aren't bad at all.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Considering that this was taken from true events and having relatives that came over from europe, I truly enjoyed it!
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Best show ever!!! I love watching this series with family and friends. It's legendary!!! You must see it!!! Barney you rock!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like the complex of the game and trying to solve the puzzle so you can continue on to the next phase of the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't play games on my computers, tablets or I phones but my wife does. She has been waiting for candy crush to be made available on her kindle. Now that it is she's happy.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Ok movie. Action is good, the story line was decent too. Wasn't the best movie of the year but it's worth renting.
B001NZ3DY6|5.0|I had forgotten how wonderful she is.  I wish I could see her in Las Vegas the first 2 months of<br />2014!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My internal storage bar was almost maxed. I couldn't download any new apps or download anything in general. I looked online for others with the same problem, (completely full internal storage but barely anything taking space) and I found that this app had been a great success. Which it totally was! I went from 99% down to 40% in a matter of 20 seconds!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I think I would rather have paid for the game and not be interrupted all the time with the time outs and the selling of the &#34;helps&#34;.  I understand that is how they make money but I find it annoying.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This album is awesome it reminds me of a Beatle recording .I LOVE IT!!!!  It's so new & fresh evry song on it is great!!
0743496736|5.0|In Jodi Picoult's story Nineteen Minutes, she takes on a new form of writing that captivates the reader. She describes a tragic incident through the vantage points of every person affiliated with the shooting and shooter. In a quiet town in New Hampshire the unexpected happened. Ten high school students that attended Sterling High were murdered by their introverted peer, Peter Houghton. If you are someone that is interested in the controversial issue of guns and the mental health of society this book is a must read and if perhaps thriller and suspense do not do it for you, in this book it will.<br />Peter Houghton grew up being brutally bullied. The second he got on the bus for his first day of kindergarten the tormenting and teasing started. \\"Peter sank back into his seat. His face felt cold, but his ears were burning. He could hear the boy and his friends laughing, as loud as if it were happening in his own head\\" (Picoult 85). Unfortunately as he got older, the students did not mature, instead the bullying escalated to new levels. \\"But he could still picture it, even after the screen went blank...even after he started to cry\\" (19). This book paints such a vivid picture of what it feels like to be bullied causing the reader to sit on the emotional roller coaster with Peter. Her writing allows the reader to feel sympathy for someone who shot ten people truly demonstrating how this form of writing forces the reader to examine all sides of the story.<br />The shooting was scary and chaotic, but most of all realistic. At this point we are living in a society where incidents such as the shooting in this book are occurring often. Just recently last December there was a terrible massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Living it first hand and watching the news as it was unravelling and seeing the country's reaction to the event Jodi Picoult's version is very accurate. Except in the story the audience gets an insight into the history and feelings of each of the characters. It also illustrates the confusion our society faces about bullying and gun control and how no one knows where the line should be drawn for both issues, \\"A gun was nothing, really, without a person behind it\\"( 114).<br />Nineteen Minutes, published March 6, 2007, was voted number one on New York Times bestseller list and gained 4.5 stars out of 5 by Barnes & Noble. The author Jodi Picoult is an American writer. She has achieved many accomplishments in her career winning New England Book Seller award for fiction in 2003, and has 14 million copies of her books worldwide. Being a young author Jodi has a bright future ahead of her and luckily for reading fans more great stories to come!<br />This piece of literature is an amazing story that covers a subject that contains many varying perspectives in America. It gets to the core of the problems without being biased. This book is a 5 out 5, no matter what type of genre you favor this book will be interesting. This book will catch your attention and you will find yourself sitting up late hours trying to keep your eyes open just to find out the ending. If you are someone that has not yet given this book a try, I highly recommend it. I guarantee it will be a book that all readers will enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. Not only because the minions are adorable but it is very entertaining :) If tu are ever bored just play this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very happy it's finally on the kindle. Had to go to library to play candy crush saga.I enjoy playing just wish had more than just 5 at a time.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Leonardo  did not give this movie his best performance. His supporting actor in this movie did an excellent job and I am sure we will see him again. He put Leonardo to shame and I DO like Leonardo Dicaprio. I was so looking forward to this movie and can only give it a lukewarm because of Leonardo rather deficit acting. He just was not present in the character.
0385528787|4.0|In Oryx and Crake, we meet Jimmy (aka The Snowman), his friends the Crakers, and Oryx and Crake themselves.  In The Year of the Flood, we meet God's Gardeners and learn more about the waterless flood, a world-wide epidemic that wipes out nearly the entire human race.  In Maddaddam, Margaret Atwood completes her Maddaddam trilogy by bringing together the Crakers, the surviving God's Gardners, and the Maddaddamites, telling the story of their efforts to survive and preserve the human race, as radically different as it might turn out to be.<br /><br />As the so-called waterless flood recedes, so to speak, these few survivors, whose lives have intersected extensively, come together to form a new community of sorts.  The humans, some of whom worked for Crake, unknowingly assisting as he planned the release of the global virus, mix and mingle with the children of Crake.  The Crakers, genetically engineered to be the next step in human evolution, and whose lives had been lived completely in an isolated biosphere, have had no contact with technology and human culture.  As they learn and adapt to human ways, the humans see that the survival of human life may depend on the thriving of the Crakers.<br /><br />As with the first two books in this trilogy, the science is interesting, but frequently not very convincing, based more on fancy than science.  And the action of the story takes a back seat to the development of the characters and interactions of the groups.  The flashbacks, especially those of Zeb, whose brother Adam One founded God's Gardeners, shed more light on events before the waterless flood.<br /><br />Readers of the first two books in this trilogy will likely be thrilled with Maddaddam.  I would recommend that you read Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood before you pick up Maddaddam.  The series as a whole is intriguing, somewhat though-provoking, and memorable.<br /><br />Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!
B002OHRO2Y|5.0|I love the cartoon as much as the grand children. :) I would recommend this item to view together. It keeps you laughing.
B00BWJ91XK|3.0|While I appreciate bringing elements of the appendices of LOTR into the Hobbit movies, beginning with this one, this movie is misguided in vision and execution.  Trying to craft another Aragorn out of Thorin is silly and disingenuous to the spirit of the dwarves.  Making this more about Thorin and not Bilbo is also not in keeping with the core elements of this story.  And then, all those chase scenes!  There were too many, and they way, way were too long. I stopped watching the movie for awhile.  If this keeps up, this series of films will be reminescent of the second Star Wars series with the young Anakin - and that series was a disaster in story telling.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great mind challenge! bring on more levels! with every new room more interesting it becomes! I'm sure everyone will enjoy the challenge.
B000VEA38E|1.0|I do not think it is the CD, I think it is the recording.  This sound is awful and some of the tracks are corrupted. This is a waste.  I will probably wind up getting music from the individual movies at some point.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|Finally! A series that gives you the feel of what the Vikings may have lived like! The actors do an amazing job at making you feel like your really there! The writters and directors get it!!  I have always been a huge fan of this era!  Excited for hopefully many more seasons to come! A must have on your shelf at home!
B00CWV8X04|1.0|I made it about 20 minutes in to this movie and shut it off after realizing is was putting me to sleep.
0385737955|3.0|The Maze runner by James Dashner, is the 1st book in the a young adult Dystopian science fiction trilogy.  The story follows a 16 year old boy named Thomas who wakes up in a world called the Glade with memories of his past existence completely wiped out.  Within the Glade Thomas finds a community that  consist of only boys.  The Glade is at the center of a shifting maze and protected by walls that close every night to keep the creepy grievers from entering and causing chaos. Within the Glade the boys have crafted a world with rules and order to ensure survival. The runners are part of this community whose sole purpose is to map the maze in hopes of being able to to solve it and escape . One day after the Thomas' arrival to  the Glade a comatose girl also appears in the box with a very ominous message suddenly the world as they know it starts to change and the need for answers to their existence becomes more dire.<br /><br />The plot kept me entranced for most of the book, the characters were a little one dimensional, but likable enough specially Chunks,Tommy's sidekick.  I did want to slap the main character tommy a few times because he did act like an arrogant , know it all piece of Klunck, but he did redeemed himself a little at the end not a lot .  (just a little)<br /><br />The story captivated me and I kept turning the page just so that I could get answers. I wanted to know why, how, when WHy? Why? so I kept turning and turning the page and it kept getting more and more intriguing. and then like a ballon with a hole,  all the air came out and I was let with \\"what the hell\\" It had so much potential !<br /><br />Overall the story failed to deliver because once the questions where answered  it made me say really? what? really? What the ! but I still give it 3 kisses because the author developed a story that keeps you wanting to turn the page wanting to read faster so you can get to the page were all is reveled.  I was invested in the story for most of the book and I wanted to destroy those horrible, murders monsters called the grievers just as much as they did and I was running right along Tommy. But it all started to unravel until it just fell flat.<br /><br />For more book reviews like this please visit PattysKiss on YoutubeI wanted to destroy those horrible, murders monsters called the grievers just as much as they did and I was running right along Tommy.

B00F91SCXC|2.0|Thought the cast could pull this one off but no. I did make it to the end of the movie but felt like I wanted my rental fee returned. I can't remember when the movie industry decided it was a good move to shake the camera while filming but I wish they would stop. They spend all that $$ on movie sets and then you can't see them while watching. Not to mention they make the viewer sick...
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I do not write bad reviews but I had to do on this one. I loved the first two books; I could not WAIT for the third book....all the little novella books that came out...I bought them...but then this one...this book made be feel terrible,depressed and sad....I read to be happy: to get away from realism...to FORGET my issues...(I am a 53 years old)...I would not let my teenager read it....because of the other books I read I expected a different ending.....the blurb says: if you liked The Hunger Games..you would love this book.... I should have remembered I hated book 3 of The Hunger Games and would have forgone this terrible feeling....I requested a refund...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this for a long time and I'm not disappointed! Live that it synch's to my Facebook game so I can play without interruption on whatever device I choose! Thank you!
B00EU9VCKO|3.0|Gives you faux-old-timey looking photos. Has some decent filters. Interface is usable, personally do not like the camera interface. If you are really going to pay money for one of these programs, I recommend you check out Vignette, which produces better quality photos, and has a simplier camera interface (i.e. you launch the program and you go straight to camera mode).
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A sort-of sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;, &#34;sort-of&#34; meaning that this book makes sense even if you never read The Shining or saw the movie.  Stephen King returns to the kind of writing that made him the most prolific novelist of the mid to late 70's.  The character development in this book is tremendous, the story riveting, and, as always, King will have you on the edge of your chair until the very end.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have now completed the trilogy and see why everyone I knew loved this series.  It is written so well, the plot is so tight, it's unpredictable and well, just a fascinating group of reads.  Wish he had written more.  Even tho' it took me a while to get to them, so glad I did.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Another classicly great album from Motörhead. It's great from start to finish, even with a little breathing room from &#34;Lost woman blues&#34; and &#34;Dust and glass&#34;. Lots of grit and personality as well as FAST!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Was slow getting into but midway through you get what we have come to expect from Mr Martin. Can't wait for the next book.
0486237664|4.0|I like to do a lot of different animals in the things I do. This is a great help for Ideals and reference on those animals.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book had me since the beginning. Finished it in just 2 days. Great writing. If you are a sci-fi lover this book is a must!
B0060D3BWK|5.0|I downloaded this through Amazon Instant for my kids and I to watch together.  I've loved this movie since I was a kid!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very thought provoking and uplifting.  I especially liked the discussion of the brain function aspect and how it relates to near death experiences.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A great show can't wait until the next season is available! All episodes of all seasons are delightful! Heartwarming and heartbreaking is this season.
030758836X|5.0|It's rare that I find a book that I so look forward to reading. Gillian Flynn has done a masterful job of combining a riveting plot with great writing. It doesn't feel naive and it contains just the right amount of tension to keep things interesting. The story wasn't predictable and the ending was deliberately left open ended.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was easy to place yourself right in it. I have recommended it to many friends. It actually went too fast!
B002KJX4IE|4.0|Have always enjoyed this film since it first came out. Michael Keaton is an absolute stitch and all the main characters do a great job. Just an entertaining, funny movie that everyone can watch.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|I enjoyed the story and I am not into science fiction, the testimonials got kind of redundant. almost a scientific view of zombies.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|What's not to like about John Mayer. Great musician songwriter, guitarist etc. He keeps showing an incredible range of musical talent.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I can edit my pictures and it look great:good:bad It is goood :) i love the pictures i loooove it
B00785P2QC|3.0|Simple fun little game however progress is slow if you don't buy your way through the game. Play if you have patience.
B00632HWOG|5.0|As this is not the place to explain why I prefer not to go over to gmail, I can only say that this app works very well for me. I use it on two different Android devices to handle mobile mail, then I depend on a pop client at home to sort and file the threads. Very simply, this app does what is supposed to do, cleanly and reliably. As long as Yahoo continues the current level of support, I am very satisfied.
B00B9PIYZ8|5.0|These boots are exactly what I was looking for; looks and function without bulk. Be warned though, After reading a lot of reviews about this boot, saying they run large, I bought a size smaller than I would in any other boot and I am glad I did, because I can wear thick socks and they still have room. If you buy them knowing this, they will not let you down. I would not buy these for heavy duty use, but in a chilly wet climate like we have in Seattle, they will be perfect for providing good looks and warmth. I did spray them with leather waterproofing as a precaution. These
B00006CXSS|5.0|I really enjoyed this. I hate that it took so many years for me to get around to watching it.
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|Just so generic and bad. Pretty much just like the other sequels, but with a different cast and location. Wish that the alternate ending to the first paranormal activity where Katie(Kadie?) killed herself would of been the ending the filmmakers chose. Would have enjoyed that more, also would have made the movie stand the test of time. These sequels that they are pumping out are just bad, just....bad.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|This was even better than I thought it would be.  I think Steve is in great form here and Kenny Wayne Shepherd is one of my favorites.  This pairing was a natural fit and plays very well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Typical! Read it in every romance novel without the brutality. Anyone dumb enough to sign the dotted line, wanting to be dominated is pretty dumb.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|Any of you who are ordering this READ THIS FIRST. I ordered this board to build a gaming rig and I didn't have all the parts for my PC to power it up and test it out. Well My return policy ended October 6th, today is the 22nd. Too late to return it, I'm out $110 I could've spent elsewhere. As a hardware geek I can tell you this board will not work for you if you plan to buy an FX series CPU. It will throttle it so badly you can't do much at all. Mine throttles from 3.5GHz to 1.5GHz up to 4.0GHz rapidly due to the bad VRM, very limited BIOs (no way to turn off APM to stable the voltage and frequency). I'm highly upset I just got all my parts together today! Been looking forawrd to this since I ordered it! (Wednesday, September 4, 2013) Seriously upsetting. I'd lean towards another motherboard. ASUS M5A97 LE R2.0 is GREAT for overclocking but only supports one graphics card. Think I'm gonna try to save up for it myself (I built a rig for my friend with it, it's so stable and fast yet still user friendly and customizable).
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Good wholsome action flick. Arnold does what you expect and no surprises or plot twists. It was good for entertainment and the production of the film was technically well done.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|EJ as you'd  expect. Great selection and well mastered. Will listen to this for quite some time. Thanks EJ you still Rock
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|Probably the best game I've ever played. I feel like I'm actually in the middle of it a and such good graphics.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My child as well as myself loves this game!!!!!!!!!! it is a very  addictive game that we both love on our kindles and on my phone. Everyone should download this game it is amazing and great for children and adult.. Thank you for awesome wonderful game.
B00B52F278|5.0|I bought the entire series and we just love it. If you're looking for lots of action and an exciting movie, this is it! Highly recommended.
1439153663|5.0|Well... this book received a lot of negative reviews but I am one who loved it.<br />It is a light easy read,well paced and never falters for an instance.<br />Set in Virginia, in the days when slaves worked on the big plantations and the onerous plantation owners were a God unto themselves.<br />Of course this could be seen as a dark book because of the \\"times\\" and the often ruthless and barbaric treatment<br />of the slaves but there is much love here and not all the whites were bad.<br />I feel Kathleen Grissom has written a great book, with wonderful characters and a great plot.<br />I like the idea that she was \\"guided \\" in writing this book by the two narrators.<br />Why not? All things are possible.<br />Congratulations Kathleen and I look forward to your next books.<br />I will recommend this book to all and sundry.
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|We bought this prior going on a train ride,The Polar Express.  Having the child familiar with the story prepares her for the adventure.  Would recommend it to children of all ages.
B004IFGORQ|5.0|Awesome family night movie. We were laughing hysterically at times.  Classic Adam Sandler, yet more refined than his original movies.
B00C061I1M|3.0|I saw her perform Working Woman Blues on David Letterman one night and then purchased the Cd on amazon.  Folksy sound takes you back.  Not my usual listening fare, but I do enjoy it.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|This was like Independence Day meets Godzilla. Special effects were incredible but I thought the movie was awkward and just Ok.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ok, for a game that has been on Facebook for however long and a few of my friends and family have been trying to get me to play too. I can now! The bad side, I just passed by them in the game. I keep going back to the game and playing until I can't any more...go job King.com for getting it on KINDLE FIRE finally! Now can I return to the game?<br /> Sorry, leaving this section!
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Downers:<br />Ozzy is worn out, sounds like a caricature of himself.<br /><br />Bill Ward is surely missed as the drumming is not as orchestrally percussive as early Sabbath.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Tony Iommi & Geezer Butler are geniuses. Just hearing them play off each other again makes the album with it.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Much closer to the comic book than the Stallone version... I hope to see more from the production team in the future.
B003U2QHB6|5.0|A great continuation of every ones favorite morons.  Not as good as the first,  but a great laugh. Excellent! !
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This story is truly inspiring and has given me a new outlook on what can be overcome.  The strength and determination she shows is amazing.  Very empowering for women.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|I think this was a solid remake. It's gory, hokey and sexy at once.  Worth seeing at least one time!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Great app!  The &#34;flashlight&#34; is as bright as any LED flashlight I own, as long as it's for short distances, less than 25 feet or so.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|While I enjoyed this, it's not risqu&eacute; anymore, the jokes and humor are too predictable now. It's worth the watch,  but im hoping this is the last one.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Arrived quickly, worked fine, looks beautiful.  I recommend buying this, but especially if you can get it for the deal price.
B004MPI5SS|4.0|Watched because of original. This movie is dark, twisted,  sick and very graphic. If you like that,  then you'll like this. Better than the original.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoying playing the game. Some levels harder than others but I like the challenge.  The game is a must have  if you enjoy the challenge.
B0030SZ2D4|5.0|Very Cool movie! The language can be strong at times but is a great movie. Probably VD's best role ever.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|I spent the extra $1 to get this in HD... It was anything but HD. The stream dropped twice in the first 5mins to buffer and the quality was never HD. I stream Amazon through a Roku with a 10meg internet connection. Amazon Instant and Netflix are always flawless quality, I don't know what went wrong with this one?<br /><br />As far as the movie goes... Better than the 2nd, not as good as the 1st.<br /><br />4 stars for movie. 2 stars for stream. Avg 3 stars
B006SVHOL8|3.0|I did enjoy this movie,  however it was very slow at times. It is very scary to realize how accurate the movie is when showing how fast an epidemic could spread.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really love this game. My complaint is there isn't enough horse/devoted owner tenderness! After feeding/grooming/cleaning there is not much more to do. And how will I ever get enough gems to afford another horse?
B004HWYTP4|4.0|RED was quite good as an secret agent action film. It was surprisingly clean but the quick action was neither unbelievable nor transparent.  Aside from perhaps a short scene with needles I couldn't even categorize it as graphic -just a little fun shoot 'em up story line with lots of lights and booms.  I am definitely looking forward the RED 2.
1593275080|5.0|An amazing collection of creations from builders around the world that showcases the LEGO brick as an art medium.  It has been on our coffee table for a few weeks and our friends and family will casually flip through it, only to go back and look at every creation from cover to cover.  The layout is beautifully simple with minimal text that allows you to enjoy the creations as they are; would definitely classify this as an &#34;art&#34; book that could be enjoyed by people of all ages.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing I was hesitant at first mainly for what it is about but the author really sucks you in with her ability to say things
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This has been a great help for my kids homework. They are able to use this while they are working at home'
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|A man who really cares about your financial well- being. He offers a meticulous mind change of your money DNA into one of constantly looking for opportunities, never giving up, and changing your level of thinking!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|The book didn't work for me. She is a great writer though! I just wish I could have gotten more out of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it is so fun to play while listening to music all day and when I have a free time to relax
006202406X|1.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS:<br /><br />As a relatively new fan to this series, I was only moderately excited about this release to begin with. I work in a bookstore, and as the youngest employee it is my responsibility (so to speak) to keep up with popular titles geared towards kids and young adults. I'd heard amazing things about this series and, upon picking up the first book, could not put it down. It was amazing and I loved it and I've since recommended it to tons of kids, young adults, and even some adults as a series that I firmly believed was better than the Hunger Games.<br />Until this book.<br />Being a bookseller, I was able to grab my copy a full day early and, having also had that day off, I read it in large bursts throughout the day. At first, I was really excited to see where the story would go. But as I got further in, the more it felt familiar ... I was just reading Insurgent again with a different setting.<br />It is always a bold move to kill your main character. And sometimes this decision is necessary, and (if written well) can make a powerful impact on the story and generally improve the ending. Tris' death was nothing short of disappointing. She did not need to die. The story would have been stronger if she had lived. Her death was purely a \\"bold move,\\" and nothing more. I think Veronica Roth thought she was doing right by her story and characters to kill off the protagonist, but it just makes her seem like an author who wanted to \\"go there\\" and \\"do the unthinkable.\\" But honestly, it was predictable. As soon as it was announced, both prerelease and in-book, that Tobias would become a POV character instead of just a love interest, it was clear that Tris would most likely die. And it could have been done in a more elegant and meaningful way. But given the fact that Tris is literally always trying to sacrifice her life for things kind of diminishes the meaning of the act. If she had not attempted to sacrifice her life in Insurgent, and if shehad not put herself directly in harm's way in Divergent, then her ultimate choice to give her life for the cause would have been stronger and more \\"explosive.\\" The decision to kill her in this context was the coward's way out.<br />In my opinion, both as a writer and a reader, I think it would have been stronger to kill Caleb, let Tris live, and have her live with the weight of having lost every member of her family, relying solely on the familial bond she shares with her boyfriend and her friends. It would have been a more personal and powerful way of teaching the message that we mend one another.<br /><br />TL;DR - this book was NOT a strong ending, it was NOT a good last book, and it was NOT what it could have been. It WAS a major disappointment, and I have felt sick to my stomach selling this book to excited kids all day long. If I could give this a 0/5 stars, I would. It felt like a slap in the face, and it makes me feel like the entire series was not worth the effort. I feel guilty for getting kids interested in this series to begin with because I know that once they read this book they will be let down in the same way that I and (apparently) most other readers (thus far) have been.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|i just got Motorheads Bad Magic and realized I didn't review this album.this is a great album from start to finish.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|This is a smaller version than the full size one that sells locally.  It is the perfect size for me.  Just the right amount of charcoal and the charcol really lites fast.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I'm in the minority here as I think World Without End is better than The Pillars of the Earth.  You could easily read this as a stand alone novel.
B00FXEL00W|3.0|Nice story of self discovery and love overcoming fear. Kendall and Payton have been friends from childhood, but something is about to change. I love stories where the line between friendship and love disappears unexpectedly. However. I felt that some passages were cut before started. Some parts of the story took their fair development and time, but others happened so fast that i thought the writer was in a rush or were written by another author. Good job Kristen please keep writing!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Unusual narrator.  Different point of view of Nazi Germany.  Not sure I would have enjoyed this as a young adult, the target audience, but loved it as a middle aged reader.  Kids are different today though so take that with a grain of salt.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase.  The DVD case had a small blemish, but the disc was perfect and played without any problems.  The film was funny and sweet; very well-acted.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It's not that well written. It is pretty much an adult twilight. But the characters, especially Grey, start to grow on you and you want to know the ending.
B0045MPPJK|5.0|This album really came at a perfect time for me. I was searching for a Die Antwoord from within. Thank you for sharing your vision.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app pretty much daily.  I'm very happy with the way this app works on my Kindle Fire.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I really liked this movie, Jamie foxx is an amazing actor and pulls off this role superbly. A different approach to a western that will keep your eyes glued to the screen!
B00846REIS|4.0|Not a bad book was  getting annoyed not knowing Gideon' s past but it kept me wanting more... :) can't wait to start the next book.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|definitely worth seeing, although not the best zombie type movie. some of the zombies were a bit cheesy, some action scenes pretty unrealistic, but all in all still good enough to stay interested.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It is a fun game, I'll grant that.  Until the higher levels that give you very few moves to perform an almost impossible task, then you use up lives in just a few minutes.  Since I don't \\"do\\" Facebook (there actually are some people who have no interest in Facebook and Twitter and such), the only thing I can do it quit the game until more lives are generated.  That's getting pretty tedious pretty quickly.  I'll probably uninstall soon.  To each his own.
B00F880BWG|5.0|The implications of what the characters endure in this series is a chilling look into the primitive world we could face if our society and infrastructure becomes too fragile and breaks down. Although the threat of the undead is an extra horrifying thoughts. Still, well acted, well directed. Bravo AMC!
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|This case is beautiful & thin, but extremely sturdy. The phone is easy to get in and out, but doesn't fall out. It doesn't feel like you are holding a much larger iPhone either- which is often the case when you have multiple layers of protection in a case.
0143038095|3.0|I was forced to buy this book for school but not its not so bad. Its not a great or interesting book. Its just not as boring as I thought it would be. It does get interesting at some points but normally I wouldn't have bought it. If you are I to fights from cultural diversity this book is perfect for you. If you aren't its not bad....it just wont do anything for you.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Should have stopped with book one. Drags on painfully with weak story line leaving nothing to imagination. Waste of time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you it is perfect. I love having it on my Kindle now I can lay in bed and play at night.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I am a knife collector/enthusiast. I must admit I thought I would regret purchasing this knife, being it was only $39.00. What a SURPRISE!!! This is a full tang monster of a knife that is so impressive, I was quite frankly, pleasantly shocked at it's quality. 1/4 inch 1095 high carbon steel with great balance and feel. The quality of the sheath was beyond my expectations too! In my opinion this high quality knife is tantamount to the Ka-bar Becker BK-7 that costs 2 or 3 times as much, depending on who you buy it from. Take it from me, you will not be disappointed. I'm going to buy two more for Christmas presents, and they'll think I spent a $100.00 or more for sure. The sheaths are so nice, that if they sold them separately, I would buy 3 or 4 of them too! To sum it all up, I would frankly say that I would highly doubt that you and me will ever run into another value like this for a long, long time. Put a couple in your cart now - you'll be glad you did. Oh yeah, it will shave the hair off your arm too! WOW! Why can't the other knife manufacturers put out a high quality knife like this at this price point with a really nice sheath with it, like Schrade does? You're going to smile when it comes in the mail!
B00079FUI6|3.0|I do love this show but I didn't expect it to come in a tiny movie box I expected the big original packaging
B00000FC5H|5.0|I enjoy Earth, Wind and Fire; this is a wonderful CD to accompany one on errands or a road trip....great tunes!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple set up, does what it's supposed to do. Looking forward to more apps that work with it, but for the money it is hard to beat. Will probably but another for the office.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing g this game at lunch and before bed and especially if I'm waiting and need to kill time.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|My mom is better than your mom.black Friday night and the turn to go to get a half hour and a s the I years of poker room to get a s and the best way of the first place of corruption and the first to be able to the best possible freelance workers at<br />Hunger games are not allowed to be able Banff and history of poker players
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Classic, must see.  You really have to Flink outside the box when you watch it to catch everything.  If you haven't seen it, beg, borrow, or steal a chance to watch it.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. You feel every emotion as you read the words on the page.  First love, true love, hope and hopelessness.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Every song on this album is amazing, hands down.  If you like/love Royals I'm confident you'll enjoy every song on this album.  I don't even consider Royals one of my favorite songs; my favorites include Tennis Court, Buzzcut Season, Team (totally my fav fav), and A World Alone.  Such a mellow sound throughout the album with quality lyrics.
B000I9YWDO|3.0|Obnoxious &#34;boss&#34; and dysfunctional office personalities in the cube. Some very funny scenes but mostly very predictable.  I'd add it to the list of movies to watch ( but not at the top).  There is bound to be a scene everyone who has worked in an office can relate to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I should give this game one star because it is so additive!!  :)  I can't work because of it!  :)  Lots of fun!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this as a replacement for my harsh phone alarm. the options available make it a much more pleasant way to awaken.
B005LAII12|5.0|I absolutely love the part when he was pulling out of the parking lot and almost hit a SECOND car, he then said \\"Sorry I was tweeting\\" Boy was I cracking up. Great movie! I thought it was a kids movie but when I seen it I was like \\"NO!\\",  my granddaughter cannot watch this.
0744014956|5.0|This is probably the biggest strategy guide book I have ever owned. It's over 430 pages long, it contains highly detailed  complete walkthrough of the entire single-player story. There are mission maps which identify key objectives, specify targets, and chart the fastest path to 100% completition. There is a complete coverage of all off-mission activities and sophisticated mini-games. The maps in this strategy guide cover every mile of this world that's bigger than Red Dead Redemption, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas combined. Grand Theft Auto V limited edition strategy guide has a hardcover casing, it has a collection of Grand Theft Auto V illustrations that are really cool and can be considered as extras and it also features all of the tips and tactics that you need to complete the game with 100% completition. It also features an exclusive lithograph of official Grand Theft Auto V artwork, however I was a tad dissapointed that it wasn't an actual full sized lithograph, but it is only a printed matt A3 sized print...<br />So to sum this up, I thought it is a wonderful strategy guide with lots of cool illustrations and information about the game, but I was really dissapointed that the lithograph is smaller than I expected.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|After a few decades, many bands run out of creativity and commit to mediocrity but not Yes.  This album shows that Yes can maintain their standards of fresh content and originality.  The new singer is just fine, no problems there.  If you like Yes then this album is a great choice.
B00EZPCZ5O|4.0|I'm going to be honest, I did not care for \\"Crash Love\\" at all.  I thought it was weak, and it didn't get my blood pumping the same way other AFI albums have done (most notably \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" and \\"Black Sails in the Sunset\\").  I was one of those people that defended \\"Decemberunderground\\" with his life, but when CL dropped I found myself agreeing with some of its naysayers.  This album, however, makes up for CL in spades.<br /><br />For one thing, it feels like an AFI record.  One major problem the last one had is that something about it just didn't feel like AFI and it didn't click with me emotionally.  This one does, without a doubt, and it has some of their darkest material since STS for sure.  \\"The Sinking Night\\" is a beautiful and haunting introduction to the album and while it isn't the epic call to arms that is \\"Miseria Cantare\\" or \\"Strength Through Wounding\\", it's still fantastic.  This leads directly into the album's first single, \\"I Hope You Suffer\\", which is one of the angriest sounding AFI songs in a long time.  Then there's \\"No Resurrection\\", which has some fantastic backing vocals that remind me of the STS days.  \\"Wild\\" is a very fitting title for that track, as it essentially sounds like 80s new wave spiralling downward into insanity, with its insane keys and quick pace.  I seriously don't know how else to describe it, all I know is that it's great.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on here would have to be \\"The Conductor\\" and \\"The Face Beneath the Waves\\".  TC is a dark, layered industrial rock tune with a very memorable guitar riff and a big chorus.  TFBTW is a very atmospheric - and at times very creepy - track that is unlike anything AFI have ever done.  It's an interesting way to close the album, to say the least.<br /><br />If there are any problems I have with this, they mostly lie in the production.  This really doesn't have to be as loud (not to mention compressed) as it is.  Give the music some room to breathe.  That was something \\"Crash Love\\"suffered from as well, and \\"Decemberunderground\\" to a lesser extent.  While it doesn't ruin the album, it's just frustrating to see AFI give in to the loudness war.<br /><br />Overall though, this is their best album in at least a decade.  While it doesn't quite top \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" in terms of quality, it's almost there and is certainly worth picking up if you're a fan of this band.  If you're looking for punk rock or hardcore, you will not find it on here and should stick to their old stuff (and maybe listen to the newest Our Time Down Here album if you want some dark melodic hardcore/punk ala old AFI).  PEACE.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|It's like they never left!  How does the band come back after so many years and put out such good music?  If you liked Heartwork this album is right up your alley.
B005PK56TA|3.0|I'm not going to write a preamble, no money in it for me. It was fairly good horror. Looking forward to watching seasons two and three.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|Clean moves fast and fun.  Typical match game.  Good graphics and quick rewards.  Easy to use. Goes quickly.  Good way to pass time.
B00FXOYDNI|4.0|While it could be more gritty or intense...the special effects are great, the characters are easy to watch, and the plots are inline with the possibility of a time where superheros and aliens are a reality on earth.  It's a government agency with a lot of responsibility and without a budget constraint or the threat of being shutdown (unless they cancel the show).
B004WIOCH8|3.0|I was late to the party when it came to this Daredevil movie and most of the people I had spoken with about it said it was a bad one.  I see why they said that: generally poor writing plagued the movie.  I don't mind tweaks to canon (as in Jack &#34;The Devil&#34; Murdock), but they don't mention &#34;Foggy&#34; Nelson by name until about 30-40 minutes into the movie which leaves outsiders in the dark for too long.  Sometimes it was hard to tell the action going on in a few scenes as the lighting was way too dark, like in the seedy bar scene.  Elektra and Matt breaking out randomly into a duel on a playground of all places is one of the most awkward action scenes I have ever seen in a movie and the pace of them getting into a relationship is way off.  And what was up with the out-of-place musical number during the funeral scene?  That drowned out the dialogue that was taking place which didn't help matters.<br /><br />However, there were points that I did like about the film.  The acting was generally competent: Ben Affleck did well as Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  The movie did successfully show things Matt Murdock struggled with: his image, his religion, his physical pain from years of action and the drawback of his powers.  Matt having to sleep in a sensory depravation tank, even if it was a little grandiose looking, was a nice touch.  The special effects with the &#34;radar sense&#34; scenes were a good touch in giving the viewer an image of how Murdock &#34;sees&#34;, especially in the rain.  Bullseye's fight with Elektra was faithful to the comic depiction, which helped make it more familiar.  And in the end, Daredevil (and Matt) both triumph despite all the things he goes through because he's the Man Without Fear.<br /><br />Aesthetically, there were no problems streaming the movie; it looked great.  So kudos to Amazon Video for that.<br /><br />So Daredevil wasn't the greatest movie ever, but it's a way to kill some time if you want to watch It once.  If you decide to watch it yourself, just look for things to enjoy, because there will surely be a thing or two that you won't like.de to watch it yourself, just look for things to enjoy, because there will surely be a thing or two that you won't like.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I say it's boring completely boring you can only plant weat I've had this game for 2 years and I'm done . Once you get it it's fun but it's not . If it says that there are diamonds THERE ARNT ANY DIMONDS ON THIS VERSION . Why can't they put &quot;minecraft hunger games&quot; you can do anything on there and why don't they put &quot;grand theft auto&quot; too . Those games are at least fun .
B00AALX5SI|4.0|This movie is more in documentary fashion than &#34;movie&#34; fashion and it's very insightful and entertaining.  It show cases the 1 year of Katy's life where she was on her big tour.  I absolutely loved seeing the production quality of her show, the amount of time/effort that went into putting on this touring, and hearing much of her music.  This movie also documents some of how she got started in her career, her background, and her marriage.  Overall, great movie.  Appropriate for all ages.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|this app is over rated. people spend to much time playing this game. i tried to see what the big fus was about but i dont see one.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|An excellent movie for the fans of post-apocalyptic and/or Japanese Kaiju movies.<br />Combines two great genres into one with masterful grace.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The first two books were ok but this one you can and have to recommend the kids not to read it, reading a summary will not hurt<br />The horrible violent things that this book describes are way too much for young adults to read, seams like fiction but.....<br />As an adult I had to skip several pages to be able to reach the end of the book and don't through it to the trash<br />Definitely not for young adult eyes
B00F91H666|1.0|The only thing this had in common with the book was the title. The plot resolution was pretty weak. Overall disappointing.
1419705644|5.0|Well made with great attention to detail, overall a great purchase! Really is a good overview of the world of Ooo.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Of coarse this is Star Wars and in Blue Ray it's even better than before. Much more detail than I ever noticed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|kindness. that's pretty much the crux of this book. and seeing it through children's stories and eyes transformed the way I look for and respond with kindness in my life. Wonder was a gut check reminder that being unkind should never be tolerated, and that friendship and kindness can change lives. This will become an annual read for sure!
1594746036|3.0|I bought this book before a long flight, and from the synopsis on the back, I was expecting a thriller.  I was lead to believe that it would be oddly scary.  It was not at all.  It's not a bad book by any means, and it kept me entertained enough during the flight that I kept reading it after I got off the plane.  However, this book seemed to me to be written specifically for the purpose of turning it into a movie.  Awkward teenagers with supernatural capabilities taking on evil monsters in a fantasy world, throw in a bit of romance, and voila!  It's become the cookie-cutter formula for teen movies.  Add in the fact that this book left off as a cliffhanger towards the next book, and Riggs has already worked out two parts of the trilogy.  Again, it was ok.  It was entertaining enough to pass the time.  But I'm going to wait for the movie for part two.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|Buttons and scissors is a great logic game...I love it...it allows you to work out your idea of what is right...it does not  always work out that way...you've just got to try it out to see..
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I enjoyed reading the third installment of Bridget Jones. Huge fan of Helen Fielding's humor. For readers in their thirties and above quite fantastic with the new age of cyberspace and online dating being kind of confusing this might serve as a guide on what not to do.<br />Loved it.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|How to Win at the Sport of Business is an inspirational book that will get you excited about the possibilities of success. Mark Cuban did a great job sharing his lessons to the top. I was hoping for a lot more business strategy and such but it was still a captivating read. Definitely a great read for anyone who is interested in starting or running a business.
B00ARN0ZF0|4.0|Pretty creepy... full of suspense, & a great sequel to the last one:-) I really love the creativity ( home videos and surveillance cameras ) beginning with paranormal activity 1 and continuing throughout the rest of them.
B00FEJHPRI|4.0|Great addition to the series. A little over the top on the story line, but very entertaining with lots of action.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched all three seasons in a week. That should be a testimony in itself. The first season started off slow, but by the third episode, I was hooked! Fast forward to the third season and I cannot wait for the fourth season (currently showing in England- not the US until January). Third season has so many twists and turns that cannot be missed!!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Fun movie. My 3 year old daughter loves it, but there are some scary parts to it. Wish I'd seen it before I let her watch because one seen has a character talk about killing another character.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|I enjoyed watching this collection and being a Star Trek fan, it was worth the purchase, I would recommend buying.
B009SCR7RU|5.0|I love the Tinkerbell series. This one is my favorite so far!  Great story line. I can't wait for the next one to come out.
0553801503|4.0|The book is part of my favorite series, but I really had to force myself through it. The problem was that it focused on a lot of characters that the readers aren't invested in...(SPOILER ALERTS)No Jon Snow or Tyrion chapters, very few Arya chapters, etc. I did like the gradual maddening of Cersei, and also Jaime POV chapters, but aside from that, it was a snoozer. Absolutely necessary, however, for the progression of the series so it is well worth the read.
B000B589JI|5.0|NICE TO HAVE IF YOU ARE OUT ON LONG DAYS/NITES AND WANT TO KEEP YOUR FEET OR OTHER ITEMS WARM LIKE LION BATTERIES LONGER.
0553106635|5.0|Best book of the series...lots of plot twists and character arcs. If you like fantasy genre, I recommend you start at the beginning of A Game of Thrones and read through.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Just received the book and read the first few chapters. Looks like it will be a good read. I'm glad that he chose to do a follow up on his first book that was so good. In my opinion, it was the best of all the books that he has ever written. Hope this one will be as good.
0553103547|5.0|Fell in love with this book when I read it about 4 years ago. Since then, I have reread it 4 more times. This book is phenomenal, although it starts off a bit slow, it picks up big-time within the first 100 pages and you won't be able to put it down.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The story is nice enough, well written and with a light storyline. It filled up half a evening nicely and without expecting too much emotional turmoil from my soul.<br /><br />Romance book doesn't look like it hasn't changed much in the last few years, since the last time I read one. Still the male is tall, handsome and rich, with strong male hands and all the muscles well in place, still the female is strong (but not too much), intelligent but with a dark past or some other problem.
B0075161UA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Not too much I can say about it without spoilers, but it was definitely my second favorite of the series, right after A Storm of Swords.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|Item arrived on time and as stated.  Guilt trip is a good movie.  Barbra is so funny.  Thanks for the speedy service.
0553108034|5.0|Another addition to the ASOIAF series. If you start reading, prepare to spend the next few months completely buried in this series. There's a little something for everyone.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Item arrived on time and as stated.  Oz the great and powerful movie is different but pretty good.  Family enjoyed it.  Thanks for the speedy service
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Great beginning.  Lots of action.  Zombies not like walking dead.  These zombies can. really move fast.  Pitt really carries this movie alone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting so long to get this game on my Kindle! Haven't noticed any major differences between this version and the Google Play version.
B00E6895M6|4.0|Quite good. A refreshing new soundscape. Can feel stagnant at times, but overall catchy upbeat songs with young-sounding, innocent vocals expressing rather dismal ideas with almost a cheerful sentiment.
B007SXB498|3.0|Another  pointedly observant work from a woman who  shows us that worldly experience is not always necessary if you have the intelligence that she had!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome Show . Very well done! The actors pay their parts well. I Can not wait for season number 4!!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book to others.  It was amazing the details she was able to convey from her journey.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The book was very interesting and a very great mysteries series I can't wait to find out about a and the book had a lot of detail that is why I recommend this book I hope you enjoy it
B008476HBM|5.0|If I could repine for one thing, it would be that classics so beloved as this do not have sequels to encourage everlasting affection but Miss Austen has left me with such violent happiness that I am glad she attributed Lizzy and Jane never-ending happy endings.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|All the pain in my fingers and wrist is gone! This has changed my life forever. Best purchase ever. Happy customer!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I like the Temperance Brennan series, so I enjoyed this, but they're really all the same.  You have to like the characters (I do), and have a tolerance for ongoing and unresolved relationships (I do).  This is simply mind-soothing entertainment with a little intriguing forensic science thrown in.  I'd say the same for the whole series, but it took a while to set in for me.  For the first couple of titles I still believed there would be movement in the relationships, if not resolution.  Of course the same can be said for Patricia Cornwall, &#34;JD Robb,&#34; and the like.  On the other hand, Elizabeth George resolved the relationship issue by killing off a key character, and I'll probably never read another of her Lynley series, so know your tolerances.
B009GEYX5E|3.0|We purchased these because to find actual Polaroid 600 film is outrageously expensive.  For $24.00 you can purchase this film which works just as well except you get only 8 pictures instead of 10
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've only been playing this for one day and I LOVE IT! The graphics are great. It's very colorful and quick to play. The narrator's voice is creepy to me, but that's easy enough to solve! One could play this game as a mindless time killer or could actually strategize and think each play through-whatever you're in the mood for. Eventually you run out of lives and must wait a predetermined amount of minutes before playing again (unless a facebook friend &quot;gifts&quot; you more lives.) Great game for preschoolers, their grandparents, and everyone in between!
B00007KWHG|5.0|After seeing Jersey Boys on Broadway I had to get it.  It takes you back to when you were a kid!
B000IDEORY|5.0|A classic, IMHO, although most of today's young people will not understand parts of it:  That abortions were illegal, subject to criminal prosecution then, That rock and roll was just gearing up to be part of a teenager's life.  But the final dance is worth the wait.  Patrick Swayze grew up with dancing, and he made it look so natural.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|If you have not seen The Walking Dead on AMC you are missing history being made!!! To get you started though, come and take a look at my site: Fans of the TV show, &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; , over on FACEBOOK. Between Amazon and Facebook, The Walking Dead live. Neather site is promoting the other. This is from me, a fan of both sites; Donald E. Bailey
B0035LMTZA|3.0|Weak plot line and lacking character development.  Had some decent action scenes, but lacked believability.  Not the best action movie I've seen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally Candy crush is on kindle. My phone broke,  and haven't been able to play for weeks. Ive been in candy crush withdrawal. Its so much better playing on the kindle. Thanks Amazon.
B00F35BV64|5.0|full of excitement, great cast, great plot. Although a remake of an earlier star trek still entertaining and changed enough to make it less predictable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to see the real candy crush available for the Kindle. Also delighted to be able to play when offline...that is a huge plus
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|2 stars unroll I can connect to facebook . no matter how many times I try it just wont connect.  ughh
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Great family movie, my husband and i thought it was funny. and our 4 month old likes all the colors :)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|All the excitement of a crazed pursuit for terrorists with interludes of true love such as I haven't seen on any screen in many years.
1451695195|5.0|The feeling I walked away with from this great book was inspiration and the knowing that I am not alone.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|Excellent in every way.  We thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  After watching a great PBS film about kids and chess entitled &#34;Brooklyn Castle&#34; we keyword searched for other films about chess and children and came across this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was worth the seven dollars that it charges. It keeps your imagination at work and its an endless game. You can do whatever you want in this amazing sand box game. Your imagination is definitely needed in this game. Theres is also some fighting in it which adds to the fun. Get it if you have the money. This game has kept me busy for so many hours. Get it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Stroller game. Fluid. Easy to play. Fun.<br /> SPOILER ALERT: They have even made it so there isn't a single vehicle vehicle that performs well on every level.<br />I've enjoyed every minute of it.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This was one of my favorite books in recent years.  It starts as a legacy left behind by a tech genius, and grows to be a world changer.  The technology is stretched a bit, but not exorbitantly, and the author avoids getting mired in details non-tech-savvy people would get lost at.<br /><br />Great pacing, interesting characters, about the only flaw I could possibly complain about is the Hollywood-like rampant hacking, and that's really just a matter of degree.<br /><br />What legacy would YOU leave behind if you could?<br /><br />I started in to the sequel \\"Freedom\\" immediately upon finishing the first book.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|very funny! my kids loved it. we have seen it 3 days in a row. get it today. its worth it.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|I really liked this movie as it contained both science fiction elements yet it wasn't one of the same old horror or alien invasion formulas. It put the aliens in a more &#34;sentient being&#34; light where we understood they were the ones victimized. It made me think what would I do in their place.
B004I744AS|5.0|But the real find is the great number and variety of extra added items that I was pleased to discover below the definitions!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|totally addictive! Just started playing and can't stop! Think I might try other games by King judging by this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME. I have been waiting forever for this  game  to come  to the  kindle and I was not  let down. Love it!!!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is a book that every citizen needs to read!  (not a difficult task since it reads like a novel) and I couldn't put it down.  But when I talk about what I'm reading with my friends, I keep getting the same response: \\"I don't want to think about it!\\".  Well - we NEED to think about it, talk about it, and contact our government representatives about it!<br /><br />The book is well written and meticulously researched.  Having read several other books on similar subjects, I could independently verify some of the facts and felt that Schlosser carefully verified his facts. And the facts are chilling. He has a lot of information I've never read anywhere else.<br /><br />He skillfully intertwines the history of the development of nuclear weapons and the tactical and stratgeic plans for nuclear war during the cold war with a detailed report of the accident in Damascas, Arkansas in 1980.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended. Please read it. Make your family and friends read it. But be warned: you won't sleep well!
B0053F03MM|4.0|Science logic was a bit off, but an entertaining watch. It should keep your attention, even if you figure it out
B000FCJZ4K|5.0|I coach professionals in the interpersonal \\"soft skills\\" of communication and this is a book I consistently recommend.  I'm not a technophobe; I love all things that begin with an `i'!  However, what I'm seeing is that technology is directly impacting people's comfortableness and skill in dealing with others live and direct.<br /><br />This book comprehensively lays out the strategies needed to create relationships by knowing how to present one's `self.'  Yes, much of what Ferrazzi presents is \\"basic\\" and it's because it's basic that it needs to be put forth.  My experience is that we are forgetting or ignoring the basics.<br /><br />Bottom line: this book is like your very own workshop.  Essential for the professional determined to improve the quality of their communication.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Great band.  Great songs.  Great CD.  AMAZING singer.  I write this review a few years after I actually bought the CD.  I still listen to it.
B003UYUP58|2.0|After downloading the sample, I was immediately enthralled and impressed by the writing and content, so I bought the book -- AND then it all went downhill. Chapter by chapter, the writing style became increasingly laborious. It was no longer a mesmerizing read but instead an arduous slog. It reminded me of reading: &#34;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power,&#34; a fascinating story buried beneath a toilsome writing style.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent stand alone book not just for King fans. Great characters and villains. Would love to see a third installment with the&#34;family&#34;.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just got this, but so far I think it is fantastic!  Not sure I'm going to get any more work done now!  haha
B005544TRQ|5.0|What a Great show! love the characters- My husband and I enjoy watching it together and every  now and then we both sneak and watch an episode on our own because we can't wait for the other to free up some time to watch it together. Addicted!!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Easy read.  Learned more about art and technique of proper running, Tarahamayu culture, and ultra ruining all wrapped in a varied and entertaining story format.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I chose this book for my book club (which is a job I hate to do) and within the first 3 days, I started to get the reviews back...they loved it. Great choice for my group especially because we have people in their 20's and people in their 80's and this appealed to all.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Very nice game.<br />Good graphics and sound.<br /><br />I found some of the levels s little difficult but this is what the game is all about...
B00CSV7AFC|4.0|Yet another great Canadian band and there are plenty more to be discovered . Great sound, great vocals and mixed bag of sound and moods.  One of the better Indie albums of 2013.  Yeah for CBC Radio 2 and Radio 3 online!!
B002S43V3Y|5.0|Who would have thought that a reconditioned hearse, two individuals who love funerals, a strange family (including an uncle with a rigged sleeve on his tunic that allows his amputated arm to salute) would make a watchable film? If tormenting a rich mother with faked suicides interests you then you probably won't be too saddened by the unhappy ending.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I enjoy first hand account history.  This is that.<br />Marcus and the men that he serves with deserve our respect and gratitude.
B008ROG6E0|3.0|The special effects pale by comparison with today's CGI. If you want to see any early Jenny Agutter film this one will do. The premise of having to die when you reach the age of 30 is interesting and would be watchable with today's film techniques, but with the intense lighting and obvious sound stage sets it leaves a lot to be desired.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I saw this book on Amazon's list of bestselling epic fantasy. I was a little wary because the authors other books were teen vampire novels, but it had a decent star rating and was free (kindle edition) so I figured I had nothing to lose. Wow was I wrong.<br /><br />After reading, the best thing I can say about this novel is that it was short. I could't believe that this book had the star rating it did, but after looking at the reviews it looks like the author has been padding them. The characters were all boring, one dimensional losers, there wasn't a single character that I liked even a little. I spent most of the book wishing for some sort of catastrophe to wipe them all out. There is a love story, but it doesn't even meet teen vampire novel standards, let alone what I would expect from a fantasy novel. The story is a meandering mess that seems to have no real point whatsoever, as there is no character development and very little plot. Her writing style is terrible, and she seems to badly need an editor (or even a proofreader!).<br /><br />I usually don't write reviews for books, as I figure that liking or disliking them is a matter of taste, but this one is so horrifically bad that I would hate for anyone else to spend their money or time on this book. I don't insist that everything I read be complex masterfully written fantasy, but a book needs to have something good about it, and this one does not.
B00FN811SY|5.0|There is nobody that researches like the JW's.  They are thorough and honest and I would recommend this to all who want to get more out of their Bible reading.
B00422LESO|4.0|I bought the book after seeing the movie. I found both to be entertaining. It an easy read, but still quite enjoyable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been wanting this game forever it is finally on the kindle app store thank God addicting it is so not boring it isn't another trick its real
B00FEN000S|4.0|As long as you go into with the right mind set it is a fun cheesy flick.  Kids loved it and it made for a good popcorn night.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love this game. im glad its finally on the kindle. its very addicting. fun for everybody to play.
0425266060|5.0|I loved this trilogy . I cant wait for sylvia day to write the next book. This is definitely a must read
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|This game contains a number of mini-games, each consisting of a few number of \\"slides\\" that tests you in areas like math, memory, analytics and pattern recognition. Surprisingly entertaining and challenging! I can definitely see myself pulling up this app whenever I have a few minutes to kill. A refreshing change of pace from your traditional time murderer like Angry Birds. I personally love the memory games, probably because my memory isn't the best - too bad I can't add some more RAM to my head :)<br /><br />One interesting thing I've noticed - it seems to be able to adjust the difficulty on the fly as you progress through each set of questions. I was really stumped on question 4 of 5 in an analytic set. When I finally figured out #4, the final question presented was very easy. It might be coincidence, but it reminded me a little of adaptive tests like GRE - pretty cool.<br /><br />The app doesn't appear to have excessive permission requirements and works well without any glitches or crashes so far. Some earlier reviews mentioned seeing ads - I have yet to see one (will update this review if I do). Actual installed footprint on my phone is 9.67MB. Overall, it's a nice game that might actually give you a few extra IQ points by playing. I wouldn't mind paying $0.99 for it. As a free app of the day, it's definitely worth checking out!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Love this app for the kindle. The 22 Learn apps are among some of my sons favorites. They also have this app for iPhone, but it has a lot of bugs, which the app for the kindle does not! Very smooth running app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its so addictive its evil! I remember getting rid of this game 8 months ago because I was stuck on level 147. Then one day I see they finally made it for the kindle.....I figured why not.... now still stuck on level 147.....I'm again addicted :( but I love it.....its like a sugary drug you cant get rid of.......
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Hangover movies, in general, are hilarious but can be repetitive. This movie turned out to be a fantastic finish to the series. A definite must see!
