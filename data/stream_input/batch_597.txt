B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is my favorite album of the year so far. I'm a big Knopfler fan, but haven't really been into Emmylou Harris before. The songs are catchy, smart, accessible. This is simply good music for grownups looking for people singing about things they can relate to.
B00005JMCW|4.0|This movie is family oriented. It shows good family. Teenagers will love this movie. A lot of things in this movie will remind you of yourself in your highschool years. <br />
0671449028|4.0|This book is funny and playful, but also ends quite peacefully. It's a consistent bedtime favorite at our house.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is really funny. If you work in the office, this movie is the must see. This movie shows every little detail about the office space. The actors are amazing, you will be laughing the whole time. <br /> <br />
0312323859|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book. I had just finished an excellent book and was ready to start another. Boy was I in for a shock! This book was bad. It was actually a chore to keep reading, but I hate to leave a book unfinished. My husband was actually hiding the book around the apartment so that I wouldn't have to read any more of it. This book is chick-lit at it's poorest. The main character was flat and the plot was ludicrous. <br /> <br />If you want to read some GOOD chick-lit please do yourself the favor of checking out any of Jennifer Weiners books. \\"Little Earthquakes\\" and \\"Goodnight Nobody\\" are my two favorites. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time on this fluff.
B000EULJLU|1.0|I cannot believe all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this album that I am reading! Anyone giving this a 5 star rating must be a Heroin addict in the final stages of permanent brain damage. And I am an ex addict. But even at my most high I would have hated this album! It's hard to believe that this was written by the same person that wrote \\"13th step\\" which is an absolutely amazing album, \\"Undertow\\", and \\"Ainema\\". Which are also classic albums. \\"10,000 Days\\" is so far out there it's unlistenable. There are literally only 4 \\"songs\\" that I would actually call \\"songs\\". Those would be \\"Vicarious\\", \\"Jambi\\", \\"The Pot\\", and track 10. These 4 songs are very good! The rest of the album is just atmospheric, intstrumental, background soundscapes. I don't know if this is because of a lack of material or if they actually think this is good. Maybe Maynard was just REALLY high! Truthfully, they put more thought into the packaging than they did the music on this one. To me Tools downfall started with \\"Lateralis\\" with these god awfull 3 min. inrtos with no payoff in a 14 min. song. WTF! I will buy the next Perfect Circle album. I will not buy any more Tool albums until I have heard them first. And please people, get real with the reviews on this one.
B000021XS0|5.0|I was introduced to DT in early 2000 when this CD was a \\"new\\" release.  Now, some 6 years later, it is still my favorite album of all time.  It NEVER fails to intrigue or entertain.  It is a musical masterpiece.  If you haven't given this collection an opportunity, you are missing something incredibly special.
B00005JP01|3.0|After setting the streets of Los Angeles and Miami on fire, Japan is now the new grounds for street racing. This time, it's not only speed that matters, but also how good you are in controlled skidding, or as the locals say: drifting.  Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is a troublesome kid who has a love for fast cars. When his recent escapade lands him in deep trouble, he was left with only two choices: juvenile prison or living abroad. His mother opts for the latter and sends him to Tokyo to live with his estranged father, hoping that Sean will finally change and stay away from trouble.<br /><br />She really should have sent him off somewhere where camels are the only forms of travelling...<br /><br />Welcome to the land of advanced technology. And let's not forget neon lights, world's busiest intersection, and interesting people (in some cases, fashion victims). On his first day at school, Sean becomes friends with another American, Twinkie (rapper Bow Wow), who happens to be connected with the local gangsters. Of course, it won't be a typical day in his life if Sean didn't get himself into trouble because of a fast car. After losing to the current \\"Drift King\\", Takashi, he now owes Takashi's partner, Han, a car. But Han has other plans for Sean, whom he has taken a liking to. So under his supervision, Sean learns to race, Tokyo style. However, it's not only the local people's type of racing that he will learn.  For when he sets his eyes on Neela, Takashi's girlfriend, Sean will find out that unlike back home, it is not only his pink slip that he should worry about, but also his life.<br /><br />THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS:  TOKYO DRIFT is an adrenaline-charged movie just like its predecessors. And just like the first two movies' lead star, Lucas Black stars as the underdog street racer who has to prove himself to the local circuit. The big difference, though, is that he doesn't possess the same charisma, which Paul Walker does. But while the more critical moviegoers are sure to moan about the lack of plot and mediocre acting, I found this movie entertaining even if for just the racing scenes alone. After all, that was pretty much the main reason why I went to see the movie - to watch the fast cars, unbelievable stunts and more fast cars.  Besides, after a hectic day at work and the miserable Sydney weather, it was nice to just relax and enjoy a movie, which doesn't require your brain to function.<br /><br />And by the way, Vin Diesel DOES return...s are sure to moan about the lack of plot and mediocre acting, I found this movie entertaining even if for just the racing scenes alone.

0393057240|3.0|i was real excited about reading this, being a big fan of the movie and all, but in the end was dissapointed. It just seemed to be a bunch of random scenes with no connection, and it was depressing, people shooting heroin, getting AIDS and dying all the time, getting off the heroin, and then going back to it. Also, the hard scot dialect was difficult to read, even out loud and irritating...this is a book that requires a lot of patience
B000EULJLU|2.0|Well, this is a good album; however, this is a cookie cutter Tool CD. I like it that bands have a unique sound, and are affraid of venturing off in fear of being called a sellout (Everygreys new CD is a prime example of that, brilliant yet people call them sellouts.) This Album is nothing new, and didn't live up to what I expected from such brilliant musicains on a LONG hiatus. Very moderate Album all in all.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|While I'm willing to be swayed by a film, I will admit I oft go into a viewing with preconceptions (thus requiring the need for a second viewing so I can be more objective). This time around: 1- I'm not a fan of Ms Johansson; 2- Mr Wilkinson, I feel, has been in altogether far too many films of late and I'm bored with him; 3- Recent adaptations of Wilde's works have suffered greatly by their directors' attempts to 'open up' the claustrophobic parlour parlance with scenic inserts in an attempt to be nominated for a Cinematography Oscar at the cost of crippling the cadence inherent in Mr W's plays; 4- learning that some of the cast were Americans, feared that they'd do a gawdawful job with their English accents; and 5- Lady Windermere's Fan is not among my favourite Wilde plays. <br /> <br />This film did not require a second viewing. At least not for me to thoroughly enjoy it. It may require a second viewing, however, for me to search for all of its pitfalls. And that can be fairly enjoyable in itself, mind. <br /> <br />None of the main actors, including Ms Johansson, appear to be 'acting', if you will. They are their characters, they inhabit them. It feels right and not forced. Mr Wilkinson does a better job here than with the Rev from EARNEST: light with hidden gravitasse as opposed to cartoonish ecumincalism. <br /> <br />The pacing is great AND the director gets to 'open up' the world of his movie. Though with a different setting (Italy) and time (1930s), his transitions and inserts keep up with the tempo of Wilde's words (even if it's a pity many of them are still excised in this abbreviated adaptation) while injecting fresh energy into how and where scenes are played out. And I did like how this tale - or expose - of social scandal played out within the circle of British and American upper-class while surrounded by one of the more passionate and explosive tribes, the Italians. <br /> <br />This was a good, solid movie, even without orcs, explosions and cgi talking cars (though these can be good, too). Gives me lots of hope for further Wilde adaptations... which I know will probably end up being less Wilde and more bewildering in their inane executions. But hey... <br /> <br />  <br />
B000FILW86|5.0|So why can't we give 6 stars?  If any album deserves it, this one does.  I'm not a great fan of contemporary music, but the other morning I turned on a radio show and suddenly a song came on.  My immediate response was, \\"Finally there's a band out there that I could enjoy.\\"  The song ended and I discovered that the song, \\"Perfect Stranger,\\" was from ROCKFORD.  I shoulda known.  As a Cheap Trick fan in Madison, Milwaukee, and points south in the 70's I was headed back to the future.<br /><br />How good is ROCKFORD?  It's so good that the praise that it's receiving radically understates the case.  This is more than a great Cheap Trick record; it's a virtual tour of all that was exceptional in the music of the 70's.  Nearly every song includes a reference to the music of that period.  It would be fun to play it in bits and pieces and have people guess as to what they're actually hearing.  The Beatles, ELO, you name it, it's here.  There are touches of Supertramp, the Moody Blues, and a number of bands with which Cheap Trick is seldom associated.<br /><br />Every track is strong.  At least 5 of the tracks are truly exceptional and 1 or 2 could be considered instant classics.  Most important of all, each is different.  It is sad to see some of my old time idols making records in which nearly every track sounds the same.  I know, I know, there are differences, but contrast TWO AGAINST NATURE with GAUCHO or AJA.  With ROCKFORD we're looking at a major release and one that never, no never, disappoints.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|'The Rainbow Children' is a CD that does an awful lot.Mainly it serves as the reintroduction recording of Prince after eight years as TAFKAP but it's also the birth of a new band,titled after the album featuring musicians such as jazz reedsman Najee and Larry Graham.It was also labeled as Prince most controversial recording-apparently one of many.What is the album?Basically 'The Rainbow Children' is a jazz-funk fusion styled spiritual epic designed to illustrate Prince's conversion to Jehovah's Witness.The story is told by the same basic deep voiced narrator who opened up \\"1999\\" twenty years earlier.This recording showcases Prince's musical rebirth with an entirely new direction,one that in a lot of ways picked up where recordings like 'Sign O The Times' and 'Lovesexy' left off.The opening title song features a chorus of sings along with Prince illustrating the CD's themes on a very old fashion,minimal jazzy-soul tune.The majority of the songs here are very stripped down to focus attention on the highly religious lyrics-namely the ballads \\"Muse To The Pharoh\\",\\"Everywhere\\",\\"She Loves Me For Me\\" and the unusually sexy \\"Mellow\\".As for some of the more uptempo numbers \\"Digital Garden\\",\\"The Sensual Everafter\\" and \\"Last December\\" all feature a number of dynamic percussive arrangements and are highly dramatic in effect.What impress me most of course are the four funk tunes-all of which are more basic and stripped down as well,featuring a strong rhythm section and great tempos.Larry Graham permeates \\"The Work\\" while \\"1+1+1 Is 3\\" gets even deeper into the groove.\\"Family Name\\" goes even deeper-a racially charged tune musically sharing some lineage with Stevie Wonder's \\"Black Man\\",but done more subversively and told by what sounds like a trio of robots.Then it launces into the celebratory \\"The Everlasting Now\\",one of the finest songs on the CD that keeps the rhythm flowing from end to end.Taken together \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is a very complicated and eccentric piece of music with a lot of unexpected twists and turns.It features a smaller group of musicians then Prince's other bands and it shares a lot more in common with jazz,gospel and psychedelic funk then any of Prince's previous music.None of the songs are particularly single worthy (same as with 'Lovesexy for the most part) but once you turn this music on it is so captivating you won't want to turn it off,even if your not a Jehovah's Witness.And for that this is another impressive triumph in a long line of them for Prince.c with a lot of unexpected twists and turns.It features a smaller group of musicians then Prince's other bands and it shares a lot more in common with jazz,gospel and psychedelic funk then any of Prince's previous music.None of the songs are particularly single worthy (same as with 'Lovesexy for the most part) but once you turn this music on it is so captivating you won't want to turn it off,even if your not a Jehovah's Witness.And for that this is another impressive triumph in a long line of them for Prince.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I wanna be the minority!.....Of people that don't like this album! <br />Includes 3 awesome songs: Warning, Minority, and I saved the best for last, WAITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!(is a very heartwarming soft song that makes you want to cry)
B00005JP4U|1.0|What a crock! Helloooo...if this politician believes so strongly in this subject, why did he not do something about it when he was in a better position to do so? I've got an idea...let's get rid of all the hot air in government first! That would surely make a dent in global warming. But seriously, don't waste your precious time or hard-earned money on this BORING piece of garbage. Spend the time doing something memorable w/ your children instead.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|I am not sure about this one. Mostly winey and bizarre. Pay no reference to it's package design and title, the music within is more like it came from the backwoods. Perhaps someone didn't ask them how often you find barbarous hicks in the space arcade? Remindes me more of someone removing themselves to roam the wilderness....
B00005JNRY|3.0|I am twenty-three and I've been a committed Pixar fan since Toy Story.  I have every movie from Bug's Life to Incredibles; and I rate all but Bug's Life five stars.  Cars was unfortunately not a five star, not even the four star of Bug's Life.   <br /> <br />I think Pixar has forgotten what they do.  They created animated film that appeal to the family. <br /> <br />Cars spends too much time on scenery, and it draws out each moment as if it were some drama reflecting the human condition.  It has neither pep or comedy. <br /> <br />What was done well, was not really what the movie should be.  The most memorable moment is a long romantic drive between two talking cars.
B000E0WJIC|4.0|Yeah I enjoy Killswitch Engage, however the screaming gets to me.  These guys have KILLER harmonies, catchy melodies, and the vocals are a bit edgy at times, however they smooth it out.  I especially like  All These Things I Hate and 4 Words (To Choke Upon). <br /> <br />Get it if you like harder stuff like Avenged Sevenfold, and Killswitch, but are looking for a more original feel.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|My first inclination was to jump on the bandwagon  when WOLFMOTHER came out. After all, I love 1970s-style but*rock as much as anyone, and this album has some great vintage rock stylings, an impressive range of material, and well-crafted songs.<br /><br />I've heard the comparisons between Wolfmother and bands like Deep Purple and Iron Butterfly, but I was surprised to note that they also sometimes sound like early White Stripes. But in addition to resuscitating old school touches like organ riffs, heavy guitars, and even a flute solo (!), Wolfmother sometimes re-creates the painfully bad lyrics that oldtimers will recall from Uriah Heep concerts of yesteryear. I sort of enjoy laughably bad wordplay (go Motorhead!), but there are a couple of songs here (for example \\"Mind's Eye\\") that made even me cringe.<br /><br />Still, I'm not complaining. When Wolfmother gets it right (like on \\"Pyramid\\"), they really nail it. I've enjoyed this CD a good deal, and I'm betting that as the band matures and focuses, they'll develop into the closest thing the 21st century has to stadium rock gods.
B000CNE092|5.0|This warm and romantic film from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman has long been my favorite animated feature. This mostly fictional story of Russia's famous Anastasia and her search for her family is sprinkled with humor and great songs. The animation, from snowy Russia to glamorous Paris, is top-notch and the story is both heartwarming and fun.<br /><br />A great cast of voices, including Meg Ryan (Anastasia), John Cusack (Dimitri), Kelsey Grammer (Vladimir), Christopher Lloyd (Rasputin), and Angela Lansbury as Anastasia's beloved grandmother add depth to an enchanting film. Anastasia wants to leave Russia for Paris because the necklace she wears has the inscription, \\"Together in Paris,\\" which she is sure holds the key to her journey to discover who she is and where she belongs.<br /><br />Dimitri and Vladimir plan to pass her off as the real Anastasia for the reward in exchange for her visa out of Russia. The banter between Anastasia and Dimitri masks a growing attraction, of course, and when Dimitri discovers before she does that she really is Anastasia he knows he must step aside.<br /><br />Complicating matters is the evil Rasputin, who has placed a curse on her family and sold his soul to destroy them. His little fruit bat, Bratok (Hank Azaria), is a very funny creation and turns out to be not so evil at all.<br /><br />The story is peppered throughout with great songs, including \\"Journey to the Past\\" and the haunting \\"Once Upon a December.\\" Anastasia is warm and involving, separating it from other animated films. When Anya discovers she really is Anastasia, it is bittersweet, as she now must choose between her past and her future. Love may conquer all, but not if the evil Rasputin has his way.<br /><br />This is a heartfelt and funny animated feature you'll want to own and watch over and over. This particular edition comes with lots of extras for hours of family fun. Don't miss this one.
B000001FMX|5.0|I first saw the NY Dolls on a Tuesday night in the Oscar Wilde room of the Mercer Art Center. NY Daily News columist Lillian Roxon ran their photo, and called for a boycott of the Rolling Stones playing MSG. The Dolls are the future of rock & roll she claimed. She was right, but it took 30 years for people to realize it. Their first album is a classic. The songs still breath fire - Personality Crisis, Looking for a Kiss, Jet Boy... Only a true N'Yawker can rhyme \\"happened\\" with \\"Manhattan\\" like David Jo in Frankenstein. There was a dead zone in music - the Velvets were gone, the Stooges on hiatus, corporations were churning out bilge with \\"singer songwriters\\" and \\"easy listening\\" bands like the Eagles. Up from the bowels of the subway, and out of the boroughs, the NY Dolls came to stir things up. Going to the clubs at the time I saw all the bands that followed in their wake at their first gigs - the Ramones, Patti Smith, Blondie, Television, Talking Heads, and dozens that fell by the wayside. There would have been no Sex Pistols, no UK punk, without them. If you don't own this, there's a big gapping hole in your collection. RIP Johnny, Jerry, Arthur & Billy. Rock forever, David & Syl!
B0007P3582|1.0|God this guy is absolutely pathetic, he's now one of the richest people in music but for doing what? Wearing excessive gold, not having an ounce of talent in his body? for singing in his childish lyrics how much of a bad *ss he is or for getting shot however many times ( which unfortunately didn't kill the b***ard ). The answer is yes; this is why he is rich. It's worrying to know there are enough plain stupid people in this world to actually buy this c**p, just goes to show how much unoriginal land sheep like these people are to just go with the trend and \\"enjoy\\" listening to this p**ck.  <br /> <br />Like basically every other Hip - Hop artist to exist today, the stuff they write about and get paid millions of dollars for isn't in my opinion music - Some uneducated piece of s**t from a broken home basically talking about how hard there life is and how rich they are now. And when it comes to Hip Hop, the actual music its self is only 50 perCENT of the cra**y package, oh no because not only are these losers showing off in their lyrics, their image and the way they present themselves on TV to them is just as important. It's almost impossible these days to flick through the music channels and not fins some idiot wearing to much gold, baggy clothing leaning up against some flash car with half a dozen women surrounding him because as far as there concerned music is about image when it is anything but that. Music's about meaningful lyrics, proper instruments, i.e. a guitar if any of you hip hop fans know that that is and melody. Posing yes, I agree this c**ks pi**es all over any other musician when it comes to posing, but sadly I don't think any talented musician would really care about that because they can feel comfortable wearing regular clothing as they don't need expensive over the top garments to make themselves feel good as their music can make them feel good enough.  <br /> <br />So there we have it my review, I'm sure a lot of you want to kill me for writing this, if so your either a complete r**ard or just scared to face the fact that your one of the sheep in the mindless flock.
B000001GQJ|5.0|I've never paid attention to the Liszt Sonata until I heard this recording. I canNOT BELIEVE some people are calling her without soul or \\"muddy\\"... This is the single most inspiring and shocking CD. Really gives you chills when you listen to it. Makes your heart beat faster.
B000058983|5.0|I bought the expanded / remastered version of this C.D. a couple of years ago.  It contains extensive liner notes (which I still have not read).  I wanted to write this review before I read the liner notes so I would not be biased or influenced in my own comments toward the album. <br /> <br />Forever Changes (January 1968) is truly one of the unique, hidden gems of the late sixties by one of rock music's first racially integrated bands.  I was first exposed to the album in 1969 when my older brother used to play his copy on eight-track tape!  Love's previous album from 1967, Da Capo, was lighter and more \\"trippy,\\" and in keeping with other music from the \\"summer of love\\" year. Check out such tracks as 7 And 7 Is, Orange Skies and She Comes In Colors.  However, while Da Capo was a great album, Forever Changes is OUTSTANDING!  It resulted in Arthur Lee's finest musical and lyrical moments.  Even today you can hear the song, Alone Again Or, played on satellite stations in malls across America (although Alone Again Or was written by Love's other vocalist and songwriter, Bryan MacLean who wrote two tracks on the album). <br /> <br />Forever Changes is a \\"deep\\" and moody album with esoteric, surreal and socially conscious lyrics which cannot be thoroughly understood.  Even some of the song titles have a surreal quality to them.  Some of the topics expressed in the lyrics include war, materialism, territoriality, alienation, loss of individuality and identity, personal freedom, sage wisdom and yes, even love (no pun intended)!  Vivid lyrical imagery permeates all the songs. <br /> <br />Musically, the album is a melange of psychedelic folk-rock, classical forms and even a tinge of jazz.  The melodies are hauntingly and wistfully beautiful with both acoustic and electric guitars as well as complex rhythms at times.  In fact, the fade-ins and fade-outs and production effects at the end of \\"The Good Humour Man He Sees Everything Like This\\" sound like there are \\"skips\\" in themusic! The strings and horns add to the haunting quality of the album.  This is a great album to listen to on rainy, summer days! <br /> <br />This album rates with some of the finest albums of the day, including Sgt. Pepper's..., Pet Sounds, Days Of Future Passed and Odessey And Oracle.  If you haven't heard this album you have missed out on a significant slice of pop culture!
B000FQJAIW|2.0|I would like to thank all of you who wrote the reviews of new hope on dvd. I almost got suckerd !!! I have been waiting for them to come out on dvd my vhs's are trashed. I can't believe it is not in wide screen what is the point.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|There is not a single song on here I don't like!!!  I find myself listening to Tearjerker over and over, as the lyrics are great and Jonathan Davis does a wonderful job singing it.  He doesn't sound feminine or hit falsetto, like another review has claimed. <br /> <br />I've loved Korn ever since they came out, and this album is a must have for any fan.
080701429X|5.0|Frankl touches upon the most fundamental aspect to some of the psychiatric problems (and non-psychiatric) that face us today: life lacking meaning. his genius and foresight that is seen as he details his experiences and perspective while in the camps is a feat, or rather a level of magnitude, to which we should all aspire.  I read the book in 1 1/2 days, it was a truly compelling read. I hope it affects everyone else as positively as it affected me.  Happy (or at least \\"meaningful\\") reading.  <br />-S.

2070513289|5.0|_This is the sort of tale that a person writes when he steps back and takes an objective look at civilization. This was the point of view of the author, stranded as he was in the Sahara with a broken aeroplane and on the edge of life and death. It was there and then that he met the only person in his life that he was ever really able to talk to- the apparition of the Little Prince.<br /><br />_This Little Prince was the sole inhabitant of a tiny garden-like world that was not much bigger than he was. It was there that he tended a single rose. However, this single rose was both delicate and difficult and finally drove him away. In his descent the prince encountered other worlds with a single inhabitant. They were all adults and all obsessed with illusions: authority, conceit, drink, wealth, duty, facts... They were all ridiculous and very strange. And then he fell to Earth. While Earth was much larger and had many more people than the other worlds they all seemed to share the same obsessions and illusions. He found it a place where a man could own a garden of thousands of roses such as the one that he had left, and yet appreciate none of them.<br /><br />_In fact, it was from a fox and not from men that the prince finally learned a secret worth knowing: it is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. Men have forgotten this truth as they rush about in pursuit of the unreal and the unimportant. How appropriate that our Little Prince should receive this most Sufic doctrine of the \\"eye of the heart\\" in North Africa. May all of us similarly acquire such wisdom in our own brief, ephemeral sojourn on Earth.
B000001Y5X|5.0|Marilyn Manson's outstanding 1994 debut set out as a '90s revolution. It is extremely rare finding a band or an artist who can both sound well and actually having something to say! This is dark,industrial rock produced by then buddy Trent Reznor.Extraordinary I must say.All alternative rock fanatics should proceed.
B000BVD460|1.0|i had the MOST unfortunate chance to ride with two individuals yesterday who popped this piece of drivel into the CD player. GOD, i have NEVER wanted to be DEAF before ... but during the HELLISH playing of this crud, i truly wished for a cease to my hearing abilities.<br /><br />i can't figure this moron out. From the beginning, i heard him gripe and moan about not having a father (excuse me whilst i wipe a tear away), practically BEGGING for a pity party. The next song, he proclaims to be a Bad*ss, who's gonna kick yer *ss. Which is it, Marshall?<br /><br />The \\"Toy Soldiers\\" rip-off was a laughable attempt at being vocal on current issues (wow, M&M says the war is unjust, so it must be true!!) The chorus portion of the song was sped up to some ridiculous speed to match the \\"tempo\\" of his ramblings. Jeez, this song was so STUPID it made my teeth hurt.<br /><br />Then, there was the mangling of Heart's \\"Crazy on You\\". Again, the sample was sped up to where Ann Wilson sounded like Alvin the Chipmonk.<br /><br />There were other songs on here that, if it were not for the melodies of the songs he was ripping off, he couldn't have found his way out of a songwriting paper sack.<br /><br />He then proceded to ramble on about how \\"controversial\\" he is and how people (prolly people like ME) are \\"afraid\\" of him and \\"offended\\" by him. Get this straight, M&M, you are not even on my \\"i give a rat's behind\\" radar. The only reason i am writing this review is because i was FORCED to sit through your poorly written and contrived CD.<br /><br />So, in closing, this disc is animal fodder. It is not fit to hang from a low-rider's rearview mirror. This disc is a waste of technology.<br /><br />BAD, BAD, BAD attempt at \\"rapping\\", folks. Forced rhymes, out of tempo ramblings. Just BAD. GOD, it was BAD.<br /><br />Bad.<br /><br />Bad, bad ... and uh ... BAD.
B000005HLV|5.0|OK, I'll keep this short and sweet:<br /><br />Mayhem have their own unique sound. What stands out most on this CD, to me at least, is how *good* it sounds.  The sound on this record is awesome, especially on your first listen when you expect it to be along the lines of the usual low-fi black metal recordings from this time period.  Mayhem did one heck of a job recording this.<br /><br />The music flows from one song to the next like waves of sound.  The music is awesome.<br /><br />Vocals?  Well, let's say they are weird.  Again, on your first listed you gonna wonder what the heck is going on here. Atilla's vocals on this record are just plain strange.  They grow on you after a while, but I still wonder what's wrong with the dude.<br /><br />Great record, and an essential recording for lovers of fine metal..
B0008JIJ2E|4.0|I just saw this yesterday for the first time in about 15 years.  I was not terribly impressed.  I like the idea, and the storyline.  But after years it seems dated and unimpressive.<br /><br />I was particulary thrown off by the fighting.  I thought it seemed fake.  I did not get captured up into the excitement of it.  I know the first time I saw it was in the theater.  I don't think we even had a VCR when this came out.<br /><br />I really liked Elizabeth Shue, and it reminded me how many movies she plays the nice girl next door. Or the girlfriend.  She really does well in this roll, as she does in many other movies.<br /><br />I had forgotten about the \\"friend\\" that our \\"kid\\" meets when he moves into the new apartment building.  He was so friendly to him helping him bring his bike upstairs.  But where is he at school?  This made no sense to me.  I think the director should have had a few scenes where his new friends were with him at school.  Suddenly, the kid is alone.  Yet he has all this charisma and charm to be next to his new girl.  And costantly at the irk of his new found nemesis.<br /><br />Okay, so he's from the wrong side of the tracks, and this girl lives in a mansion?  Why do they even go to the same highschool?  Its not a private school, its a public school.  And students go to public schools in their neighborhood. If he's from Reseda (spelling) and she's from the hills, than why are they even on the same planet?<br /><br />None of this made sense to me. But ignoring this, I thought the final fight scene would be great.  And everything would be well again.  But it had totally lost its lustre in my eyes.  No more excitement, just stupididty.<br /><br />I didn't like this movie too much on DVD.  Kind of corny.  I meant to give it 3 stars.
B000FFJ85I|1.0|give up, ur not good, nor will u ever. my sister got this cd, i overheard a screamo/post hardcore sound for like 2 seconds and that realized it was this horrible band, if u respect music in any shape or form dont buy this
B000062Y98|4.0|As a 30-something fan of 70's and 80's heavy metal greats such as Black Sabbath, Rush, Iron Maiden, (early) Metallica, and (early) Queensryche, my introduction to Blind Guardian was \\"Nightfall in Middle Earth\\" about five years ago, and I felt like I had found a new friend, so to speak.  Blind Guardian can be described sonically as a cross between Metallica, Queen, and Iron Maiden, but with a special taste for Arthurian and Tolkienesque themes (with, I suspect, some thinly-hidden allusions to the evils of the Nazi era of Germany), and some of their most stirring pieces have an actual bardic minstrel feel to them that might not be out of place in Renaissance music.  They are a band for fantasy-lovers who like aggressive, pounding heavy music, but who appreciate a rousing melody and layered vocal arrangements. <br /> <br />Being really taken with NIME as I was, I had mixed feelings about \\"A Night at the Opera\\".  Generally speaking, the massive chorale layers are there still, as well as the cataclysmic drumming and strident, proud Brian-Mayish layered guitar-work.  The fantasy themes with the veiled references to modern issues remain.  (Some of the not-quite polished English remains: they've gotten a lot better over the years, but they could still use the input from a native-English speaker in crafting their lyrics.)  But this album seems to have lost some of the bardic feel of their previous releases, with some exceptions granted for specific tracks.  They are experimenting more in this album, and it shows in the complexity of the layering and the epic length work \\"And Then There Was Silence\\"  As other reviewers have noted, however, something of the intimacy and emotion was lost.  I am anxious to see if, in their next album, they are better able to integrate their progressive experimentation and the more bardic, poetic elements that shined more on NIME.  Now a summary of tracks with an interpretive gloss on lyrics. <br /> <br />PRECIOUS JERUSALEM <br />A thundering androusing introduction to the album.  The lyrics seem to take the perspective of a Hebrew prophet or Messiah bewailing the state of Israel and the state of that divided city in the Holy Land.  <br /> <br />BATTLEFIELD <br />A commentary on how futile wars get waged when people put a leader on a pedestal and follow them blindly into battle.  Strong and stirring music, though more reflective than the first track. <br /> <br />UNDER THE ICE <br />It's often not good to be the bearer of bad news because you can be made a scapegoat like poor Cassandra (the Trojan prophetess who prophesied the doom of Troy).  \\"You're the artificial enemy, an illusion we all need for our sake\\" seems to me to be a reference to Nazi persecution of the Jews.  The music has a slightly Middle-Eastern feel and the lyrics are suitably grim and menacing. <br /> <br />SADLY SINGS DESTINY <br />A song about Jesus from the guilt-ridden perspective of Judas.  Not a high point for me on the album, but not a bad track. <br /> <br />THE MAIDEN AND THE MINSTREL KNIGHT <br />This track seems like a missed opportunity to really display the band's minstrelsy.  The protagonists they're referring to may be Sir Tristram and Iseult (who in the Arthurian legends had the unpleasant misfortune of being married to the cowardly, but vicious King Marke of Cornwall).  The idea of the piece is touching and gallant: the lady waiting to be delivered from bondage by the minstrel knight and the knight waiting for the right opportunity to deliver her.  I think the piece would have benefited by being made more acoustical and Renaissancy with less of the thundering guitars and drums.  The quiet, reverent mood established early in the piece is ruined by the metallic treatment in the rest of the song.  As the piece is in the middle of the album, it would have provided a nice acoustic interlude, a pause in the action before the aggressiveness of the rest of the album. <br /> <br />WAIT FOR AN ANSWER <br />The lyrics seem to be anexhortation to keep one's eyes open and think for oneself and not place too much faith in authority to provide an answer.  The music here is bright and upbeat, being in a major key. <br /> <br />THE SOULFORGED <br />A song about the troubled and complex figure of the wizard Raistlin from the Dragonlance series, sung from his perspective.  This is one of my favorite tracks of the album, one of the most bardic and epic tracks with a driving and melodic riff, and one which I think capture Blind Guardian's artistic essence. <br /> <br />AGE OF FALSE INNOCENCE <br />I wonder if this is a first: a heavy metal song about Galileo!  Galileo is here lamenting the recantation the Church has forced out of him about the earth's travel around the sun rather than vice versa.  (He even compares himself with Judas for making the recantation, though maybe the apostle Peter would have been a better comparison.)  Musically, not my favorite track, but I salute them for their subject matter. <br /> <br />PUNISHMENT DIVINE <br />I believe this song is about the late nineteenth century philosopher Nietzsche who played quite a part in attacking Christian beliefs, while lamenting the chaos his view might imply for the foundations of morality.  The piece (told from his perspective) suggests that Nietzsche deep down wished he could be a religious believer because of the difficulty accepting the conclusions his own views implied.  The music is decent enough, but it is overshadowed by the mammoth epic that is... <br /> <br />AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE <br />This was intended to be the high point of the album, and I think it succeeds.  It is a heavy metal epic retelling of the mythical events leading up to the Trojan War: the amorous abduction of Greek Helen by Trojan Paris, and the revenge that would be visited on them by the Greeks.  Even though the events are all before the war, you can almost see the city burning at the end of the piece and smell the smoke.  There are some quirky transitionsbetween sections in the piece, but some memorable moments that do them proud musically: for example the section \\"misty tales and poems lost...  all the bliss and beauty will be gone.\\" <br /> <br />MIES DEL DOLOR <br />This is a Spanish translation of an earlier song \\"Harvest of Sorrow\\" (which I haven't heard in English yet).  It is more acoustical and quiet in texture and a charming ending to the album.  I only wish they might have had more of a Spanish flavor to the music itself to match. <br /> <br />This is an album worth having, though I would recommend people start with \\"Nightfall in Middle Earth\\" or \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\" if they're not familiar with Blind Guardian.  I am encouraged by their progressiveness in this album, but I hope they are able to keep the bardic touch that is their trademark and I think a part of their own deep inspiration in future releases.  I'm also hoping they have a bit more quiet, acoustical pieces in their future albums to provide contrast to the heavy pieces.  (This was a nice feature of NIME.)  I anxiously await their next album.
1400032717|5.0|As the mother of an autistic three-year-old daughter, I was apprehensive to read this novel. However, despite the tears, I'm glad I did. Haddon wonderfully captures some of the idiosyncratic behaviors of the autistic, drawing in readers who want to understand what takes place in such minds. The minute details enable the reader to make a personal connection with a narrator who, ironically, cannot make his own personal connections in society. Today 1 out of every 166 babies born will have a form of autism. Hopefully, the popularity of Haddon's tale will create more awareness of the hurdles these children face.
B000002LGA|5.0|Seventeen years after 'Transformer' his most acclaimed work Lou Reed returns to the streets of his hometown to seek inspiration for this, his fifteenth solo album.He states in his liner notes that 'New York' is meant to be listened to in one sitting as if it were a play or film.After listening it is not difficult to see why.From the opening bars of 'Romeo Had Juliet' to the closing seconds of 'Dime Store Mystery' Reed takes the listener on a journey through the sleazy,drug fuelled,hooker laden,crime ridden streets of the Big Apples' less affluent suburbs.  Lou sets the scene for the album on 'Romeo Had Juliet' with the opening line \\"Caught between the twisted stars,the plotted lines,the faulty map that brought Columbus to New York\\".The more subdued but no less effective 'Halloween Parade(AIDS)' follows and then leads onto the first single and lyrically,the most vivid song on the album 'Dirty Blvd'.It is the story of Pedro,a young,immigrant kid with nine siblings,living in a squalid squat and beaten regularly by his father but remains optimistic and hopes to escape.\\"He finds a book on magic in a garbage can,looks up at the cracked ceiling and says at the count of three I want to fly...fly away\\".The subject of child abuse continues on the harrowing,thought provoking 'Endless Cycle' and then the tempo increases with the hard rocking 'There Is No Time'.  'The Last Great American Whale' is a sarcastic yet conscientious swipe at the destruction of the environment and decline of our fellow creatures.Reed also vents his spleen throughout on topics such as pontificating '(Good Evening Mr Waldheim'),politicians('Strawman') and the plight of Vietnam veterans and the homeless as in 'Xmas In February'.\\"Sam's staring at the Vietnam wall,it's been a while now since he's home,his wife and kid have left,he's unemployed,he's a reminder of the war that wasn't won\\".The lyrics are better than anything Reed has written previously but he also plays the guitar well and surrounds himself with able musicians.Mike Rathke on guitar and the rythym section of Rob Wasserman and Fred Maher are tight and raw which gives the record a garage feel.  Dion Dimucci appears on backing vocals on 'Dirty Blvd' and ex Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker appears on the Andy Warhol dedicated 'Dime Store Mystery'.  'New York' is widely regarded as Lou Reed's masterpiece.On it's release he said \\"This is as good as I get\\".Artists often say this,however bad the rest of us find the product.Hindsight is sometimes a wonderful thing and offers repeated reflection but after almost two decades since it's release many would find it difficult to disagree with Lou Reeds statement.
B000F48CD8|5.0|We all know by now that Jack White is a genius and can do no wrong and that this a great album, but I am here to tell you about an even better band, Rose Hill Drive. These guys are the real rock and roll deal. If you like rock and roll at all then check their ep out here on amazon, it is truly brilliant.
0440234743|5.0|Troy Phelan is an old man who is dying fast. He is the 10th richest man on the Earth with a net worth of over $11 billion. For the past several months he has been writing and rewriting his will and testament to split his money as he sees fit. His three ex-wives and seven children all anxiously await his death and their chance to claim a piece of the $11 billion pie. The first of many surprises happens early on with Mr. Phelan's death and more importantly what is in the contents of the will. In his last will before his death there was not a single word about any of his ex-wives or children. The only name given any money to was an illegitimate child of Phelan named Rachel Lane, a missionary living deep in the swaps of the Pantanal in Brazil. This kicks of a vicious legal battle. Nate O'Riley becomes the one man who can change the outcome of the matter, given the job of finding the woman in the jungle, where every decision can mean life of death. <br /> The quest of Nate is an adventure full of suspense, action, discovery, and surprises. Meanwhile, the legal battle in the states becomes bigger and bigger, while the magnitude of the stakes and the personality of the characters begins to really come out. John Grisham took two intertwining settings and plots to create the best of his books that I have read. I thought that all the plot twists made for a very quick read. At many points in the book I felt that I wasn't going to be able to stop reading because of all the action, suspense, and the writing style.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This a great Album and one of the best of the peppers career after Californication and bloodsexsugarmagik. Everyone here already knows how great this album is though so I am going to tell you about a band that you have to hear, Rose Hill Drive. They have an ep here on amazon and it is simply the best thing released this year. These guys rock with the fire of Zeppelin, but don't rip Zeppelin doing it. Trust me if you like rock and roll at all you have got to listen to these guys, they are the future of rock and roll.
B00005JOYA|5.0|Admitedly, I have played all four games through - each more than once. I suppose that makes the film all that much more enjoyable, but at the same time allowed me to see just how darn good this movie really is.<br /><br />Silent Hill has a somewhat complicated plot. I think that a lot of the comments relating to this movie not making sense, are due to the complexity of the story. Since the film makers took so much from the game, it is clear to see how well done this movie is.  I don't want to spoil anyone's fun here, so I won't spill all the details. For those who have played the games, I'm sure there's little new stuff here, but for anyone checking out Silent Hill for the first time, I ask that you don't give in to the idea that \\"If you didn't catch it, then it is not there.\\" I have played Silent Hill 2 at least eight times, and I'm still catching some really cool stuff - as I'm sure the movie will do for me when it is released on DVD.<br /><br />This is a story about a place that has become corrupted by religion - through and through. It is kind of like a disease. It spreads. Consumes. Devours. And in horror, that is like sitting down to your favorite meal. It's all there. Characters you want to see overcome, others you want to see torn apart. Monsters. Being alone in the dark. Blood. Rusty knives.<br /><br />At the core of Silent Hill is a mystery.  Why has this town become such a twisted and horrific place?  Why does it change when the siren calls? What draws someone to a place like this?  And these questions are answered. And new ones arise. Something I would beg a sequal for, though it isn't as though there should have to be one. I'm happy with what I got here.<br /><br />If you have an open mind and enjoy the essence of horror, mystery, and suspense, I don't think you can go wrong. Of course, there is no one film that everyone will enjoy. It usually comes down to taste and the mental outlook of the viewer. I would recomend checking this place called Silent Hill out when the DVD arrives. (The film came out two months ago, so you might not get the chance of the theater experience.) It is creepy, mysterious, interesting, emotional, and, at times, downright scary. And that's good, right?Silent Hill out when the DVD arrives.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Everyone knows that Pearl Jam is a great band and that is a good album by know so I am going to tell you about a new band that you have got to listen to. Their name is Rose Hill Drive, and they rock with a fire unseen since Led Zeppelin. IF you want to see the return of rock and roll then check these guys out and give them your support. Their Ep is here on amazon and their album is coming out in August, be ready for the music world to be turned upside down.
B000001DQI|5.0|As great as this alnbum is it still doesn't get the respect it deserves.  Maybe because his briliance was so effortless, or that he was not the sole songwriter, or that he was so prolific in this time span that people didn't have time to catch their breath... but on simple product alone I place this albumn in the top ten of the Rock/Pop era.  That's right, top ten. This is a double album that never loses strength.  It makes you believe he could have produced a TRIPLE album that was just as strong.  This album is a total experience.  The artwork and liner notes are a perfect compliment to the eclectic song selection.  The songs are so well crafted and so well produced it almost seems as though they were handed down from above.  Add this album to your collection immediately.
B00003CXC6|4.0|Kurosawa stands out as one of the great directors of modern cinema.  This movie in particular is often cited as a shining example of his artistry. <br /> <br />The sets, lighting and cinemotagraphy are superb.  Where the film falters is in editing.  It is choppy in parts to the point of being laughable.   <br /> <br />Add to that the scenery chewing overacting of Toshirô Mifune and the viewer is left with the sense that Kurosawa missed the mark on this ambitious project. <br /> <br />The great director resorts to some rather hamfisted sentimentalities at the end as he attempts to salvage the tale's sound and fury into something of significance.  He is only partially successful.  \\"Faith in man\\" is no faith at all, except (apparently) when compared to what otherwise would be our confidence that mankind is not worthy of our faith.
B000FGGE68|1.0|basically, the only excuse i can think of for this movie's existence is that Mila Jovovovovshvjsoich loves to \\"strike a pose\\", because that's really all this is.<br /><br />well, i say \\"all\\", and i just watched the first 30 minutes.<br /><br />horrible.<br /><br />there hasn't been a good sci-fi film in so long.
1400032717|5.0|This fresh and original tale, told from the viewpoint of an autistic boy, will make you laugh, cry and think all at the same time. The boy, Christopher, can give you the answer to 251 x 864 in a second, but can't figure out how other people think. You'll fall in love with this young man and cheer him on as he tries to sort out his life with a mind that can't filter out excess information.
0783240287|5.0|There are three things you should probably know about me \\"right at the get-go\\"  as a reviewer.  First, I am not hugely into musicals.  Second, I am not a bible thumper in any stretch of the word.  Third, I was never an Osmond fan growing up.  These things aside,  \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\"  DVD with Donny Osmond is terrific!   I saw parts of this on PBS sometime during the 90s and at that time liked what I saw.  Last summer I was big into Egypt, so picked this DVD up for \\"treadmill time\\".  It kept me hopping, that's for sure!  The music is   \\"catchy\\" and even now I find myself humming parts of it from time to time.  The casting, sets, and even the camera angles are pretty much flawless.   Donny Osmond is particularly good in this production. He manages to go from a boastful young  Joseph to a successful and finally also to a wise Joseph over the course of the musical and does it in a way that is neither too \\"lightweight\\" or too \\"heavy\\".  He's  just right.  Also, I remember when he sang in the 70s he had this irritating way of changing pitch for emphasis.  Not so in this production.  He also seems far more attractive now than he did before.     <br /> <br />So check out this DVD!  It's lots of fun and just about anyone would probably enjoy it.   Due to its wide appeal it also would make a nice gift.
0385338686|4.0|Charming book, will laugh often.  The plot is a little unplausible but funny.  I can see Renee Zellweiger playing in the movie.  Whenever I read these books that take place in England, I become delighted with their vocabulary.........words like bullocks, nickers (panties) and the wonderful adjective that even men use, 'lovely.'  Another book in a similar genre but not British is 'Match Me If You Can' by Susan Elizabeth Phillips.  Another wonderful book to take to the beach.
B000AU9UYM|2.0|Rehashes the same 'moral' question about vigilantism as any Batman movie, but without action or laughs.  The whole corrupt city being saved by a rich man is so simplistic and trite as to appeal to only the most sycophantic libertarian. <br /> <br />Holmes' character is totally pointless.  Bale, who is obviously talented after 'The Machinist', is emotionally flat.  And the great actors of Caine and Morgan are left on the sidelines- one to explain emotion and one to explain gadgets. <br /> <br />I wish I hadn't seen it as it erases some of my memories of Keaton and Bassinger and Nicholas in a movie that had thrills and laughs...
B000EHSVS2|4.0|Yes, an outstanding movie, but there are apparently some bad transfers in this edition.  On an HD 50\\" widescreen the images were slightly grainy & not sharp.  As originally presented in 70 mm Patton had outstanding visual clarity completely absent from the dvd I purchased from Amazon.  Other dvd's in my collection played on the same equipment have markedly superior picture quality.
B0009KA7BS|2.0|Hmm.. I actually really like Keanu, but this was not a good role for him.  If he had played it a bit more like Depp in 'Pirates...' it may have been ggoofy fun.  The only amusement comes from Swinton and Stormare as Gabriel and Satan respectively.  Plus, Gavin (Bush's frontman) is creepy enough.  Weisz's performance is nothing special (her accent always stinks!).  <br /> <br />As people have said the story makes no sense.  It is tentative in its storytelling... is this an action film or a religious film?  Problem is it fails to be either or both. The only grace outside of Stormare and Swinton is that the visuals are cool. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this, just walk away, rewatch the Matrix or something like the Ninth Gate for creepy religous movies.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I love Star Wars. But I have lost all respect for George Lucas.  Like many of the fans. <br />  Why? Because he is a liar. He promises and says statements but does not keep his word. He wasn't going to release the DVD version of 4,5,6 until 3 was out on DVD. He lied. And I bought the laser disc of this version in 1997. It was advertised as something like \\"own the originals for the last time\\". He gave statements that he would never again release them and forever forward would be the new updated versions with the added extra special effects. <br />   George is money hungry. He is a billionaire but he needs a constant influx of money to keep his own empire going. What else does George have or do but Star Wars? His own directing abilities were in serious question, as well as his writing skills when Star Wars 1,2,and 3 hit the theaters. I read once that The Rolling Stones, when their accountant said \\"You boys are getting low on funds\\", hit the road for yet another tour so they can keep up their lifestyle. George simply releases Star Wars again. There will be other releases, usually two years or so apart when his wallet gets a little thinner (but not much). He should have a plaque on his desk that says \\"A foolish Wookie and his money are soon parted\\".
B000002H33|3.0|First up, I am NOT a heavy metal follower, so this review is basically to help other people like myself. Hopefully I can identify some songs for you which have 'cross-over' appeal. I tend to like \\"hook\\" laden songs, and the ones below have either a good melody going for it, or a good rhythm.    This is probably Metallica's best album, but I don't think they have ever really made a great album, at least not the ones I have heard [p.s. Reload changes that...see my review of that great album on this board].    One of the standout tracks on this album is:     Welcome Home:    For people not into heavy metal music, this song could be the one that opens the door for you. It has a really good slow melody opening the song [a very nice bass melody on bass or guitar], and the initial vocals are slow and melodic too. A really top melodic combination. The song eventually veers into heavy metal territory, but the initial feel of this piece is well worth the effort. I'm actually quite growing fonder of this song's slide into metal-it's not as disappointing as I initially found it-though lyrically, it goes from being poignant to being a \\"B\\" movie type scenario, a la, say, the horror movie \\"Halloween\\". This would have to be one of Metallica's five best songs. I think they probably only have five high quality songs. If this song wasn't promoted as a single, you have to wonder what people behind the band were thinking. Definitely top 40 material.    another reason to get the album-    Orion:    This is a very nice instrumental. I really liked the guitar rhythm for the first half of this song. Initially, I disliked the change of groove of this song, about halfway into it, but I am less against it now. The second half is perhaps in the same league as Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\"...sort of spaced out music. In fact, this track really seems to be two entirely different instrumentals but just stuck together out of convenience. If you're not into heavy metal, try listening to this instrumental first, and then listen to Welcome Home. These are the two best tracks on this album.     Best of the rest:    Battery:    As with a lot of Metallica songs, they go for interesting intros to tracks-something melodically interesting, before veering into heavy metal. The intro to this track could stick in your head, so long as you repeatedly listened to it. Damage Inc. also has an interesting intro, but not as good as this one's.    Finally, I think Metallica are at their best when they come up with good song introductions and deliver a quality melody to go with that introduction. Welcome Home fits that bill. The song writing on this album is of a very good standard, but, unfortunately, isn't matched with music of the same high order as Welcome Home. There are some ok songs on the album though, apart from the ones that I've already mentioned, including The Thing That Should Not Be.    If Metallica ever release a best of cd, Welcome Home and Orion are absolute MUST HAVE selections from this album. Since they don't have so many songs as good as Welcome Home, I think Battery is also a good afterthought of a song to put on a best of compilation.    I've removed my initial reference to wanting to give this album 2.5 stars out of 5. I'm calling it a flat 3 stars out of 5 album [3.5/5] tops. Of the Metallica albums I've listened to, I'd say that 3 are \\"essential\\"-namely, \\"Master of puppets\\", \\"Reload\\" and \\"Black\\". These are all decent albums [at least]. And whilst albums like \\"Ride the lightning\\" have absolute classic songs like \\"Fade to black\\", I think a decent compilation of Metallica songs would make purchasing albums like that and \\"And justice for all\\" redundant. Haven't heard \\"Garage days\\" or \\"S&M\\" but am interested in checking them out. Don't have a high opinion of albums like \\"Load\\", \\"Kill 'em all\\", \\"A.J.F.A\\" or \\"R.T.L\\".    P.S. I've also reviewed the following cds by Metallica at this site:    Reload  Load  and Ride the lightning    as well as Megadeth's\\"Greatest hits\\" and Iron Maiden's \\"Ed Hunter\\" cd.    I recommend the album \\"Completion makes the tragedy\\" by the new band Coldseed-which I've reviewed at this site recently.    P.P.S. Here are some songs I consider to be classics of the metal genre:    Metallica: Fade to black    Megadeth: Prince of darkness    Iron Maiden: Run to the hills     AC/DC: Hell's bells
0944092705|5.0|I own a first edition of this book and it is printed a little bit better than the 3rd edition. That's the only other printing I've seen. Maybe this new edition improves on the printing.     Either way, it's a beautiful collection of work.
B0000026DJ|5.0|I just noticed that I reviewed this album years ago, as \\"A music fan\\" [October 23, 1999]. Since I've listened to this album again in the meantime, I thought I'd try and do a more informative job this time!].    As per my original review, I have to say that it is an open question of whether this album is the Oils best, or \\"10-1\\" takes the honour.    Initially, my reaction was that the album had a killer opening three tracks. On relistening to it, it gets better, as some songs grow on you even more.    Here are my favourite tracks:    Beds are burning: pop/rock classic, melodic and clangy at the same time.    Put down that weapon: sort of in the same vein as \\"10-1\\"'s \\"Short memory\\". The track is a slow pop song that has a brilliant change of pace...a delicious bass riff veers into hyper, clangy rock, and then returns to a slow send off. Terrific stuff.    Dreamworld: one fan told me that the lead singer was a big fan of The Beach Boys. I'd always considered this song as a Beach Boys style song. It's my favourite song from the album, probably. Not the best intro, but once the harmonies and melodies kick in, it's a terrific pop song.    The dead heart: this is a real sing-a-long pop song. You should find the \\"do do do do do do\\"'s really catchy.    Sell my soul: this is the song that has REALLY grown on me-a lost Oils classic, a la \\"Sleep\\". I love the attention grabbing, funky opening \\"I am ready. Let's begin\\". Again, the song has strong melody, as is usual for quality Oils songs.    Sometimes: probably the best of the rest.    In my mind, I always think of this album as in the same vein as The Red Hot Chilli Peppers' \\"Californication\\" album. Both albums are immensely strong. This Oils album has really only song which I don't rate that highly, but I can't remember which it is! Californication is like that too, but this Oil's album has stronger songs, and more of them.    Same goes when comparing the Oils \\"10-1\\" album with the Chilli Peppers' \\"Blood sugar sex magik\\". \\"10-1\\" is great because of the four songs on it which form the foundation of the Oils' greatest songs ever. BSSM by the RHCP is also a very good album due to the presence of four songs, but again, I think the Oil's album has the stronger four songs.    P.S.    *** Other Australian cds I've reviewed at this site:     Midnight Oil: \\"10,...,1\\" and others    Skyhooks: The collection    INXS: \\"Kick\\" and \\"Listen like thieves\\" and \\"Anthology\\"    John Farnham: The great Australian songbook       Johnny O'Keefe: Birth of Australian rock'n'roll    Alex Lloyd: Amazing-The best of    The Saints: Know your product-the best of    Rogue Traders: Here comes the drums
1932907009|5.0|I'm venturing down the path of novel writing, but bought Save The Cat! on the high recommendation of a friend who is writing screenplays.  He was right!  It's a fabulous book that I'll read many times.  I found the Beat Sheet tremendously helpful in wrapping my mind around what elements constitute a great story.  After reading STC! I feel I'm much better armed to create stories that people will want to buy. <br />
B000002H2H|2.0|<br />Just finished reviewing \\"Master of puppets\\" and as for that album, I'll just say that I am not a heavy metal fan as such. This review is just to help people that are curious about the band and aren't really fans of heavy metal either. Hopefully I can indentify some songs for you on the album which have 'cross-over' appeal. I tend to like \\"hook\\" laden songs, and the one below has a terrific melody for a hook. <br /> <br />This album has one out and out terrific song- <br /> <br />Fade to black: <br /> <br />This song has a nice accoustic introduction, that bleeds into a beautiful guitar melody about the one minute mark. Yes...beautiful. Heavy metal and beautiful...doesn't seem right, does it? As with Master of Puppets \\"Welcome Home\\", I initially disliked the part where the music veered into heavy metal territory. However, this song has grown on me more than Welcome Home has. This is perhaps Metallica's best song ever-or at least, in the same league as Enter Sandman, which is currently my favourite Metallica song. The sheer magnitude of the heavy metal guitar sounds in the latter part of the song was initially off putting, but I have warmed to it, and it's not so weird to me anymore. <br /> <br />As for the rest of the album- <br /> <br />Fight fire with fire: <br /> <br />This song is the best of the rest. Again, it has a very nice accoustic guitar intro-Spanish flavoured, perhaps, before veering off into heavy metal territory. <br /> <br />Nothing else really stands out on this album-The call of Ktulu is not in the same class as an instrumental as Master of Puppets' \\"Orion\\". It does have some interesting, creepy effects though. <br /> <br />In Metallica's favour, though, is that they are not afraid to mix up their song's feel. Trapped Under Ice, and Escape have an interesting vibe to them. <br /> <br />Should Metallica ever release a best of album, I think that Fade To Black is a definite must have selection. A best of album which included Welcome Home, Fade to black, Memory Remains, Enter Sandman and Orion would be a great album. It's unfortunate that Metallica haven't really ever released a great album...at least not with more than one song that I really like [p.s. Reload changes that...see my review of that great album here]. <br /> <br />N.B. I've also reviewed the following Metallica cds at this site: <br /> <br />Reload <br />Load  <br />and Master of puppets <br /> <br />as well as Megadeth's \\"Greatest hits\\", a Black Sabbath compilation and Iron Maiden's \\"Ed Hunter\\" cd. <br /> <br />P.P.S. Here are some songs I consider to be classics of the metal genre: <br /> <br />Metallica: Fade to black <br /> <br />Megadeth: Prince of darkness <br /> <br />Iron Maiden: Run to the hills [though it doesn't have the quality of the other two in terms of me being willing to listen to it over and over and over again in a short period of time] <br /> <br />AC/DC: Hell's bells
1559408898|5.0|Robocop is a masterpeice - and the Criterion edition is like manna from heaven for fans of this film. It contains all the violence and gore cut from the original cut and makes the film even better in that it helps get the point across. Fans of the movie should seek this one out and show it to people who only have a passing intrest in the film - watch them either light up (like a friend of mine in film school) or turn away in disgust (like an old girlfriend of mine did) either way they won't forget the experience!
0679409920|5.0|Greene takes the reader inside the dreary, cynical world of detente era espionage. The very few people who care about anything larger than themselves are deluded out-of-touch idealists or fanatics. No one will be caught out dreaming of a better world, unless it exists in the past. The 1970's were like that. Castle is neither an idealist nor a fanatic, but he is obsessively in love with his African wife. A secret agreement among apartheid South Africa, England and the US leads to desparate steps and the ultimate denouement.<br /><br />A brilliant portrayal of the spy's inner world. I love John LeCarre's work, but Greene's Maurice Castle excels even LeCarre's George Smiley.
B0002DB50E|5.0|Videodriome is a movie I've been a fan of for years. I use the movie as a test to see if people are REAL movie and horror fans and not just posers. The best part of the film is that any day now Fox will greenlight a reality TV show where twenty-somethings are killed in front of a live studio audience. If you're new to the work of David Croneburg- check this out ASAP and see what all the fuss is about. The Criterion DVD is stacked with extras and the transfer is a thing of beauty.
B00005JOVH|4.0|Me and all my friends agree, best one yet.  After the action packed message of equality and battle against genocide, you are left excited.  My friends hope for yet another sequel, but I have heard the actors conclude the trillogy complete, their contractual obligations complete.   <br /> <br />I grew up reading comics.  Out of all the comic books they have made movies out of, the X-Men holds the most immaginitive, story rich environment for me.  Maybe Batman holds a close second.  My only critisism would be that developing all the characters in a two hour movie can not be easily done.  How do you do justice to the decades of character development covered in the comic book, and complete a story line?  Dispite that, they have done a great job in this movie.
0060764899|5.0|This book is about 4 kids, Edmund, Peter, Susan, and Lucy. They are pretty wealthy kids and live in a pretty nice house. But things start getting weird when Lucy finds this other world in the back of a wardrobe closet that she finds upstairs. She goes into the world and she runs into this faun. His name is Mr. Tumnis. He invites her to his house for tea. After being there for what Lucy thinks is 2 hours, the faun says that he shouldn't let her go because of the White Witch's orders. When Lucy goes back, she thinks that her brothers and sister will be worried because she thinks that she has been gone for 2 hours. When she asks if they are worried, they say \\"no you were only gone for 5 minutes.\\" Then Lucy explains what happened to her and they don't believe her and so they make fun of her. Then, a couple of days later, Edmund goes into the wardrobe and he runs into the White Witch. She bribes him to come with her back to her palace. She asks him if he has any other brothers or sisters and he says yes. So then she sends him back to get them. When he comes back without them, she gets very angered. Read the rest of this great book to see what happens next.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I ordered the DVD sight unseen, based on online reviews (something I've never done, by the way), and I cannot find the words to do justice to it. Wow.   I read the book a couple of months beforehand and liked it a lot, especially because of the social issues and how the internal lives of the characters (especially Margaret & Thornton) are developed by Gaskell. Yet somehow, while watching the miniseries I felt that it was, in some ways, an improvement over the book (sacrilegious though this might sound to fans of the book). This could be because it shows in a few scenes, with great economy, what Gaskell takes pages to tell, about the stresses and strains of the Industrial Revolution, class conflict and poverty, and also about the characters' feelings and motivations. It could also be because several of the characters are strengthened in Sandy Welch's script (Higgins and Bessy being the most notable examples). The early shots of the cotton mill were striking and Welch's line \\"I've seen hell and it's snow white\\" was a highlight for me.   Although I somewhat disagreed with some choices made - such as the circumstances under which the two leads first meet - I still felt that these changes fit in with the overall tone and flow of the adaptation, allowing me to understand or overlook them.   The music was deeply moving and appropriate, and significantly added to the emotional impact of the story. The camera work was very much to my liking, not static unlike many period dramas. As for the acting, I found both Daniela Denby-Ashe AND Richard Armitage convincing; though some think that RA does steal the show, DDA has a very difficult job playing a resilient, reserved character who internalises so many of her struggles. It's worth mentioning that even in the book, Margaret's (DDA's) emotions always have to be kept under wraps, (though I can still sense the tension simmering under the surface); Thornton's angst is more visible somehow, especially in the book, so RA has more material to work with than, say Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice, and he does a wonderful job with it.     Let me quickly add that any comparisons between John Thornton and Darcy are odious and unfair to both, because in the respective books, John's perspective was far better developed than Darcy's. I adore both, though Darcy was my first literary love and so just about sneaks ahead. Thornton is among my top 2-3 favorite literary heroes, though.     And despite my liking for the humorous ending from the book (abrupt though it is), its counterpart in the miniseries, which was, shall we say, more fully developed, was simply sublime.     Someone once said that great film can be made from a very good book, but very rarely (if ever) is great film/TV the product of a great book. Perhaps this is why I will never be completely satisfied with an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice; not to denigrate any of the Pride and Prejudice adaptations, I will always ultimately return to the source for that satisfaction. As far as the book and miniseries versions of North and South are concerned, much as I liked the book, I just might feel differently :-)
B000F39MAQ|5.0|I don't know how the peolple can not rank this DVD with 5 stars!! <br />Netrebko has a beautiful voice, she is a great actress, has squillo, really good high notes, she is really good!!!!! some times you can notice some accent that say that she is not Italian buy in general she is really great, and she is cute!! <br />Villazón is simply out of this world, he does not has a big voice as Maestro Del Monaco or maestro Corelli,  but it's not small voice too, he has a good squillo, good fiato, beautiful mezza voce, high notes, he is a rally good actor, he is in a good shape, and he shows every feelling in the scene with his  <br />voice. Some thing else to consider him out of this world??. <br />Hampson. it's good personally i do not like it soo much. <br />The proposal, i like the traditional but in this case  it's modern, closer from this day, and i like it lot!! <br /> <br />For me its SIMPLY AMAZING  <br />
0802130208|5.0|This book came to me by a friends recommendation. Not knowing what the novel was about, I was surprised to find it to be one of the best novels ever written. In one sentence, its a comic masterpiece. From the first page you are hooked and laughing. The characters are well-written and formed. On the same page you will love Ignatius, piety him, and dislike him. A good story revolves around its characters, not the circumstances. No book does this better then Confederacy. There is no boiler plot, build-up, suspence,or reality. However, it has Ignatius , the most unique character ever written into a novel. He is egotisitc, dirty, a slouch, idealistic, crazy, a day dreaming, narcessitic slob. He doesn't have one redemming quality about him. However, you can never forget him and you don't want to forget him. The sad part is Toole himself. He was an amazing writer, a hidden genius, who died too soon.
B00003CX9E|1.0|I really can't imagine if there is any film that is more boring than Citizen Kane, what would it be like? It's a real torture to sit through this movie. I absolutely hate it.
B00005QFE5|5.0|The Road Home is a tender testament, not a eulogy, of unspoken love. By maintaining a minimalist approach to dialogue, the movie never comes across as too sentimental. It's spareness continues frame by frame. The acting and filming is also restrained, and thereby exquisite. Enduring love is actually very quiet and you see it and feel it in this wonderful movie. YES! Belonging to each other in family and community is beautiful. And it can't be addressed with words. This movie screams humanity across all cultures and all politics.
0812975219|4.0|I just finished off with the second edition of the book. The book is randomly written, but got some good points scattered inside (non-linearity!). Its build up a good foundation for the fact that lot of things in our lives are random, but we often ignore this fact - i dont know whether I should accept that as \\"luck\\", but random events sound more appropriate. This randomness strikes all, more or less equally - and some take advantage of it, and may progress. Some interesting points quoted in the book are -- <br /> <br />1)About risk - manage risks, but dont ignore things because 'they are risky'. Beware of a major blowup. History may not point out to anything - so dont be fooled by trying to justify your points too seriously using stats!! Certain events - Black Swans - can alter the best laid plans - so it can pay to be ultra-conservative, and taking advantage of things when the odds are highly in your favour (as buffett says!). Idea is to figure out how much can you afford to lose, in case a LTCM happens. [easier said than done] <br />2)Non-linearity concept - Things in life are not linear. Good oppurtunties can take time to emerge. Same happens in stock markets, and in this book too, where \\"very\\" good ideas come after a long-boring rambling by Mr.Taleb. <br />3) Noise/incremental information/comments from 'experts'(Not for traders) - He points that observing minute to minute  prices doesnt lead to anything (but may cause emotional drain/depressions). The minute to minute prices just give a small incremental information - which is a unnessary noise.    <br />4)Importance of Pascal's wager - good traders trade based on past observations, but dont ignore the possibility of being wrong and make sure that the results of their being wrong, is limited. <br />5) Biases - anchoring, availability bais, attributional bais - affecting our decision making process. <br />6) Cutting off your emotions, by limiting them with physical constraints. (do see this interesting movie called MOMENTO). Role of emotions in decision making - providing shortcuts. <br />7)Ability to change your own decisions, in event of flow of new information. <br />..and many more things like that. <br /> <br />To an extent, his commentory has made me paranoid about things. With my experience in markets, I can understand that the lots of expected things, may not frutify - so it makes sense not to have delusions or get in denial mode/ use history or data to justify our actions/ and decide conservatively.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|A really good movie as long as you like the genre.  The special effects are well done.  Good charaters from the original following that story line.  I would recommend watching Underworld first to get the true sense of where the story has been. Not for everybody, but those who do should really enjoy.  The film is very stylish.  Expect a lot more action especially from Kate Beckinsale.  Definitely a great sequel but leaves room for at least one more chapter.
B000002KHF|5.0|I happened to hear the song Into the Mystic and ordered the CD just for that one song.  What a pleasant surprise to have this gem of a CD. Every song is so wonderful and moving. I am adrift on the sea of Van Morrison's lovely, unique voice.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|like the previous reviews stated, this album requires at least 3 listens in order to like. you WONT like it at first. you just wont. i didnt, and i was dissapointed and pissed that i waited 3 years for this. now i love it, some songs more than others, at least. after listening to this cd for a couple weeks i realized that sing the sorrow doesnt sound as different from art of drowning as i thought before i got DU. you can definitely see the influence way more. this is not their best cd, this is not their worst cd, this is their most different cd. AFI never ceases to amaze me, and they havent on this record. i like the new sound a LOT. <br /> <br />ive decide what older fans are most sad about is not that they dislike the new sound, its that they'll never have another black sails, all hallows, art of drowning (my personal favorite). i feel awful knowing that AFI will never be the AFI i fell in love with again. when i remember when my older brother was learning to drive and he would listen to all hallows ep over and over again in the car, and i learned to love them. it almost makes me cry when i think back on those memories years ago and then i hear decemberunderground. and then i hear miss murder on the radio and see 10 year old girls dancing in the car next to me. they probably think that decemberunderground was their 2nd cd and i bet they havent heard anything from sing the sorrow either which is just sad. thats another thing old fans are mad about, peoples ignorance and disrespect for what made AFI what they are. just listen to answer that and stay fashionable and then listen to december underground. its not the same band. they evolved.  <br /> <br />back to the cd. <br /> <br />prelude 12/21 - 7/10 (ok intro, not as good as other AFI ones) <br />kill caustic - 6/10  <br />miss murder - 5/10 (sick of it) <br />summer shudder - 10/10 <br />the interview - 10/10 <br />love like winter - 9/10 <br />affliction - 8/10 (the bridge in this song is the closest thing to their earlier stuff your ever gonna find on this cd. i love it) <br />the missing frame - 8/10 <br />kiss and control - 6/10 <br />the killing lights - 8/10 <br />37mm - 8/10 <br />endlessly, she said - 9/10 (sounds a lot like sing the sorrow)
B00002DE2L|1.0|Given the number of 5 star reviews here, it's clear that the majority of these people haven't heard the recording by Hugh Bean and Stokowski. Once you do, nothing else will do, unless you are a period performance fan. This cd has the most ridiculous packaging I've seen. All to promote the sexy, come hither looks of Mutter. One would hope for a remotely sexy performance, but it's not to be. I'm literally shocked at the poor intonation and the scraping noises of her violin (especially on Winter, track number 10), it makes my teeth grind. One wonders what the rest of the musicians were thinking when they recorded this. Did they think the scraping sounds were good? The Trondheim Soloists sounds like a second rate group, one that obviously needs more cohesiveness to make their group sound better. They sound under rehearsed and they struggle to keep up with Mutter's pace. Then there's Mutter the conductor. Sure her performance with Karajan was a mess, and he knows how to conduct. So here we have Mutter thinking she can do it better. This is a better performance, but it's still a terrible one. Avoid this and get the one by Stokowski and Hugh Bean.
B000E1YW0E|2.0|Although this musical makes some good points about life, liberty, etc., the overall effect rather lacks in luster. Try as I might, I simply couldn't see the so-called \\"Bohemian spirit\\". Most of the song lyrics are flighty, and the characters perplexing. The plot is weak and difficult to follow - there's a strangeness about the whole thing. Something key is missing; there's nothing to tie it all together. Plus, it's pointlessly, erratically depressing in parts. I would strongly suggest one forget to rent \\"Rent\\".
B00004W48F|4.0|I really like this film. This film is slow and deliberate. Johnny Depp is such an interesting actor you become immersed in the film just on the performance of his character. This is really modern filmmaking based on old-fashioned story telling. It is very intriguing and has been unjustly underrated.
0553288105|3.0|Six years ago I was friends with a very smart girl at UCLA.  Since she was so smart I thought I would ask her what she read.  (This proves that I do read books that people recommend to me:  I just might be a bit late in reading them).  She recommended that I read the book, The Gods Themselves, written by sci-fiction author, Issac Asimov.  There is no doubt that the author is incredibly intelligent and well-versed in the field of science.  However, the man is not very good at character development.  The story does delve into a lot of interesting scientific knowledge (a great deal of which goes over my head but was still intriguing).  The problem I had with the book is the character formation.  The characters seem wooden, stiff, and unlikable.  I couldn't feel really connected to any of the characters.  They just didn't have any intriguing personalities.<br /><br />Great literature introduces the reader to incredible characters; Iago in Othello; Falstaff in Henry IV; Yossarian in Catch-22; Pick in Great Expectations; Dagny Taggart in Atlas Shrugged.  That's absent in the book, which is perhaps its greatest limitation.
0553804367|4.0|When I mentioned to my friend Carver Yu that I was reading this book, he scrunched up his face in the way that only a man who knows the field well can do and commented, `Well, of course, that book contains a fair bit of metaphysical speculation.'<br /><br />Precisely.<br /><br />That is what makes Hawking's attempt to simplify his original one-syllable-less A Brief History of Time such a beguiling reader for a non-specialist like me. Call it metaphysical speculation or call it a daring attempt to translate the astrophysicists' language into yours and mine without losing the power of asking us to imagine a world nearly completely different than the one we thought we lived in. Call it what you want, it's still a read well worth the effort it requires.<br /><br />Don't shy away from finishing this book if you don't understand it all. Allow it the chance to paint an impressionistic portrait of what physicists--many of them justly awe-struck by the object of their inquiry--believe that they see `out there' when some of humanity's best minds ask the fundamental questions and follow the theories (theirs is a theory-rich pursuit) where they lead. Many of those theories, as Hawking describes them, will sound like nonsense.  Unless sense is different than we thought.<br /><br />When I was at Cambridge, I used to bicycle past the severely disabled Stephen Hawking in his wheelchair, followed by his personal nurse, as he wheeled between home and office, his mind no doubt drifting far from the concrete course of his wheelchair across the Commons. One wonders whether paragraphs of Briefer History and other of his works were taking shape as our paths crossed.<br /><br />Metaphysical speculation for those who dare to imagine things they may not fully understand. Things like wormholes, peabrains, and a universe curved so severely that words almost fail in the explaing of it.<br /><br />If that sounds provocative enough to justify the effort, this book is for you.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Thomas is a vain and self-centered fashion photographer in London during the swinging sixties. But he obviously wants a life with deeper meaning--he poses as a factory worker to take gritty black and white photos. And one day he gets out of his Rolls-Royce (or is it a Bentley?) and wanders aimlessly through a park snapping photos.<br /><br />Thomas' desolate photos of the empty park show his loneliness and ennui. But as he develops the photos, he discovers that he may have photographed a man's murder. The dead man whose photograph Thomas takes in the park represents the deadness of Thomas' own emotional life. As he compulsively enlarges the photographs in search of the \\"truth\\" of what happened, a beautiful, mysterious woman, Jane shows up and demands the negatives. Jane also seduces him; this is a reversal of Thomas' usual exploitative relationships with women--she's turned the tables on him. Thomas, perhaps for the first time in his life, is truly emotionally engaged. But Jane takes off with the negatives and his prints and Thomas is left alone again, but now with a new capacity to feel. Where he goes with it is up to him. Of course, since this film is by Antonioni, it's visually mesmerizing and what \\"happens\\" is beside the point--Antonioni's films are always about a process of becoming. His characters have a way of never reaching their destinations. In Antonioni's films, the journey is the destination.<br /><br />Blow-Up is also about the sense of time passing--Thomas and Jane are young and beautiful, but their youth is as elusive and fleeting as the mysterious images Thomas takes in the park. The dead man Thomas photographed is middle-aged; it's an omen of Thomas' future he has to face and accept. Antonioni's mod London looks quaint and dated today--but in a way that only increases the film's allure. Like all of Antonioni's films, it's a quirky masterpiece.
0312323859|5.0|I was initally not going to read this book b/c I hated the Darcy character so much in \\"Something Borrowed\\" (which I also loved by the way), but after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon, I had to pick it up, and it was well worth it!  <br /> <br />Emily Giffin is a wonderful writer b/c she makes you understand and even eventually root for this character who initially seemed so one-dimensional and unlikeable, without really changing the essence of the character. I was very surprised by how much I ended up rooting for Darcy to finally get her happy ending w/ Ethan. Darcy's story even ended up more touching and rewarding than Rachel's in \\"Something Borrowed\\"...I definitely recommend this book!!
1594481938|1.0|I imagine that somewhere or other MacDonalds has a recipe book. It explains just how to turn out billions of identical burgers. Well, Nick Hornby has found the equivalent for books and has used it to turn out this dross. <br /> <br />From an outset which strains credulity - four people turining up at the same time to jump off a grim and nondescript building in North London - it moves on to a series of dreary monologues and 'self-discoveries' which would be out of place in a 12 year old's essay. <br /> <br />The cardboard plot is nailed onto a balsawood framework of characterisation, and launched onto a kind of third division romansbildung narrative structure giving ... er a bunch of unintereting but increasingly annoying and dreary set pieces. <br /> <br />Actually, this is an unfair review. I didn't finish it. As soon as my train got to London Waterloo, I put the book in the rubbish bin. I felt that reading advertisements on the station was more rewarding. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps it's some kind of postmodernist joke, and Hornby is just telling me that he has come a long way down from High Fidelity. Maybe the real book is just the title and the rest is just filler (as we used to say in COBOL). <br /> <br />Either way, it was rubbish and I'm not going to bother trying to read it again.

B000FA57RQ|4.0|You will not see a more relaxed, likeable Madonna than in this documentary. Well complied and always interesting, it is a cut above the previous film about her, Truth or Dare, where she appeared spoilt and diva-ish.  <br /> <br />The concert footage is amazing. She looks beautiful throughout and her stage presence is flawless. Her relationship with the dancers is more believable than in the previous documentary and her farewell to them during the last performance brought a tear to my eye. <br /> <br />The footage of her children and husband is a welcome addition as it gives the viewer a new side to her that we havent seen before.  <br /> <br />I especially love that this dvd includes a live cd which includes the wonderful \\"Nobody knows me\\" and \\"The Beast Within\\". <br /> <br />Any Madonna fan will love this new perspective on the pop icon. She is funny, thoughtful and still one of the best live performers ever. It seems that no one can put on a show like Madonna.
B000BNX3B4|4.0|I liked this movie alot! These two people just connect so well in this movie, but not TOO well, so that it's kind of creepy and unbelievable. No, this movie is really sweet. It has....charm.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|A huge disappointment after such a long wait. Mostly leaden ballads, the songs are deeply uninspiring and repetitive while the lyrics, mainly written by Gilmour's wife, Polly Samson, are trite and seem designed simply to give her husband something to sing. Gilmour seems strangely reluctant to show off his guitar prowess on most of the tracks, which struggle to get underway. Take A Breath is a positive embarrassment and the worst thing the maestro has ever done. I didn't expect a new Floyd album but surely we deserve something better than this. Far and away the best offering is the brooding, 6-minute Island Jam given away with the album by Best Buy as a promotional CD. I suggest you pay the earth for this one outstanding track and try to forget the album. <br />

B0002J4X1Q|4.0|Horror flicks aren't my favorites, but Resident Evil was good enough, I love the Resident Evil's games they are so scary as \\"hell\\",the cast isn't so good, I don't think Milla Jovovich is a good actress(see UltraViolet aka:UltraMediocrity to know what i'm taking about) but her acting wasn't that bad in this one, Michelle Rodr&iacute;guez was fantastic(i hate she dies in this movie, a reason why i dislike Residen Evil: Apocalypse),the suporting cast was really really bad (except Michelle) is like you see the American Pie band fighting with zombies , the direction wasn't that bad too, i never heard about Mr.Paul Anderson in my whole-life, the story well is good not so original but with some excellent twists, visuals are good no more no less, the zombies aren't so scary like you think but the monsters looked really good,i don't think Mr. Romero gets angry if he see  Residen Evil,a good movie nothing spectacular but if you compare Resident Evil with Super Mario Bros. The Movie, Street Fighter, House of Dead, Alone in The Dark,Doom... then you will have a worth oscar winner movie, i love the DVD, has a lot of really good material but then if you are looking a rental this a excellent option or even if you are fan of Residen Evil games  you must see it, worth the rental or buy(if you really like it).<br /><br />Story 8/10<br />Acting 7.5/10(Michelle Rocks!)<br />Direction 8/10<br />Visuals 7/10<br /><br />Overall 7.5/10
B000002UDB|5.0|Next to Sgt. Pepper, this is one of the best Beatles albums I've ever listened to. It's a fun and whimsical treat. Every song is just as catchy as the next, highlighting the most artistic, innovative, and experimental musical moments of their career. My favorite song of all was \\"I Am The Walrus.\\" Brilliant album.
6305181810|5.0|I haven't seen this movie and I've never heard of it. The cover makes it look so interesting that I can't wait to see it. I highly recommend this movie to everybody!
B00003CWL6|4.0|It definitely deserved its award for Best Picture. I've never seen a film that portrayed the \\"all-American dream\\" suburbean family with such intelligence, hope, honesty, tragedy, and dark humor. This movie doesn't at all sugarcoat any of the characters; instead, the characters sugarcoat themselves. And most brilliant of all, they don't lead us to predictable territory. Just when you think of the typical thing that usually happens, or could have happened, to these characters, things turn around, surprising us with a whole different outcome and consequence. Kevin Spacey's calm narration itself was a chilling contrast to not only the seemingly beautiful and peaceful neighborhood that his character Lester lived, but also to the melancholy and tragic outcome of his life and that of his family and his neighbors. Also, an awesome performance by Allison Janney. Mena Suvari, who played Angela, the sly and sexually obsessed cheerleading teenager that Lester falls for (thus beginning his fantasies for her, such as the memorable roses in the bathtub scene), also did a great job. However, I felt that she made it too obvious that she, too, wanted to seduce Lester. I believe it would have been more affective if she was portrayed as an innocent girl in person, but then naughty in Lester's fantasy world. The fact that she would have had kicks out of seducing Lester to begin with didn't make the fantasy scenes very, well, make-believe. Personally, I felt like the way she spoke to Lester sensually was just kind of cheesy and obvious, purposely catering to Lester's fantasy. I'm sure that was the point, but oh well, that's just the only tiny thing that irked me in the movie. The rest is brilliant, shocking, and just tragic, while still, somehow, bringing upon a message of hope.
B00000K31V|5.0|I truly feel sorry for anyone who was turned away from this movie by Ambrose's review (Although I doubt any intellegent human being would be). Maybe using spell check for your review and actually paying attention to the movie might make your review a little more credible. Anyway, \\"eXistenZ\\" is in my opinion Cronenberg's best film to date. This film is NOT for the typical movie watcher. For The life of me I can't figure out why everyone likes to see movies where you can just sit passively for an hour and a half and not think or learn anything. Just throw in Will Smith, some action, comedy, state of the art CG, and a little brief nudity and the general public will eat it up. \\"eXistenZ\\" is definitely not one of these movies. It really does \\"Make The Matrix Look Like Child's Play!\\" In fact, it blows all 3 Matrix's right out of the water. For anyone who liked \\"Videodrome\\" or \\"Naked Lunch\\" this film is not just a must see but a must own.  My personal Favorite.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|Director Tim Burton pursues his gothic vision and Michael Keaton returns to reprise his starring role as the caped crusader in the second installment of the Batman series titled, 'Batman Returns.'<br /><br />There are so many positives in this film and yet it still falls one star below the first Batman. The special effects are better, the bizzare, neo-goth costumes and surrounding landscape are higly evocative and utterly original and the cast is excellent, but something is missing. And what is that, it's Batman. There's more Burton than Batman in this film. Director Tim Burton was obviously more interested in expanding his creativity than he was in exploring the Batman mythos and it shows.<br /><br />Cast  includes; Danny DeVito (the Penguin), Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Vincent Schiavelli, Paul Ruebens and Michael Gough as Alfred. Bottom line, there's too much Goth in Gotham City.
B000000JO3|5.0|Ian MacKaye pours his guts out, pukes and craps on them, then swallows it all in case any of you yuppies forgot what punk is about.  By far the best punk album I have ever encountered, I continue to kick myself for the 10 years that I was deprived of this.  OK, I was 6 months old at release, but is that a valid excuse?  Hardcore, yet thought provoking, your life sucks if you willfully deny this.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Director Tim Burton absorbed all the important lessons to be learned from the four Superman movies and added his own unique (some might say warped) vision to 'Batman', successfully moving the motion picture superhero genre to the next level. While the Superman series fiercely clung to a high degree of light-hearted comedy throughout, 'Batman' presented a dark, grim world for Bruce Wayne to defend. While the villianous Joker (Jack Nickelson) was a comedic villian in his own right his was a more modern up-to-date black comedy that caused one to both laugh and cringe at the same time.<br /><br />A great beginning for the Batman series that would spawn three sequels. Study the background scenery of Gotham City and you'll see just how much Burton's vision has influenced the genre for decades to come.<br /><br />Cast includes: Kim Basinger, Jack Palance and Michael Gough as Alfred the butler. I don't think I would have picked Michael Keaton to play Batman, but he was indeed up to the task. Highly Recommended!
B000F5GNX8|4.0|You know when you see a movie and you have little expectations for it?  Well I was pleasantly surprised by Kiss, Kiss Bang, Bang.  Val Kilmer was so witty and I was glad to see him honing his comedic timing again.  I like his brooding roles but I felt like his comedy had been overlooked for many years and this was the perfect venue to get him back into it. Robert Downey Jr. is also very funny and endearing and I forgot what a great actor he is.  If you like either actor, you'll love this film.  Great plot, suspenseful, funny and thought provoking.  I thought the part of Harmony could've been cast by someone better but Michelle Monaghan was adequate.
B000B5XOXY|5.0|In my estimation the best of the four Warner Bros. Batman films was the '95 release 'Batman Forever', the third installment in the series. With Tim Burton moving out of the directors chair into the position of co-producer and Michael Keaton no longer interested in reprising the role for the third time those positions were filled by Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer.<br /><br />Generally replacing the main character in a film with another actor/actress is a sure sign of doom, but not in this case. Val Kilmer provides a superior Batman, one darker, deeper with a more morose view of his mission and life after the death of this parents. A man whos dreamllife and the everyday world merge and separate on there own terms. He's more complusive than dedicated, more imprisoned than liberated. He is a man obsessed with his role as the caped crusader. The inclusion of the lovely young Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian, psychiatrist and love interest to both Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman is wonderfully designed to explore the obsessive, dreamlike world of the troubled multi-millionaire.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher delivers an exciting action/adventure cinematic experience from beginning to end with excellent special effects, a campy cast of characters and at long last the first appearance of Robin, the Boy Wonder played perfectly by Chris O'Donnell!<br /><br />Also starring; Jim Carrey as the Riddler, Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, Drew Barrymore as Sugar and Michael Gough as Alfred.
B00005JP03|5.0|I haven't seen the other fast and furious movies but this one made me interested about the other two. I thought it had a great start, very entertaining, and a pretty good end. The middle was a little slow. But overall a great movie.
0807126063|1.0|One doesn't need appetite suppresents when thinking of the protagonist of this lugubrious overwritten dirge.  I couldn't help but wonder if the dunces referred only to the characters in the novel, or to those who paid for it as well.<br /><br />There is no beauty, insight, meaning or reason for this book. Avoid.  Unless you crave the grotesque.
B000001Y5X|3.0|Decent for his first CD<br /><br />Not his greatest CD, but I would still listen to it
B000F39MAQ|3.0|There's no denying the marvelous voices of Netrebko and Villazon, but if one had to choose their recording or this DVD version, the recording, I submit, should win hands down. On it, one can listen to them and be spared the vulgarity and outright visual ugliness of what no doubt believes itself to be an innovative production.  Once again, fine singers are here sabotaged by now conformist Eurotrash directors, costumers and set designers. Has anyone else noticed how this production, like the Villazon \\"Don Carlo\\" and the Florez \\"Barbiere,\\" employing simplistic sets and limited, repetitive colors, calls attention through its \\"minimalism\\" not to the essence of the work being staged but to the childish simplemindedness of the few items and shades of color that remain on stage.  What lingers in the memory more than the essence of Verdi or Rossini is a poverty of imagination, suggesting more than anything else limited funds at the theater's disposal. <br />Aristotle, and Aquinas after him, held that the universal exists in and through particulars. Why a work that is in 19th century Italian idiom and reflects that century's manners is thought to be made \\"universal\\" by ignoring such particulars and transplanting it to some cruder, vaguely modern time period, is wholly baffling.  Verdi, like Shakespeare, struck deeply enough into the bedrock of human nature to entrance us with music and a story that surely doesn't have to be moved into our time for us to connect to it.  Do we, like Polonius, really need Netrebko in a slip and Villazon in blue boxer shorts engaging in what is close to a sexual act in order to keep awake? Similarly, Doctor Death and the gigantic clock suggesting Violetta's time is running out are both more appropriate to, say, Elizabethan dumb show with its clueless observers than to any staged work that has a respect for its audience. Netrebko and Villazon deserve better.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is still good even though it is pretty old
B0001NBMBC|5.0|A review by a teen!! <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0 <br /> <br />This song is a perfect example of what this album has to offer, awesome track great lyrics. a lot slower than your average slipknot but i still love it and i dont know why. Great intro!!!! <br /> <br />The Blister Exists <br /> <br />Screaming and a catchy choures I like it. takes kind of a while to get to the point but its awesome. <br /> <br />Three Nil <br /> <br />Fast screaming mixed with a melodic choures , the drumming on this song is amazing!!! <br /> <br />Duality <br /> <br />Probably the best song on the CD, really shows how slipknot has changed, changed for the better, awesome choures with quick rap-like verses, and still enough screaming to satisfy. <br /> <br />Opium of people <br /> <br />The begining of this song is awesome, but the verses are just sweet he reminds of SOAD almost, exept a little more mader. the choures is an amazing beatiful melodic beat that makes this song one of favs. on the CD <br /> <br />Circle <br /> <br />Acoustic, now slipknot has REALLY changed, i do like it this song gives me chills in the good way, very meaningful lyrics, catchy too!! <br /> <br />Welcome <br /> <br />A fast song, with nice riffs and incredable drumming with lots of screaming, not my favorite on the CD but not bad, i dont really like the choures <br /> <br />Vermillion <br /> <br />ooooooohhhh slipknots love song!! i really do love this song its cool, starts out with a slow quiet voice then goes to a mader voice but not a scream, its hard to explain, has a very catchy choures, then a gutair solo.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|It is good to see pearl jam rock out on their latest accomplishment. i was beginning to worry that they would simply fade out in obscurity. the songs on this record form a more cohesive mix compared to riot act and binaural together, both of which were fairly decent albums. i have noticed that many have criticized eddie vedder of being too political on this record, which i find strange because he usually has a few songs with political lyrics on them. there are certainly a few on vs.  <br /> <br />one thing i've always liked about pearl jam is that their opening songs are usually strong (Brain Of J, Once, Go and now Life Wasted). i'm also very glad to see mike mccready writing more music on this record compared to previous releases (he only co-wrote Save You on Riot Act)he even proceeded to write lyrics on inside job, which he did a fantastic job on. <br /> <br />Another thing i liked on this record is the riff work on Unemployable. overall this is a strong album for pearl jam, their best work in the last 6 years.

The problem i have is adam jones just belting out the same guitar progressions as he usually does on every record. i do appreciate his effort with the talk box solo on jambi, but it's nothing special. many of the songs i find sound too similar to \\"the patient\\" or \\"The Grudge\\". and wings for marie part 1 and 2 are dull and lengthy. <br /> <br />It seems that tool is past their prime. all i recommend is to listen to their previous albums, which at least have some form of variety
1400079179|2.0|The Da Vinci Code along with Angels and Demons were written very well I thought.  They keep you reading and wondering what is going to happen next. They are however both going to contribute to societal decay.  That makes them harmful rather then just inert entertainment. I have read them both but many with little faith or knowledge seem to be treating them as fact instead fiction sprinkled with a few facts which is what they are. Since societal evolution is so important I cannot recommend this book.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Seems like every well-to-do comedian will try to do at<br /><br />least a serious movie once in awhile, and that is a<br /><br />good thing for some fresh originality.  Carey is no<br /><br />exception to that (Sandler did this with Punch Drunk<br /><br />Love) with this movie, and it does fantastic despite<br /><br />its indie qualities.  It's great that a good movie can<br /><br />be truly appreciated by the majority of society at<br /><br />least some of the time.  This movie is also Winslet's<br /><br />breakthrough to show the world that she can and likes<br /><br />to do movies that aren't necessarily as sappy like as<br /><br />Titanic.  She does not disappoint on this one as you<br /><br />may notice how quickly she has to change in character<br /><br />sometimes as hers in one that can be very moody, and<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo is also a stand out.  Dr. Mierzwiak's<br /><br />wife is not even listed on imdb, but she was excellent<br /><br />for her extremely small role.  All the actors were<br /><br />great, but the ones mentioned were the ones that stuck<br /><br />out for me the most.<br /><br />What makes this film so great is of course, not so<br /><br />much its popularity necessarily, but all the nuances<br /><br />you do and don't notice, and the way it was created.<br /><br />There were some prop setups for a scene in which Joel<br /><br />Barish (Carey) looks like a small toddler with his<br /><br />adult face, but Clementine (Kate Winslet) looks normal<br /><br />to the scene.  What's really weird is that since Carey<br /><br />was doing this scene with overly sized props, when<br /><br />Clementine was under the table with Joel, it seemed as<br /><br />if the proportions still kept nicely, and maybe that<br /><br />is because of some visual effect which occurs when<br /><br />Joel is back further from the camera and more crouched<br /><br />up.<br /><br />Dunst was not a big fan of improvising on this movie,<br /><br />and I think it was mentioned in the commentary that it<br /><br />was a bit hard for her working with Ruffalo and Wood.<br /><br />This actually fit in with her character in the story<br /><br />more though, so it worked out!<br /><br />There is also snow on the beach in a scene, and I do<br /><br />not know of another movie with that feature in it.<br /><br />Other nuances to notice is the crack that is on the<br /><br />ice pond when Carey and Winslet are lying on the ice<br /><br />of the pond.  There's a shot of the Barnum and Bailey<br /><br />circus, and that was pretty much a one time deal where<br /><br />Carey and Winslet were rushing to the scene(s) at the<br /><br />last minute to capture that interesting piece of<br /><br />footage.<br /><br />There are also some visual effects which you may or<br /><br />may not notice throughout the movie.  There is slight<br /><br />smoke used several scenes to make some of the scenes<br /><br />seem more dreamy, and if you aren't really looking, or<br /><br />even if you are, you may not notice.  The effects with<br /><br />the lighting really come out when things are<br /><br />disappearing.  There's also a stream of lights at the<br /><br />ice pond scene, and it looks like it's just a carousel<br /><br />of lights flying by, but when you hear from the<br /><br />commentary that it's a highway, you realize that it's<br /><br />actually a bunch of cars driving by.  Another cool<br /><br />thing about this movie is that there is a bed car that<br /><br />Carey rides on.  During the set, they were having so<br /><br />much trouble with the car that the brakes didn't work<br /><br />at one point, and Carey actually had to drive the bed<br /><br />car out onto the highway and let its gas run out.<br /><br />People passing by must've been quite appalled to say<br /><br />the least!  When it's creative and you have hard to<br /><br />capture scenes that were caught, when things are done<br /><br />right in the moment, you know that you will probably<br /><br />have a greatly critically acclaimed movie.
015670160X|5.0|After that light title for the review, allow me to stress that *Orlando* is one of my favorite, favorite books. I've probably read it 20 times. I'm always astonished again by how much character and life and plot and gorgeous prose that Woolf packed into so few pages.     SUMMARY: Orlando, the title character, begins life as a lad in Elizabethan England in 1588 and ends the book as a woman thirty-six years older in 1928.     Much has been made of the fact that Orlando changes gender and ages magically slowly during the 340 years that the book covers. The effects of the gender switch play beautifully against society and society's changes. Orlando the character is probably based on Vita Sackville-West, Woolf's lesbian lover who cross-dressed, and the gender switch is seen to embody both the masculine and feminine aspects of her. Modernism, the art movement that best characterizes Woolf, is concerned with society and the person's role in it. Woolf managed to play both sides by introducing a character who was both male and female.     All this is true, but I believe that there is another layer to the book beyond mere gender role exploration and modernist games. Orlando is a book about being a reader, about a life spent as a reader. When one reads great literature, one experiences what it is like to be both a man and a woman, to live the span of many lifetimes, to have experiences as varied as traveling to Istanbul by ship and giving birth to a child and hacking at the head of a Moor swinging from the ceiling and being the lover of a queen and being in love with a man. Of course, a writer is a reader moved to emulation, and Orlando is a writer. After centuries of composition (and that's what it feels like sometimes!), *The Oak Tree,* Orlando's epic poem, is finally accepted for publication.     Most of the time, when I read a great book, I understand the mind and the soul of the writer better when I'm done. Reading a book about being a reader may seem a tautology, but inthis case, I feel like Virginia Woolf understood *me,* and my life as a reader, almost eighty years after the publication of *Orlando.*     TK Kenyon  Author of [[ASIN:1601640021 Rabid: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1601640226 Callous]]: A Novel
0307263118|3.0|This book did not deserve the Man Booker Prize. Kazuo Ishiguro's \\"Never Let Me Go\\" and Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\" were far more deserving. I mean who really cares about that weird, shallow, pretentious family anyway. I guess the bigger your words the better your chances of winning the Booker. Enjoyable summer reading but not prize worthy.
B00005JOSS|4.0|The film is enjoyable and allows you-mostly-to cast aside time/space sensitibites. Both actors did a good job, and the plot was reasonably well developed.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Takk... is the first Sigur Ros album I've heard all the way through (although Svefn-G-Englar and Ny Batteri from the Agaetis Byrjun album are all-time personal favorites), but it more than justifies the mountains of hype surrounding this band. This is, simply put, some of the most hypnotic and endlessly fascinating music I've ever heard, the tiresome accusations of pretentiousness notwithstanding (It's sort of depressing that people have devoted their time and effort to bashing this band when shamelessly corporate crap merchants like Staind would make much more worthy targets for their vitriol). At any rate, I've noticed a tendency to compare these guys to post-rock bands in the vein of Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and while there are certainly parallels, Sigur Ros bring to my mind the Flaming Lips, partly in the way they marry rock and orchestral sounds, partly in the way they manage to combine childlike wonderment with musical experimentalism, and partly in the way they've found a permanent place in my rotation despite having two of the least tough-sounding male vocalists in the history of popular music.  And since the Flaming Lips rule, that's pretty good company to be in.<br /><br />There are some traces of traditional rock sounds to be found on Takk..., mostly in the drumming, but they're combined with heavy doses of symphonic instrumentation (especially strings), which, along with the band's soaring melodies and the wonderfully alien, androgynous vocals of frontman Jonsi, elevate the band's sound into the aural stratosphere. For the most part, the album's early songs float by beautifully on shuffling beats and hauntingly ambient noise from the guitars, strings, and bits of piano and horns, only occasionally, as in the case of Glosoli and Milano, exploding into transcendent, guitar-laden rushes of sound. The first seven tracks on this album sound like Sigur Ros's version of devotional music (devotion to what, I'm not sure), all angelic vocals and upbeat arrangements, but after Milano Takk... takes a turn in a darker, more contemplative, and for my money more interesting direction.<br /><br />If all the sunniness of the first seven tracks is too much for you, Gong and Andvari should provide you with some welcome relief, as they sound like the products of an album the band recorded while in a much more downcast mood. Gong is a bit harder-edged and more discordant than the rest of the album, sort of like a breakup song after a string of love ballads, filled with clamorous percussion and powerful vocals that, shockingly considering their source, can almost be described as aggressive. Andvari is Sigur Ros for a rainy day: slow, muted, and mournful, the repetitive drumming and string arrangements sounding almost funereal in comparison to the uplifting sounds found earlier. For its part, Svo Hljott, which gets my nod for album highlight, sounds like a summation of what's come before it, with a familiar quiet-to-loud-and-gorgeous build that still maintains a hint of the melancholy feel from the prior two tracks, with a rawer edge to the guitars and drums than, say, Glosoli.<br /><br />If there is a weak spot to be found here I'd have to give the nod to Se Les, which sort of meanders for too long without an interesting melody to make it memorable. That said, everything else is more than good enough to make up for one little misstep. While Sigur Ros's work clearly isn't for everybody, it's equally clear that they're putting out some of the most creative and individualistic music out there today.

B0006L16N8|4.0|While Coldplay are definatly not my favorite band I do recognize that they are still a pretty good band, although they don't really create anything really new, they can still create a good song and captivate listeners around the world. The piano playing is probably one of my biggest beefs with coldplay. I just dont like it. I do however really enjoy the guitar playing and to some extent Chris Martin's vocals. Sometimes I like his vocals and sometimes they just don't seem to fit very well. I cant help but notice how some people are bashing him for not being that talented of a singer. And on that note I will say that I agree that he isnt really a great singer, but hey he may not be flashy, but he still sounds pretty good to me. And dosen't take anything away from the music.<br /><br />And people have to realize that most people who like Coldplay like them because of Chris Martin. Because hey, this kinda is pop music and we all know that vocals rule pop music. And thats one of the many, many reasons that I despise pop music, because of the boring lyrics and the focus on singing. Indeed, the day that Martin leaves Coldplay would be the same day that the band would die, because sucess comes from a bunch of skinheads who can't really get into any music that they can't understand, or might require a little thought and many listens to grasp, and just want a little diddly to sing along to on the drive to work.<br /><br />Not to say that these guys are some sort of pop divas, and not to say that the play pop music.(more like Soft Rock/Alternative)And they don't seem to let their popularity get to their heads. And I like Coldplay because they are not as boring as some of the more popular rock bands around today(Like U2, who I can't stand). For the record I primarily listen to the many different genres of [Modern] Metal(It may seem like a shallow genre but you couldn't be more wrong!)Im sure It might be a little strange to hear a metalhead saying that he likes Coldplay, and believe me, I get alot of grief about it from other people I know who like metal. But I stand by my statment that Coldplay is a good band. But Im pretty openminded about music, and usually don't let labels influence what music I listen to. (Everything from Grind Metal to Progressive Rock to Folk to Johnny Cash.)<br /><br />One thing that really bugged me about X&Y was the anti-copying stuff that they put on the record. Im not sure whether it was sony who did this or if the band chose to do it. I have a feeling it was sony, because bands really don't profit from CD sales as much as they should.<br /><br />Overall I liked X&Y, but it didn't really blow me away as a final product. And I would rate it more as a 3.5/5d believe me, I get alot of grief about it from other people I know who like metal. But I stand by my statment that Coldplay is a good band.

For a \\"best seller\\" kind of story that's useful for several hours of entertainment (that additionally is 1,000 times more mind-stimulating than passively watching a pop movie), I would recommend this book at 4 stars. Plus if it stimulates you to research more about the issues discussed in it, that's even better!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I've watched this movie lots of times since I purchased it. Saw it at the theater and knew that I would purchase it. The idea of people communicating two years apart was a great plot point. I liked the meticulous character development. The story wasn't rushed, but it wasn't slow. They took the necessary time to develop the characters so that you came to care about them. I highly recommend this movie and the DVD.

Interesting observations: <br /> <br />- By looking at micro-facial expressions, a psychiatrist can tell with 95% accuracy whether a couple will still be together in 15 years. <br /> <br />- Priming our actions: by telling ourselves something about ourselves before doing an action like taking a test, you'll affect how well you do on the test. This demonstrates the power of positive thinking and the power of negative thinking. <br /> <br />The information in this book will help you at the workplace, by knowing what you need to work on when it comes to \\"impression management\\" for your boss.
1592401791|5.0|Finally, a Beatles book from an insider who has no agenda, no axe to grind! In case you don't know who Geoff Emerick was, he was the man responsible for the sound of the Beatles from 1966 onwards, from their Revolver album to Sgt. Pepper (called by many the two greatest rock albums of all time) to their final record, Abbey Road. I knew that he had done those records with the group, helping shape their new psychedelic image, but what I didn't know was that he had also worked with them on many of their earliest records, too, things like I Want To Hold Your Hand and She Loves You. And he was only 15 at the time!  <br />What an incredible story, and it's told really well too, and with admirable honesty. There's no dirt dishing here, like so many other Beatles books, but there is a refreshingly candid look at the personalities involved. George Martin didn't do everything he claimed he did, and John wasn't really the leader of the band, not in the studio, anyway -- Paul was. Ringo was as good a drummer as we always thought he was, but he was also very quiet and tended to say little, though when he did come up with a comment, it was usually a gem. Emerick's portrait of George Harrison is perhaps the most interesting one. Harrison apparently wasn't all that great a guitarist in the early days, at least not when the red Recording light came on (don't forget, he was only 18 when Emerick first heard him play), but he got better and better as the years went on, and it's fascinating to see the way he grows in stature in Emerick's eyes as the band get further along in their musical development. By the end, you can tell that Emerick has almost as much admiration for him as he does for the \\"musician's musician\\" Paul and the ever-mercurial but phenomenally talented John.  <br />I had a blast reading this book, and it got me to get out all my old Beatles records and give them a spin one more time... only this time, knowing the stories behind the making of them, I heard all those classic recordings with new ears.  <br />A great read, and a lot of fun. Highly recommended! <br />
B00005JKJA|3.0|Well what can I say.  Right off the bat, watching the movie, I had a very strong sense of watching Twin Peaks, mostly due to atmosphere.  I haven't seen any other David Lynch movies, so it could just be his style.  I really didn't like the movie for the first 2 hours.  Was like a cheap episode of Murder She Wrote. However, once you get to the last half-hour, you see it was that way on purpose.  Can't say I enjoyed it anymore knowing this. So why more then 1star?  Well, I do like movies that are different.  This is defiantly not what it seems, and you have to watch it more then once to get a better understanding of what you just saw. <br /> <br />All in all, I wouldn't add it to my collection, but it is worth seeing.  I'd say rent it as a 7day rental, that will give you time to dwell on it, and rewatch it a few times.  Once done with it tho, I don't have the desire to see it again. <br />

The first two were very good, being the first to get me hooked, but after growing up along with their style this is a very mature, expressive and politicaly infused album. Their last was just a preview to this little dollup of awsomeness. The instruments are creative, the lyrics full of expression, androgynously sexual( as always) and insightfull into the ever sexy and mysterious life of the three members. A definate must have

B000002KIE|5.0|This review should be accurate, and therefore it might help anyone thinking of buying this record, although if it doesn't I won't lose any sleep over it. <br /> <br />I'll get on with it; firstly, any [hard] rock fan opposed to \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" will do well to spot any significant errors with the guitar, bass or drum work (the band rightly used ex-bassist Glen Matlock for the recording, seeing that Sid Vicious wasn't up to it).  Secondly, anybody choosing Johnny Rotten's vocals as a convenient reason to slate this album is also out of luck because he never intended to be a great singer.  More to the point, it doesn't even matter that he couldn't really sing; opening track \\"Holidays In The Sun\\" certainly wouldn't have much swagger to it without Rotten, and neither would follow-up \\"Bodies\\", although the driving force behind this song has to be Steve Jones with some solid guitar work.  If \\"No Feelings\\" and \\"Liar\\" don't contain another two catchy solo passages from Jones then I don't know what does, and all I'll say about \\"God Save The Queen\\" is that if you're offended by it then either you don't get what it's about or you do but you shouldn't have bought the album because it's not what you want to hear.  \\"Problems\\", with solid drumming from Paul Cook and a well-worked bass conclusion by Matlock, is another strong number with more excellent lyrics by Rotten, and the brief, raw \\"Seventeen\\" is succeeded by \\"Anarchy In The U.K.\\", with the first lines Rotten ever penned.  \\"Submission\\", although definitely one of the more neutral, less offensive numbers, is still very listenable with some amusing lyrics from Rotten.  \\"Pretty Vacant\\", again underpinned by strong guitar and drum work, gave the Pistols another UK hit, and \\"New York\\" is also very catchy once gotten into, albeit the idea of the manager who isn't worth writing about.  Finally, \\"EMI\\" rounds the album off with a one-fingered salute directed squarely at the record company that fired the Pistols for telling the truth about 70s Britain. <br /> <br />There.  Since a lot of modern rock has been inspired to varying extents by the Pistols, you might be able to get into \\"Bollocks\\" if you get it.  If you can't get into it, you could always get rid of the CD, but in an individualistic manner would be preferable.
B000FILW86|5.0|One could make a convincing case that Cheap Trick is the greatest classic-rock band in the world today.<br /><br />Consider that Trick still boasts its signature lineup--vocalist Robin Zander, bassist Tom Petersson, drummer Bun E. Carlos and guitarist Rick Nielsen--all of whom still play as well as ever. The band is still together, apparently, because the guys love playing music. Most significantly, the band has never stopped making good music. Okay some of their mid career albums really do suck.<br /><br />There aren't many classic rock acts that can claim one of those things--let alone all of them.<br /><br />For further evidence supporting Cheap Trick's greatness, check out the band's newly released \\"Rockford.\\" arguably, the finest power-pop/rock offering you'll hear all year.<br /><br />It only takes a few seconds of the album's deliriously good opener, \\"Welcome to the World,\\" to get your hopes up that this record is going to be one fun ride. Fortunately, the band manages to surpass even mile-high expectations by delivering 11 other (pop) rock-solid songs.<br /><br />\\"Perfect Stranger,\\" which was produced and co-written by former 4 Non Blonde Linda Perry, is an excellent choice for a first single. It's classic Trick, full of catchy riffs and bubbling with urgency. \\"If It Takes a Lifetime\\" is an exquisite piece of finely crafted pop/rock, reminiscent of Jeff Lynne's best tracks with ELO. \\"Come On Come On Come On\\" is a driving rocker that would have fit on Trick's classic '77 album, \\"In Color.\\" If you need a dose of Beatlesque pop, the type that Tears for Fears mined for platinum, you'll definitely find it on \\"O Claire\\" and \\"This Time You Got It.\\"<br /><br />Best in a long time!!!!!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|After listening listening to \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" a dozen times or so, I have to say that it's on par with \\"Californication\\" and \\"By The Way\\". All three works have very similar qualities that make them all some of the best work by the Chili Peppers. The only real question then is whether \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" could have been a single disc.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of double disc albums because inevitably there will be filler. I also don't like sitting and listening to an album more than 45 minutes. \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is 123 minutes. With 28 songs I expected at least half of them to be disposable, and what I actually found was that there wasn't a single dud. There are about 10 songs that could have been excised though, trimming \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" down to a perfect 18 tracks. This is what I came up with, more or less...<br /><br />1. Dani California<br /><br />2. Snow ((Hey Oh))<br /><br />3. Charlie<br /><br />4. Stadium Arcadium<br /><br />5. Hump de Bump<br /><br />6. Especially In Michigan<br /><br />7. C'mon Girl<br /><br />8. Hey<br /><br />9. Desecration Smile<br /><br />10. Tell Me Baby<br /><br />11. Hard To Concentrate<br /><br />12. 21st Century<br /><br />13. If<br /><br />14. Make You Feel Better<br /><br />15. Animal Bar<br /><br />16. Storm In A Teacup<br /><br />17. We Believe<br /><br />18. Turn It Again<br /><br />The other 10 tracks were fine, but I felt they weren't AS good. Agree or disagree, I'm sure it's open for debate. The bottome line is that \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is another solid addition to the Red Hot Chili Peppers repertoire. The best thing about it is that if you are a new Pepper fan, this is a good place to start, and if you are an old Pepper fan (like myself) this is a good addition to your collection.<br /><br />The only other criticism about \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" and the band is that, even though I really like Rick Rubin, the band has used him on every album since 1991's \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\", and I wonder what new sounds the band would achieve if they went with a new producer at this point? I mean, we've had three albums in a row now that all sound fairly similar, and the band has been around for over 20 years now, so what would be the risk in trying something completely off the hook?e albums in a row now that all sound fairly similar, and the band has been around for over 20 years now, so what would be the risk in trying something completely off the hook?
B000002U9W|5.0|This British band was to be more influential than anybody dared thought in 1965 when they formed as The Pink Floyd, under the leadership of a certain Mr Syd Barrett in Cambridge, England. They evolved from numerous bands from the area, including Leonard's Lodgers, The Abdabs and The Tea Set, and changed their name to just `Pink Floyd' in 1968 when Syd had gone.<br /><br />The first album to appear was the quintessential Sixties psychedelic rock album The Pipers At The Gates Of Dawn (1967), which was mainly Syd Barrett written, and is still wonderful to listen to today. It reached Number Seven in the British album charts.<br /><br />The second album A Saucerfull of Secrets (1968) was a difficult album for the band, as Syd by then had gone, not literally gone as in disappeared, but gone as in, his head was definitely somewhere but no longer on this planet. David Gilmour had become a member of Pink Floyd and for a while Pink Floyd was a quintet, but Syd became impossible and they were down to four again. Syd Barrett only appears on three of the songs on the album, but Gilmour only gets a writing credit on the title track.<br /><br />Album Number Three was a soundtrack for the movie More (1969) and is a marvellous album, but it was recorded in 5 sessions over a period of 8 days and was, after all, only meant to accompany the movie. Nonetheless, it peaked at Number 9 in the British charts.<br /><br />Fourth album out the traps was an ambitious double album affair: Ummagumma. One album was recorded live whilst the other contained four solo sections from each member of the band. The live album contained three songs written whilst Syd Barrett was in the band plus the title track from the second album. Whilst the second album is extremely adventurous, it's not really a band thing. But again the album was a huge hit in the U.K., reaching Number 7, whilst in America it was the first Pink Floyd album to break into the Top 100.<br /><br />So with this rather patchy if successful album track record behind them, what did the band come up with for their fifth album? Atom Heart Mother (1970). Well it's a bit hard to describe really. The first track is the title piece taking up 24 minutes; it's an amazing collection of musical themes in a classical arrangement (this is why at first it was known as the Amazing Pudding. Get it. Collection=Pudding. The Amazing Pudding is still the name of Pink Floyd's most famous fan club). The band had various riffs and themes, but hadn't really put it all together, and with an imminent American tour coming up and a recording contract to fill, with the band not really in agreement what should be done, they brought in mutual friend Ron Geesin - the avante garde producer.<br /><br />Roger Waters and Nick Mason went in the studio to lay out a rough rhythm section for him, which was a bit ragged as both were a little tired, so it speeds up in some places and rather alarmingly slows down at others. With this the band clears off to America leaving Ron Geesin with the instructions to over lay something grand; you know, heavenly choirs, brass fanfares, whatever you like really, get on with it Ron we're all rather busy actually. Oh, have it ready for us when we come back in June, etc.<br /><br />So completely without supervision Ron Geesin took Pink Floyd's rough rhythm track and turned it into a musical masterpiece, bit of luck really.<br /><br />When the members of Floyd got back from tour they were well impressed, so they decided not to bother re-recording the bass and drums. But Gilmour and Wright went back into the studios to lay some mercurial guitar and keyboard solos onto our Atom Heart Mother.<br /><br />The piece is broken up into six sections, but it all gels perfectly into a whole. Gilmour and Wright really come out of the closet with their dynamic soloing, whilst all of Geesin's work fits perfectly with the band.<br /><br />The brass section riffs are monstrous, whilst the violin playing is executed with total abandon. The choir is in fine voice, especially with its forerunner to Tubular Bells voices that rampage through the closing sections. The SoundBits are also tastefully used with a motorbike roaring away with the band and orchestra when they first come in together. As the music builds to a false climax towards the end a voice booms out, \\"Here is a loud announcement\\" whilst at the musical climax another voice calls for \\"Silence in the studio\\" to no avail. With time constraints, touring, and Ron Geesin only coming in half way through, everything was against it being a classic, but it is.<br /><br />The other four tracks are also little gems, but in their own special way. Again not much band cohesion. But maybe they just worked better this way. The next song is a lovely Roger Waters song called If, showing Waters' ever increasing interest in the human brain. Gilmour supplies some exquisite electric guitar to accompany Waters' acoustic guitar and vocals.<br /><br />The lyrics are amongst Waters' most uncomplicated (like later when he tried to educate us all with `The Wall' in 1979).<br /><br />`If I were a swan I'd be gone,<br /><br />If I were a Train I'd be late,<br /><br />And if I were a good man,<br /><br />I'd talk to you more often then I do.<br /><br />If I were asleep I could dream,<br /><br />If I was afraid I could hide,<br /><br />if I go insane,<br /><br />Please don't put wires in my brain.<br /><br />Richard Wright's contribution, Summer 68, is a nod to the past, showing off unashamedly its Syd Barrett influences, with its catchy chorus and mid tempo verses, all tied up with some rollicking barrel house piano, and the return of the brass section at the conclusion. David Gilmour then contributed Fat Old Sun, a wonderful little dirge that is a complete rip off of The Kinks song released the previous year as Lazy Old Sun, but that does not make it a bad song, and anyway Ray Davies never sued.<br /><br />The last piece on the album is exactly what it says it is, Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast. The song's title refers to one Alan Stiles of Pink Floyd's road crew in the Sixties and early Seventies. What you get is the sounds of Alan getting up in the morning and coming downstairs to cook his breakfast, all rather noisily, with the band jamming some breakfast type themes over the top in places. Often they just leave Alan scratching away solo. A rather odd end to the album, but as with the rest of the music, rather effective.<br /><br />Atom Heart Mother was released at the back end of 1970 and was the first Pink Floyd album to top the British charts, and crack the American top fifty. So job well done. Mind you when Pink Floyd released their greatest hits double CD Echoes in all its one hundred and fifty minutes, they could not even find time for one little excerpt from this album.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Horribly written and poorly directed horror movie that takes the source material of the comic book that it's based on (The excellent Hellblazer) and literally destroys it with a script that is so badly written that some of the dialog will make you grunt when you hear it and plot points that has nothing to do with the story at all. The story itself make absolutely no sense because it says one thing and contradicts itself latter with another, so you really have no idea on what is going on from time to time. Some characters serve no purpose what so ever like Constantine's kid sidekick who is as annoying as they come and the angel Gabriel, who is involved in one of the stupidest plot revelations to come out in recent cinema. A revelation that turns this movie's second half into a bad joke. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence is pretty bad because instead of trying to help the story along, he just resorts to copying what was done before in order to get an effect and relying too heavily on the special effects to tell its story. You can see the influence the movie \\"Seven\\" had on him because of the way the lighting is done in some scenes but what he forgets is the fact that \\"Seven\\" had a compelling story that scared and held you in your seat until it's shocking climax while this movie will have you thinking on why so much had gone wrong with it in the first place. Acting wise, I will have to join the majority in praising Rachel Weisz for her performance because with out it, the movie would have been a bigger disaster than it is. Rachel Weisz give too much to this film with her performance and gets too little from it. Her performance literally keeps this movie from going under its own stupidly and she does make you think about her character as a real human being who is going though a crises of faith and a corrosion of the soul. She's so good in fact that she makes you almost forgive this movie but unfortunately for her and the people paying to see it, she is the only actor who is able to rise above the bad script and lousy direction to give a compelling performance. Keanu Reeves, who plays the title character of John Constantine is a decent actor when he is motivated but he looks like he's on some kind of drug in this film and does not come a cross well in his role. You don't really believe his character at all by the way Keanu plays him and the movie loses credibility because of it. You can't blame him for his lack of interest because of how bad the script is but he could have done better or they could have gotten a better actor to play the character instead. <br /> <br />I suggest you see this film for Rachel Weisz's better what this film deserved performance only because the only good thing this film really has.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South is my favorite book because I like the basic story and I really love the characters, and this feeling carried over to the series.  <br />Even though the BBC adaptation of Wives and Daughters (another Elizabeth Gaskell book) was excellent and stuck more strictly to the book than North and South - I still enjoyed North and South more because of the reasons I love the book. I also thought the acting of the whole cast was as good as anything I have seen.  <br />North and South is often compared with Pride and Prejudice and while there is a good reason for that, I actually feel it has as much in common with a Dickens tale. The book was actually first published by Dickens in his weekly paper/magazine and was viewed favorably by him. If I was to try and describe the tone of the piece I would describe it as a cross between a slightly less complicated Dickens tale and Jane Austen.  <br />I never thought I would find a series I like better than Pride and Prejudice but I have. While it came to a resolved ending as most drama series do, whether tragic or happy, and I have previously been happy with that - there were several relationships in this that I wanted to follow further and I was wishing it would continue.

When every kid who jumps on the trend at your high school suddenly goes to hot topic to buy the new afi shirts of sing the sorrow because they just found out about them, you realize thier popularity and the fact they are on a major label really does not allow them to just go back to writing the music they used to, among other issues...so i understood i wouldnt be getting the old punk-tinged abums from them anymore. <br /> <br />So maybe thats made me more accpeting of this.  I deffintly wouldnt call this album great, or even good. But it isnt horrible, so lets just call it decent.  I agree with the others who think davey's screaming really doesnt fit, he used to have more a yell-scream, now it sounds like metalcore or screamo stuff, which really doesnt fit the music.   <br />My favorite tracks are summer shudder, the interview, the killing light, affliction, endlessly she said. its obvious i am more of a fan of the softer songs that sound more like \\"this time imperfect\\" than thier new songs that sound like the killers or panic at the disco, those i think are unoriginal and trite...afi does not need to go and sound like everyone else, which is the main downfall of this album.  They are talented musicians obviously as shown by thier live shows and past albums, but they really jumped on the trend here.  the techno-ish \\"panic at the disco\\" songs, and the screamo singing that is used to try to evoke emotion just dont work for them.  <br /> <br />Another issue is the lyrics. davey isnt all that young anymore so of course there isnt going to be much teen anger and rebellion and \\"young\\" issues presented, but whats with all the depressing suicide lyrics? i mean sure, make an album dark and moody, but be realistic. i really doubt davey feels that negatively about his life, he needs to stop catering to 14 year olds who have no friends. vary up the lyrical content and fit it to a song, dont go screaming about something that doesnt need that type of emotion attached to it. <br /> <br />I dont own this album.  I didnt rush out on 6/6/06 to buy it. i had a premoinition that it wouldnt be that great. i am glad i dont own it, i have money to go buy the new bouncing souls album now. Though, i do enjoy the songs i mentioned, so its worth the download.  I am going to see them at street scene in san diego on 8/4, hopefully they can make these songs better live.  For all of you who always state afi's old stuff sucks and this is better, just stop talking right now. you dont know the real afi, and i doubt your a huge punk rock fan. for now this is afi's style, and were all just going to have to accept that

B000F6IOC0|4.0|After finally watching this movie I couldn't believe that it wasn't given more favorable reviews by critics.  It is a beautifully shot film, it is well thought out, and it takes you on a different journey than the original.  It is shot much more out in the open country than in a city dwelling, with beautiful angles and a wonderful score.  It provides much more background to the story behind the vampires and lycans while also staying true to the original story.  I have enjoyed both films greatly and look forward to the possibility of a third.  In an age where most sequals turn out to simply be rehashed versions of the originals, Underworld: Evolution is exactly what a sequal should be.

B000ESSTL0|3.0|Call me cynical (or dimwitted) but I think I finally understand why record companies are re-issuing `classic' albums with a second DVD disk. The idea isn't so much to attract new listeners as it is to seduce old fans of the band to buy a second copy with enhanced audio features and some video content. \\"Violator\\" inarguably represents a definitive moment in music history, so it stands to reason that it would be given the deluxe treatment. I'm just not sure if it's worth shelling out the shekels for it.<br /><br />The short `bonus' movie that appears on the extra DVD inadvertently provides a few reasons to support my case. First of all, the movie contains little more than a few spotty interviews with bandmembers, their producer (Flood), and their associates. The subject matter revolves mostly around an in-store media event in Los Angeles, with small bits of info on the recording process and filming the videos. Unfortunately, the videos themselves are NOT a part of this package, and the footage regarding the in-store `event' inadvertently backfires. In California, thousands of unsupervised fans waited for hours to meet the band, and grew restive. The media coverage of the near-riot offered a slew of publicity for Depeche Mode, who admittedly spent only four minutes at the store before being escorted away. I'm sure the intention of this footage was to portray the band as the `90s version of the Beatles, but instead, they seem callous and cynical. Rather than express sympathy or regret for the fans who were neglected or injured, they discuss their four-minute non-effort as a career-defining moment. As the film ends, an onscreen message points out that since its release, \\"Violator\\" has sold over 7,500,000 copies worldwide. With that many copies sold, who on earth is left to buy a copy?<br /><br />The album certainly has not gained in relevance over the years. Rather, it is a timepiece for a generation, a piece of memorabilia to accompany memories of their youth, and they certainly still have their well-worn copies filed away somewhere. Yes, the album has a lot to recommend it, especially the moody club hits \\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" \\"Policy of Truth\\" and \\"Personal Jesus,\\" which has since been overshadowed by Johnny Cash's spine-chilling version. The album flows well, and it hasn't aged too badly, but people who missed it the first time around are unlikely to desire it fifteen years later. That leaves the original 7.5 million fans to consider buying a second copy. Perhaps the six bonus tracks will add some appeal. Other than that, the only real advantage of this deluxe package lies in the surround-sound mix. If you have a killer sound system that can process this, and you loved this album back in the old days, then go for it. Otherwise, I'm not sure that it's worth it, even for hardcore fans.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|This movie is good but not the best. The begining is guys doing drugs having sex. It was so boring it almost put me to sleep. After the guy gets to the factory its all gore. A lot of the stuff in this movie is messed up and sick. But was entertaining i wouldnt watch it again so rent this dont buy it.
B00005JOSU|5.0|*Note* Contains some mild spoilers<br /><br />\\"The Lake House\\", starring long time friends Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock - working together again for the first time since \\"Speed\\" (1994) - is a story of semi-magical connection between a man and a woman which spans the width of two years. You see, Kate (Bullock) and Alex (Reeves) have both lived in the same gorgeous house made entirely of glass. Kate is moving out and leaves a letter in the mailbox wishing the next tenant good luck and enjoyment in the house, as well as a forwarding address for her mail. Through movie magic (and possibly fate), Alex - who just purchased the house - receives this letter and the two begin to correspond.<br /><br />Confused at first, they soon realize they are living two years apart, Alex in 2004 and Kate in 2006. While an odd set of circumstances (and theoretically impossible), they continue to write. Both are failures when it comes to relationships and they find the letters a great chance to talk to someone of the opposite sex and not have to face rejection. Soon they fall in love but are not sure how they could ever meet to make a relationship work because of the time issues. They share a dog (too complicated to explain here) and their hearts. Attempts to meet do not work and they begin to lose hope. Can they find a way to be together? Or will this simply be another failed relationship to add to their lists?<br /><br />Despite what people have been saying, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Lake House.\\" Complex, sci-fi plot aside, it comes down to a story about how two peoples lives change when they allow themselves to connect. It's honest. Its cinematography is gorgeous and the performances are good. Keanu and Sandra have an amazing on-screen chemistry as we have witnessed before (in Speed), but here it is more mature. Sandra delivers a performance closer to her character in \\"Crash\\" (2005) and less like that of \\"Miss Congeniality.\\" Kate is a charming but self-conscious and lonely woman. Keanu gives what I believe is his best performance in a movie yet! His famous slightly \\"wooden\\" acting style is perfect for the character of lonely architect Alex, and he can really become someone quite believable and open in the moments when his character is happy. While the two do not share much direct on-screen time, that serves to make the moments they do share it SO desirable. The viewer longs to see Alex and Kate meet face to face and for this relationship to work out for them. Especially delightful, were the voiceovers (of the letter reading and writing) which filled the movie as other things happened. It was a clever way to keep them from always sitting at a desk and brightened the tone of the film overall.<br /><br />Forget thinking about how all the time travel works, that's not the important part. The important point of this movie is the relationship between these two people. The magic of the time transcending mailbox only serves to bring them together, but so do many other things in their lives (as we come to find out). It gives the viewer hope that maybe they are destined for love like this - maybe not with the assistance of a post office receptacle - but fated in some way to meet that one person for them.<br /><br />\\"The Lake House\\" is a touching film, free of all the hustle and bustle of modern American cinema and culture in general. There's no emailing, just good old-fashioned letter writing. It's a throwback to the real movies - before we forgot how to make them - before we forgot that a movie is about the people in it and not about sex, drugs and rock and roll. \\"The Lake House\\" is a beautiful film and you should really go see it. Don't go in expecting it to all make sense, but go in with an open heart and open eyes and let it win you over. Critics have gone to theatres with their arms crossed and their minds made up already. Take a lesson from Alex and Kate, open your heart and see what happens.<br /><br />Ebert said he enjoyed the film quite a lot despite it's complicating plot and Roeper called it one of his favorite movies of 2006! Ebert and Roeper (two of the most respected movie critics in the biz) can't both be wrong!quite a lot despite it's complicating plot and Roeper called it one of his favorite movies of 2006!

B000A0GXGA|4.0|MAVERICK was an incredible TV series that was way, way ahead of its time. This sampler is nice... but it's no substitute for a feature-packed DVD boxed set produced by someone like Paul Brownstein (who did the GUNSMOKE, WILD WILD WEST and DICK VAN DYKE boxed sets). But if WB wants to do another MAVERICK sampler, let's see one that includes the \\"Shady Deal at Sunny Acres\\" episode from the original MAVERICK, the unsold ABC pilot THE NEW MAVERICK, the pilot from the CBS series YOUNG MAVERICK, and the first and last episodes of the NBC series BRET MAVERICK. Seeing \\"Shady Deal\\" and the last episode of BRET MAVERICK (in which Jack Kelly makes a surprise appearance as Bart) would make nice bookends to the entire MAVERICK saga.

B000005QH3|5.0|Barry Newman plays Kowalski (no first name given), who used to be part of the statist machinery directed by \\"The Man\\".  He began life as an inductee in the local government indoctrination center, doing a 12-year sentence.  After graduation, he did his dance with the military before rejoining the civilian side of a country on a war footing - as a cop!  Somehow, Kowalski is able to untangle his mind from a lifetime of cultural programming and become a free-thinking person.  The catalyst for this event is \\"The Man\\", who reacted heavy-handedly to Kowalski's moral clarity and made him an outcast.  One thing leads to another and Kowalski then makes a wager that he can drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Denver, Colorado to San Francisco within 15 hours.<br /><br />That's when the real star of this film emerges - a white 1970 Dodge Challenger with 440 cubic inches of internal combustion engine fed by a six pack that could make over 400 horse power (although Dodge said 390 hp to help out buyers with their car insurance).  This fine example of MOPAR muscle steals the show in a classic car-chase film.<br /><br />The viewer of this awesome road film gets to ride along with Kowalski, Man!  Cops in hot pursuit are everywhere, and there are plenty of opportunities to experience the Challenger's frame-straightening torque and sudden acceleration, even at slow speeds.  Kowalski lights up the rears more than once!  This Challenger is all muscle, Man.<br /><br />You can watch this film a thousand times if you fast forward to all the chase scenes.
B000BP5OXW|5.0|What would you do, if a mysterious plague swept throughout the world, literally killing everyone off, but leaving in its place something new, something frightening, something downright horrible, while leaving you alive, immune and seemingly alone? What would you do, if the undead now walked the earth looking for you, the last man alive...the last vestige of the human race? What if what they wanted was the taste of your blood on their lips? Just what on earth would you do?<br /><br />These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book which demands to be read. Read it. You will not be disappointed.
B000003Z6I|5.0|It's hard to qualify music like this with a category without using prefixes like 'post-' and 'art-', and I know that Nick Cave himself objects to being associated with the 'g' word. However, I think goth-rock fits this album best. There's the dark theatricality that you find in all of Nick Cave's work but also unpredictable, frenetic bursts of noise that are more like the work of the Birthday Party taken to even further extremes. For example, some sections of \\"Cabin Fever!\\" sound like they were recorded in some insane sawmill... IN HELL! <br /> <br />The album may at first sound like a mess, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with some great moments. After a few listens you'll be joining in the weary bar-room choruses of the more restrained tracks (Wings Off Flies, Well Of Misery). The braver listener may also attempt to sing along with such higher-volume tracks as 'Cabin Fever!' and the title track, but be warned. Anyone overhearing you will think you are certifiably insane. <br /> <br />Ballads like \\"A Box For Black Paul\\" and \\"Saint Huck\\" point towards the more restrained, narrative form Cave's work would take later on down the road, and the cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Avalanche\\" is also a killer. All in all, 'Tender Prey' is probably a more accessible introduction to the Bad Seeds, but this one is my personal favourite. A crazy ride.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Few people have ever been as controversial in government life as Robert McNamara was in his seven years as the Defense Secretary of this nation between 1961 and 1968, when a dirty little war in Vietnam escalated into a conflagration that tore America apart.  It is this controversial individual that documentary filmmaker Errol Morris gets a lot out of in his often poignant 2002 documentary THE FOG OF WAR, and the end result gave me a very good appreciation for the man, even if the decisions he made with respect to Vietnam, partly with John F. Kennedy but mostly with Lyndon Johnson, resulted in the loss of 58,000 US service men and women, and countless millions of Asians.    During his time as SecDef, McNamara was often criticized as cocky and arrogant--a regular \\"Wiz Kid\\" from Harvard who seemingly had no business being in the position Kennedy had appointed him too.  Certainly, the slicked-back hair would give one that impression.  But as we see in THE FOG OF WAR, McNamara rose to the level of brilliance in his ability to help Kennedy defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 and keep it from exploding into Armageddon, all the while fending off the macho warmongering of Curtis LeMay and other rabid anti-Commie types in the government at that time.  Even now, as he is pushing 90, he remains adamant and proud of his time in government life, but he is also willing to admit the seriousness of the mistakes he made, particularly with our gross misreading of the Vietnam war as being a part of the Cold War, when in truth it was an internal matter of the Vietnamese wanting independence from outside forces, including ours.    And for a man who was often accused of being overly analytical and unemotional, McNamara chokes up when he thinks of Kennedy and the man's untimely assassination in Dallas in 1963, and declares unequivocally that Kennedy would never have allowed the Vietnamese conflict to escalate into a war that would kill millions, let alone tear the greatest nation in the world asunder.  This is a man who has gained a lot of wisdom about the ways of politics and war, but it has been through an enormous amount of pain, not to mention an enormous amount of lives lost.  Although Morris (who directed the highly acclaimed THE THIN BLUE LINE) does occasionally find McNamara as evasive now as he may have been during his time in office, he nevertheless gives us a great deal of insight as to regards with McNamara's life and times, and how world events came to shape his thinking.    Given the passage of time, and thanks to Morris' sobering film, I believe it's safe to say that McNamara, though he is regarded even today by many pundits as the worst SecDef this nation has ever had, merits a great deal of sympathy and respect in hindsight, for his time in office was one in which the great pressures of the Cold War would probably have swallowed up just about anyone who held his position.  His wisdom is one earned through considerable pain, and it is the kind of wisdom that was totally lacking with Donald Rumsfeld, whose hubris made McNamara at his most incendiary look like a halfway-decent guy.
B000EMGAOY|2.0|Stadium Arcadium is a nice pop album.  <br /> <br />The Red Hot Chili Peppers has to learn that just because they are more \\"mature\\" and \\"older\\" and more \\"sophisticated\\" and more \\"popular\\" means that everything they do now has to be subdued and ready made for radio play. If this is what maturity and sophistication is, then it is no wonder why rock is in the god-awful state that it is in today.  <br /> <br />Seriously. There is too much mid-tempo rock and too much pop ballads. There's just too much pop in general. Kiedis sounds good, but way too monotone. The songwriting is redundant, tiring, and boring, and nearly all of the tunes are rehashes of their past songs. The album is overproduced, even though I'll give the engineer Ryan Hewitt credit for not having audio clipping problems which was a the tale of the sound on Californication and By The Way. <br /> <br />Now to the actual songs. Stadium Arcadium lacks cohesiveness and for a two hour double album, the Peppers risked overkill and unfortunately they did it. There is nothing new or impressive on this album, anything on this album I hear, I already have heard it in some capacity on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, One Hot Minute, Californication, and By The Way. Way too many songs are composed in the same fashion and some are composed too much like songs they have done in the past. <br /> <br />The funk on this album is terrible. It's a total insult to funk period. Kiedis vocals are way too glossed to be convincing for a funk song; the funk and mid-tempo to soft mix which is present is as old as old can get. There was a sense of unpredictability when the Chili Peppers did the funk; there's no surprises on here and it is nothing short of pathetic.  <br /> <br />It irritates me that the Peppers have to do virtually the same thing for THREE consecutive albums. THREE. Even though this is the first time that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have recorded three  albums with the exact same line up and that is good for consistency, it isbad when they sound nothing more than mere extensions of each other. There's no hint of freshness on this album that has been a staple of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Frusciante sounds almost exactly the same as he did in By The Way; Flea's bass grooves continues to be the only saving grace of  this album, even though it is a far cry from the work he has done in the past; and I guess it is a positive that Chad Smith has the most involvement with his drumming on this album ever since One Hot Minute.  <br /> <br />The glowing reviews for this album are absurd. This band is not getting better with age; they're becoming more and more redundant, I am tired of of the albums being dominated by mid-tempo to pop ballad mess; there is nothing impressive about this album; this album shouldn't be even mentioned in the same sentence of classics such as Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Mother's Milk, and One Hot Minute, and if this is going to be the predictable and tiring musical direction that they are going to go in, then I am officially through with this band.
0307277674|1.0|I was looking forward to a book that I couldn't put down, but this book was hardly that. I couldn't finish it. The various characters and scenes seemed familiar somehow. Borrowed elements from an Indiana Jones movie, except made boring somehow? And the writing itself doesn't inspire either: \\"Is there time? (italicized for some reason) He knew it didn't matter. Without hesitation, Langdon broke into a sprint back towards the stairs.\\" Hmmm. Why would he hesitate? Worried about a cramp? And since when do people break into a sprint? How about this: \\"Without another word, Langdon pulled his pen from his jacket pocket and ....\\" Yes sir, no hesitation, he just threw caution to the wind and whipped out that pen. And how about this cliff hanger: They both froze. On the glass, six words glowed in purple, scrawled directly across Mona Lisa's face. We had to wait two more exciting pages to find out what those words were. Save your money for the movie. Tom and Audrie have to be better.
B000EHSVQ4|2.0|Director's Cut:    First of all, let me say that the following review seeks to address many different aspects of this film, including the contents provided in the Director's Cut package.  Therefore, let me prime this by saying that the Director's Cut is far superior to the original Theatrical Version, and although I still have some reservations towards Kingdom of Heaven (KOH), if you are going to watch this film the Director's cut is the way to go.  Ridley has added some 45 minutes of unseen footage to the theatrical release for this version, and it not only adds to the film, but it makes it coherent.  As well as the additional footage, the documentaries and featurettes are worth watching if you are interested in the film or in the filmmaking process.      Documentaries and Featurettes:    While the documentaries and featurettes provide much insight into filmmaking, you will have to sit through an exposé of Ridley Scott's hubris just to access it.  For instance, Ridley and his cohorts spend excess time bragging about the sophistry of their non-theatrical release - even making claims that the average movie goer is too ignorant to understand the depth and complexity of Ridley's full vision.  But, when we examine the characters they are all fairly one dimensional, nor is the plot anything to brag about considering that the actual crusades were far more interesting.  Ridley also spends lots of time prancing around with his nose in the air spurting out the \\"f\\" word as if it were the most cultured word in the English language.  However, Ridley's attitude aside, the documentaries and featurettes do provide access behind the scenes of the film and into Ridley's creative vision, which if you are curious minded like me, provides ample educational and entertaining material.      Historical Accuracy:     Having watched the bonus material in the Director's cut version, I can say that the production team spends extensive time detailing the various processes employed in order tomaintain historical accuracy.  Furthermore, three historians are interviewed in order to analyze some of the historical differences that non-the-less ended up in the film.  Throughout the historical analysis, the excuse is given that artistic license is required for a historical-fiction film; and therefore, the historical differences aren't worth nitpicking.  Furthermore, the historians and production team seem to agree that accurate historical epics would result in a documentary rather than a drama.  Unfortunately, this logic is not only ill informed, but is a contradiction from the marketing pitches used to promote this film.  One need only open the insert that comes with the Director's Cut to find an example of this marketing strategy:    \\"To tell the story as accurately as possible, screenwriter Monahan worked from primary sources, referring to the firsthand accounts (in translation) of people who were present while history was being made rather than interpretations written by others through the subsequent centuries.\\"     Which begs the question why then allow Ridley Scott's subsequent interpretation of the historical events?       It's not that this film required historical accuracy, but when you market it as such it should maintain the accuracy implied.  If you are interested in learning more about this, Wikipedia has a pretty decent rundown of the inaccuracies.      Christianity vs. Islam:    It's pretty obvious to the careful viewer that Ridley Scott had an axe to grind with Christianity, and in particular Catholicism.  Ridley not only dumbs down the crusader's faith, he portrays it as ignorant, absurd, brutish, vacuous, and trite.  Ridley's biased attitude seeps through numerous characters including the Knights Templar who use the token phrase \\"God Will's It!\\" as an excuse to do anything they like, Priests who steal, cheat, and lie, Monks who claim that goodness is fighting for those who can't defend themselves (a very shallow view of Catholic morality), anAtheist centrist (i.e. Balian played by Orlando Bloom) who sleeps around with a married woman yet still claims purity and uprightness, and a Bishop who exclaims near the end of the film \\"convert to Islam and convert back later!\\" - leading me to believe that Ridley has never dared to examine the lives of the thousands of martyrs in the Catholic faith who all chose death rather than conversion.  These characterizations only exist in Hollywood's delusional world as the real Crusaders gave up money, land, and family in order to defend Eastern Christendom from Muslim invasion and occupation, and in order to purify themselves through holy pilgrimage.  In fact, piety and Christian devotion had to exist to a greater degree than recognized in order to motivate the expense, hardship, and renunciation of material items and familial relationships that was required for Crusading.  Not to say that all Crusaders were pious and holy, they weren't, but most were, and they definitely had a reverence for Christ and their Catholic faith that doesn't exist in the mundane version of the Crusades shown here.     As well as showing Catholicism as a religion composed of barbaric zealots, Catholic practice is almost wholly omitted in KOH.  For example, Ridley excludes Catholic Sacraments and prayer entirely from the film except for two short scenes involving last rites or the Anointing of the Sick, which he then uses as an opportunity to attack the Sacrament of Confession - Godfrey (Liam Neeson) sluffs off confession with the claim that he doesn't regret the adulterous act that produced Balian, and King Baldwin (Edward Norton) dismisses confession altogether by exclaiming that \\"I will confess to God when I see Him.\\"  With this much anti-Catholic bias one should wonder why Catholics weren't more upset when this film was released.  It's almost as if Ridley feels it is his obligation to slap Catholics in the face, and he is only adding fuel to the anti-Catholic fire that was ignited by Hollywood long ago.     Conversely, when it comes to the Islamic religion an extreme amount of respect and reverence are offered by Ridley and his team.  The Islamic forces are largely depicted as civilized, deep, philosophic, and tolerant people, who are simply trying to fend off war mongering Christians.  Many assumptions are made regarding the Islamic side of the issue; for example, it is just a given that the Holy Land was Muslim occupied long before Christians had stolen it.  Furthermore, Ridley gives Muslim prayer plenty of face time in the film, and even shoots the Christians jealously looking on - for of course, this degree of spirituality is far beyond anything a mere Christian could ever understand, let alone obtain.      Furthermore, the additional documentary footage reveals much about Ridley's view of the Islamic religion.  For instance, he remarks during one interview that he wants to portray religion with as much respect and reverence as possible, and he clarifies, \\"especially the Islamic religion.\\"  In reality, the actual Islamic militants were much more raw and brutal than Ridley has depicted, and the whole tolerance theme he applies to Saladin/Islam is a load of rubbish - largely invented by 19th century historians who were trying to redefine the Crusades in the face of existing conflicts.      Set and Costume Design:    Besides the fact that the Jerusalem set excludes the hill that Jerusalem sits upon, the set and costume designs are magnificent.  Actually, the grandiose scale of the sets and costumes really makes the film worth watching.  If anything, one can get a good idea of the feel of medieval times just from the costumes and sets.  The flags are also worth looking into as Ridley's team spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on flags alone and had hundreds of different types, which are all authentically recreated!  It's worth the time to watch the Featurettes with Janty Yates, as she provides insight into the huge effort involved in creating the numerous costumes for this epic.  Furthermore, the weapon design team did a fabulous job, one step below Lord of the Rings but awesome non-the-less.     Special Effects:    Again, compared to Lord of the Rings, Kingdom of Heaven is a notch below, but for technical battle scenes and vast armies it is still utterly impressive.  I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great action sequences, as KOH offers plenty of eye candy.        Score:    The score, written and conducted by Harry Gregson-Williams, is both fitting and enchanting.  With undercurrents from other Middle Eastern epics, Williams uses vocal performances and orchestral sounds to woo the audience into the movie.  The music certainly outweighed the theatrical release, but with the Director's cut it seems to blend well.      Budget and Theatrical Release:    For a big time epic Hollywood production, Kingdom of Heaven performed poorly to say the least.  It is probably one of the bigger flops in Hollywood history, especially considering that Ridley Scott is one of the most highly acclaimed action directors of our times.  However, having watched the Theatrical version, its easy to see why it failed - the movie was one dimensional and the plot was incoherent.  There is a 30 minute presentation by Ridley and team in the Director's Cut package that dialogues the numerous failings of the theatrical release, and it is well worth watching as the team offers invaluable insight into the disappointment and propriety involved in marketing and cutting Hollywood movies.  In short, Ridley Scott makes the claim that his original version of the movie (i.e. with the boy) is wholly preferable to the rubbish he ended up cutting.  However, under pressure from the studio, Ridley collaborated with the effort to shorten the film and remove the boy from the movie.      Perhaps, as Ridley claims, the theatrical release would have been more successful had his version been shown rather than the watered down release thatended up in cinemas.  We'll never know what the outcome would have been.  However, if I had to speculate, I would say that even though the Director's cut is vastly superior to its theatrical predecessor, American audiences would still have avoided the film because of its clear and arduous attacks on Christianity.  As indicated by another viscously anti-Christian movie, the Da Vinci Code - it shattered box offices around the world, but took in pitiful amounts in the U.S for a production of its size.      Oh well, better luck next time Ridley!
0385336691|5.0|Edwin Lane may have had both his wives kidnapped and killed.<br /><br />But we don't even know about the first set of circumstances until we're well into the 10th outing for Lee Child's larger-than-life hero, Jack Reacher.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book, and I was not disappointed by the conclusion, the plot, the writing.  Child had some ups and downs at the start of the series; poor editing, taking Jack down a road that mere mortals travel instead of leaving him as the implausible former Army MP who travels the country with little or no worldly possessions, his size and skill as an investigator and his prowess in a brawl keeping him in close contact with the soft, dark underbelly of the country.<br /><br />The book opens in NYC, surprisingly, one of Jack's favorite places.  Everything notwithstanding, he can stay anonymous there.  Quite by chance (there are TOO many coincidences in the book, like any good Reacher outing), he witnesses a man leaving the scene of a ransom drop.  He doesn't know that, but he's observed each and every detail; and when he returns to the coffee shop the next day, he meets the first of many staff members of a former military security consultant cum mercenary general; the previously named Edwin Lane.<br /><br />With this kidnapping, Lane's stepdaughter (who he doesn't seem that fond of) has been taken with his wife.  In one chapter, we visit them in their captivity.  That chapter alone leaves us unprepared for the way the bottom falls out of the tale when Reacher first agrees to help Lane.  Reacher's scorn of Lane's staff (he classifies them as a group of soldiers who take orders well, but who were probably general or dishonorable discharges, due to a variety of poor judgements on their part).<br /><br />Although there's not much character development of Lane's second wife, the daughter, the man, known to Lane, who kidnapped them, Child clearly defines their roles.  More interesting are  the former FBI agent who joins Reacher, in more ways than one, and the sister of Lane's prior wife, who sets enough doubt in Reacher's mind to have him refuse to walk away, there is just enough - we are more than rewarded with his decision to seek justice against Lane for those who he's had killed.<br /><br />Devotion to making the world right, whenever he can, at the risk of personal safety, and with a total sense of fearlessness and aplomb, is what Reacher's all about.  And when you finish the book, you'll be more than satisfied that you've followed this series with faith that Child would let Reacher continue to be somewhat of a timebomb and hero rolled into one.  Because Child doesn't, for the most part, introduce a cast of supporting characters that goes from book to book, you can also enjoy any Reacher story as a stand alone.  But don't.  If you love thrillers, read the series, one delicious book at a time!gent who joins Reacher, in more ways than one, and the sister of Lane's prior wife, who sets enough doubt in Reacher's mind to have him refuse to walk away, there is just enough - we are more than rewarded with his decision to seek justice against Lane for those who he's had killed.   <br /> <br />Devotion to making the world right, whenever he can, at the risk of personal safety, and with a total sense of fearlessness and aplomb, is what Reacher's all about.

B000EULJLU|4.0|For the longest time, because I lacked patience, I did not like tool. Tool is not very accessable. It takes time to wrap your brain around their different concept of what music is or should be. This new album has some fantastic songs that do not take too much time to adjust to and, therefore, you can appreciate almost immedietly (Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot). I feel that the really long songs that some people are upset over are simply attempts to expand horizons, to explore new territory, and I really respect that. I did not feel, as some reviewers have felt, that these songs were only background noise and soundscapes--only tool trying to grow artistically! Lots of people only want to hear that same thing from their favorite bands and desert them as soon as they are offered something different or more challenging. I do not want to hear Undertow: Part 2, or Lateralus Revisited. <br />    This album is twice as good as any of the HardRock/Metal that one is exposed to on mainstream radio. I am not some \\"tool geek\\". If tool sold out or offered me a \\"load of goods\\" I would be the first to shout from the roof-tops--however, I think that maynard would rather cut his wrists than pander to anyone. I think tool's main objective is self expression, they will throw a few bones to the record companies but you will not find hardly any here.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I love this movie!  There is a lot of the dry, sarcastic humor that I tend to appreciate.  It was not what I expected.  It has lots of comedy, mystery, action, romance and drama all in one solid package.  I was told about this movie while it was at the theater, but I couldn't find it playing near us.  I rented it on day one of release and have watched it two more times since that to pick up anything I may have missed, as it moves quickly.  The acting was incredible on the parts of all of the leads.  It reminded me in parts of a less violent Pulp Fiction type because there are no good guys.  You root for the good-intentioned, likable leads.  I've always loved Downey and I think he is one of the best actors of our time.  This movie gave me a new appreciation for Kilmer.  He was dry, yet so funny.  I was not familiar with Michelle Monaghan, but she felt very real to me.  This movie is great and somehow lost $ at the box office.  Please show it some well earned love and respect!
B000FILW86|4.0|I tend to give five stars only if an album has aged well. \\"Rockford\\" certainly has that potential. What a great group of songs! All well composed, performed and with hooks that just grab you and won't let go. <br /> <br />The unsung hero of Cheap Trick? Why, none other than Mr. Bun E. Carlos! Has a man ever played drums so perfectly as on this record? Never overplaying, a trait that he learned from the pop drumming master, Ringo Starr, but adding just enough chops to keep the rhythms from getting mundane. Bun E. drums his heart out on this one. <br /> <br />And Robin Zander is over 50, smokes, and sounds like this? Sick!! <br /> <br />
055357342X|5.0|This series is really entertaining. George Martin kills off all his heroes and heroines with abandon. Just when you sense order being brought to the world of these characters, he rips it up and starts over. What a great way to keep the story fresh.  <br /> <br />I bought all three one after another. I'm waiting for the paperback for the forth, but might have to buy the hardcover.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols are one of the three most prominent punk bands of all time. The other two, of course, being the Clash and Iggy. It's hard to compare the Pistols to the Clash, though I see that many other reviwers have. The Pistols were fiercer, angrier, and fired up as hell. The Clash were much less so, but that also guaranteed their music and message to be longer lasting, which it was. The Pistols could never last; their rage was far too intense to. This cd is fantastic, and for all the teeny boppers that say it isn't, you know nothing about punk rock. Of course, I guess it isn't fair to expect you to because 1976 was the year of punk, and that was before any of the Good Charlotte and Blink-182-loving reviewers were even born.
0452282152|4.0|A clever and believable tale centered around one of Vermeer's most famous paintings,  Girl with a Pearl Earring.  I was completely intrigued with the way Ms. Chevalier seemed to spin every aspect of the tale  to the point where the reader feels voyeuristic for peering in on such private moments!<br /><br />I will never look at this painting in the same way again. Vermeer's mother in law was in fact named Maria Thyns (note: Maria Thins in the book), and the Dutch Master indeed  sired 11 children.  Another fact is that  many of Vermeer's works were purchased by the very wealthy Pieter Van Ruijven. So as you can see,  this wonderful work of fiction is steeped with important historical facts.<br /><br />Wonderfully creative.  Clean, crisp. bare bones writing style.
0800177975|5.0|Saw this movie on HBO and it was very cool.I like it when Jack Slater says to the bad guy at the end,\\"No sequel for you\\".Rated PG-13 for strong action sequences.Canada:14A.Great movie for the whole family.
B00005JMR5|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that this film is underrated.  First of all, the acting is very good.  Quite frankly, the pairing of Mikhail Baryshnikov, Greggory Hines and Isabella Rosselini is reason enough to see this film.    Not that I'd recommend it to everybody. Sure, it feels kind of dated with the 80's music.  And like every single dance movie I've ever seen, it's a little difficult to take it seriously when the characters suddenly stop their dialogue and dance because the screenplay says \\"insert stunning dance sequence here\\".  Yet, unlike those other dance films, this one does not rely on filler about backstage bickering, romance and coming-of-age.    This film successfully takes the dance movie genre in a whole new direction by setting it in Russia during the Cold War.  Suddenly the plot is no longer filler that justifies the dancing, but actually raises some interesting questions when Nikolai's idealistic view of American freedom clashes with Randolph's pessimistic view.  If you're a fan of Baryshnikov, Hines or dance in general, do not hesitate to see this one, because it's really a joy to see them together and the film itself isn't bad either.
B000F48CD8|3.0|Better than the White Stripes but not as good as Brendan Benson solo.  It's a shame that Brendan isn't receiving more credit for this project. He's a far more talented songwriter than White and still you only hear The Raconteurs referred to as Jack White's band. There are a few gems here such as \\"Hands\\", \\"Together\\", and \\"Call It a Day\\", but much is fairly average. If you're into this record do yourself a favor and buy Benson's three solo albums.
B00004BZ0V|5.0|The Clash are my favorite band of all time, so of course I gave this cd 5 stars. If you haven't listened to The Clash's music before, you are really missing out! This is a good collection of their singles, and is a decent beginning to any punk collection. That being said, it's only a beginning. I agree with the reviewer below me who said that there are better cds compilations of The Clash's music. I'd reccomend \\"The Story of The Clash,\\" which has 28 of their songs, including one of their best singles \\"Career Opportunites.\\" But, any cd of The Clash is good.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I'm not a big fan of the first Underworld film. But, I bought the sequel because many said it was awesome...and they were right. Kate Beckinsale returns as the vampire Selene and Scott Speedman returns as the half-vampire, half-werewolf Michael.    Selene and Michael team up to stop the first vampire Marcus (Curran) from freeing his werewolf brother William (Steele). Bill Nighy makes appearance as Victor in a past scene.     Len Wiseman does another great job with the dark visuals in this film, and the setting is awesome. To me, the story in this one was better than the original one, but everyone has their own opinion.     I said if I like this film, I would give the first one a second chance, and I will. Once I see it again, I'll give in my review. Forget BloodRayne, Selene is way better than her (at least the film version of BloodRayne). If you're a fan or not a fan of the first Underworld, go checkout this cool sequel.
1400032717|5.0|I picked this up a few years ago and thought it was one of the most original books I've read in a long time.  For lack of a better word, I have to say this book is \\"Neat!\\", and the exclamation is a must.  The creativity comes from the perspective the story is told, a 12 year old autistic Christopher John Francis Boone, who \\"relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions\\", and also likes prime numbers but hates the color yellow.<br /><br />My favorite Christopher quote:<br />\\"Stupid things are things like emptying a jar of peanut butter onto the table in the kitchen and making it level with a knife so it covers all the table right to the edges... \\"<br /><br />So Christopher goes on a mission to solve a murder mystery, the murder of his neighbor's poodle.  The rest you must read yourself.  I must say this book is GOLD, Christopher's journey is funny and heartbreaking at the same time. Haddon's teaching background and work with autistic children shows brilliantly in this work.
B00005JP01|3.0|yest its probably leading further and further away from waht it started out as but i still liked it more than part  2 and way more than that roller ball movie no movie of the year but ketp my attention
0375703764|3.0|I was really enjoying this book at the outset.  Though I was mildly annoyed by the distraction of the gritty, seemingly irrelevant, and not particularly well-written footnotes I'd been advised to read, and the unnecessary denseness and divergences of the body of the book, much of the discussion, was very interesting/insightful.  As the book wore on however, I found it more pretentious than anything.  The book is conscious of the book and while this gives it something, the \\"awareness\\" present in the narration of Johnny Truant seeks to portray it as something extremely powerful and largely accounting for his deteriorating state of mind.  I realize this is supposed to add to the horror-novel-ness of the book but instead it seems to reinforce the nagging feeling at the back of one's mind that the book's author was quite full of himself.  At first wowed by its bizarre layout, I ended extremely annoyed by it.  I'm impressed by the character-development and the innovativeness of the book but overall, it was a largely unsatisfying, and at times very frustrating, read.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music. In his musical style/class, I would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with Walter Trout weighing in first place.  As you can easily see from all of the other reviews, I believe that you will find this CD well worth purchasing - as I have found all his material is. (After purchasing this item, I eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and haven't been disappointed.) As with any CD, you may not like all the selections but I believe the vast majority of his material you will. Among my favorites on this CD are: `Pack It Up', `You Upset Me Baby', and `Man of Many Words'. Bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. Since he is young and gifted, we can expect many more superb CD's in the future. Highly recommended.
B000294SFW|5.0|After too many mediocre (\\"March or Die\\", \\"Hammered\\", \\"We are Motorhead\\"), or almost-good (\\"B*stards\\", \\"Sacrifice\\"), or downright bad (\\"Snake Bite Love\\"), albums, this is a true return to form by Lemmy and the boys. Much of this seems to be related to the new producer hired for this album (and for the upcoming one), Cameron Webb. On the bonus DVD that accompanies some Inferno copies, Lemmy admits that Webb got them out of their old routine and really pushed them to 'try a little harder' this time.<br /><br />And it shows. You can hear that a lot of care has gone into (most of) the songs, the production is cool and understated, and Lemmy's voice hasn't sounded better for a long time. OK, so there is no \\"Ace of Spades\\" or \\"Overkill\\" on this one, but the overall standard of the songs is very high nonetheless. \\"Killers\\", \\"Down on Me\\", \\"In the Black\\", \\"In the Year of the Wolf\\", \\"In the Name of Tragedy\\", \\"Whorehouse Blues\\" are the stand-out tracks, really outstanding stuff. Maybe it also has something to do with Lemmy's involvement with Dave Grohl and Probot, that all of a sudden Motorhead sounds relevant again, and ready to conquer a new generation of fans.<br /><br />Especially the mighty threesome 'Down on Me', 'In the Black' and 'In the Name of the Wolf' show this new direction. Very heavy, midtempo songs, but with a new-found melodic streak, some innovative (indeed!) singing by Lemmy, a-typical lyrics. They are really what makes this album special. Such a pity that Motorhead hasn't gone on to play these songs live! In contrast, standard m'head filler like 'Fight' should really have been left out of the album.<br /><br />So please, none of that \\"Hey, this is Motorhead, these guys put out the same album every year, and it's always cool, so just go ahead and buy it\\", no, Inferno is different, and good. I still remember clearly hearing the mighty Orgasmatron on the radio when it was released, 20 years ago this year. Inferno is easily the best Motorhead studio album I've heard ever since.
0385513755|4.0|Love it.<br /><br />I recommend the illustrated version, the art and photographs will bring the reader right to the action, it's like a vacation to France. In my biased opinion, this book is quite fantastic on a literary level, with my only complaint being that it's slightly graphic.  However, Dan Brown certainly did his research and brought the controversial Holy grail arguement to life in a most entertaining thriller.<br /><br />I certainly will not bother to state my opinions on religious matters on the book as it would take far too much time here (and I am far too lazy). However I think despite its controversy most readers will enjoy the Code for its interesting tidbits, such as the fibonacci sequences & PHI (CRAZY no?), anagrams & symbology, and references to Da Vinci's paintings.  Don't bother to watch the movie, read the book.
B00007KWI9|5.0|Okay I'm a very long term Yes fanatic but, I never bought this one until now. Unfortunately other than Chris and Jon I'm not sure who the rest of this line up is. It's great, it's ruff but still has that sharpness only YES brought to progressive rock. I especially like that old jazz mix. I think if ELP had hung on to that a little more they'd still be putting it out like my boys here did way back when. My only regret is never got to hear something like \\"Somethings Coming\\" in any live set. Probably never will but defintely recommend any Yes freak like me needs this CD. It ain't tails but not supposed to be. PS Why is Chris Squire's CD so darn expensive...I've got the album but making that jump at these prices is a bit much.
B000002N2P|3.0|I've never liked Green Day, infact I despie them much, but I have to admit, this is actully pretty good for punk music.  Sure the song writing isn't exactly the most \\"spell binding\\" ever, but it's punk, what do you expect?  It's not like Pink Fyold or any classic bands, it's a genre of it's own.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Green Day is horrible compared to those bands, I'm saying they're a different type of band.  I will admit that the songs sound slightly different, and some of them pretty catchy (Brain Stew, Geek Stink Breath, Walking Contradiction,  and Stuart and the Ave.) but they all sound a little similar.   <br /> <br />The lyrics are nicely filled out and the music actully seems to flow smoothly, which I  don't usually see in music like this. So I actully did enjoy this album, much to my surprise. From the Loner (Armatage Shanks) to the Walker (couldn't think of a better word, too tired, Walking Contradiction) it's all pure punk, all the way through. The riffs in many of the songs are pretty unqie and catchy, and the drums make a good \\"appreance\\".  It's a little short though, lasting only about 30 or so minutes, but it's good.  It's different from a few of their other albums, it's pure punk, it actually works.         <br /> <br />I thought I would always hate this band and that they would never have a saving grace, but I may of found it, in a little Insomniac.
0452282152|5.0|I thought the writing was clean. The story unwove smoothly. The character was likable. I thought the historical detail was perfect, not too overdone.  Many reviewers did not like this book much and perhaps John Grisham is more to their taste. It is not a fast paced paperback to read on the plane. Rather a book to be savoured like fine wine.
B000F48CD8|4.0|I really enjoy Jack White, just as much as the next mid 20 year old kid, but it pains me when they say this is \\"jack's band\\".  This band is a conglomerate of talents, which is headed by who I think is one of the most under-rated musicians to date = Brendan Benson.  This album rocks out though, it's a great mix of different styles/sounds, and it's too bad they only produced 10 tracks.  I can't stop listening, and please check out Benson's solo albums, you won't regret it.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I had hoped the new Doctor Who... <br />  <br />(no REAL fan would call it \\"Dr.\\", you know)  <br /> <br />... would be at least ok. <br /> <br />Having seen the entire first season  <br />(several times - thanks Sci-Fi Channel!)  <br />I must say: <br /> <br /> \\"OK ??? It was SUPERB !!!\\"  <br /> <br />(with apologies to the fourth Doctor). <br /> <br />To my joy, Christian Eccleston and Billie Piper brought some quality acting to the new show, with Billie Piper winning a couple of British acting awards for her work last season, and the series an award for best drama. <br /> <br />I was sorry to loose Eccleston after the first season (but look forward to Tennent), and will be very sorry to loose Piper after the second - Rose has quickly become one of my favorite companions! <br /> <br />But I am VERY happy to have my favorite SCIFI show back on the air - and hope the SCI-FI channel will soon announce that it will continue the series here in the USA. <br /> <br />But regardless, I will buy any new season DOCTOR WHO DVD the BBC produces, starting with this one !!! <br />
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon still contains hope that humankind on planet Earth may be a sort of \\"WORK-IN-PROGRESS\\".  <br /> <br />FIRST OFF - This is the film where numerous perspectives/viewpoints of the same event illustrate rather persuasively how [literally] there are often two or more sides to most stories. The central event in this story has been the basis of many similar themes since. The Roshomon knock-off that is the most fun to watch and most illuminating to me is probably an episode of \\"All IN THE FAMILY\\" titled, \\"EVERYBODY TELLS THE TRUTH\\". Of course, Archie Bunker does not deal in subtlety, so it is an interesting and comical take on the Roshomon theme.  <br /> <br />Another similar treatment, but this time a drama, is on the big screen and features Paul Newman, \\"The Outrage\\", from 1964, with William Shatner, Lawrence Harvey and Claire Bloom as co-stars. This film is hard to find, but well worth the effort.      <br /> <br />RAMBLING ON ABOUT \\"RASHOMON\\":  <br /> <br />This film is NOT an easy thing to watch. In English it is somewhat less effective and in Japanese one must contend with the subtitles. Still, I suggest the Japanese with subtitles. Be aware, however, that this is a highly visual film so avoid getting bogged down in the subtitles. More than any other film I have seen, \\"Rashomon\\" shows rather than tells, so be prepared to pay very close attention to seemingly small details. Like Kubrick, everything you see and the way you see it has been reduced or altered to be just what is needed for the story. In essence, this is a rather stark though epic production and it may take a few viewings to truly appreciate \\"Rashomon's\\" true splendor and significance. It is a short movie that I wished was longer though I was quite satisfied with the ending.  <br /> <br />WHAT THIS FILM IS ABOUT: [Without giving away the plot of course.]  <br /> <br />HOPE! Through the re-enactment of some perceptional permutations and nuances of a tragic event we are almost left with the conclusion that human beings are fatally-flawed, evil, weak beings fueled by lust and driven with selfish motives and little else.  <br /> <br />THE MESSAGE OF HOPE:  <br /> <br />But then there is a ray of hope in the form of a helpless abandoned infant and what follows. What we see is intrinsically-flawed humans that through self-awareness may seek to improve their character. If this is true, maybe then through self-awareness, human flaws may be intrinsic but solvable over time making us flawed but NOT FATALLY FLAWED! Sentience may over time be our deliverance in the form of character and integrity. If this is true, then humans are not naturally depraved and everything may not be preordained. Perhaps we are a kind of \\"work-in-progress\\". What a nice thought, though Kurosawa gives it to us rather like castor oil.  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD:  <br /> <br />This is a Criterion Collection DVD and that speaks for itself. Here, however, the best special feature is the rather large booklet that is included with the DVD. The transfer is excellent for a 55-year-old black and white film and it is in Full Screen Format. <br /> <br />LAST THOUGHTS: A FILM THAT MAY NEED TO BE SEE MORE THAN ONCE TO FULLY APPRECIATE <br /> <br />ALSO RECOMMENDED TO VIEW: <br /> <br /> --* \\"EVERYBODY TELLS THE TRUTH\\", ALL IN THE FAMILY - episode 58, 1973 <br /> <br /> --* \\"THE OUTRAGE\\", Martin Ritt, 1964 <br />
B00007LTIA|4.0|Review no. 94. Originally released in 1974, as this was the seventh record from Yes. This longplayer features four lengthy tracks that deal with vocalist Jon Anderson's interest in Eastern religons. Rest assure, 'Tales From...'  is quite nicely put together, I thought. Two cuts that I was most impressed with were &quot;Revealing Science Of God&quot; and &quot;The Ancient-Giants Under The Sun&quot;. This pressing comes as an expanded 2-CD reissue with two bonus tracks and informative liner notes. Ideal for any true Yes fan over the age of forty. 'Tales From...' MORE than proves that Yes is and always will be at the top of the heap of the progressive / art rock bands. A real keeper. Recommended.

Magic.<br /><br />Except there's one big problem, he wants out of the doll's body in order to start again, because Andy the young boy is the first person he tells his secret too he has to be the one who's body is sacrificed.<br /><br />The young Andy is quite properly terrified, his Good Guy doll moves without batteries and the name on the box is not his dollies name, he whispers, tells Andy things and his mum thinks he's making it up.<br /><br />One dead babysitter later and the possibility of living plastic doesn't seem too far fetched, not when confronted with the fact it was either that, or your son that had commited murder.<br /><br />I love the movie.  I have watched many times and still feel Chucky in his first movie had the power to give people the chills.<br /><br />I know there was a doll clear out when it was first played in our house!<br /><br />Would recommend to fans of Puppetmaster especially.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album redifined the all speed/ thrash movement and is easely my favorite album by Metallica. \\"Fight fire with fire\\" is a thrash masterpiece. Their raw sound, the guitars, the vocals, the drums, the solos, all is in the right place to make this one of the best metal albums of all time. If you want thrash masterpieces check out: Dark Angel's \\"Darkness descends\\"; Megadeth's \\"Peace sells...but who's buying\\" and Anthrax's \\"Among the living\\". You won't regret it!!! <br />
0783225849|5.0|SOME FIRST THOUGHTS - - <br /> <br />Before \\"Jaws\\" chased us out of the water, we had Norman Bates to send us packing and running off to the supposed safety of the nearest Holiday Inn or Best Western. <br /> <br />SO WHAT HAPPENS:  <br /> <br />Sure, we all know the story. For some reason Janet Leigh steals 40 grand so that her boyfriend will stop making excuses and marry her. She ends up at the Bates Motel and the rest is cinematic history. If you are looking for something fresh and new, \\"Psycho\\" doesn't sound too promising, but . . . .  <br /> <br />BEFORE THERE WAS JAWS TO KEEP US OUT OF THE WATER:  <br /> <br />There was Psycho to give rise to chain motels across America. Days Inns, Holiday Inns, Best Westerns and many more. No more homey mom and pop motels for us. We knew that Norman Bates was waiting to welcome us at those just like Jaws was waiting for us at the beach. Ever wonder why there are so many swimming pools in Florida and California?  <br /> <br />But Psycho is different. It changes moods and is very disarming, almost subtle, while at the same time utterly creepy and uncomfortable to watch. Add to that an unreliable narrator and somehow an utterly sympathetic villian.  <br /> <br />THE DINNER SCENE: SANDWICHES ANYONE? <br /> <br />The tension really mounts as the odd chemistry between Perkins and Leigh in their dinner scene reveals a common bond of estrangement and disenfranchisement with normal society and the world.  <br /> <br />After dinner, Norman Bates [Anthony Perkins] opens up a peep-hole in his office wall. With obvious hunger, he studies Marion Crane [Janet Leigh] as she undresses, revealing her black panties and bra, now replacing the white set from the opening scene liason with her beau. Presumably, she dons black now as she is now an embezzler.  <br /> <br />IN-BETWEEN:  <br /> <br />The middle of the film is something you'll just have to see, to believe. Suffice it to say that it has aged well and generates palpable tension and discomfort. Bernard Hermann's score ratchets the tension up a notch along with the action.  <br /> <br />NORMAN BATES' CLAIM TO INNOCENCE IS SIMPLY THIS, \\"I WOULDN'T EVEN HURT A FLY\\"!  <br /> <br />We find out at the end, what Norman Bates'true motivations are, and we get it fast and concise from a head-shrinker [I mean psychiatrist]. After we feel pangs of impatience over having this nasty piece of exposition at the end, we get the real ending where we see how Mrs. Bates \\"wouldn't even hurt a fly\\", or would she?  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD:  <br /> <br />Looks and sounds great. Plays in either English or French, with close-captioning available. Great remastered dual-layer transfer in Widescreen.  <br /> <br />SPECIAL FEATURES:  <br /> <br />A 90 minute documentary that features Janet Leigh and Joe Stefano [Script Writer] and others. This doucmentary is among the best I have seen on a film this old, and it includes the Assistant Director, Hilton Green's comments about the production of the film.  <br /> <br />A 7 minute trailer with Hitchcock walking us through the sets and a filmography.  <br /> <br />IN THE END: <br /> <br />Anthony Perkins and Alfred Hitchcock really deliver in this simple yet chilling story of terror and suspense. <br /> <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Spectacular! There are no words to describe just how moving and honest and real this film is. The bottom line here is a message that transcends all barriers; gay or straight, male or female, rich or poor. The message is that love comes in many forms and if you are ever lucky enough to find a love so deep and strong, you must hang onto it regardless of all other outside factors. And when you don't, you very well could end up with nothing just as Ennis DelMar does. This is not a gay cowboy movie. It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.     I've read a lot of the other reviews and it seems that everyone has a different take on Jack and Ennis's relationship. But this is how I see it:  Yes, they were both gay and they were both in love, not in lust, with eachother. Lust doesn't last 20 years and the fact that they did go on to have so-called \\"normal\\" relationships with the women they married was not because they were bisexual but because they were doing what they thought they \\"had\\" to do. They tried hard to deny who they really were inside and married women, had families, then girlfriends but this was all part of the social pressure they felt to be \\"normal\\". Jack had more guts than Ennis did and was desperate to have a life with him because he needed him and loved him so badly, but Ennis was too uncomfortable with his love for Jack, was too embarrassed by it and couldn't have followed his heart because he was too consumed with the murder of the gay man he'd witnessed as a child. It isn't until the end, when Jack is gone, that Ennis comes to the realization that he let the love of his life slip through his hands. His daughter has found love and is getting married, Alma has remarried and Ennis finds himself alone with nothing to love or hang onto because he let his fears and insecurities about who he was come before his true love for Jack. The lesson is a hard one but the message is simple: No matter who you are or who you love, don't let anyone tell you who you should be. If you have love to give, give it freely and to whomever you wish. Never, never, never deny your heart.
0525244581|5.0|ok so i heard about this book through the fx tv series \\"rescue me\\" where it was made reference to. i really want to read it now since i have an interest in philosophy. it was said on the show \\"your taking life lessons from a semi retared bear\\" which was kinda funny. i didnt really know this book was real.
B000001FTD|5.0|<br />  If you looking for one album that contains everything that you could possibly imagine in a thrash album, here it is!!! One of the best three masterpieces, along with \\"State of Euphoria\\" and \\"Persistence of Time\\", but this album got something to desire, is their own distinctive sound. Anthrax obviously was one the \\"big four\\" and is not to expect lesser than the other albums on that time. Here you got excellent drums, incredible guitar riffs and breathtaking solos courtesy of Dan Spitz. This album, \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Reign in Blood\\" makes the thrash scene back in the day!!!
B00000G3PA|3.0|FIRST THOUGHTS -- Some people think the movie is terrific and some think it is far from terrific. Well, this film certainly had the talent to amount to something! Did it? <br /> <br /> <br />* THE CAST * DIRECTOR - Michael Bay & PRODUCER - Jerry Bruckheimer <br /> <br />Bruce Willis  - Harry S. Stamper  <br />Billy Bob Thornton  - Dan Truman  <br />Liv Tyler  - Grace Stamper  <br />Ben Affleck  - A.J. Frost  <br />Will Patton  - Charles (Chick) Chapple  <br />Peter Stormare  - Lev Andropov  <br />Keith David  - Gen. Kimsey  <br />Steve Buscemi  - Rockhound  <br />Owen Wilson  - Oscar Choi  <br /> <br />NOMINATED FOR THE FOLLOWING ACADEMY AWARDS; [tells a lot about the film] <br /> <br /> *BEST SOUND <br /> *BEST SOUND EFFECTS <br /> *BEST ORIGINAL SONG <br /> *BEST VISUAL EFFECTS <br /> <br /> <br />MY TAKE ON ARMAGEDDON: SOME GOOD SCENES .. BUT - <br /> <br />This is one of those notorious features that is a really bad film with some really good parts. Billy Bob Thornton playing NASA executive director Dan Truman turns in a believably impressive performance and leaves me wanting to see him in more scenes. Unfortunately, the melodramatic, over-the-top love subplot which begins the movie with Willis [Harry S. Stamper] literally taking shots at his daughter's [Liv Tyler] bed mate [Ben Affleck] establishes the tone for this flick. After this, my expectations were lowered to a more realistic level. Very little of what followed was believable even in a fictionalized, fantasy sort of way. The first-rate special effects were overdone to the point of inducing vertigo in me. I noticed many others in the theater wincing and/or turning away to avoid some of the dizzying special effects scenes in space, which seemed to come far too often and last far too long during the second half of this far too long 150 minute flick.  <br /> <br />The premise of this film and the talent on hand made this a potential powerhouse epic. Well, it still did well at the box office but it was neither an epic or powerhouse of a film. <br /> <br />IN THE END - Armegeddon is still a very difficult word to spell!Armegeddon finally boiled down to me, to be, $150 Million in Special Effects + a 2 Cent Romance which equalled a Headache. Nevertheless, the DVD plays very well and the award nominated special effects look extremely vivid and are really in your face for a very visceral experience. I only wish the rest of the film met the same standard as the effects did.  <br /> <br />

0446310786|5.0|This is my first attempt at writing a book review for amazon or otherwise, so forgive me if there's anything wrong with it. <br /> <br />There are a few things that will make an instant good book for me. The first and foremost thing is if I can relate to it at all. No matter how farfetched the situations are, if the characters feel real or I can some how believe what's happening, what they're feeling then the book has achieved a great amount: that's the first sign of a good book. The second sign is the ending. If the ending blows me away and I'll be sitting with the last sentence, mouth ajar for a few minutes I know I've read a good book. The last thing is what it's about: if it feels like fluff  or like the author didn't have much of a reason to write the novel other than money then it's hard to read. If the book is expressing a huge feeling that the writer's desperate to get out or if the novel's bringing something of importance to our attention however, then it's worth reading. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" had all these traits. <br /> <br />When I first opened Harper Lee's only novel I wondered about it for the first few pages. Jean Louise Finch, the narrator of the novel, was giving the reader a historical timeline of her family, which didn't attract my attention and I was worried I wouldn't like it, but as soon as the story began I couldn't put it down. I have to admit I'm a very slow reader and even with short books that I love, Old Man and the Sea for example (a circa 100 page novella), it takes me about a week or two to get through. I read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" in around 3 days. I'm not bragging or anything I'm just displaying it's grip. It's not a fast moving novel, it actually is slower and it just talks about normal life; but I couldn't leave the characters for too long because I developed such a strong bond with them instantaneously.  <br /> <br />I can't really go too far into the ending of the book because I don't want to give anything away but I must saythat about two pages before the end my heart was twisting, not because it was sad (although it was in a way), because it was so powerful... so good.  <br /> <br />Now I don't think it's any surprise that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" has important values tied to it. But I found that most all of the main messages of the book tie back to everyone being selfish and misunderstanding each other. There are numerous occasions of prejudice and you get the chance to see almost every character misunderstand and judge another. <br /> <br />The book really connected with me and I would suggest it to people who like books that show real human beings and tell coming of age stories that have much more meaning to them than cheesy TV movies. I can understand people not liking this book however, for its slowness but I didn't find it slow at all: I could hardly put it down. Overall this book has been extremely enjoyable to read and I would call it one of my favourites.
B00006RINF|5.0|Basically the only similarities these two bands have is that they have a female singer. Firstly Cristina Scabbia sings way better, and secondly she's much hotter. The music is nice to relax and contains some great slow songs such as \\"comalies\\" where cristina sings in Italian, but there are some heavier songs such as \\"Swamped\\" and \\"Daylight dancer\\" The drumwork in this album is allright but under average for a metal band, he doesn't make great use of his double pedal, however the chorus of \\"Daylight Dancer\\" has an interesting beat. The guitarworks isn't very challenging but has some nice riffs that fit metal very well. Finally onto Cristina's voice, it's beautiful, and the lyrics are well written, however I think that they should just keep Cristina and have only one singer because the male singer isn't great and has this annoying Italian accent (see \\"Swamped\\"). Overall this album is very enjoyable to listen to if you're looking for an interesting new sound, however, this album will not keep you hooked for more than a month.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Before you get this CD, ask yourself one thing: Are you an AFI fan, or AFI fanboy? If you answered AFI fan, then go get this cd. You probably enjoy the evolution from CD to CD, and will stick by the band as long as they don't stray too far. If you answered AFI fanboy, only buy this CD if you feel like doing nothing but bitching. You either hate everything after AOD, maybe even BSITS, but you still buy every CD and complain on internet board about how bad it is. Either way, this is my review.<br /><br />Prelude 12/21: 10/10, honestly, I think this is the best AFI intro to date. There's something about the electronic aspect of it that makes it catchy, creepy, and all out beautiful.<br /><br />Kill Caustic: 7/10, it's a good song, but I think I got so used to the directors cut of Miss Murder and hearing the prelude before the song. This song now seems out of place, and I usually end up skipping it, but go back to it later. I really love Davey's screaming, and you get your first listen to Jade's amazing guitar tone. All in all a good first real song to the album.<br /><br />Miss Murder: 8/10, I totally love the bass intro to this song. The first time I heard this, I thought to myself, \\"Who the hell is this, they're really not bad.\\" Then after the song, the DJ said it was the latest from A Fire Inside. I wasn't sure if I was excited about this or not, but after finding the video on youtube and watching it a few times, I grew to love the song and the new style. Davey's lower singing voice is just as good as his higher voice, and the fact that they had fans sing backup on this song is just incredible. Great choice for first single.<br /><br />Summer Shudder: 8/10, I love the riffs in this song. I have no idea what the phone in the middle means, but that's part of the beauty of AFI. It could have deep meaning, or it could mean nothing and it's just funny to watch fans try to figure out what it means. Either way, one of my favorites on the CD.<br /><br />The Interview: 7/10, my favorite part of this song is the breakdown, ending, whatever. The organs with Davey and I think Jade singing together is just amazing. I couldn't imagine two singers who compliment each other so well.<br /><br />Love Like Winter: 10/10, this is my favorite on the CD. Everything about this song is catchy, the guitar, the melody, the electronics, and the foot steps keeping time in the begining. Not only that, but it sounds like it's a cover of a song from the 80's, but it's really an AFI song. I think the feel like this song should be 20 years old is a lot of the appeal to it. Whatever it is, this is an amazing song.<br /><br />Afflicition: 7/10, this sounds like it was a b-side from Sing The Sorrow.<br /><br />\\"Hey Davey, I kinda like this song but it didn't make it on our last album.\\"<br /><br />\\"I agree, let's re-record it and throw it on decemeberunderground.\\"<br /><br />It's a fairly good song, but nothing to special comes out about it.<br /><br />The Missing Frame: 5/10, the melody reminds me of Weezer sometimes, which should be cool, but this is my least favorite song on the CD. I usually skip this song, really nothing great about it.<br /><br />Kiss And Control: 8/10, I usually hunt this song down, well after Love Like Winter. I'm a sucker for AFI songs that start out all slow, but then the chorus comes in and hits hard. The little spoken part is pretty intense, and adds tons to the song. This song is pretty STSish, but unlike Affliction, doesn't sound like it belongs on it. Second favorite song on the album.<br /><br />The Killing Lights: 8/10, I don't have to hunt this one down, it's right after Kiss And Control. With an opening bass line that's very Blink 182ish, and a very poppy, catchy chorus, and even the bridge with Davey's \\"cut cut cut cut cut you up\\" part, this is another I listen to more than most.<br /><br />37mm: 6/10, the intro sounds like it was done on Fruity Loops, and sadly sounds like everything else done on FL. I like electronics in music, but not this much. Not the song I listen to the least, but it's close.<br /><br />Endlessly, She Said: 7/10, not the best closing song AFI's ever done. ...but home is nowhere, Morningstar, and God Called In Sick today are some of my favorite songs, and amazing ways to end their CD's, but this one doesn't measure up to them. Also, there's not a hidden track at the end of this. However, this song isn't a bad song. I really do like it, and usually skip 37mm to listen to it.<br /><br />So is this the best album put out by AFI? Not in my opinion, but it still rivals Sing The Sorrow for most mature musically and lyrically.s in music, but not this much. Not the song I listen to the least, but it's close. <br /> <br />Endlessly, She Said: 7/10, not the best closing song AFI's ever done. ...but home is nowhere, Morningstar, and God Called In Sick today are some of my favorite songs, and amazing ways to end their CD's, but this one doesn't measure up to them.

B000AJJNOK|1.0|God this guy is absolutely pathetic, he's now one of the richest people in music but for doing what? Wearing excessive gold, not having an ounce of talent in his body? for singing in his childish lyrics how much of a bad *ss he is or for getting shot however many times ( which unfortunately didn't kill the b***ard ).  The answer is yes; this is why he is rich.  It's worrying to know there are enough plain stupid people in this world to actually buy this c**p, just goes to show how much unoriginal land sheep like these people are to just go with the trend and \\"enjoy\\" listening to this p**ck.   <br /> <br />Like basically every other Hip - Hop artist to exist today, the stuff they write about and get paid millions of dollars for isn't in my opinion music - Some uneducated piece of s**t from a broken home basically talking about how hard there life is and how rich they are now.  And when it comes to Hip Hop, the actual music its self is only 50 perCENT of the cra**y package, oh no because not only are these losers showing off in their lyrics, their image and the way they present themselves on TV to them is just as important.  It's almost impossible these days to flick through the music channels and not fins some idiot wearing to much gold, baggy clothing leaning up against some flash car with half a dozen women surrounding him because as far as there concerned music is about image when it is anything but that.  Music's about meaningful lyrics, proper instruments, i.e. a guitar if any of you hip hop fans know that that is and melody.  Posing yes, I agree this c**ks pi**es all over any other musician when it comes to posing, but sadly I don't think any talented musician would really care about that because they can feel comfortable wearing regular clothing as they don't need expensive over the top garments to make themselves feel good as their music can make them feel good enough. <br /> <br />So there we have it my review, I'm sure a lot of you want to kill me for writing this, if so your either a complete r**ard or just scared to face the fact that your one of the sheep in the mindless flock. <br />
B00005JLKB|5.0|As a boy growing up in the 60s, I was an avid fan and reader of Superman comics. I didn't catch this series when it first aired, but I found it at my local movie rental store and my curiosity led me to rent it. I've just finished volumes one through four of the six in the first season and was so impressed I wanted to make a quick comment.<br /><br />So far I haven't enjoyed a TV science-fiction series this much since the original Star Trek. The series's strengths are the engaging story ideas and the strong cast, all of whom strike just the right notes in their roles, and are really superb. Superboy is great and also Lana Lang. But the real show stealer is Michael Rosenbaum, who is terrific as Lex.<br /><br />But Lex isn't the evil mastermind of the comics out to get Superman. Here he's a good guy and Superboy's friend, although sometimes he does resort to certain morally questionable expedients to accomplish his goals, but he truly wants to protect Superboy and his friends. There is no doubt he has a dark side, but it's mostly kept in check and when it does come out, it's usually to fight an even more evil bad guy. In other words, to fight evil, you need an even sneakier and more ruthless bad guy who's still on the side of good. :-) It's a brilliant concept and one of the ideas that really make the show stand out from the herd. One other great idea is the Kryptonite meteorite fragments also creating strange abilities and talents in different people, aside from its property of being toxic to Superboy.<br /><br />I've spent so much time on Lex that I don't want to overlook the other characters, but as I just wanted to write a brief review, I'll just say they're all really great in their roles too, especially Tom Welling and Kristen Kreuk.<br /><br />Toward the end of the season, it looks like Clark is finally going to get together with Lana, but then the story takes a turn and it he ends up getting together with Chloe instead, and the first season ends on that note. So I guess I'll find out how that turns out in the second season. So far I think this is great series and the best thing in a sci-fi show to come along in a long time. These first few DVDs of season one have made me a convert and I look forward to renting the other seasons.t note. So I guess I'll find out how that turns out in the second season.

1592400876|4.0|I read this book with no expectations. I'm always willing to learn a few things I should have absorbed in school but wasn't paying attention that day. I laughed out loud several times and got all the way to the end without being bored, not even a single time.<br /><br />It is amazing to me how anyone could be so stuffy and erudite to pan this book. It's a punctuation book delivered with a light-hearted approach, for Pete's Sake.<br /><br />I'm actually something of a stickler myself. I can spot a misspelled word on a page instantly. It's a gift and a curse. But grammar/punctuation elitists who think this book has no value are simply the biggest boors.  To these I say, exhale already. In this rapidly declining culture where written and spoken communication is being abandoned for coded shorthand, to think that someone [Lynne Truss] has made an effort to say it in layman's terms to keep language alive, should be a reason to break out in applause.
0446677450|2.0|I had heard great things about this book, and I was very disappointed when I read it. I have serious doubts about the credibility of Robert Kiyosaki. I don't think he made money in real estate, he made money by selling get rich books. <br /> <br />Half of the book is empty advice filled with cliche stories. I think he made most of it up. The rest of the text is a sales pitch for his board game and seminars.  <br /> <br />There is no secret to getting rich. It just takes discipline.
B00005JLK1|4.0|Ok, it's not the best ghost film ever made, but it is far better than the reviews here state. It's a movie about a haunting, not a slasher film. Like any good ghost film, Ghost Ship builds to a satisfying and memorable climax. Plus, there's some gory special effects (love the opening scene), nice camera work and an original storyline (for a change). The sinking of the oceanliner and releasing of the spirits is done beautifully. I loved the new \\"ghost crew\\" setting up the next ship for a simular fate! It's by far better than all the recent ghost garbage like Boo! and the horrible remakes of 13 Ghosts and The Haunting. If you like teenage body count films with blood and boobs, then pass by this one (and don't write bad reviews).
B00005JP4W|5.0|Wow um, there are a lot of stupid, ignorant reviewers. An Inconvenient Truth is NOT a political tool, seeing as Al Gore is no longer in politics and has stated many times that he doesn't plan on going back to politics. And he DID try to combat global warming during his political career, but the idiots in congress were determined to ignore him because they couldn't accept the fact that we are facing an international crisis; they would rather be in denial and reassure themselves that what they knew was true were just rumors spread by hysterical scientists. Science and politics just don't mix, especially when billions of dollars of oil business is still yet to be by the petroleum corporations that control our government. This film has everything. It informs the general public about a topic that has for the most part been ignored, it is dramatic and well done, and even has humor and satire. Go see this. Do it. Do it.
B00006GO9Q|2.0|Shhh, don't tell anyone but Miles and his \\"in your face\\" trumpet give me a headache.<br /><br />I like funk and groove so I should have done a bit more homework before trying out the jazz scene. For me this CD is mostly silent except for some irritating trumpet blowing like foxtail into your eardrums.<br /><br />I was about to give up on the whole jazz scene when I came upon Panthalassa. Track 1 of that CD (In a silent way/Shhh/Peaceful) is nice; smoothing out and grooving out Miles while staying true: say the purists.<br /><br />If you love it remixed and electrofied (yes sir!) check out DJ Cam's tribute to \\"In a silent way\\".
B000CNFC76|5.0|Francis Ouimet, the son of poor immigrants, falls in love with  golf, despite the fact that it is a game played by the wealthy and well-born.  He gets as close to the golf course as he can, by being a caddy.  His hero is Harry Vardin, himself a product of a poor household, who has won many professional golf championships.  Despite opposition from those in charge, Francis manages to play in the U.S. Open against his idol, Harry.  When his usual caddy takes an offer of cash from another player, Francis settles for a 10-year-old boy named Eddie.  The unlikely pair succeed beyond anyone's expectations by ending up in a tie with Vardin and another golfer.  The 18-hole playoff is full of suspense, with the three players having identical scores through the first several holes.  Eventually the third player falters and Francis is left in the playoffs with Vardin.  This is a heart-warming movie, suitable for the whole family which has the added plus of being a true story.
B00005JLEX|5.0|If you're a T.V. Seinfeld fan you will absolutely love the DVD's. The scenes that were cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions. I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television. I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005. She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents. We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day. We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom. On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's.<br /><br />The DVD sets include great special features from \\"How It Began\\" to \\"Making a Seinfeld Episode\\", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more. It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon. After all; \\"Who wouldn't love Jerry?\\"<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers' opinions I find that Seasons 1&2 are at least as enjoyable as the later seasons.  Episodes included in this set are:<br /><br />Season 1- The Seinfeld Chronicles, Male Un-bonding, The Stake Out, The Robbery, The Stock Tip.<br /><br />Season 2 - The Ex-Girlfriend, The Pony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, The Jacket, The Chinese Restaurant, The Phone Message, The Apartment, The Stranded, The Statue, The Heart Attack, The Revenge, The Deal.are:  <br />Season 1- The Seinfeld Chronicles, Male Un-bonding, The Stake Out, The Robbery, The Stock Tip.  <br />Season 2 - The Ex-Girlfriend, The Pony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, The Jacket, The Chinese Restaurant, The Phone Message, The Apartment, The Stranded, The Statue, The Heart Attack, The Revenge, The Deal.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Listened to both this album and the the Live EP.  Really don't understand all the hype. Nothing original here. Same as most of the other EMO Pop (just add a few synths) being marketed as \\"cutting edge\\".  Overproduced, boring and predictable.     Marcus, Chaordic was right (and he sounds pretty calm to me).  It's not about not liking mainstream.  It's about liking what's good (mainstream, indie, it makes no diff.).  Sure you can combine genres, but do you really want to try mixing say, the Clash with the Backstreet Boys and throwing in some synths for good measure (Punk/Pop w/ synths)?  I think not.  Some things just dont work and end up really stinking.This is a stiky turd imho.      Check out Depeche Mode 101 if you want to hear something that is still fresh (from all the way back in '88), has brooding deep lyrics, fat synths and crazy beats.  It's all about the music, not the hype.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am in love with this TV series. I watched \\"Serenity\\" (the movie) about 4 or 5 months ago, and i fell in love. Watched it several times, then it was due back at the store. Didn't have the money at that time buy the series and the movie together (i wanted to get both of them at the same time. I bought them last Sunday. Watched four episodes a day starting Monday. And watched the movie last night. I am in absolute love with this whole 'verse. I am very sad that there isn't anymore! Why didn't anyone pick up (and why doesn't anyone pick up) the show?! It is amazing. Best thing that has ever been on television. I love Firefly!  <br /> <br />I hereby declare myself a Browncoat. Now just to buy the coat...
B00005JOWR|4.0|The \\"joke\\" here is a tobacco lobbyist encouraging us to be free thinkers while knowing he can manipulate those thoughts.  At last, a movie that both Ralph Nader and Karl Rove can enjoy!<br /><br />On the upside, with so many movies conveying the message, if you're really good looking you'll always come out on top, here's a movie that tells us being clever is just as important, if not more so.<br /><br />Oh well, I'm making it sound as if its not funny and there are some funny bits.
0670033375|5.0|Jameson Thottam with a raising review of Collapse <br /> <br />Overview <br />The book, \\"Collapse,\\" by Jared Diamond is a sort of sequel to his Pulitzer-prize-winner \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" his very popular explanation of why Western civilizations developed technological, societal, and political strategies that enabled their world dominance. In \\"Collapse,\\" he attempts to explain why some societies flourished for a time, but then failed and vanished, and the lessons we can learn from their mistakes. Jared Diamond is an acknowledged expert in evolutionary biology who teaches at the University of California, and is highly influential in informing public discourse on environmental and social issues through more than 200 articles in science magazines. .  <br /> <br /> <br />Science is a body of knowledge gained by performing controlled and replicable experiments----but for some fields controlled experiments cannot be performed, and other methods must be used. Diamond's solution is to compare past situations, which differ with respect to a variable of interest, then use statistical techniques to approximate the contribution of specific variables to success or failure.  <br /> <br />Examples (Jameson Thottam) <br />In \\"Collapse,\\" Diamond examines the stories of several past failures, including the following:  <br /> <br />--Easter Island, where iconic stone heads are all that remain of a once great civilization on a Pacific island.  <br /> <br />--Anasazi societies in New Mexico that built some of the largest and tallest buildings in North America then abandoned them and disappeared.  <br /> <br />--Mayan cities that were once the hub of advanced Native American civilization then collapsed more than a thousand years ago leaving only ruins and some written history.  <br /> <br />--The Norse colony on Greenland that survived for about 450 years, and then disappeared.  <br /> <br />In all these cases, Diamond notes a similar pattern of environmental damage, climate change,shifting trade patterns, and shortsighted or greedy leadership. He sees these same problems becoming globally critical within a few decades. Diamond does not foresee an apocalyptic collapse, but more likely significantly lower living standards, disease, wars, all triggered by scarcity of resources.  <br /> <br />The Patter [Jameson Thottam] <br />The typical pattern starts with population growth, leading to intensified agricultural production and ecological damage. The agricultural practices become unsustainable, leading to shortages and starvation, wars and civil unrest, and ultimately to collapse.  <br /> <br />Where it all leads to? ?jameson Thottam? <br />Diamond sees \\"ecological suicide\\" as replacing nuclear holocaust as the biggest threat to global civilization. He sees several small-scale catastrophes as small instances of the coming global collapse. Events in Somalia and Rwanda, for example, are similar to those that precipitated collapse in earlier societies, and study of these situations and how they were handled is essential to avert a similar global disaster.  <br /> <br />Diamond presents a wealth of lucid and interesting details about these and many other cultures, and the methods used by scientists and historians to trace their rise and fall. He also offers an interesting perspective on current environmental issues in Australia, China, and the United States.  <br /> <br />Conclusions +Jameson Thottam <br />Diamond concludes with a summary and generalization of why some societies undermine themselves, make disastrous decisions, and even commit suicide. He defines four kinds of categories:  <br /> <br />--Failure to anticipate a problem.  <br /> <br />--Failure to perceive a problem already present.  <br /> <br />--Failure to attempt to solve an identified problem.  <br /> <br />--Failure to find a viable solution to a problem.  <br /> <br />I didn't find this book anywhere near as compelling as his excellent work in \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\" It's an interesting collection of case studies, together with a LOT of speculation and analogy. It seems questionable how relevant these past examples are to present-day situations, the most significant difference being the existence of today's technology, which can accelerate environmental damage, but can also provide solutions for that damage.  <br /> <br />Summarizing with Jameson Thottam <br />The present global economy has linked the fates of greatly distant and differing societies, and Diamond must be admired for this attempt to learn from the fates of earlier failed cultures, and how it happened. As Diamond says, we have the ability to learn from past mistakes, share information, and respond to challenges in ways that past civilizations never could. So there is hope for the future! <br /> <br />Enjoy these excerpts of reviews <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam
076790592X|1.0|A silly book, with echoes of the bridges of madison county, overwritten sports metaphors (he's one of the worst offenders as a writer in the sports pages). It really makes life into a schmaltzy slush, while avoiding any real issues. Perfect for the exurb bush fan.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Not technical? you got to get out of your bedroom with your guitar girlfriend and get in a studio and try to put something together like Ghost of perdition.  That song, the middle especially, is as intricate as metal should get without sounding overdone.  TOO Technical can sound like garbage.  The song has musical ups and downs, which has always been their trademark and the sound quality is much better then previous albums due to the fact that they make more money and can afford a better sound engineer.  If you dont like this album then throw away all your opeth albums because its the best \\"technically challenged\\" one yet.
B000067J1H|4.0|Definately one of the biggest Cult Hits in recent years.  \\"Fight Club\\" tells the story of a man trying to hit rock bottom and stripping down everything along the way.  Everything comes together in a surprising ending that will leave you shocked and surprised.
B0000029AL|5.0|One of their best recordings ever. Though not as well produced as some of the later efforts (Get Your Wings, Rocks, Toys)It is a showcase of what this band could do. Steven, Joe, Tom, Brad and Joey all sound tight. The songs well written (if not covers of original blues songs from other artists).<br /><br />I would buy it before anything released after \\"Draw the Line\\". Most of Aerosmith's 80's stuff was over-produced junk. I mean would \\"Pump\\" stand up to the self titled first album? I dont think so. If you like straight ahead quality musicianship with demanding parts written for specific instruments get this one.
B000E33VWW|5.0|As the title suggests, this movie concerns the author of the 1966 classic, In Cold Blood, not the horrific quadruple murder in Holcomb, Kansas on November 15, 1959 on which Truman Capote based his greatest work. Viewers who expect a retelling of the book will be disappointed.<br /><br />But this story has great merit on its own, for it perfectly depicts the delicate, difficult (and in this case compromised) balance between a great writer's desperate urge to tell the truth and the strategy he must employ to obtain it. The day after the murders, Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) opens the New York Times, reads an account of the murders on the inside pages, carefully and neatly clips the article and calls his New Yorker editor, William Shawn, to say he will change course to write about the crime.<br /><br />Famed for Other Voices, Other Rooms and Breakfast at Tiffany's, the novelist initially plans an article or series, but Capote's work swiftly expands into something much more grand--and dark. He shamelessly declares to his lover, friends and associates, including Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), that this story will let him create a new genre, the non-fiction novel. To some, Capote's pronouncement seems pure braggadocio. Yet remarkably, he fulfills his promise, in a breathtakingly gruesome and insightful account (read by this viewer long ago), again today a bestseller.<br /><br />Highlighted here is Capote's means of investigating what drove Perry Edward Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) to their deeds. For years, he doggedly reports, collecting every available document and interviewing everyone associated with the killers or their victims--rural businessman and farmer Herbert Clutter, his wife Bonnie, his 16-year-old daughter Nancy and his son Kenyon.<br /><br />But only through Capote's own lies and prevarications can he sufficiently engage the perpetrators that they will reveal their motive and the awful details of the Clutters' deaths: spurred by a false rumor that Clutter had $10,000 in his prairie home, Smith and Hickock embarked upon a fruitless search that yielded them only rage, some $40 or $50, buckets of blood--and their own eventual demise on Kansas gallows. (Parents, beware: Flashback scenes make this film highly unsuitable for children.)<br /><br />To gain interviews, access to legal documents and obtain unlimited visitation rights, Capote cozies up to families, friends and colleagues of law enforcement officials and even bribes the warden at Leavenworth, where the killers are soon transferred. He also ingratiates himself with friends and families of victims and killers alike. Armed with photos and details of the killers' broken and dysfunctional early lives, Capote begins conflicted friendships with the two men, both convicted of four counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death.<br /><br />Capote develops seemingly genuine sympathy for the imprisoned murderers. Upon his return to Kansas, Capote learns that Smith has not eaten for a month, races out to buy baby food and then spoon-feeds him. But his kindness is ultimately self-serving, for it also ensures that Smith won't die before telling Capote details of the murders.<br /><br />Fairly early in his investigation, Capote decides to entitle his as-yet-unwritten non-fiction thriller, In Cold Blood.<br /><br />Later, even after completing two thirds of the book, Capote lies to keep Smith talking. Smith reads a news report on Capote's recent New York reading, confronts him, and demands to know the book's title. Without hesitation, the straight-faced Capote says he has no idea. The reading's organizers concocted that title, he lies to Smith, in hopes of sensationalizing the event and drawing a big audience. Smith continues talking to his \\"amigo.\\"<br /><br />Capote's empathy is not entirely duplicitous. While repulsed by the evil deeds of Smith and Hickock, he finds and funds an attorney to appeal their case.<br /><br />At some level, Capote relates to them: His own childhood was unhappy. Born in New Orleans, Capote was dragged from place to place by his promiscuous mother, who abandoned him before he was sent to relatives in Alabama. Capote can't precisely explain, he tells Harper Lee, his childhood Alabama friend, in his characteristically high, disconcerting voice. \\"It is as if Perry and I grew up in the same house, and one day he went out the back door and I went out the front.\\" The case has radically changed his life, he says. Yet Capote leverages his sympathy and personal experiences to gain his subjects' confidence.<br /><br />Moreover, when the killers' appeal reaches the Supreme Court years later, Capote wants only to finish his story, which implicitly requires that their lives end. Thus Smith's request for Capote to find another attorney generates a brief reply, in which Capote claims to have exhausted all possibilities. In truth, this time, he has done nothing and no longer wants to.<br /><br />While Harper Lee's masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird becomes a bestseller and blockbuster movie, she also becomes Capote's alter-ego and his conscience. Only her intervention prompts Capote to rise from his drunken stupor in New York and fly to Kansas with New Yorker editor William Shawn to visit Smith and Hickock one last time. There, Capote confronts his own internal conflict, and at Smith's request, tearfully agrees to witness their executions.<br /><br />There's no secret to the ending of this tale: In Cold Blood made Capote one of America's greatest writers. In the book, he wrote, \\"Four shotgun blasts that, all told, ended six human lives.\\" But that's false too. In reality, the crime killed seven, including the author who shone world attention on the murders. This movie tells us why, however great, Capote never finished another book, and probably why he drank himself to death.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly centers around the Firefly-class ship, Serenity. Most of the show has a sepia-tone filter to make it look aged and dusty. If you missed this one when it was first run, you have a second chance, and its worth it. There are three unaired episodes for those who did. If you want to enjoy the motion picture Serenity in the fall, watch these DVDs all the way through. Beware though, the theme music gets in your head.
B000002BYD|1.0|I refuse to believe that the same band responsible for \\"Ten\\" was behind this nearly-unlistenable mess. <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder must have gotten sick of people imitating his singing style, so he decided to sing like a demented Tiny Tim on smack in the hopes that no one would bite his style. I think he succeeded.  <br /> <br />To me, \\"Yield\\" is an appropriate title, because it's exactly what Pearl Jam has done, realizing that they are no longer musically relevant. You can only wonder if they took their own lyrics seriously when they sing \\"I'm not trying to make a difference, I stopped trying to make a difference\\" in \\"No Way.\\"  <br /> <br />I don't know; maybe I'm not a true PJ fan, in that the only two albums I own are \\"Ten\\" and \\"Binaural,\\" which IMHO is when they finally got it right again. But I wouldn't take this musical abuse from anyone; that it's coming from PJ just makes it that much worse.
B00005JP4W|5.0|I was glued to my seat!  This documentary was incredibly interesting and engaging.  Al Gore makes an iron-clad case for taking our heads out of the sand and doing something about our addiction to oil.  It should be required viewing for every American.
1581806574|5.0|I found this book to be extremely helpful.  The author of this book did an amazing job with the illustrations and breaking down the steps where they are able to be followed to the finished product.  As far as drawing books go, this was one of the far more helpful and I was thrilled with gaining insight on how to draw the more complicated anatomical features of the fantasy creatures, such as wings with feathers.  I suggest this book to anyone who is interested in fantasy drawing, but cannot seem to pinpoint certain features such as feathers, horns, or tails. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002PZVH0|5.0|All the fellow reviewers are correct.  Please let me just add that \\"1/1\\" is absolutely the finest music I know of to act as sort of \\"white noise\\" when one wishes to drown out all...\\"sounds of pleasure\\" when one is making love enthusiastically.
B00005JOSS|3.0|i was expecting this to b so much better. but still it's worth it.
B000056VJ7|1.0|cThe songs are pretentious, over the top drivel, the singing overwrought, over emotive, and pompous, and the production is shrill, bombastic and self-indulgent.  It might be tempting to simply dismiss this criticism given that this was released in the 1970's, after all, but such doesn't was.  1978 was indeed a superb year in music given such great albums by the likes of The Clash (\\"Give 'Em Enough Rope\\") Elvis Costello (\\"This Year's Model\\"), Patti Smith (\\"Easter\\"), The Ramones (\\"Road to Ruin\\"), Bruce Springsteen (\\"Darkness at the Edge of Town\\"), and others.  An anomaly on an absolute nadir in popular culture.  Maybe both.
B000002KKS|5.0|When Dio became the new lead of Black Sabbath, he injected new fresh air to the almighty Sabbath. This album sounds more like NWOBHM (New Way of British Heavy Metal) band rather than  their Ozzy era Sabbath (if you skip Sabbath Bloody Sabbath & Sabotage). The best tracks are: Neon Knights , Children of The Sea , Heaven & Hell & Die Young. Recommended    Trivia : It's with this album and during their tour , Dio introduced to the world the malocchio sign (horn), and with that the salute of the anything metal. \m/

B00000JNOJ|5.0|Este album llego a mi por simple curiosidad en el 2000. Nunca imagine que alguien pudiese juntar tal talento en sus manos y voz como lo hizo Muddy para este album. La seccion de musicos que le sirven de soporte son nada mas y nada menos que. Buddy Guy y Willie Dixon. No hay palabras que puedan describir la magia que emanan de estas grabaciones, tan solo blues en su mas puro estado... es como trasladarse al delta de los 1930. Sonido puro y llanamente acustico con un entramado de guitarras magistral entre Muddy y Buddy Guy que sirven de fondo a la ya famosa interpretacion vocal de Muddy y eso sin contar con el solido sonido de Willie Dixon al bajo. Recuerdo que en una vieja revista de blues apuntaba sobre la existencia de este disco como una muestra de musica folk interpretada por quien se supone fue, es y sera la mejor voz y guitarra del blues americano... pero aqui no hay nada de folk, es blues delta en su estado mas primitivo. Maravilloso y dotado de una sencillez total que asombran por el resultado; PURA MAGIA. Se agregan una serie de bonus tracks que no deslucen del contenido inicial de la edicion original...pero los temas grabados en acustico son y seran la parte central de esta obra unica en su genero. Las fotografias que se incluyen en el inserto y en  la propia caja del cd demuestran por su elegancia el disfrute de tres maestros del blues que nunca imaginaron que al juntarse para esta sencilla grabacion, crearian una de las mejores muestras del espiritu del blues delta. El album recoje algunos de los temas mas interesantes de la discografia del Mudddy; <br />Captain captain, Good morning little school girl, long distance callin'... ademas de otras gemas cargadas de sentimiento y la belleza del blues en un estilo unico donde predomina la improvisacion y la tecnica espontanea de dos de los grandes guitarristas bluseros de todos los tiempos. <br />Puede y debe catalogarse de grabacion escencial para todo amante de la musica y el blues... No dudes en obtenerla...nunca dejaras de escucharlo, de lo contrario no sabes de lo que te pierdes. <br />Saludos
B00005JOSS|5.0|This is Keanu Reeves best yet. Why didn't the studios wake up sooner and realize the unbelievable chemistry between Keanu and Sandra Bullock. They are magic on the screen and convey it masterfully to the audience. It was a perfect combination of hearing the voice over of the letter writer while the letter is being read, to seeming conversation between them. The dance together was sheer magic. I saw the first showing on the opening day and went back and saw the first showing on the second day. Everyone has to give this movie a try. Makes me want to dig out my Three Dog Night and listen to \\"Old Fashion Love Song\\".
B000085RTZ|5.0|It's quite simple really.I listened to The Black Halo, The Fourth Legacy, and Epica, in that order,back to back.The result is that I'm on selling the first two but keeping Epica,because it is by far the best in recording quality and musical enjoyment;for me anyway.I only hope Epica wasn't the summit of Kamelot's achievement because they are an excellent band,and lets hope for more great stuff.
B000002KB8|5.0|to that guy who was getting all hot and bothered preaching about Korn and Limp Bizkit, do some research pal because this record IS the foundation of metal and without it Korn and and the other limp band would never exist. They are able to exist because of THIS record. Korn and Limp Bizkit band started nothing, they simply set foot on the path created by Sabbath. Where were Korn and Limp Bizkit when this album came out? Yeah, that's what I thought!<br /><br />I would say this record is a must-have for any metal collection. I don't know if it is their best but who cares. It certainly got the ball rolling unlike any other band at the time. The cover is absolutely perfect and conveys the mood of the tracks. The opening track, 'Black Sabbath', sets the tone on what came to be a great musical journey in the life of the band. Korn, Limp Bizkit and countless other bands should be sending these guys checks every month! And Tony Iommi is still doing it better than a lot of the hotshots of today.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears's second album Oops!... I Did It Again is my favorite Britney album. This disc is such a guilty pleasure and I love it! All 12 tracks are catchy, irresistible, and cool. Standout tracks include: Stronger, Where Are you Now, What U See is what U Get, Don't Let Me be the Last to Know, Lucky, and of course the title-track. I also recommend her In the Zone album as well, but don't buy her Britney album, that is pure awful and ridiculous. Oops!... I Did it Again is one hell of a dance record even if she can't sing one note! Buy this under-appreciated album today.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I stumbled on to this film on sky movies and i fell in love with as quickly as i did with the matrix. some people are saying this is just a rip-off and this is no near as good as the matrix trilogy, i completely disagree. This may not be better then the first matrix, but its stong storyline and new take on martial arts (gun kata)help this film outstip the two later matrix's by far, as they were just a chance to show off CGI. If you want a quik analagy if this film, think 1984 on speed and you haven't read that book DO IT!
B0002TX4QQ|5.0|I can't say that this is a \\"good\\" book because that would almost trivialize it.  Reading this book is like watching a train wreck--you know something bad is going to happen, but you just have to watch and see it.  I've not read such a compelling book for a long time.  The story is told \\"after the fact\\" by Kevin's mother.  She writes a series of letters to her huband from whom she is separated.  She tries to reflect on Kevin's life, plus the family dynamics, to see if she can find a reason for the mass murders he commits at his high school when he is amost 16.  The ending is shocking, and rather unexpected by me.  I really recommend this book for those of you in book clubs, because there is so much to discuss.  I wish I had somebody to discuss it with.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I don't know why it seems the RHCP is the only band that can still make great music after 20 years. As a fan since the 80's, I've always thought they couldn't get better. Again, I'm wrong. The first listen of these CD's, I thought it was good. Now that I've listened to it several times, I'm hooked. It hasn't been out long enough to say it's their best ever, but I predict that this may be THE album they are never able to top. (hope I'm wrong again).
1400079179|4.0|Ok. So I'm probably one of the last literate people on the planet to read The DaVinci Code. I admit it, I didn't want to intially buy into the hype. That's why I waited for the cheap paperback edition to be released. As much as I hate to admit it, I liked the book. There. I said it. I actually really enjoyed it. In fact, it was downright difficult to put the book down. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that, if you haven't read a single one of the million+ reviews, is that it's a fast-paced thriller that keeps the reader engaged. I'm sure someone has already written that. As far as the \\"controversy\\" surrounding the book, people are forgetting this is  a fiction novel. Even though there are conspiracys out there that the text is based on, people need to get their panties out of a wad and appreciate this novel as an interesting work of FICTION literature. Dan Brown never said he was presenting this is as concrete evidence of actual events and proof. Please, can everyone just chill out? I actually doubt anyone is reading this review anyway. I'm just bored at the moment and haven't figured out what book I feel like reading next, so if anyone is really reading this and HASN'T already read The DaVinci Code, You should. Just suck it up like I did. You'll probably enjoy it, even though a few moments (ie. who the REAL villan actually is) are a little predictable, I still liked it. Maybe I'm just good at guessing. In addition, I also saw the movie, and as much as I love Tom Hanks and Audry Tatou, (rent Amelie', by the way)I liked the book better than the movie. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />P.S. I didn't write this to be helpful. :)
B000F0UV0E|5.0|No wait!!! Not only this year, but for the past 5 years. No, 10 years. I cant remember loving an entire CD more since the likes of Blonde on Blonde or Revolver or Blood on the Tracks. These two are so good together it is scary!! Add the distinctive Knopfler guitar, superb musicians and you have....well like I said. I can't stop listening to this. After seeing an interview with the 2 on Knopfler's web site, I like it even more. When he spoke about the final song and its relationship to 9/11, it made it even more meaningful. Run out and get this album now. If you like either of them individually, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JP4U|5.0|An artist hopes for one thing. Craftsmen do not hope; they merely make something, and sell it. <br /> <br />A craftsman would be a music group like the band \\"Hot Hot Heat.\\"  <br /> <br />They make a song, they make it so someone can listen to it, jump around to the beat of the song, relate to the lyrics on an emotional and philosophical level, and feel an emotion as an effect. <br /> <br />One could use the verb \\"hope\\" in terms of a craftsmen in that, \\"They hope someone will like their song, and buy it, and that they can be famous, so they can have sex with lots of pretty girls who like to jump around to the beat of their music,\\" but that would be not my useage of the word hope. I would say, \\"A craftsman wants someone to like their song, so they can get paid, and do what they like to do with their life.\\" This is no different than Apple computers making their iPods the coolest and smallest they can make them. \\"Hot Hot Heat,\\" whose music is quite fun and cool, and deserve all the pretty girls they can get, makes their songs as fun and cool as they can make them.  <br /> <br />It is NOT more vain that they just want someone to like thier song, it is NOT immoral ; it is what most people do ; but it is without hope. <br /> <br />All men need hope. Artist and craftsman.  <br /> <br />I need hope, and that is why i will remain an artist.  <br /> <br />Craftsmen find hope through other means.  <br /> <br />But an artist, through what he creates, hopes.  <br /> <br />Every sentence, note or brushstroke he produces can be translated to: i hope.  <br /> <br />What does he hope for ? <br /> <br />An artist hopes for change. <br /> <br />An artist hopes one who experiences what has been created he or she will not be able to live their life the same way after the fact.  <br /> <br />An artist does not necessarily try to create beauty, he does not necessarily try to create truth, he does not necessarily try to soothe OR stimulate ; an artist could chose any of these things, or hecould chose none of them, but he choses them to hope for change.  <br /> <br />Sometimes, this is small change in one's life. For example, the famous William Carlos Williams poem: <br /> <br />so much depends <br />upon  <br /> <br />a red  <br />wheelbarrow <br /> <br />glazed in rain  <br />water  <br /> <br />beside the white  <br />chickens  <br /> <br />Now that you have read that poem, your life will be different in a very small way. You might say the word \\"chickens\\" with a slightly different feeling for the word. You might see red as a little more of an interesting color. You might notice the weight of the things you say, the heaviness of the syllables, the heaviness of the thoughts they bring, or you might just every so often mutter to yourself, \\"Beside the white chickens,\\" because it has a pleasing sound to you.  <br /> <br />Williams does not care if you \\"like\\" his poem, if you would pay five dollars to have it read to you--for proof, read his collected letters to publishers. You may end up paying five dollars for it, but that is not his concern. He wants you to be different, he wants to toss you into the horror of his world, and make you understand it. He wants change. <br /> <br />An artist is a terrorist.  <br /> <br />I paid five dollars today. <br /> <br />I saw An Inconvenient Truth.  <br /> <br />It was art.  <br /> <br />It was a kind of art i do not often view, It was art whose materials were equal parts science, drama and truth.  <br /> <br />Like Williams' poem, it was hoping.  <br /> <br />But it hoped far beyond anything Williams ever wrote.  <br /> <br />It hoped with a child's mind, it hoped with a purity and a logic.  <br /> <br />And it changed me. <br /> <br />I don't know who else in the small small matinee audience it changed, but i hope it changed everyone in there.  <br /> <br />I cannot go on living my life in the same way.  <br /> <br />I mean this with sincerity i rarely know.  <br /> <br />I am weary with catharsis, i have cried and i have raged and i have hated, and now i am ready to move on.  <br /> <br />I am ready to be someone different.  <br /> <br />Starting with these words.  <br /> <br />I hope you liked this review, and i know there are many reasons why you might not.  <br /> <br />For example, the style is very plain and may come off as careless ; and its logic might seem ill. <br /> <br />But this review is art. To me. <br /> <br />You may decide if it is bad art, but it will still be art. Because i wrote this with the hope that you will be changed after reading it, and you will go see An Inconvenient Truth tonight at seven at your local theater, instead of the Da Vinci Code, instead of Mission Impossible Three, instead of Garfield: A Tale of Two Kittens, instead of even another movie i have given a rave review in the past. Even the movies that are listed as my all time favorites, i hope that you will see this first, and then them ; and i hope that you will be changed by it. I hope you will see that, if we do not change, we are truly doomed.  <br /> <br />And that is why i believe in art.  <br /> <br />That is why it is my God. <br /> <br />Because it creates Change. The only thing that will save us. Nothing else will. <br /> <br />signed, an artist
B0009S2T0M|4.0|Now I enjoyed this movie very much.  But only up to a point.  I haev heard about these \\"tartan asia extreme:  Enough said, I don't exactly want to dwell on it.<br /><br />Now the story is VERY ineresting and had me wonderign all the way.  Now that was teh point of it, but it really went out of it's way to mget you interested in teh characters.  Teh whole revenge factro was just WAY too weird for me and then end is extreme .  It, well, no, I can't tell you,  you have to see it to believe it.  If you are into this kind of sick stuff, it is for you, but the second half of the movie just gets too \\"extreme\\" for me.  I will check out another one of these some time, but I give it one more chance.  Can anyone recomend a \\"tartan\\" action movie for me that is not so freakign extreme.  Good flick though, very good.<br /><br />Also the music kicked ass, but the music changes just like the movie does towards the end.  I may have gave this 3 stars, but being an action fan, I really enjoyed the realism as well as the unrealism in the fight scenes.  Yes he does use that hammer:)  The acting was BRILLIANT, story was good, but I only like my stomach turning over when I am watchign a horror. But last reviewr is right, camera angles and overall directorial job is just awesome.<br /><br />Commentary gives you all types of insight as the director and cinematographer focus mainly on the film and don't really get off topic.  They certianly wanted to talk about how they made it, some really good info on the  commentary.<br /><br />In the interview with the director he talks about the violence in his movies, how surprising.<br /><br />Other goodies iclude deleted sceens and trailers.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that the special features are superior to pretty much any other all region or region 1 asian dvd.  Well, I should say chinese, that's all I really know, but kno a lot.
B000FFJ85I|2.0|The dissection of Decemberunderground <br />*All you old AFI fans can get your crankiness on. DU follows along the path of Sing the Sorrow <br /> [C'mon, don't tell me you didn't expect that] <br /> <br />*The album is an acquired taste  <br /> [The first run-through of the album, for me at least, left me thinking \\"Okay...I waited 3 years for this?\\" After a couple times through, you get used to it, I guess] <br /> <br />*The band delves into different musical styles and techniques  <br /> [Remember how you could always tell Davey Havok's scream from all the other commonplace ones? Well, now you can't.] <br /> [[You'll see what I mean on the Kill Caustic intro]] <br /> ALSO [[[Prelude 12/21 has a beat like a rap song on the radio]]] <br /> <br />*Summary <br />Basically, the preceding 3 elements are what makes the CD hard to love. No, the album isn't awful, but even compared to STS, it falls very short. There are a couple of songs on the album I have begun to like, but as for the rest of them, it will take me a while to become acquainted with them.  <br /> <br />My Favorite Tracks: <br />Prelude 12/21--I always love AFI introductions  <br />Love Like Winter--Deliciously dramatic and catchy, but not in the way that Miss Murder is <br />Endlessly, She Said--Slow, melancholy guitar intro...and I'm hooked <br /> <br />My Rating: <br />2 stars--Burn the CD from a friend--that way, you can't even regret it. [Unless it was your last blank CD] <br />
B000002H38|5.0|Whew! This album is an oldie but goodie that always sounds refreshing and new just like your first time hearing it. <br /> <br />Do you remember when originality, creativity and mind-bending talent were prerequisites for professional singers? <br /> <br />Do you remember when a solo artist/group put out a 10-track album AND ALL 10 TRACKS were classic? <br /> <br />Even if you don't, you need to hear this Anita Baker debut because class is in session! <br /> <br />Baker truly was an innovator who bridged old school soul with new 1980s flavor. She's got a more classic, more refined sound and a more deeply understated vocal approach than your Whitney Houstons and Mariah Careys of the music world. <br /> <br />If you're into artists like Roberta Flack, Nancy Wilson, Sade and some of Toni Braxton's earlier work, you'll love this LP if you haven't already heard it. <br /> <br />Outstanding musicianship and a relaxed, soulful vibe are this album's high points. <br /> <br />Given the more high energy, in-your-face bruskness of the majority of today's R&B, Baker's laid back energy is a welcomed change a of pace that makes this debut seem all the more incredible, enjoyable and relevant. <br /> <br />This LP is from a different time in music history. Recommended!
B00005JL96|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time last night with my wife. Let me just say, I think this might be one of the best Disney films - right up there with the big \\"four\\" - The Little Mermiad, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.    I was in Disney World last year. I have to admit I was a naysayer. I couldn't understand what all these little kids were obsessing about. Stitch was the most popular character there. He was even my wake-up call every morning. However, after seeing this film, now I know what the fuss is about. This film is great for all ages and ranks among the best in the Disney franchise.    With memorable characters, a touching story, and colorful animation, this is a Disney classic.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I really liked this - it's cute and funny and cool.  It's a perfect choice to put Zach as the voice of Chicken Little.  He sounds really cute in it.  There are so many famous voices and each bring a great personality to their character. <br />I thought the humour involved was good for both adults and kids (where in other animated movies, sometimes the humour is more geared toward adults) and I laughed often.  I did however lose interest here and there on occasion; it went off the boil and a bit over the top with the aliens, but overall, I'd say this is an excellent movie that families and adults and kiddies will all love.

0393327655|3.0|If you don't like to read accounts of torture--and I am loathe to--skip large sections of this book. <br /> <br />To be fair, I'm only a third way thru the book, but it's enraging to me to run across his unnecessarily vivid descriptions of torture.  It seems obscene to include more than the barebones of it. I was disgusted and enraged with the author when I stumbled into the first account of torture and have been able to skim-read in order to avoid being blindsided by it again. <br /> <br />So far, I have found nothing new in this book, just a clever and often witty rephrasing and interpretation of what is pretty well known.  However, my background in religious matters is a bit more extensive than others, so some may find the info new.   <br /> <br />I do concur mostly with his descriptions of the 9/11 terrorists as not cowards, not lunatics, but \\"men of faith.\\"  The reasoning being that it is dangerous to literally and completely believe texts in the Koran (and the Bible) that foment violent, irrational behavior. <br /> <br />I'm giving this book--so far-- only 3 stars but mainly due to the graphic, gratuitous torture description.  It's just that the descriptions of torture are far beyond what's necessary to get the picture.

Great album, best iv heard from wylde yet (im a sucker for his acoustic stuff). Buy it now and grab a six pack and find a good comfortable stone to rest yer backend on for a few hours... <br /> <br />All songs 10/5 :D
0060839872|5.0|As a professor of philosophy and a former mechanic in the Marine Corps I can see why many see Pirsig's book as daunting, thick, and stifling.  It is filled with philosophical history, philosophical thought, deep forays taking you to dizzying heights of thought - and smashing into the depths of a single screw on a motorcycle.  I do think that the novice in either of these realms, philosophy or mechanics, would be well served to push through this book.<br /><br />It is well written, paced, and fleshed out.  An excellent book for anyone who has time and wants to read something 'deep'.<br /><br />With all of that said - I could not help but think that Pirsig's foray into insanity could have been prevented had he searched for 'quality' in the Buddhists.  He seems to have driven himself insane because he was attempting to reinvent the wheel.<br /><br />This is not a draw back - but merely an observation.  I will not be assigning this in any class I teach soon - but I constantly recommend it to students who are 'ready'.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|A loving family of seven - the grandfather, the father, the mother (Mary Astor), one son and four daughters (including Judy Garland and Margaret O' Brien) plus their cook Katie. Interesting to note, the gorgeous Mary Astor at some moment can pass as one of the elder sisters. This bears a close resemblance of Little Women - the era and the simple goals of life - whose coming of age daughters search for love and husbands, rather than education and careers. The movie is still highly watchable for at least three reasons.     The first are the pleasant songs; \\"Have yourself a merry little Christmas' was beautifully performed by Judy Garland. The second is the wonderful performance of the cute Tootie (Margaret O'Brien), who also appeared in Jane Eyre (Olson Welles and Joan Fontaine) as a little French girl. She was a daring darling, the girl version of Dennis the Menace; she cried and laughed effortlessly and lightened up the screen with her presence. Her radiance and sweetness simply shines through. The third is the warmth and togetherness portrayed by the family. Their elegant house was shot most favorably in 4 seasons. It was almost too richly decorated and sat itself beautifully on an enviable frontyard. The Smith family dressed immaculately for the World Fair in St. Louis and had all the fun.     The plot revolves around traditional family values. Yet everyone portrayed their stereotyped roles and delivered their cliche lines well. Curiously, people of the old times portraying such parts somehow appear natural and more palatable than modern people would. All these make the movie a delightful nostalgic family movie with the warm Christmas spirit. In addition, the DVD version gives such lush colours.
6305736650|3.0|It's easy to understand why so many people love this movie; the Humphrey Bogart character is one of the film world's greatest. Rick is noble, self-sacrificing and romantic.      He has loved this woman for years.  He continues to love her even though, in Paris,  she stood him up without explanation when they were planning to run off together.  Years later when she walks into his bar, he still loves her.  Even after he finds out that she had been married before but failed to mention said fact throughout their affair in Paris, he still loves her. After he finds out that the reason she didn't meet him at the train station was because her, presumed dead, husband had turned up, he never asks her why she didn't send a short message explaining the circumstances.  He continues to love her even as she plans to abandon her war hero husband.  He loves her as she sit's idly by and let's the men in her life make her moral decisions for her.    Rick is a great charcter but the Ingrid Bergman character is far too passive to be the stuff of legends.
0689865384|4.0|Human instinct is to be part of the crowd-to fit in. If I find myself in the presence of people I want to like me I try not to stand out. I want to be cool, to fit in, to be liked. This book really focuses on that. Everyone wants to fit in. But what if fitting in is the wrong answer? What if it causes people to be hurt? Do we do what is right or do we try to fit in? Uglies really stresses these questions on the main character. We all know what should happen- the main character chooses right over fitting in with out a second thought, but then we have a perfect character. A person who does everything right. Then the book is predictable to a fault. We may sometimes choose right over fitting in but it is always more complicated then that. There are more things to consider in life then \\"is this right?\\". In fact that is probably the question most often ignored. This book shows humanity's faults as well as our strengths. It is believable and well-written. I couldn't put it down.
6304712944|5.0|With its lavish sets, beautiful music, and undeniable star quality, Camelot is a wonderful motion picture built upon the successful Lerner-Loewe Broadway musical, which in turn was based on T.H. White's The Once and Future King.  It is in no way a definitive account of King Arthur's story, as it concentrates on the fateful lovers' triangle of Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot.  I probably have a different take on the legendary romance of Arthur's two closest companions than most, for I look upon this story not as a love story at all, but as a true tragedy.  Franco Nero is wonderful as Lancelot (despite the fact that Nero is Italian, not French), and Vanessa Redgrave makes for a most enchanting Queen Guinevere, but my opinion of these illicit lovers is set in stone and could hardly be pulled out even by the likes of Arthur.  To me, Lancelot is one of the biggest cads in literature.  Granted, he had no intention of falling in love with Guinevere, but his actions made a mockery of all his numerous, rather obnoxious claims to purity, nobility, and chivalry.  Chivalry does not start by betraying your king and closest friend to engage in an adulterous affair that could not but lead to disastrous consequences on an epic scale.  This just goes to show how one lone Frenchman can bring about the ruin of the noblest of kingdoms.<br /><br />I initially had a little trouble with Richard Harris as King Arthur, as he certainly doesn't conform to my image of the legendary hero (my King Arthur, for example, doesn't wear copious amounts of eye shadow), but his nobility and sense of purpose soon won me over.  Still, I'm not overly fond of the film's characterization of the man, for it creates for us the image of a weak, ineffective ruler who shames himself over his unfaithful wife and basically allows his kingdom to fall into ruin all around him.  I don't see many glimpses of \\"the future king\\" in this movie.  It would not be right for me to describe this as a fault with the film, however; it's just part of the filmmakers' designs, as their intention was to show us Arthur the man rather than the mythic Arthur of legend.  This version of King Arthur is exceedingly human, and that makes for some powerful scenes, particularly his passionate soliloquies as he ponders the loss of everything he cares about.  One cannot help but despair alongside Arthur as Camelot begins to crumble, particularly since, in this version of the tale, Merlin never warned against marrying Guinevere.  The one weak character in the film is Mordred (David Hemmings), who - despite his late-arrived scheming - seems almost tangential to the tragedy that unfolds.<br /><br />While the film runs almost a full three hours, it never really succeeds in revealing the true magic of Camelot.  The hopes and dreams of Arthur for his Round Table of noble knights dedicated to pursuing justice and right doesn't get enough emphasis, and his attempt to create a criminal justice system feels like little more than a plot device for Mordred to orchestrate his downfall.  The loss of the Arthurian ideal is the true tragedy of this story, but too much of the film's emotion is dedicated to the illicit lovers, ignoring the fact that their sins would have basically pushed England into the Dark Ages.<br /><br />It's a real shame that the musical has all but disappeared as a cinematic art form these days, as Camelot shows just how much depth and meaning an impassioned score and exquisite songs can add to a story.  When you think of Camelot, you think of the characters and the story only after your mind replays such songs as the title theme and the award-winning love song If Ever I Would Leave You.<br /><br />The DVD's special features are good but not great.  Alongside comparably short descriptions of important Arthurian topics, short bios and filmographies of prominent players in the drama, and five different movie trailers, you get a 10-minute contemporary documentary about the filming of Camelot and a thirty-minute look at the movie's opening (with Vanessa Redgrave rather conspicuous in her absence).lot and a thirty-minute look at the movie's opening (with Vanessa Redgrave rather conspicuous in her absence).
B00005U122|4.0|Roger Waters and band put on an excellent show in \\"In The Flesh.\\"  Waters assembled an exellent band around him and they give the listener/viewer an all around sample of his work both with Pink Floyd and as a solo artist.  The song \\"Dogs\\" is a particular highlight with keyboardist/guitarist Jon Carin singing the lead vocal. <br />I only wish Jon had done some more lead. Doyle Bramhall II is a fantastic lead guitarist but his vocals are rather weak. <br />One of the highlights is, not surprisingly \\"Money.\\"  Andy Fairweather Low's solo is very entertaining. <br />Highly reccomend the extras as well, particularly the mini-documentary about assembling the show.

0066620996|3.0|Jim Collins was the co-author of \\"Built to Last\\", a study of what made great companies great.  The companies in that study had been great for a very long time, but there remained the question: can ordinary companies evolve into great companies?   <br /> <br />He and a team of researchers spent five years researching this question.  The first thing they did was to examine whether there were any ordinary companies that had evolved into great companies.  They found 11 such companies.  They then analysed the key elements of these transformations and this analysis is the basis of \\"Good to Great\\". <br /> <br />The things that these Good to Great companies had in common were stable management over a long period of time and unremitting dedication to what the company did best.  Absent were pima donnas and superstars, restructurings and visionary strategies. <br /> <br />If I go into any more detail you won't need to buy the book.  The book is worth reading.  It is written in a simple, readable style.  Its real worth is that it reminds us of what good management looks like, something that's it's easy to lose sight of in these guru days.   <br /> <br />\\"Good to Great\\" is 300 pages cover to cover.  The chapters comprise 210 pages, the remainder being appendices.  Within the chapters there is a great deal of repetition in the text as well as bullet point chapter summaries at the end of each chapter in the manner of textbooks.  The last chapter is an ad for Collins' previous book \\"Built to Last\\".  So the core writings would boil down to around 100 pages. <br /> <br />It's a pity that Collins and his team didn't spend more time trying to convey the culture of the companies being studied and less time padding chapters and trying to derive new management concepts from the data.  Next stop: lecture circuit.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Just about every legitamate review says, this is Snoop Dogg's best album and has yet to top this. Back in 1993/1994 Snoop Dogg was all about making party tracks with Dr. Dre and the Death Row Immates (RBX, Dogg Pound, Lady Of Rage, and Warren G.) Gangstafied tracks on drinking and smoking \\"Gin And Juice\\" couldn't have been a better 90's party track. \\"Ain't No Fun\\" and \\"Doggy Dogg World\\" Snoop Dogg gives listeners how he runs his well known game on the females (the latter would be lyrically less explicit). Some of my favorite tracks \\"Whats My Name\\" and \\"The Shiznit\\" are as lyrical as Snoop rides the beat perfectly (yes people, Snoop actually did have rhymes).<br /><br />Guest appearances come off as the smooth West Coast style. \\"For My N***z and B*****s\\" and \\"Serial Killa\\" would have vocals from The Dogg Pound and RBX or Lady Of Rage, quite possibly no let down guest wise. Dr. Dre didn't go wrong with the production on this either.<br /><br />Thankfully this is reissued for young listeners like me, because I was too young to buy this back in '93. This is the top notch Snoop Dogg that we've paid to hear. Since this CD raised the bar for him, he has since had an uphill climb trying to pull off another classic like this (I believe Paid The Coast to Be the Boss is as close as it would ever come). If you do not own a copy of this classic, you have no idea what you are missing.<br /><br />Lyrics: A-<br /><br />Production: A<br /><br />Guest Appearances: A+<br /><br />Overall: A<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: Gin & Juice, Tha Shiznit, Murder Was The Case, Who Am I (Whats My Name), For My N***z and B*****s, Ain't No Fun, Doggy Dog World<br /><br />Honorable Mention Track: Gz and Hustlas<br /><br />If you have a 1993 copy, you'd notice that this reissue is condensed to 13 tracks by putting all the skits at the beginning of the songs (the origonal had 18 I think) not that it really matters. Also the song \\"G'z Up, H**s Down\\" was removed when it was reissued for some reason, I haven't heard that track yet.'t heard that track yet.
B00000IREA|4.0|I love this movie.  More accurately: I love Jane Fonda in this movie.  Anytime she opens those big eyes (or shows off those legs) I am mesmerized.  Jane is magnetically sexy (accentuated by great costume design including thigh-high boots, fishnets, skin-tight unitards, etc.) and what ultimately draws me to mulitple viewings of this film.   <br /> <br />The story, while usually not important for this kind of movie, is actually somewhat original and made interesting by Jane Fonda's devotion to her role and the sometimes hysterical dialogue.  The acting, for the most part, is average in this movie, but Jane is brilliant and so is Anita Pallenberg in a small role as the Great Tyrant/Black Queen (\\"My Pretty Pretty\\").  Anita is also exceptionally beautiful and incredibily sexy. <br /> <br />Notes on the DVD:  While it lacks any special features, the picture is great (although occasionally grainy) and it shows off the wonderful cinematography, great colors, and stylistic set designs (and the wonderful Jane Fonda, of course).  I first saw this movie on AMC and it was somewhat edited, but the DVD thankfully restores the nudity, which is not entirely important but adds to the ambience that makes the film great. <br /> <br />Overall it's a cheesy movie but a pretty good one, and if you don't take it too seriously, you may enjoy it.

0739326740|5.0|For a while I resisted reading this book, thinking that it could not possibly be as good as its hype. Well, I was wrong. This is simply one terrific book that will keep the reader riveted to its pages until the very last one is turned. It is a very well-written, intricately plotted thriller in which a great number of esoteric historical facts and interesting theories of a religious nature are woven. Those who read it should, first and foremost, keep in mind that this book is simply a work of fiction.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose when Jacques Sauniere, the elderly and revered curator of the Louvre, is murdered inside the museum. The crime scene and the body itself are laden with symbols and cryptic messages pointing to renowned Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon. He is invited to the crime scene by the wily Captain Bezu Fache, of the Central Directorate Judicial Police, the French equivalent of our Federal Bureau of Investigation, ostensibly to assist the police. Little does Langdon know that he is, in fact, the prime suspect.<br /><br />When he meets police cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, they join forces. They are then led on a merry chase by a series of riddles and ciphers that are ground in a historical context. They are always just one step of the French police, who seem determined to charge Langdon with the murder of Jacques Sauniere. During their voyage of discovery, Langdon and Sophie come across a secret society, the Priory of Sion, that has a startling list of former members, which list includes Leonardo Da Vinci, as well as the late Jacques Sauniere. There is also some interesting historical detail about the ancient Knights Templar, as well as Opus Dei, a conservative religious organization currently in existence.<br /><br />Langdon and Sophie peel back layers of historical clues that point to a secret of such magnitude that some would kill for it. As Langdon and Sophie surreptitiously travel from France to England and seem to be headed closer to the heart of the mystery that they are trying to unravel, an unknown nemesis is closer to them than they would dare imagine. This unknown adversary is marshaling resources in order to obtain the long hidden secret that Langdon and Sophie appear to be on the brink of discovering. It is one that has the potential to have earth shattering implications.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, plot driven, rather than character driven, thriller. It hurls itself into the reader's consciousness at break-neck speed, and before the reader realizes it, the book holds the reader in its thrall: hook, line, and sinker. For those readers who love historical detail and unusual facts and coincidences, this is definitely a fascinating book that will hold their interest. It is a page-turning thriller in which nearly every chapter leaves the reader on the brink of a precipice. The book is written in clear, effortless prose, which makes the most esoteric historical details surprisingly easy to understand. Simple in its presentation but intricate in its plotting, it is no surprise that this book has become a runaway, international bestseller.

B00018TI5E|4.0|\\"Shadows Collide With People\\" is the first CD Frusciante did solo while being clean, I believe. It's also the best produced, and most accessible of his solo works. After listening to this I can clearly hear the Frusciante influence in every subsequent RHCP release. The Chilis used to be Kiedis and Flea's band---now they are definitely Frusicante's band. I like this CD. I think if it had been pushed there are definitely radio friendly songs there. Buy this one first, and if you like it you should try his other solo works. Just be warned, some of them (Niandra Lades, especially) are pretty weird.    Another reviewer compared John Frusciante to Brian Wilson. I believe that is an accurate comparison. One day, people will look back at JF's solo work and wonder why more people didn't \\"get it\\". Brilliant musician, brilliant songwriter, genius in the studio. Buy this CD, buy all his other CDs, buy all the RCHP albums, too.
B00005JNRY|4.0|Pixar's last collaboration with Disney turns out to be a sweetly sentimental picture about days gone by - about the fast pace of the present leaving behind the \\"simpler\\" days of bygone years.<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" is the interesting final act in a marriage between the most original maker of animated pictures and the marketing behemoth better know for its tried, trite and formulaic films. The film is completely predictable. Once we are introduced to self-sufficient, arrogant racecar \\"Lightning McQueen,\\" only the most obtuse of viewers could fail to predict that he will somehow learn the requisite lessons that 1) We All Must Rely On Others and 2) We Must All Slow Down To See The Beauty Arounf Us. Add a love interest, a motley collection  of oddballs and a bitter old racer who has turned his back on his old love of racing, and you have a potential carnival of clich&eacute;s. But \\"Cars\\" pretty much gets past banality to deliver a movie that is breathtaking to watch, often funny and almost moving.<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" waxes rhapsodic about the pre-interstate experience of driving in which the journey, not the destination, was most important. The film adulates the old Route 66, with its neon-emblazoned motels, gas stations and drive-ins. It should probably not shock anyone that these establishments could be ugly, uncomfortable and lonely in their own right. But \\"Cars\\" lets us see their beautiful side, in which they catered to the basic needs of travelers of the 1950s and 60s while reflecting the values of their era.<br /><br />Animated or not, \\"Cars\\" is a crashing bore for the little kids. The soundtrack veers too much toward mawkishness, and the languid vistas conjured up by the filmmakers are too glorious for small minds. There's too much story, too much unfathomable nostalgia and not enough racing. The kids in the theater where I saw the film were losing their minds.<br /><br />But for those of us with a bit of wear on our tires, \\"Cars\\" gets us where we want to go - a few minutes rest from the hustle-bustle of the Highway We Call Life.he Highway We Call Life.
B000002H6C|5.0|Every now and then a CD is released which captures a band at the peak of their abilities as both songwriters and musicians. The Beatles had Sgt.Pepper, The Beach Boys had Pet Sounds, Radiohead had Kid A, The Red Hot Chili Peppers have Stadium Arcadium, and Metallica had And Justice For All. This is a PERFECT metal CD. Hard, fast, angry, technical, and brilliant. Nobody has even come close to the mastery of the craft Metallica did here, not even Metallica themselves. Bot a weak song on the CD, not a bad performance either. Buy it, crank it, and lament the fact that Metallica will never be this good again.
B00005JOSS|1.0|I love Sandra Bullock and usually really enjoy her movies but this one is a real dud.  I am absolutely amazed at the good reviews here.   I wish I could get my money back, it was that bad.  I saw this movie with two of my friends and they felt the same way.    The one star I give this movie is for the dog, Jack, who is the best part of the whole film.    Don't waste your money on this one!!!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I had Muse recommended to me by several sources, and after listening to a couple of song samples on Amazon.com, I still wasn't sold on the band.  I worried that the lead singer's voice would make me want to gouge my eardrums out with a wooden spoon halfway through the album, even if the music was catchy.  I worried that the music would be so overdramatic it would be ridiculous.    I finally took a chance and purchased \\"Absolution\\" a couple of days ago.  On my first listen to the album I was enjoying the first few songs, although they were very overwhelming.  Just when I thought I wouldn't be able to handle ten or so more tracks of it, however, the band took the album down a notch with slower and less-embellished songs.  For the rest of the CD Muse managed to dance the edge of being ridiculous without ever being so, for a refreshing effect.      I've been listening to \\"Absolution\\" at least three or four times a day since I purchased it, and I already know it's going to be one of the albums I find myself revisiting repeatedly as years go by.
B000001IPP|5.0|Rancid is definitely the best of all the punk acts that came out in the mid-nineties and this is one of their best albums.  After listening to these tracks I wonder why any song has to be any longer than two minutes.  Like most Rancid albums the first 2/3 is where the bulk of the best tracks lie, which are kind of Oi-punkish with the chant-a-long choruses, and oh, they're all catchy as hell.  But since when was catchy a bad thing?  People tend to discredit catchiness as if it were a signal of bad music, but while catchy is equivalent to pop, I don't think it hurts the music in any way. <br /> <br />I wrote this review mostly to stand up for Rancid, and to state that they are indeed very punk.  They're third wave nineties punk, a class of punk in which pretty much every band had their...I guess you could call them \\"MTV moments.\\"  They all also wrote pretty accessible stuff.  But you know, if you want hardcore you've got Dead Kennedys and Black Flag and if you want classic you've got The Clash and The Pistols.  This is supposed to be different and it stands on its own as a really great punk record.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Everyone talks about fixing what isn't broken, how bands seem to \\"experiment\\" a little too much instead of just going with what's made them successful..  Eventually, these guys all need to spread their wings a little..  If music doesn't evolve one album to the next, people would be complaining that these bands are always putting out \\"much of the same\\"..  What bands can you think of that're still around today who have succeeded with the same exact sound for several albums?  The Chili Peppers?  Pearl Jam?  Green Day?  You can even point out a noticable change in the punk bands who have stuck with a single theme over the years, such as the atheist Bad Religion or the political Anti-Flag..  Can anyone say radio friendly? <br /> <br />Why is everyone so scared of change?  I'll admit, I caught onto AFI between the release of 'The Art Of Drowning' and 'Sing The Sorrow', so I wasn't exactly around to see the evolution from 'Very Proud Of Ya' to 'Black Sails In The Sunset'..  For those of you that have been with them since they started with Nitro Records, you've heard a distinct change in every one of their albums from the debut, so why trash them for changing now?  Are they \\"selling out?\\"  because if that's your opinion, they should've sold out on their first smash hit, which came off of \\"Sing The Sorrow\\"..  They're definitely not more pop punk in contrast to what some of the reviewers have said..  If you hear this album sounds like Blink 182, disregard that completely..  You'll never hear the haunting keys, driving vocals and groovy guitars on a Blink 182 album that AFI put front on \\"DECEMBERUNDERGROUND\\"..  One change I will accept is that they have more of an electronic sound to this album, but that doesn't do anything but add to this dark punk genre they've seemed to invent since 'Black Sails'..  You'll hear that electronic groove in songs such as the opener, \\"Prelude 12/21\\", \\"Love Like Winter\\", \\"Affliction\\", \\"The Missing Frame\\", and \\"The Killing Lights\\".. <br /> <br />One of the most important aspects of \\"DECEMBERUNDERGROUND\\" that all fans need to consider is that Davey's vocals are as amazing as ever, if not better..  They made a slight adjustment in the vocals from \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" by featuring a little less chanting and a little more \\"post hardcore\\" screaming..  You'll hear some of it in the bridge of the single, \\"Miss Murder\\"..  Davey can do some absolutely insane things with his voice..  If you want a comparison, \\"Death Of Seasons\\" from the last album sounds like it could fit onto \\"DECEMBERUNDERGROUND\\" <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  If you're a true AFI fan, this disc should rank up as one of their best, if not the best..  If you're new to AFI, I'd highly recommend this album, then start working your way backwards to the beginning..  Also, consider your sources..  A majority of the negative reviews are very short and give you no specific reason why the album didn't live up to far..  Also, look at the reviewer..  Even though you could easily lie on this site, I wouldn't trust \\"A Kid's Review\\"..  Once you become exposed to music over a decade or so, you have better judgement to review albums like this..  Some people give up after one listen and trash the album with one star..  That's ridiculous..  This album is worth the price (which I paid $9.99) but just incase you want to test it out before buying, I'll rate each song for you.. <br /> <br />1) Prelude 12/21: (9.5/10) It's only 1:33, but it's still one of my favorites on the album and challenges \\"Miseria Cantare\\" for their best opener <br />2) Kill Caustic: (9/10) Most of the fans think this is the best song on the album..  This track is most resemblant of a post hardcore AFI..  Davey's screams are incredible, and his vocals make the song <br />3) Miss Murder: (10/10) I didn't like this song at first because it sounded a little too radio friendly for AFI, but it's extremely catchy and kind of meshes old AFI with new AFI <br />4) Summer Shudder: (9/10) I love the guitars and thechorus of this song..  This resembles the chanting AFI that we all know and love from \\"Sing The Sorrow\\" <br />5) The Interview: (8/10) It's a little too slow for my liking, but the chorus is pretty catchy, and I've noticed many people who list this as one of their favorite tracks <br />6) Love Like Winter: (10/10) This is probably my favorite track..  It grooves, has amazing guitars and really catchy keyboards..  I don't think any part of this song has a weak spot, though it hasn't been mentioned much, I think it's one of their strongest tracks over the past few albums <br />7) Affliction: (8.5/10) I don't LOVE this song, but it's solid..  it's a fast paced combination of screaming and background chanting..  Seems to be popular among the fans, though <br />8) The Missing Frame: (8.5/10) I like the vocals in the chorus of this song..  Hence \\"DECEMBERUNDERGROUND\\", it almost sounds like some kind of a punk rock christmas hymn.. (don't ask) <br />9) Kiss And Control: (9.5/10) This is like the ballad of the album..  Unbelievable, you need to hear it, it's beautiful..  Kind of compares to \\"The Great Disappointment\\" in a way <br />10) The Killing Lights: (8/10) This is the only song I consider a little too \\"pop punk\\" for AFI, and its lyrics are a bit weak, but it still has a pretty cool rhythm and beat <br />11) 37mm: (8.5/10) I haven't heard much talk about this track, which surprises me..  Seems like the forgotten song of the album or something, but it sounds like old AFI, which I thought would make it a fan favorite..  Not great, but solid <br />12) Endlessly, She Said: (10/10) I think this is their best closing song ever, with \\"God Called In Sick Today\\" close behind..  It's another beautiful song, and my second or third favorite on the album..  Great finish to a fantastic disc <br /> <br /> <br />For those of you who excel at math, that's 108.5/120 with averages out to 90.4%, an A- album in my opinion..  I didn't even think that was good enough.. <br />If you need anything else to help you decide if this album is any good, go on Interpunk.com and search for the album..  It has reviews and people vote for what they think are the best tracks on the CD.. <br /> <br />Pick up this album

B0009R1T7M|2.0|When I first threw \\"Illinoise\\" into my CD player it took me a couple of songs to form a reaction: wow...this is really bad.  By the time I bought the CD Sufjan Stevens had received an ungodly amount of hype, and I was ready to sit back like in those decade old commercials and be blown away by my audio equipment.  Too bad \\"Illinoise\\" wasn't up to the task.    The first thing I noticed about the album is how the production makes much of it sound limp.  The production reminds me of a Coldplay album where the songs have their rough edges sanded down.  If you're going to make use of this many instruments, then I want to be reminded of Mahler and Prokofiev not Chris Martin.    While there are a couple of standouts (I recommend downloading \\"Chicago\\") there's just not enough high points in the twenty-two tracks to recommend the album.  The lyrics are too often overtly self-conscious and overwrought.  One of the worst offenders is \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr.\\"  The idea itself is interesting: try and create sympathy for someone who has committed atrocious acts.  However, Sufjan isn't clever enough to pull this off in a three minute pop song.  When talking about Gacy's victims he directs a hushed \\"Are you one of them?\\" at the listener.  The results are laughable at best.  Imagine the following line delivered with utmost earnestness and a fist clutched to the singer's heart (at least that's how I picture it) and you'll get an idea at how ridiculous his songs can be: \\"And in my best behavior/ I am really just like him/ Look beneath the floorboards/ For the secrets I have hid.\\"  Trying to create a sense of connection and empathy with a monster is an interesting idea, but Sufjan Stevens just can't do it without being overly sappy.    The amount of hype this album has gotten insures that Sufjan will have a few more albums critics can overhype and then forget.  I'm just hoping that he gives the whole state theme up before he reaches my home state of Ohio.  If you screw that one up Sufjan,then don't expect us to go easy on you.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Though I was skeptical at first that this would be just another \\"space movie\\", I ended up loving it and just wanting too see and know more. It sucks that FOX took it off air, but hey, i guess you can't help that people like mindless television.
B000002UAR|5.0|With Revolver, the Beatles left virtually all of their contemporaries behind.  George Martin provided able assistance, but Paul's idea for the string quartet that undergirded \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" was all his own.  Tape loops, a new cryptic bent to his lyrics, and soaring, chanting vocal's made John's \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" a pioneering piece of studio music.  Harrison's tabla-and-sitar \\"Love You To\\" offered up the possibilities not only of Indian music but of Eastern religion.  And Revolver was only the prelude to [[ASIN:B000002UAU Sgt. Pepper]].
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Some of you may hate this album and crave for there earlier work. With me I would tend to go for Californacation, By The Way and maybe even some of One Hot Minute. <br />But this album Stadium Arcadium, for me it has not only just beaten all of them, it is probably started a new era for Chili's music, again some may hate it, but me personally after hearing this album, have considered Red Hot Chili Peppers as one of my favourite bands, only third to, Pink Floyd and Bob Marley. <br /> <br />In some way I won't Tom Petty to win his court case, for Dani California and Mary Jane's Last Dance sounding very simalar indeed. This is because, to put it quite frankly it is NOT the best song on the album and will never be, in my eyes. For me it is a average song. <br /> <br />I know all the singles, \\"Dani California\\", \\"Tell Me Baby\\", \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\", \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", \\"21st Century\\", \\"Desecration Smile\\", \\"Storm In A Teacup\\". <br />That is also in release date order, well most of it is, not sure about the ones after \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\". <br /> <br />This album is worth every penny, and comes very cheap! <br />
B000021XS0|5.0|Having been a fan of Dream Theater since their 1992 release \\"Images and Words\\", this release from 1999, for me, is one of the great Rock \\"Classical Rock Masterpieces\\". I remember picking it up at it's time of release and after the first listening thinking that this was one of the best albums I had heard for years. \\"Scenes from a memory\\" is an album that finds the band expanding musical boundaries and heading down the concept path which I have enjoyed from a number of great bands over the years, including - Genesis, \\"The lamb lies down on Broadway\\" (1974), Pink Floyd in the, \\"The Wall\\" (1979), Marillion \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" (1985), Queensryche, Operation Mindcrime (1988) and most recently Green Day, \\"American Idiot\\" (2004). <br />The concept is superbly covered in great detail by a number of reviewers on this site so I won't repeat it here. In short it involves a character who experiences a recurring dream of a murder set 70 years earlier and has many twists and turns that kept me interested in the story much like a good book would do.  <br /> <br />As for the music, well this is where it all takes off. The band are in just brilliant form. The music is technically brilliant (in the same league as \\"early 70's\\" Yes and \\"late 70's / early 80's\\" Rush (for me combine Yes - \\"Close to the Edge\\" with Rush - \\"Hemispheres\\" and we're getting close, over 70 minutes of classic Rock with a band determined to push the boundaries of technical ability whilst managing to integrate great riffs (Drums, Guitar, Bass and Keyboards), superb vocals, huge melodies and harmonies.  <br /> <br />A defining moment for me is \\"Starange Déjà Vu\\" and within it a change at 2minutes 38 seconds, absolute magic, the whole song rocks and this moment alone sums up what I enjoy about this album the most - the overall feel and natural interplay of the band, the ability to have something this complex and at the same time maintain a sense of melody and harmony - very rare and so very special.  <br /> <br />\\"Dance of Eternity\\" is another top effort, a 10 minute instrumental that has to be heard to be believed. Likewise \\"The spirit carries on\\" is a moving emotional track near the end of the album that is very moving. (Also check out the Live \\"Scenes from New York\\" DVD, \\"Scenes\\" is played in its entirety and this track complete with backing vocalists is just stunning, a \\"Defining moment\\".  <br /> <br />For me this is really a \\"No Risk disc\\" for anyone who likes \\"early 70's\\" Yes and \\"late 70's / early 80's\\" Rush I really think will enjoy it. <br /> <br />Looking back over the years Genesis and Rush were \\"my bands\\" of the 70's and early 80's (plus a fair bit of Jethro Tull and Kansas), and Marillion (plus Simple Minds, Waterboys, Big Country and U2) took most of my attention in the mid 80's. In the 90's Kings X (early 90's) and Dream Theater remain top of mind for me.   <br /> <br />This is a great album and if you do get it I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00030590I|5.0|Leave it to Hong Kong filmmakers to be the first to exploit, truly exploit, digital technology.  This film creates its own visual imagery, never seen before.  A drop of rain on a sword.  A swirl of yellow leaves.  A storm of black arrows. That, plus a soundtrack of extraordinary beauty.  Hollywood can learn from this one, or hopefully it will.
B000E1155E|5.0|This is a fantastic album. The band have taken Britain by storm writing pure pop songs which as they should describe the perils of growing up as a teenager. Bands may go on for decades but their most energetic songs come from their youth. <br /> <br />This album is pure. Kids singing in their own accents, copying no one and not caring a damn about what people think. The band are the first in the UK whose fame has spread by word of mouth and the use of free downloads. The best track for me Riot Van describing the police's treatment of kids, who like all the youth of Britain have been out drinking.  <br /> <br />Whilst the album has been compared with past Oasis albums the difference in the bands is marked. The Monkeys don't 'do interviews' unlike the publicity seeks Gallaghers. <br /> <br />I am a 40 year old fart. This music make me rember being a kid.
B00000BKI4|5.0|From the first notes of this record you know that you are listening to something new and unique, to wit, a saw. Who else has put the saw to such exquisite use in popular music?  OPUS 40 is a rock sculpture near Woodstock, NY, created by a sole man over a lifetime's work in his backyard. My girlfriend took me to that place ten years ago.  How nice to see it remembered here in a song by the same name.  That is one of the more traditional songs on this record, but I'm drawn to the odder ones upon repeated listenings.  Impossible to categorize, unique, strangely affecting, this is the band's breakout record and masterpiece, although \\"Secret Migration\\" comes close.
B00004ZD69|3.0|The concept behind GYBE's music is to create atomsphere with the use of dramatic instruments such as strings, horns, narration and and voice overs. This concept was well portrayed in \\"f#a#oo\\". The whole album sounded like the soundtrack to the most appocalyptic movie of the century. <br /> <br />I must admit I have trouble getting into this sort of music. Some call it post/prog rock. I say it is more of post classical if anything. Godspeed have indeed found a new concept. That does not necessarily mean they are great musicians. <br /> <br />The same goes for \\"lift your Skinny Fists\\". <br />In this album, it's the same concept but rather than creating what could be called a soundtrack, the band using other ways to convey their message. Sometimes they use Mogwai influences to create a soft loud effect with a repetetive melody (\\"storm\\"), sometimes they use Pink Floyd ideas to build to climaxes (\\"static\\"). In \\"Sleep\\", the band seems to borrow Mercury Rev melodies to create an ethereal feel to their music. Sometimes, it even feels as though they even borrow ethnic influences to perfect their sound. <br />Does it work?  <br />Partially. <br />Remember Godspeed are Godspeed. A band with a concept, and not the bands mentioned above. They don't have the balls of Mogwai, the orgasmic psychadelia of Pink Floyd, or the beauty of Mercury Rev, and adding tribal rhythms is not the guaranteed receipe for success. So, while do use these ideas as a way of making the music \\"stand out\\" more, it's not necessarily more powerful then its limitations. There are still extremely long or dull moments, passages that are just plain boring, such as voice overs, and moments of frustrating repetetiveness that don't build up to crescendos exciting enough. Each piece dwells in 15 minutes of this and needs a lot of patience before it actually gets \\"somewhere\\". On the whole, it feels like there is even more filler then there needed to be.  <br /> <br />As a piece of information, most people who like Godspeed seem to prefer their other two albums to this one. <br /> <br />To me, \\"Lift your Skinny Fists\\" leaves a taste of a not so fantastic experience, one that requires patience to try again and to say the least, one that does not lift your fists like antennas to heaven.  <br />If I am to accept that this is supposed to be the 21st Century masterpiece, then all I can say is that I don't think \\"Godspeed\\" were the best band for it. <br /> <br />My final advice is that if you have trouble with Godspeed, if minimalism is too limited for you, and if you did not get into \\"f#a#oo\\" in the first place then you might not get more out of \\"lift your skinny fists\\".  <br />If you have never heard of Godspeed and are looking for THE album, there is a fair chance you could be disapointed with \\"lift\\". <br />If you love Godspeed, then you should listen and make your own call as to whether this beats their other stuff.
B000FILW86|5.0|I just can't get this album out of my cd player.  It is reminiscent of their earlier stuff without being a copy.  It is diverse without being disconnected.  You've got rock songs, ballads, driving bass and drums, guitar licks with great hooks, and the incredible vocals that only Robin Zander can belt out.  (Why is it that other rock vocalist lose their voice as they get older and Robin's voice keeps getting stronger?).   <br /> <br />They capture a lot of the live sound on this album as they did in '97 with 'Cheap Trick'.  I always love the albums, but seeing them live is the best.  It's nice to see them capture the intensity of their live show on a studio album. <br /> <br />I'm also glad that their new record label is actually promoting this record.  It is definitely worth it!!!

B00006JKOM|4.0|This 1976 album has been criticized by a number of prog fans, including certain \\"academically-oriented\\" progressive rock writers.  To tell you the truth, I am not entirely clear as to why this album is criticized and with such vigor.  It is actually pretty darn good and initiates a period where some fairly incredible music was being cranked out by Mr. Anderson and company.<br /><br />With respect to the lineup at this point, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond left the group after Minstrel in the Gallery (1975), leaving the band without a bassist.  The late John Glascock replaced Jeffrey and the tone that John gets out of his Fender Musicman bass is very tight and punchy and the interplay with virtuoso drummer Barriemore Barlow is truly something to behold.  Speaking of Barriemore, his drumming during the mid - late 1970's was simply jaw dropping - those of you that need proof are urged to check out his solo on \\"Conundrum\\" from the live Bursting Out album (1978).  As such, his performances on Too Old to Die: Too Young to Rock n' Roll are excellent, although he does not play on every track.  Come to think of it, the performances by all of the band members are all fairly inspired and Ian even plays a solo on a harmonica along with some semi-jazzy riffs on the saxophone.  In addition to the core members, string and brass arrangements are featured here and there and Steeleye Span vocalist Maddy Prior provides backing vocals on the title track.Personally, I feel that the subtle changes in instrumentation were a nice addition.<br /><br />The music on this album is characteristic of the blend of acoustic textures and thunderous prog that started with Minstrel in the Gallery and culminated with albums like Songs from the Wood (1977) and Heavy Horses (1978).  One other thing worth mentioning is that the use of melodies increased dramatically on this album and they are actually very nice.<br /><br />The remastering is superb and features incredibly good sound quality along with loads of band photos, liner notes, pretty good bonus tracks, and restored cover/gatefold art.<br /><br />All in all, I found this album to be very enjoyable and certainly not nearly as bad as people say it is.  Recommended along with the excellent Songs from the Wood and Heavy Horses.otes, pretty good bonus tracks, and restored cover/gatefold art.

0380002930|5.0|I read \\"Watership Down\\" back in the 1970s on the recommendation of my grandmother, who cited it as her favorite book.  Indeed, as others have said, the story captures you very quickly. Yes, the characters are rabbits, but it is not a children's story per se. The characters are so well drawn they grip you immediately and you care very much about them. To me, it is more an allegory relating to evnironmental destruction and loss of natural habitat.  Scenes from this book still linger in my imagination many years after reading it (albeit only once). Weird, but I often still think about it when driving along looking at the landscape and trying to imagine the actual length of land the rabbits traversed and the trials they encountered on their way to find a new place for their home. <br />This book is full of adventure, integrity and love. It captures the imagination and doesn't let go.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is a shame that this show was not allowed to find its audience on tv.  Looking at some of the other fare that seemingly thrives on the airwaves, one might hope that a show that is both well written and cast would be given the time to develop.  Alas though, this is not always the case.  This is not a simple Star Trek clone.  It has a distinctive look and feel that many should enjoy.  It is a good thing that the dvd has come along to provide a channel for quality shows before they disappear.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|Finally....finally....we get this CD, plus the \\"Don't Look Back\\" cd remastered!!!  My ears have never been happier!  Trust me, you'll absolutely love this one.  I hate listening to an older CD where you have to turn the volume up halfway to get a good sound level.  Such was the case with the older version of this CD.  Put this new CD in your player and crank up the volume (you won't have to turn it up as far now :)....But, the sound is incredible.  A truly wonderful job at remastering....I've had this cd on order for nearly 3 months and finally it arrived at my doorsteps this afternoon.  Ahhhh, some wonderful ear candy for a Saturday afternoon.

B00005AUBA|5.0|Such a beautiful composition. Couldn't relate to anyone who was not moved by such a work; in fact I'd likely want to murder them. Just kidding!?  <br /> <br />Bottom line is, for me, this is Mogwai's masterpiece (thus far), capturing both their amazing sense of technical, sonic subtlties and bringing in their most resonant, loving melodies. It's so wonderfully sad.. so tenderly glum. The first two tracks alone bring more out of my soul than virtually any modern music being written. <br /> <br />My favorite music makes me think of, you know, certain things -- most prominately the things that I cherish.. Things that, despite my gross affection for, I don't always have time to meditate on for whatever reason (and there are certainly many). Myself, loved ones, the world at large...God. Like one of my favorite albums, Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s \\"Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada\\", \\"Rock Action\\" is so perfectly melancholy that you'd wonder if their could possibly be a more moving piece of music that doesn't touch with its glorifying mournfulness. Pretty music is always pretty, but the world is not pretty. It is both horrendous and simultaneously full of the most amazing possibilities; this contrast, for me, allows any artist to bring out the most in my Human spirit. C.S. Lewis stated somewhere that if the world was perfectly beautiful and content, there would be no reason to question the existence of God. And most understand that without suffering there is no potential for empathy, at least in this world. So, for me -- especially at this point in time, where the general heart of Man seems far fallen from its home -- this type of music can offer so, SO much. You just have to go along with your imagination. <br /> <br />It's unfortunate that a part of me can get so much out of this music while, admittedly, I still maintain a good feeling of spite for those who would dismiss the music for their own personal reasons. But, coming to grips with that is a personal issue that I need to attempt to overcome... If you have (or haven't), but have a reservation within your soul for haunting, benevolent sounds of grace, please divulge... For you and me.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" is arguably their masterpiece (along with \\"hail to the thief\\"). After the brilliant \\"Ok computer\\", they went in yet another direction and experimented with dark electronica on this album. It opens with the catchy \\"Everything in it's right place\\", which will immediately suck you in. Then, it's on to the icy-sounding \\"Kid A\\", the sound perfectly resembles the album cover. Cold. Then the almost jazzy \\"The national anthem\\" kicks in. Which is a complete 180 from the previous song, Driven by bass instead of synth. The next song, \\"How to disappear completley\\", is a much quieter song. Hard to explain it. Must be heard. The next song is called \\"Treefingers\\" and is also difficult to explain. It is an apparently improvised instrumental. While some may say it is not as good as the other songs, i think it perfectly fits and adds to the album's mood. Then it's on to \\"Optimistic\\", a noticeably more upbeat track. The title suits the song quite well. One of the record's more guitar driven tracks. The followup to this is \\"In limbo\\", a very dreamy sounding song. If you have heard it, you know what i mean. Following is the dance track \\"Idioteque\\", it is kind of song you could never Radiohead doing, butit is pulled off so pefectley, you wonder why is wasn't made sooner. We then get one of the album's best tracks, \\"Morning bell\\", another catchy tune. This song has some of Thom Yorke's best vocals. It also has the haunting line  \\"Cut the kids in half\\". The song sounds like it's about a divorce. Then the record ends with the beautiful \\"Motion picture soundtrack\\". The perfect way to close the album. One of the best albums ever, if you don't have it, I strongly suggest getting it.
1594200823|4.0|Very informative and well written book.  Makes you think. How can we live in agreement with the nature? Pollan shows that animal agriculture can operate in a way that respects the environment.  And much, much more...  Recommended reading.
B00001QEE8|3.0|I don't have this dvd and wouldn't buy it unless i was desperate.Disney is always pulling stuff like this: \\"Limited Issue, Limited Adition, Limited time Only\\", To Be Perfectly honest, it's becoming quite annoying.The only point i could think of for owning this dvd is because it's \\"dvd\\". However i believe it is a waste of money and a vhs copy is sufficent at this point. When they put it out again it should have the special features it deserves.
B000084T18|1.0|when i first heard 50, i actually though he was kinda ill.he did freestyles on stretch armstrongs radio show, did a joint with nas, and came with somewhat competant lyrics...but now he's in the club, asking 21 questions. FELL OFF.  if you want hot street lyrics and beats, check 4,5,6 by Kool G Rap (and if your not familiar with G Rap, you need to step your game up...)
6305311463|5.0|I'm an engineer and the science here makes extensive use of   poetic license. However, I find it completely entertaining and   engrossing. The special effects are fine. The \\"story\\" is a real   heart-breaker and tear-jerker. I continue to re-view it for the pure   entertainment. Has some great characters. Besides, we get to look   at Liv Tyler a lot. Probably not 5 stars. Four in my book. I gave   it an extra star because I think it's been panned too severely.
B00005JP01|5.0|This has to be one of the best films I have ever seen. When I first heard about how it was coming out, I thought 'Oh cool, more Brian and Roman Pearce!' And then, I realised that this featured none of the original characters. I still wanted to see it, but I didn't think it'd be as good as 2 fast 2 furious! I was completely wrong. This is way better than 2 fast 2 furious and that's saying something. I loved Sean and my favourite character would have to be D.K. - he was just soooo evil!  <br /> <br />It was funny, heart-stopping, and thrilling. Definitely the best, as while 2f2f was brilliant, it just didn't have the same effect. Plus, some new characters really put spice into it. <br /> <br />This film is totally recommended. GO SEE IT! <br /> <br />And to the person who said it had no script, no acting, no original characters and that only stupid people would like this - get a life!
0790729350|2.0|I have a borrowed copy so I am not bitter about buying this CHEAP rehash. Director's cut... means what? We all know that Woodstock was a groovy phenomenon - there's no debate there, and the positive reviews for this product are giving credit where its due. However, if I was a consumer I would be enraged. As another viewer mentioned, the sub titles are in places hysterically inaccurate- Couldn't the producers of this version hire a fact checker? Additionally- there are no extras at all, and the two sided disc is not mentioned anywhere. The dvd just cuts off and turns to black while CSN are still talking. I thought something happened to my TV. ( yeah man, the cats that put together this version were just not being cool - and that's not me just rappin' with a negative vibe- ya dig? Don't waste your bread man.) See the movie, just don't buy this version.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I'm a big fan of spider-man before the release of the movie, i have a almost all the comic of spiderman ,i was excited when i heard about the spider-man movie and very happy beacuse Sam Raimi will there direct it, i finally  see it and is one of the best movies in 2002, the cast is terrific, Tobey Maguire was a outstanding, kristen Dusnt(she is very beautiful but never as Reese Witherspoon) did a excellent job, William Da Foe another outstanding actor and is a excellent villan, the visuals are Incredible,the New York city looks really really beautiful looks even better in the movie than in the real world,the direction is simply \\"Perfect\\",X-men are great too but i prefer spiderman by far, i put 4 stars beacuse Spider-Man 2 was bigger and better than the first spiderman.<br /><br />Story 10/10<br />Acting 9/10<br />Direction 10/10<br />Visuals 10/10<br /><br />Overall 10/10
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Disney hit all the right notes with this delightful film about courage, empowerment, and believing in yourself. Every time this film comes on (usually the Disney Channel) I curl up on the sofa and have a delightful time with this adventure of Mulan. If you haven't seen it, you're missing a great film.
B000244FDW|4.0|1- David Rintoul is a more believable Darcy <br />2- Elizabeth is a more believable Elizabeth <br />3- the actress who plays Jane does not have a strangely shaped head (this distracted me in the later version) <br />4- the dialogue is closer to what the author wrote <br />5- the pace of the production appeared to be in keeping with the pace of the novel <br />6- the later version had screeching, annoying actresses whereas the 1980s version had actresses who appeared to understand their characters and played them well. <br /> <br />There are many more reasons.  Suffice to say that this version is a better production overall.  I fear the later version hoped it could count on Colin Firth to carry the entire production- as much as I like him, he couldn't make up for the shortcomings of the rest of the cast.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|If you like your zombies hysterically funny, then you have to get this film.  Gruesome, funny, disgusting, and touching all at the same time, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" really delivers.  Unlike some comedy-zombie flicks that start out strong and end weak, this one keeps the gore and humor constant throughout, and then delivers a couple of zinger punchlines at the very end.  Wonderfully hideous!  You have to get this one.
0975991477|3.0|In The Biology of Belief, Bruce Lipton sets forth a lot of new ideas that are exciting and seems to back them up with sincere medical articles.  While his ideas are interesting, read skeptically since, like most persuasive authors, he bends and manipulates a few articles to further his own point.  For example, in the chapter on the placebo effect in which he takes a few pot shots at the pharmaceutical industry, Lipton cites an article in the New England Journal of Medicine in which J.B. Moseley performs a blind test for arthroscopic surgery for the osteoarthritic knee and a placebo surgery.  Mosely finds that the placebo surgery patients recover as well as the patients who actually recieved the surgery.  Lipton uses this as evidence that even procedures as large as surgeries are useless and that the same effects could be reached by his \\"positive belief\\" ideas.  Well, upon further research, one would find that arthroscopic surgery for the osteoarthritic knee has long been one of the more controversial surgeries, with many surgeons believing that it does not actually do anything to fix the problem.  The study proves what many surgeons had suspected for a while, that THAT particular surgery is unnecessary, not all surgery in general.  Seeing a placebo heart surgery leave a patient as well off as a real heart surgery is something that the world of holistic medicine still waits to see.  So while this book does lay out some interesting new concepts in the field of epigenetics, be weary of some of Lipton's ideas and examples and read with a discerning eye.
B0009ML238|4.0|When I put this CD into my player, I heard influences from a number of bands: Dream Theater, Symphony X, Divine Regale, etc.  In fact I found myself comparing band member names from Circus Maximus and Divine Regale because the singers sound so much alike.  None of the names were the same, just a lot of similarities between  the two bands.  It takes a lot of chops to come close to bands like these and Circus Maximus does it with ease.   <br /> <br />The singer's voice is clean in all ranges, the guitar playing is impecable, the keyboarding is all over the place--bringing great flavor and atmosphere to each song, the drumming and bass playing are tight.  What else can you say? <br /> <br />If this is the baseline from this band, I can't wait to see where they go from here.  When their songwriting and album concepts begin taking more shape and form this band's success will be unstoppable.
B00005JNRY|5.0|I went into Cars with not very high expectations. I don't know why considering Pixar has a perfect batting average when it comes to making good films. Perhaps it was the unbelievably high amount of negative reviews I was reading about the film. In the end, I think this was a good thing as it allowed me to watch a movie that would surpass my expectations, and I love it when a movie is better than I expect.<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about Cars is that it's an abstract fantasy. Much of the criticism I hear is about how the film's setting doesn't make sense logically. Here we have a world populated by cars which feature accomodations such as doors and seats for humans that don't exist. I find this a silly thing to get hung up on as it has no bearing on the story of the film which uses personified cars as clever characterizations of people.<br /><br />The film opens up strong and engages you right from the beginning. I hate NASCAR, but I had no problem enjoying the visuals of the film's openning race that would serve to tell the motive of the main character, Lightning McQueen, as well as set up the conflict he would have to overcome.<br /><br />The story itself is completely unoriginal and full of cliche, but this does not detract much from the film. Even if feel at points that you've been there, seen that, you really haven't due to the interesting twist of the movie's unique setting (cars instead of people in case you haven't been following along). You also haven't seen this story (Doc Hollywood) done so well. Were this a serious drama, the cliche and stereotypes that are rampant in the film would be a negative, but as a comedy they only add to the film's characterization of Americana and society.<br /><br />The pleasure in this film isn't wondering what's going to happen next. In deed, the film is entirely predictable, but fitting to the theme of the movie it's a great ride. Lightning McQueen starts off as a hot shot racing car celebrity who ends up trapped in a small town and ends up learning what's important in life. The pleasure is in watching the growth and development of the main character on his journey to enlightenment (read: not being a self-centered, egotistical moron) and all the encounters with the story's other denizens along the way.<br /><br />Much like Ellen Degeneres did in Finding Nemo, Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as the lovable tow truck named Mater. You don't have to be a fan to appreciate his performance. And Luke Wilson has become a master at making the unlikable-ignorant-jerk likable.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much children will enjoy this film. It's slow in parts much like The Incredibles was, but unlike that film it doesn't have the big action scenes as pay off. The film is definately good for kids and teaches morals such as 'it's not whether you win or lose but how you play that matters.' However, the overall story seems more aimed at adults. Still, I didn't hear any kids complaining at my trip to the theatre so don't be concerned about taking them.<br /><br />Pixar returns to it's roots with the same style film as Toy Story 1 & 2. It also keeps with it's tradition of being an impeccable movie studio that never fails to impress. Cars is another homerun for the studio and easily one of the best films of the year.nds up trapped in a small town and ends up learning what's important in life.

B000F7CMRM|2.0|Definitely worth renting, but if I were you I'd wait until either Warner Bros or Criterion releases the deluxe edition. I've heard Stephen Gaghan speak in person on his film and simply can't believe he doesn't have an incredible amount of backstory and commentary to be expanded on a future dvd edition. \\"Featurettes\\" and deleted scenes - that's all you get here? Please.
0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris has quickly become one of my favorite authors.  In a world where religion is being used as a divisive force it is time that people start to invest more faith in humanity than in some deity.  Religions have always come and gone, piggybacking off one another for themes of creation, divinity, and myth.  Hopefully a supposed secular country like the U.S. will take the insightful words of Harris to heart.  He presents a clear and logical argument, even though many religious extremists and evangelicals will slam the book.  No matter how you spin it terrorists that act in the name of God act in accordance to their personal faith, and that is simply dangerous.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|When I heard Animal I Have Become on Sirius Radio a few months back I began anticipating the release of this cd.  The other day I picked it up (later than I wanted too, but work kept me from getting it when it was released).   Anyway, I got home and threw it into my cd player and from the beginning of track one, just knew that this cd was going to be wonderful.  I told one of my best friends online, \\"this cd has been the best purchase I have made in months, it was $16 well spent... buy it\\"  He went out and bought it, and said pretty much the same thing.   <br /> <br />I have listened to Three Days Grace for years now.  I have seen them in concert and knew that they would always release good music.  But to be honest, this cd still surprised me.  I did not expect to pick up something that was this good from them.   <br /> <br />I would do a track breakdown, but others before me have beat me too it, and for the most part were pretty close to what I would rate the songs.  So I will spare you all another track breakdown.  I will say that Time of Dying, Gone Forever, Never Too Late, and Over and Over are my favorites on the cd. <br /> <br />Pick this cd up if you get a chance. You will not be dissappointed.
B00005JOSS|5.0|you'll like this movie. One does have to suspend their beliefs to some extent in this. The reason for that has to do more with technology. One could look up someone on the net, though even that try isn't always successful. I love the way time moved in this movie and the realizations of people as they realize how they exist in each others time with each other and apart. I love how these two people are there for each other with just a simple letter. They doubt and yet they don't take chances. There are some scenes you can see from a mile away but that doesn't matter. The journey is what matters and this film addresses that splendidly.  <br /> <br />Relationships of architecture and how it relates to our lives and where live, parents, siblings, loneliness, loved ones are looked at. There are some very funny moments.  <br /> <br />I am buying this one when it comes out because I love the time aspect as well as the relationship aspects. It was worth it.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is about Jonas. When he is a Twelve (Twelve years old) his role in the community is to be the Receiver of Memory. The Giver (his \\"boss\\") gives him the memories of the past, like color, pain, war, love, and other things unavailable to their community. They both want the community to have those things, so Jonas does something no one else has ever done, with his friend Gabe. The ending is a little weird, but to understand more about it you should read Gathering Blue and Messenger, companions to The Giver. I recogmend this book for people 12 and older, though I read it at age 10 and recently re-read it.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Porcupine Tree's \\"Deadwing\\" was a record I decided to leave off, and explore later, as I listened heavily to \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Signify\\". Being PT's latest effort, I, for some reason, undermined it as being not as promising. This was, mind you, before I listened to the album. <br /> <br />Boy oh boy was I wrong. <br /> <br />This album is absolutely stunning. Stunning. Perfect in every way. I could not believe my ears upon hearing this fine piece of work and it all started with the opening track, \\"Deadwing\\". Almost ten minutes in length, the song didn't draw out or anything of the sort. In fact, it had wonderful guitars coupled with entertaining lyrics and incredible transitions. The way Steven Wilson is able to use his voice on this song is amazing, especially when he uses his whisper vocals. This was the song that opened my eyes... and rightfully so, being the first one on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Shallow\\", \\"Lazarus\\", and \\"Halo\\" are the next three songs on the album. Already familiar with \\"Shallow\\", I listened to it joyfully as the main riff carried me throughout the song. The guitar work is amazing, and the song in itself flows so differently from the opening track - very refreshing, to say the least. It's a song like this that makes me appreciate Stephen Wilson's strenght on verses, not simply relying on melodic choruses. \\"Lazarus\\" follows \\"Shallow\\" and is a completely different mixture than the previous two, which were more up-tempo in their overall delivery. \\"Lazarus\\" is a beautiful song, with beautiful lyrics and wonderful piano playing. \\"Follow me down to the valley below, you know...\\" Stephen Wilson's atmospheric capabilities are stunning, as \\"Lazarus\\" proves that beautifully. This track is a very heart-felt one, and it makes me feel at peace whenever I listen to it. \\"Halo\\", on the other hand, was a completely different vibe all together. The chorus is stunning, and it sums up the background vocal melodies, which piece the song together beautifully.  <br /><br />\\"Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here)\\" and \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" are probably my favourite songs on the album. Being the longest song on \\"Deadwing\\", \\"Arriving Somewhere...\\" is a true masterpiece. The lyrics are probably my favourite, as the progression of the song fits in perfectly with its theme. The lyrics and the music both complement eachother perfectly on this song, as Stephen Wilson and Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt pump out two wonderful solos. \\"Can you imagine from here on in your life begins and all you knew was wrong?\\" Just a wonderful interlude from a wonderful song. On the other hand, \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" might in fact be more precious that the one before it. I can honestly say I've listened to this one more than any other. The song is simply beautiful. I cannot stress how it makes me feel, and how its atmosphere sets my mood appropriately. Without exaggerating, I will say that the chorus for \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" is among my favourites of all time. It breaks my heart. It proves how incredible Stephen Wilson's vocal ability is.  <br /> <br />\\"Open Car\\" is probably one of the first songs I'd ever listen to from Porcupine Tree. The chorus and the verses carry themselves mutually, even though they sound completely different. The choppy guitar riffs mix with the drawn out melodies of the chorus, making this song very friendly to the ear. I would anticipate this song to be very popular among listeners... especially those of whom are new to Porcupine Tree.  <br /> <br />\\"Start of Something Beautiful\\" and \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" represent classic Porcupine Tree, in a sense. Both songs are long, with \\"Glass Arm...\\" clocking over eleven minutes, and they both carry with them a sense of ambiguity. \\"Start of Something Beautiful\\" is rather easy to listen to, as it is fixed in a very laid back manner, with a catchy chorus (that continually gets better) to boot. \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\", on the other hand, probably represents classic Porcupine Tree the most. Very musically inclined and instrumentally driven, this song has the fewest lyrics out of any on the album, characterizing PT's wonderful charm and unmatched style. It's another atmospheric gem, as the instrumentals to and from the lyrical stanzas bring the song to its climax.  <br /> <br />\\"Shesmovedon\\", or the hidden track, if you will, is very straight forward in its style. But what makes this song so amazing is its chorus, \\"She changes every time you look...\\" and the very fact that it was unexpected. Even if I had known this album had a hidden track, I wouldn't expect it to sound this way... but it does fit the theme of the whole album, and the final track, \\"She moved on.\\" <br /> <br />What else can I say? I love this album more than life itself. It's probably one of my favourites of all time. The only thing I can say is don't waste another moment without it. I beat around the bush a lot with \\"Deadwing\\" and I'm sorry that I did. In my honest opinion, this one did everything and more... and it fits my lifestyle perfectly. Thank you Porcupine Tree. <br />
B000ENC6XM|4.0|This is a review of the HD DVD only, not a review of the movie or the actors.<br /><br />With the advent of the new HD DVD players, movie studios are releasing movies in that format.  Some aren't even really changed at all, and those who purchase them are only getting a repackaged product that will allow them to place it on the shelves with the other HD DVDs.<br /><br />CONSTANTINE is one of the movies that will really make an HD DVD system and surround sound system shine.  The movie is jam-packed with special effects that look great on an HD monitor.  Pausing the movie allows the viewer to look at a crystal-clear image that has to be seen to be believed.  The audio portion of the film will slam through the surround sound system.<br /><br />Anyone who loved the movie but hasn't bought the 2-disc special edition of CONSTANTINE can pick this one up.  The HD DVD comes fully loaded with all the extras.  The smooth, new interface available on the HD DVD formatting that allows a viewer to effortlessly switch back and forth between the movie and the special features is well worth the upgrade.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|KoRn was what i listened to non stop for years and they are one of the bands that inspired me to play guitar ( 7 string too ).  I was very excited to hear this album come out because \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\" was a grat album with tons of great and classic riffs.  Brian \\"head\\" left the band after recording the covers off the greatest hits album, and Munky is now the guitar player.  And i don't know if it was his influence on the music writing, or the band figured it was time for change but its... different.   <br /> <br />I heard Twisted Transistor and was like, this is really wierd , but its only one song.  Then i heard the album its self.  And in my opinion is a huge disgrace.  What in gods name was KoRn thinking being recording a video with those retarded no talent rappers.  Its horrid to see the KINGs OF NU-METAL  do a video with those rappers.   <br /> <br />Since i am a loyal fan, ive decided not to buy this album and hope that this industrial style will pass, and not become worse.  Hopefully their next album wikk be heavy again...  And i am interested to see how it works with the Fear Facotry Guitarist, so maybe he'll breathe new life into the band. <br />

B000EHRVP6|5.0|The film spends its first 45 minutes in a horndog's vision of Amsterdam as paradise - a colorful city alive late into the night with truly beautiful women for sale at prices you have no trouble affording (some nudity, but mostly young women in bra and panties) and epic bouts of drugs and drinking.  Meanwhile, you get to know the three characters' vices well enough to dislike them, but you can't help laughing at their adventures and finally being won over by their basically good (if horny and druggy) nature.  Looking for even hotter women and cheaper drugs, they are talked by a chance acquaintance (his roommate is having soft-core sex with an attractive nude woman throughout their conversation) into travelling to Bratislava.  Where in heck is Bratislava? In Hell. It does exist, and Slovakia functions for this movie and for \\"Eurotrip\\" what Eastern Europe did for Dracula and the Prisoner of Zenda - another world, where anything beautiful or evil is possible.  They enter the titular hostel and find two gorgeous women dressing in their room who invite them to a health spa where first they see a topless beauty lounging and then a shapely bikinied brunette walking away from them and a completely nude blonde goddess walking towards them.  Our heroes have come to Sex Shangri-la; even the dopey, socially inept Josh scores with a beauty queen.  Josh really isn't a bad dude, we now know, and Paxton tell us of his nightmares about a little girl drowning in Lake Michigan.  They become likable as we get to know them and the two Asian girls they befriend.  Then they begin to disappear and ... (I don't want to give any of the shocks and unexpected heroics away)and the last half hour is screaming, horror, gore, brutality and ... believable heroism.  The last fifteen minutes are very exciting.

B0002OERI0|4.0|This is a massive improvement musically for Green Day, seriously listen to everything they wrote prior to this and you'll be dumb struck when you listen to this, and also a fairly decent rock opera.  <br />To me it's kind of like taking The Who Quadrophenia and scrunching the first half of it into one massive 9 minute long song. The similarities are there, both stories are about a main character who just doesn't really belong in they're town and both end up running away to get away from it all (I know some people will probably complain that it was about a guy with 4 personalities but was there really much of a difference between any of them? I looked at them as being more like social identities). <br /> Although Quadrophenia was more of a concept album than a Rock Opera (really no story at all). So Green Day pretty much took that concept and stretched it out to make a rock opera. <br />The music is great and is a refreshment from a lot of the stuff you'll hear nowadays, some verity in sound ya know.  <br />
B00005JNRY|5.0|Being a fan of Toy Story and A Bug's Life, I used to look forward to a Pixar release. Then came Finding Nemo and The Incredibles: two of the dumbest movies I have ever seen! I went and saw Cars just becuase I'll sit through anything that has to do with cars and motor vehicles. But, to my surprise, the movie was great! This is way better than any of Pixar's other movies. It's a must see!
B00006EXL5|4.0|I love My Chemical Romance ever since I heard \\"I'm Not Okay\\" I actually got to hear this album first and have loved it since the day I got it.  <br />The music in the album is probably the closest to being perfect music I'll hear nowadays, something thats heavy sounding but doesn't have one of those singers who sounds like they're vomiting into a toilet. All the songs are pretty good (with the exception of track 8 Early Sunsets Over Monroeville, I thought it was a little dragged on). <br />The standout track on the cd of course is \\"Demolition Lovers\\" <br /> <br />as for some of the people who disliked I guess this just isn't your kind of music. And to those of you who liked Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge be warned this isn't the same thing as that album but give it a try look the videos they have for \\"Honey this mirror ain't big enough for the two of us\\" and \\"Vampires will Never Hurt You\\" you should get a decent feel of what the album is like from there. (Might also be a video for headfirst for halo, anyone know?)
B000050HTO|1.0|I don't usually rant but it, at least from my prespective, probrably different from yours, seems that bob dylan is an incredibly talented lyricist and I absolutley love covers of his songs. But he belongs in poetry, not in music, or he should have at least sometime over the last 40 years taken a small share of his millions of dollars and taken voice lessons. Because I know from vocal experiences that ANYONE can learn to sing at a professional level. I mean the fact is 'as is' he's not where he needs to be and as a performer he should be not so much looking past his wealth, because I know that still means alot to any preformer, but he should be putting his first priority in making sure the people who pay his checks get the best possible product, even if he's no Freddie Mercury or Billy Joel just the best Bob can do. and he in my eyes is no true performer
B00005JOSS|4.0|Of course the movie is well written. It'd be disappointing if a Pulitzer winning writer couldn't pen a decent film. The written word is brought to life by Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, two people who have a quiet and mesmerizing way of delivering their lines. You feel like you're part of something truly magical (to not sound completely corny!) because the premise of the movie is itself shrouded in mysticism. How is it that the little flag of the mailbox moves up and down by itself? Or that the two main characters have the same dog? And with the lakehouse as the backdrop, well, you can't beat that. <br /> <br />Bullock plays Kate, a woman living in 2006, who has just begun a new job and moved out of the lakehouse into an apartment. She leaves a letter at the lakehouse for the new tennant. But who should receive this letter other than Alex, a man who is living in the lakehouse in 2004. They begin a letter-writing courtship, questioning the possibilities of how something so strange and wonderful can be happening and whether or not they can manipulate time in order for them to one day be together. While it seems easy enough (all she has to do is tell him to meet her in two years at so and so location), time and circumstances are not always on their side. <br /> <br />The big question is will they or won't they, and of course, I cannot reveal this. What kind of reviewer would I be?! All I can say is that lovers of romantic comedies should not miss out, nor should fans of the written word. It's important to forget the space/time paradoxes and simply enjoy the movie, which is certainly not hard to do at all. Bullock and Reeves make that extremely easy.
0446677450|5.0|This is an excellent book on the subject of financial inteligence. Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter tell the story of making money in a no-nonsense if not controversial manner. What's controversial are the ideas contained within (and the authors admit that much). Alas, the ideas will most likely be considered contoversial by the 95% that end up with nothing at the start of retirement.
0140186409|5.0|You have to read this book.  It has been one of my favorites for the last 10 years and I often re-read it.<br /><br />While the Joad's story is definitely moving, I think the best parts of the book come from the narratives between the Joads story.<br /><br />Most people look at this book as a history of the Great Depression and how it affected the Dust Bowl in the 1930's in terms of the Joad family.  I hope that people can remove themselves from the Joad story long enough to realize that Steinbeck's narratives exemplify the history of EVERY CLASS STRUGGLE THAT HAS EVER BEEN.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever studied revolutionist theory, be it the American Revolution, Civil Rights, Women's Right's, Gay rights, etc. cannot NOT appreciate the insights that John Steinbeck gives in the alternate chapters.  It is unfortunate that most people won't bother to read this book because,<br /><br />a.  it's a classic, and classic means \\"boring\\" and<br /><br />b.  it may be about a group of people that are not at all interesting to them.<br /><br />As an Black-American, I see the looks of people when I say this is one of my favorite books (along with \\"Great Expectations\\" but that is just because Estella is a the kind of woman I admire), especially among other Black-Americans.  I mean, who cares, we have CURRENT struggles in our midst.  But to not read this book would be a mistake.  This book is very relevant to what we currently face.  And with the current immigrant situation, I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone illegally in American as well.  This book is not about just the dust bowl in the late 1930's, it's about being strong in the face of adversity.  It's about going when there is nothing left.  It's about coming together for survival.  It's about what causes change.<br /><br />Many people won't care about the Joads (although I don't know how you cannot - if Ma Joad doesn't remind you of the stereotypical strong black grandmother holding the family together - I don't know what does).  But even if you don't, you can at least read the narrative chapters.<br /><br />Particular chapter favorites are:<br /><br />If you are not moved by the words in the above mentioned chapters, then you have never been on the other side of \\"the right\\"t know what does).  But even if you don't, you can at least read the narrative chapters. <br />Particular chapter favorites are: <br /> <br /> <br />If you are not moved by the words in the above mentioned chapters, then you have never been on the other side of \\"the right\\"
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I really liked this movie. The comic chemestry between the two male leads is excellent, the script is witty and intelligent and I found myself pleasantly amused and engaged throughout. A film noir with a very ironic take on Hollywood with an angle interesting enough to make it into possible cult material. Did I say that I liked how the two male leads interacted with each other? Who knew that Val Kilmer could be so subtly funny and sarcastic. And I loved the very ironic narration and how the movie is divided up into chapters, like the comic books from which it is inspired. An intelligent commedy that does not take itself too seriously. With so many so called comedies made today that fail to amuse, this one is a keeper. Have fun.
B00003CX8V|5.0|This movie has great actors, a great screenplay, and a great director.  I can't fully write how good this film is and why it's considered a classic. It won the Best Picture Oscar and is one of the few winners that really deserve the mention as an award-winning film. The director made the romance is low-key, which makes sense considering the cynical nature of the film. Billy Wilder (Director) also knew when to inject humor and when to inject drama. Very few directors are good at having a sense of when to incorporate humor into a dramatic moment. Any other time it just distracts and messes up the flow of the picture but here Wilder kept things smooth. I also love the ending which from my viewpoint is perfect considering the cynical mood set by the characters. This film has a little romance, mixed with a dash of drama, and a hint of comedy making a delightful piece of classic Hollywood film.
B000003TA4|2.0|I agree with that last reviewer who said how dated this album is.  I too was heavilly into Nirvana in my childhood, but now I just cringe whenever I hear their music.  Back when I was a kid I loved this band, and I still own several of their albums today, but I never listen to them now.  My old cassette tapes of \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\" used to be two of my favourite albums;  but now they've been reduced to juvenile relics from my past that just sit around collecting dust.  Some bands from the past stand the test of time and are able to remain relevent in the 21st century; Nirvana on the other hand, is nothing more than a product of their time that faded into obscurity where they belong. <br /> <br />Face it Nirvana fans...Nirvana aren't a \\"classic\\" band like you think they are.  Who wants to listen to Kurt Cobain's anguished cries of teenage angst in 2006?  Not me that's for sure.  And who over the age of 16 actually enjoys that wall of distorted guitar noise?  I sure don't, and neither does anybody else, why do you think grunge died out?  Because it was just a short lived 90s fad, just like boy bands or the Macarena dance craze! <br /> <br />Face the truth Nirvana fans.  Your favourite band was never any good to begin with, let alone in 2006.  If you're a whiney, angst ridden teenager in 1992, go ahead and get this or any other grunge album.  But anybody who's outgrown their \\"teenage angst\\" phase will have no use for the waste of plastic known as Nevermind.  Or any other grung music for that matter...
B000E33VWW|5.0|Most of the acclaim went to Phillip Seymour Hoffman for his portrayal of Truman Capote. But I think just as much credit should go to director Bennett Miller. For this to be his debut narrative film, Miller did a wonderful job. He knew what pace and mood to set for the story. I also love the script which didn't spell everything out for the audience. Capote's motives and feelings become murky allowing someone to make their own personal judgments about Capote. Hollywood bio-pics usually glorify the individual it shows to the point of masking their humanity (with all its flaws). But this took a different approach. I felt sympathetic for Capote and at the same time repulsed by his actions. A well done film!
1594200823|5.0|Very indightful.  Incredible information about the origin of what we eat.  Read it.
1400079179|4.0|I won't go into the theological debates that this book obviously stirs up (that's such a lengthy dicussion with resources everywhere and readily available), but I will say that I did not find myself shaken by the assertions and implications of this book. I thought it was so obviously...well, fiction. On a literary stand-point, Dan Brown is undoubtedly a gifted writer, which is part of the reason why this book has done so well. He keeps his chapters short (all 105 of them, plus preface and epilogue), and his technique is the hook: he ends his chapters with some sort of \\"[gasp!]\\" or \\"dun-dun-DUN!\\" moment, and makes you read a chapter of a separate storyline before you're given more bits of information as you read along. And it gets old after a while, once you pick up on this literary tactic. Some of it also seems a little too contrived or conveniently coincidental. It's almost like you're reading an episode of MURDER SHE WROTE, particularly with all the moments of sudden revelation and betrayal (for example, a character who appears to be helpful and benevolent, but now all of a sudden shows s/he has had his/her own ulterior motives all along), and to the point where you want to yell, \\"Puh-lease! Give me a BREAK!\\" That is what killed it for me, why it was obvious to me that this is a book of fiction, and while it is a well-written story, it can't be taken that seriously. Not any more than you would treat any other book of fiction.
0007165013|5.0|Even though all cecelia's books are my favorite, my heart probably went out to this book the most. Its a great book, no doubt and she took the liberty of penning the story in such a way that it is portrayed in letters, emails, etc. <br />I felt really sad throughout, despite the humor and all. It was relief, to disappointment, to humor, and back to disappointment again. So much hints, so many second chances and all thrown away. This book remain the most realistic to our lives, in my opinion.  <br />A story about two best friends who grew up together, not realising that they were meant for each other all because of a chance that was missed and words left unspoken. They see each other through jobs, marriage, heartbreaks, and alot more. Until when they're finally at their retiring age, do they realise that they do love one another more than anything else in the world.  <br />It saddens me when I comtemplate about the time wasted, and all the words that were dragged on. <br />'Where Rainbows End' is TRULY an endearing tale. <br />If you're the emotional sort, read it and you won't be disappointed.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|That's Right!  Star Wars on DVD.  not Star Wars A New Hope, but  <br />Star Wars....The point is that Lucas says ( in Star Wars Insider) that he is listening to the millions of fans when he made the decision to release the 1977/1980/1983 original versions of the first trilogy films.  A point that seems to be missed by everyone is that although the originals are being released for the first time ever, they are included  as a bonus feature, on disk 2 of a set of DVD's that previously was unavailable separately. The main disk is the previously released SED version, but not collectively boxed as  a 3 title set.  So in a way he has kept his word. The titles still being advertised are, Star Wars: A New Hope, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.  ( Notethat: The Special Edition phrase was removed from the packaging of the 2004 and 2005 packaging)The 1997 versions are in 5.1EX and the extras are presented in Dolby Stereo 2.0 (anyone with Dolby Pro Logic II can still set their receiver to deliver 5.0 sound on a receiver capable of doing 5.1 or better) and to some people who don't own a 5.1 system, they are still going to like it. Also there is the Nostalgia ( No \\"Episode IV - A New Hope\\" that was added to the 1978 re-release)There are also rumors that the originals are not in Widescreen. WELL, truth be told, the discs are being released in both Full and Wide, and it is even noted here on Amazon that even the extras disk is also in Widescreen.  Lucas did say that when SW was re-released on VHS for One Last time, he was speaking the truth in that these new releases will be in 2.0 and no THX, but at the time, DVD was not even a afterthought. DVD technology only came about as the 2nd generation of Philips/Magnavox's CD-i gameing console was playing movies ( Analog CD-quality)on the CD-i players. My suggestion to those of you who won't buy the DVD because you already own the SED DVD, You can always Netflix disk 2, or buy the 2 disk set, and sellyour 1st disk on ebay. If you haven't bought the 3 disk collection in the silver or gold boxes, depending on your preference. ( widescreen - silver, full screen - gold) then hold off on buying until September 12th, when the 2 disk sets come out, tehy are priced at $29.95 but wal-mart (gag!)will probably be selling around $15. If you do decide to buy teh 3 pack set instead, buy the larger ( 4 disk) sets as they have a bonus disk that includes several hours of extras that are not included in last years 3 disk release.
0812975219|3.0|Simply put: This book advocates in favor of the Black Swan theory of probability. This theory states that no amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but that a single observation of a black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion. <br /> <br />For the purposes of Taleb's analysis, he believes that the financial markets misprice the occurence of outlier events. And he goes so far to say (and I concur) that those events where are discounted so heavily, and hence defined as highly unlikely, are the likeliest of all... at some undetermined time in the future.  <br /> <br />For anyone who agrees that the financial markets function to hurt the most people at any given time, then you would agree. This review is being written mid-June 2006 just after an almost 10% correction in the Benchmark indices and an almost 25% correction in the metals and mining complex... following one of th most fantastic runups in recent history.  <br /> <br />Who thinks that Taleb, who buys far OTM puts and calls, made money during this recent set of markets moves? I do.  <br /> <br />I say all of this with ONE qualification: Apply Taleb's strategy when the VIX is at relatively low levels. To sell OTM puts and calls when the VIX is high is to damn yourself to an interminable holding time... the prudent investor does not need to lose such a sum (or as Taleb puts it, \\"Bleed\\") for no reason.  <br /> <br />Happy investing.
B00005JOVH|3.0|Bryan Singer is out of the directors chair from this one and is Rush Hour director Brett Ratner comes into his place. Let me just say this was a great entertaining movie with some script complications but I enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand. It wasnt the best out of the three...X2 being the best. It would of been better if it was just X-Men 3. It left it open for a 4th & 5th. The action scenes were great especially the whole bit with Jean at her house. I liked the scene in the beginning where Wolverine lights his cigar off a burning car...just great.  So the story goes that there is a mutant named Leech played by Cameron Bright  who is a special kind of mutant. He has the ability to revert the mutant gene. So the head honchos jump on this as soon as possible. Jean Grey played by the beautiful Famke Janssen has returned from her watery grave with a bit of a problem. Her other persona Phoenix has come out to play which makes even more things complicated. Magneto played by the always great Ian McKellan joins together his fellow mutants along with Pyro played by Aaron Stanford , Juggernaut played by Vinnie Jones  (\\"I'm the Juggernaut bitch!\\") and so on to go forth and try to stop the humans from trying to turn the mutants into...well...humans and so Wolverine played by the awesome Hugh Jackman and the other X-Men band together to fight or...make a stand. There's old and new faces within the cast. Halle Berry  as Storm, a solid Shawn Ashmore as Bobby/Iceman, Anna Paquin  as Rogue, Rebecca Romijn as Mystique, James Marsden as Cyclops and of course the other great guy Patrick Stewart plays Professor Xavier. The new ones include a fantastic Kelsey Grammer as Beast, Ellen Page as Kitty/Shadowcat and Ben Foster as Warren/ArchAngel. Foster should of had a bigger part. He was still good as was Page. Also starring Bill Duke, Ken Leung, Dania Ramirez, Eric Dane, Olivia Williams, Josef Sommer, Anthony Heald and a cameo by Stan Lee.
B00005JNRY|5.0|\\"Cars\\" is excellent! This is one of the year's best! This is Pixar's first film after winning the Oscar for their previous film \\"The Incredibles\\". This is cute, funny, and heartwarming. John Lasseter's (this is the fourth Pixar pic that Lasseter has directed) directing and Joe Ranft's (who the film is dedicated to) co-directing is excellent! The story by Ranft and Jorgen Klubien (who has also been involved with Pixar's 3 recent films \\"A Bug's Life\\" (1998), \\"Toy Story 2\\" (1999) & \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" (2001) and the screenplay by Phil Lorin, Dan Fogelman, and Kiel Murray (who has also been involved with Pixar's 2 recent films \\"Finding Nemo\\" (2003) & \\"The Incredibles\\" (2004) is excellent! The music by Randy Newman (who won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 2001 for \\"Monsters, Inc.\\") is excellent! The film editing by Ken Schretzmann (who has been involved with 2 Pixar films \\"Toy Story 2\\" & \\"Monsters, Inc.\\") is excellent! The visual design of the film is beautiful and one of the best that I have seen in an CGI-animated film, even from Pixar.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|This movie is severely critized, it deserves it. Nevertheless not everything is awfully bad in this film. Instead of writing an essay type review, I'll point the good and bad things:    THE BAD    - THE FORCED HUMOR. Totally unnecessary, blame it on Paramout, after the success of Star Trek IV, studio absent minded executives demanded and forced humor into the script. Some of it is not that bad (Scotty crashing his head is laughable), but the bad, is BAD, the worst example is Chekov and Sulu lost in the woods.  - BAD FX. Specially at the end of the movie, it degrades the movie making it almost B quality. Blame it again on Paramount, for giving barely away a limited budget.  - ENTERPRISE DAMAGED. With the forced humor, the mighty Enterprise was a helpless victim. Making everything functioning bad in the starship takes away its dignity and makes look the Federation as a bunch of space morons instead of a competent organization.  - THE KLINGON SUBPLOT. Again, the forced humor makes the Klingons look cartoonish and not the powerful warriors that were portrayed in Star Trek III. It would have been much better to avoid it completely and focus more on the story and characters.  - SHATNER'S ACTING. In the bad moments, the worst in all of the ST movies, and perhaps, his carrier!    THE GOOD    - MUSIC SOUNDTRACK. One of the best of the movie series, beautiful. Along with the soundtracks of Star Trek: The Motion Picture and Star Trek II.  - FILM MAIN THEME. The general story is classic ST, the search for God, the ultimate trek. Sadly its execution was poor.  - KIRK/SPOCK/MCCOY TRINITY. This is where we see the characters as true friends and we know them better than ever before. The scene with the three of them and Sybok exposing their pain is a Gem, one of the finest Star Trek moments. I don't find the 'row, row your boat' singing insulting, but can understand the fans that hate it.    This film is only for the true Star Trek fan, although is sometimes painful to watch, it hasits moments not a lot unfortunately, but it stays true to Star Trek as a story, it had a lot of potential. I don't think is the worst Star Trek movie, maybe if its tone was more serious and less comedic, it would be better regarded.
B000E33VWW|2.0|Capote was a disagreeable figure in real life. This film shows the flaws in his character that would grow to mammoth proportions by the end of his life. The problem with this film is that 1) I couldn't understand half of what Hoffman (as Capote) was saying. Hoffman may have his lisping, nasal, girlish speech down pat but that doesn't help the audience. Raising the volume didn't help a bit. The problem was with Capote's poor articulation and low speech intensity. 2) This really isn't very interesting. Story: writer/journalist crosses the line when it comes to ethics and objectivity in order to further his career. What a staggeringly novel concept!! And the story of a murder in Kansas is not international news - it's just a senseless murder in a little town. That Capote lost his objectivity when working on it should bring nothing but a big yawn since it has no historical importance. 3) This movie is dull.  <br />Don't waste your time.
B000FIMG68|3.0|Last season, Lost started out the gate as the show with the most buzz. This fake Survivor type show was full of interesting and diverse characters, intertwining flashbacks, and a mysterious island that was a character unto itself. All along the journey first season, we were surprised and shocked at all the twists and turns in the flashbacks and on the island, the biggest being that Locke was in a wheelchair at the time of departure. But something happened last season that too most of the wind out of the Lost sail, namely the finale. If the first season moved at breakneck pace, the finale slogged along for three hours as we sat and said, \\"Just go down the hatch already.\\" We had to put up with boring flashbacks of the survivors as the prep for the plane along with a long and boring montage of them actually boarding the plane only to have the last image of the season being a group looking down the hatch. <br /> <br />So after a summer of complaining, the people over at Lost gave us what we wanted right off the bat, not that we knew what we were looking at. When the castaways finally descended into the hatch, we got to see it in three straight episodes, once from Jack's perspective, along with Locke's and Kate's. I was surprised we didn't get to see it for a fourth time in Desmond's flashback. And since this was the season of see the same thing over again. We also got to see the second confrontation with Zeke, Jin reuniting with Sawyer and Michael on the beach, and the token hot chick's death scene more than once. <br /> <br />Unfortunately season started off much like the season one finale ended where we sat around waiting for something to happen as we sit threw flashbacks that are not all that interesting. Then when something actually did happen, it was either was pretty obvious like the token hot chick dieing, or I just stopped caring a long time ago like learning how the plane crashed. And now that characters are getting their third and fourth flashbacks, they justseem less interesting. Then there was the Rose and Bernard flashback which had to be the most boring one yet. Yeah, the island has healing powers; I got that with the first Locke flashback. C'mon, couldn't we have a Rousseau, Libby, or even an Others flashback? <br /> <br />But as the season progress, it did get a little better and that was all due to the inclusion of Not-Henry Gale. Yeah, it was pretty obvious from the get go that Not-Henry was an Other, but that didn't stop his character from being interesting as he tried to drive a wedge between Jack and Locke. And who knew that when he reunited with Zeke and the boys that they could be so funny but I find it interesting as the Other's revealed each other's names, we still didn't learn Not-Henry's. And even though he looked to be in charge on the pier, I'm still not sold on Not-Henry being Him. <br /> <br />The second finale seemed like a new show onto itself as we learn more about Desmond, a character we barely got to know before he left. Then we get longer glances at the Others and we see them interact as well as new setting including the giant foot that I'm surprised why everyone is so hung up on the four toes thing. Then there was the last scene, where we got the first look at the outside world with the Artic station and the call to Desmond's former girlfriend. But with Lost, we were left with many unanswered questions as well as the answers (well, at least my speculation): <br /> <br /> <br />- Why did the Others want Jack, Kate, and Sawyer? (They were the one's who went after Michael, but they don't want Locke because of his former paralysis) <br /> <br />- What's with the giant four toed foot? (It was built by Polynesians that lived, or still live, on the island and only put four toes because they are lazy.) <br /> <br />- Who is Him? (Penny's daddy) <br /> <br /> <br />- What was with the bright light and loud noise? (The island resetting large electrical charge.) <br /> <br />- What are the fates of Locke, Eko, and Desmond? (Alive, alive, and alive.) <br /> <br />- Why was Libby in the mental institution? (The death of her husband sent her into a deep depression.) <br /> <br />- What happen to Cindy, the flight attendant? (Was captured by the Others) <br /> <br />- What's up with the Hanso Foundation and Dharma Initiative? (I think I need to watch the orientation films again.) <br /> <br />- Who's Sun's baby daddy? (Artificial inseminated, sperm donor - Zeke) <br /> <br />- Who did Carol Vessey leave Jack for? (Um, Ed maybe?) <br /> <br />- Why did the others let Walt leave after doing so much to get him? (Much like Desmond, they know he will be back.) <br /> <br />- Who eyeball was in the tailies' hatch? (Some one we haven't met) <br /> <br /> <br />Oh and course, there are still these unanswered questions from last year (with some revised answers from what I originally thought at the end of last season): <br /> <br />- How did Locke get in the wheelchair? (Shot by his dad after stalking him.) <br /> <br />- What is the monster? (A Hanzo experiment gone wrong.) <br /> <br />- Why did the fortune teller change his mind about Claire keeping her baby? (He was paid off by the Others.) <br /> <br />- How did Jack single handedly beat up Ethan Rom after be beaten like a red headed step child days earlier? (Ethan let him win.) <br /> <br />- Why would Sayid hook up with Shannon after being so close to finding his true love? (I, personally forget about any past loves if I had a chance with Shannon.) <br /> <br />- What's with the numbers? (Just a way to connect everyone and everything.) <br /> <br />- What did the French chick say to Hurley to calm him down? (Gave him some French lovin') <br /> <br />- Why did Claire name here kid Aaron? If she lost all her memory, what could the significance of this be? (I think the writers screwed up.) <br /> <br />- What did the Others want with Walt? (He can control the monster.)
B00005KK4P|4.0|You'd be hard pressed to find a better performance of all Schubert's 8 Symphonies than the ones in this very well designed and packaged box set by Karl Bohm and the Berlin Philharmonic.  The only knock on this collection is that the sound quality, although listed at ADD standard isn't the best.  This can be attributed to the analog master and the age of the recordings but I have heard worse like disc 2 of the similar Mendelssohn package.  Still, this is overall a worthwhile package to get for all Schubert fans.  Recommended.
B0002X314C|5.0|Get Lifted is probably the best RnB album of the last 3 years, I don't think Usher's confessions really offers the same consistency and quality despite going 9xplatinum but figures don't always tell the truth because John Legend is a real artist and not an entertainer... Confessions wouldn't sell more than 500,000 copies in the hands of Brian Mcknight or Joe... it's full of fillers but gets overrated because of huge marketing. Get lifted is a truly a masterpiece and beleive me there's not a single track you can afford skipping coz every song here is powerful on its own. However, this is not the case with the 'Emancipation of Mimmi\\" or \\"Confessions\\"...<br /><br />\\"Ordinary people\\" is such a simple track but it's lyrics and John Legend voice just makes it a soulfood. The last time I liked a simple song was in 2002 when I heard Fallin by A. Keys. The album has two other accoustic, simple but amazing tracks, \\"Stay with you\\" for which J legend won a grammy and \\"So high\\" whith its simple but amazing lyrics ... \\"when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far and we can't get much closer to God than where we are...\\". The gospel inspired \\"It don't have to change\\" belongs in the same category. John Legend delivers great music with amazing simplicity.<br /><br />\\"Get lifted\\" has uptempo tracks with the involvement of his friend and mentor Kanye West who helps with his rich production skills on the Rnb/hiphop mix \\"I can change\\" feat Snoop Dogg, the crazy & funny \\"Get lifted\\" and the big hit \\"Number one\\".<br /><br />With this album John Legend proves he's a great songwriter, he can also play piano, he's really a consumate artist.<br /><br />2.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|If you want a laugh, click on the 'lowest ratings first' button and read the one star reviews where everyone pretends they aren't offended. <br /> <br />Seriously this film, and particularly the d*cks, p*ssys, *ssh*le speech made more sense than any of the politicians and left/right extremeists ever do. DON'T YOU GET IT THERE'S NO HIDDEN AGENDA. THEY'RE JUST TAKING THE P*SS OUT OF ALL OF YOU BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY! And so is this film, watch it.
B00005JP4U|3.0|Al Gore, the former Democratic candidate for President in 2000 who caved-in to Adolf Bush's theft of the Presidency like Kerry caved-in 4 years later over Ohio (much to the chagrin of many gob-smacked Democrats), has noticed that our planet is getting warmer.  How percipient!  Actually, until there are alligators lurking about the swamps in Minnesota again, our planet will continue its rise from the Ice Age.  Until we reach our previously normal temperatures prior to that meteor putting us into the Ice Age, our planet will continue to get warmer until it is back to normal.<br /><br />What Gore has done in this sensationalized movie that pretends to be a documentary, is to attempt to frighten us about the planet returning to normal.  When he's not campaigning as a political candidate - telling us about his son's brush with death and his sister's death from cancer - he says global warming is not normal; he says our planet is dying.  Rather than celebrate our planet's return from the Ice Age and alligators' eventual return in the future to the swamps of Minnesota, Gore says that ever-increasing carbon-dioxide emissions are scorching the earth.  Changing weather patterns are blamed on man and his machines rather than being accredited to our planet's on-going return from the Ice Age.  Like Chicken Licken crying that the \\"Sky is Falling\\", Gore is telling us that the planet is dying - Soylent Green fashion.<br /><br />Gore says \\"Too many people go directly from denial to despair.  They don't stop to think what can I do about it?\\"  He may be right, but global warming has been going on ever since our rise from the Ice Age.  Nobody can stop global warming - it is a natural response by our planet to get itself out of the Ice Age, which a meteor is to blame for making our planet so cold in the first place.  Until we return to normal, earth will continue to warm.  And politicians will continue to scare us. And Doom-sayers will continue to warn of impending Armageddon.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Again, Tool brings us genious.  Make sure you listen to this album more than twice before you make a decision about it.  Tool is a modern equivolent of a band like the Beatles that reinvents their own genre of music each time they release a set.  Great album, though the one drawback might be the length of many of the songs which can be a turn-off to many people.  Doesn't really bother me, but I want to be honest about it.
0060537639|4.0|As many of you are reading other reviews that say this book is a pack of lies, I will tell you to read the book before you believe this. This book is very believable NONFICTION (910.951 in the dewey decimal system).  <br /> <br />The book starts out with a history of China from about 1415-1421 with the building of the Forbidden City, repairing the great wall, etc. Then the book talks about 4 differant armadas under Zheng He. Then he wraps up the book with the Chinese influence over the European explorers.  <br /> <br />One of the major pieces of evidence this book uses is maps of the  1400s and journels from Columbus, Magellan, and de Gama. <br /> <br />This book is extrememly well researched. The author spent 15 years researching the topics. The bibliography is 25 pages long.  <br /> <br />The only problem I have with the book is the author's style. He uses a lot of 1st person pronouns to tell (unrelated) stories about his time in the navy. <br /> <br />The book has a website at [...] that has a lot of good information with more up-to-date facts from the book.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I have watched this 3 times.  Each time I am more deeply moved.  The heartbreak, the sincerity, lonileness, greatest love of all, next to that of man for God, that of man for man.  Sex is just a passing expression of the great depth of devotion and need.  A story of love, not a story of lust.<br />Jim
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Firstly, I have been a huge fan since the beginning of the Chilli Peppers, and I have witnessed their change. Before they used to put socks on their privates and dance around. They then went into a little more mellow music and then with the release of Californication, introduced the newest Red Hot Chilli Peppers the subtle band, willing to make good music. People are criticizng this album because its not like the others, but if you think of it, it is. Its a great album. Heres the break through <br /> <br />#1: Dani California (7.0/10) - This song starts out with a driving drum part and from there on it provides the listener with some ear-candy. However, definately not the best work on the first cd.  <br /> <br />#2: Snow (9.5/10)- This song quickly puts to rest all disuptes about the RHCP's new album. The guitar seemlessly meets the ears, and for a second you feel like your in music heaven. The intro guitar riff is matched with Keidis' great vocals. This song is worth the whole first cd. <br /> <br />#3: Charlie (8.5/10) - This song starts out with a almost horrible beggining. The funkiness is appreciated, but the sound of Flea's bass in the beggining doesnt seem to match the mood that Snow ended on. When the verse starts slowly the song gets to you, but its the chorus which makes the song amazing. With almost  orgasmic beauty, the chorus makes up for the deficiencies of the song. The guitar leads up and then BAM!. Nice riffs by Frusciante, overall good song. The funkyness works after one gets used to it.  <br /> <br />#4: Stadium Arcadium (8.0/10) - This song is pleasant to listen to, and may have some whistling. Its not a bad song, but lacks the star quality that Snow and Charlie bring.  <br /> <br />#5: Hump De Bump (6.5/10) - One of the weaker tracks on the cd in my opinion. It's a great individual track, and again the funk works, but it doesn't fit the mood. However don't be surprised if its ringing in your head later.  <br /> <br />#6: She's only 18 (6.0/10) -Keidis' vocals are sub par mediocre, not a great track, but some may like it. Not much to say about it. <br /> <br />#7: Slow Cheetah (9.0/10) - This song is phenomenal. The acoustic set may raise some eyebrows for previous Chilli Pepper fans, but soon Keidis' vocals make up for the change. Simply stunning, definately the chorus. Nice ending as well. Great Track. <br /> <br />#8: Torture Me (7.0/10) - Nice Song, again not much to real comment on. Pretty Normal.  <br /> <br />#9: Strip My Mind (8.5/10) - Great Song. The beginning is pretty boring, but the lyrics are pretty nice. Also it has a catchy little tune. It may not connect to some, but for me I enjoyed it.  <br /> <br />#10: Especially in Michigan (10/10) - The best song on the first  side, this song gets off on the right start, and from there it simply takes people's breath away. Even though it's loud, keep listening, the chorus is simply amazing. Make sure to listen to this.  <br /> <br />#11: Warlocks (8/10) - This is a nice song, keeps to the whole idea that the chilli peppers rock. Another strong song. <br /> <br />#12: C'mon Girl (8.5/10) - Being a bassist, I was willing to give this song a 10 just because of its begginning, however I didn't really like the chorus much. Still great. <br /> <br />#13: Wet Sand (7.5/10)- Sweet Song <br /> <br />#14: Hey (7.5/10) - Another good song to finish off the cd.  <br /> <br />Altogether, the album features in my opinion four great songs: snow, charlie, slow cheetah, especialy in michigan, the latter being the best. however, its music ranges, so others songs may appeal. Its worth the buy definately considering that this ablum could be the greatest hits compilation for any other band.
B000059ZLH|4.0|If your a fan of progressive rock, you probably already know how good this CD is. In my mind it is the single greatest CD of all time (followed closely by Operation Mindcrime, any of the great Pink Floyd and Rush records) <br /> <br />My only complaint on this DVD, is the sound. I was at this show and the sound at the theater was great. Somewhere, it didn't transfer to the recording. It is not the worst thing I have ever heard, but it doesn't show the bands power live.  <br /> <br />Every other aspect of this DVD is well worth the price. I would not want to be with out it.
0060922583|4.0|In the introduction, the author clarifies terms like Holographic Universe, and concepts like the holographic analogy, metaphor or paradigm. The physicist Bohm and the quantum physicist Pribram are the originators of the idea. In this book, the theories and the conclusions of many researchers influenced by the holographic model and its interpretations are explored. Talbot warns that some interpretations are controversial and the book indeed strays into highly esoteric territory.<br /><br />Part One: A Remarkable New View of Reality, looks at the work of Pribram and Bohm and how these two scientists teamed up. These two chapters, The Brain as Hologram and The Cosmos as Hologram, examines the vastness of memory, associative memories, photographic memory, phantom limb sensations, the transference of learnt skills and our amazing ability to recall, forget and recognize familiar things.<br /><br />Part Two: Mind and Body, investigates the holographic model in psychology, the body, miracles and in the ability to see holographically. Phenomena like dreams, psychosis, lucid dreaming and holographic therapy are examined, with reference to the work of Stanislav Grof amongst others. The section on healing deals inter alia with the work of pioneers like Dr Carl Simonton and Larry Dossey, with emphasis on conscious and unconscious beliefs, acupuncture and the use of imagery (visualization).<br /><br />In the chapter: A Pocketful of Miracles, there are discussions of psychokinesis, the kahunas of Hawaii, the work of Carlos Castaneda and the question of whether consciousness creates subatomic particles. The next chapter explores research on the human energy field, the energy field of the psyche, the aura and the chakras, x-ray vision and the altered states of shamanism.<br /><br />Part Three: Space and Time, attempts to apply the holographic model to clairvoyance, retrocognition, ghosts and apparitions. It also explores the possibility of a holographic past and future and of thought as the creator of reality. Out-of-Body experiences, Near-Death experiences and their holographic explanation are discussed and there is an interesting section on the famous mystic Swedenborg. This part also looks at a variety of phenomena like Marian appearances, UFO's, the results of taking the herb ayahuasca and various shamanic experiences.<br /><br />The chapter Return to Dreamtime revisits Bohm's idea of the implicate and explicate order and compares it to Tibetan Buddhism, Zen and Hinduism. In the next one: The Future of the Holographic Idea, the author investigates holographic sound with reference to the physiologist Hugo Zuccarelli, and speculates on the implications for science of the holographic paradigm. Amongst them are new kinds of computers and puzzles in chemistry that might finally be solved. The model might be able to eventually explain telepathy, synchronicity, paranormal and mystical experiences. The text concludes with Talbot's view of mankind's evolutionay thrust towards a higher consciousness.<br /><br />The book contains voluminous notes arranged by chapter, and an index. The text is well-documented. The only problem is that there are repetitive accounts of well-known historical paranormal experiences that are already very familiar from the literature. Overall, The Holographic Universe contains enough purely scientific information to serve as a starting point, but it will appeal more to those who are into the metaphysical and spiritual side of things.re and of thought as the creator of reality.

B00000DC7L|4.0|Now being a HUGE Brian May fan, i must say this is a fine piece of work for someone with such talent as Brian May. I must say, that his guitar playing is, as always, wonderful, spectacular!!!! etc etc. But I must say it isnt his best. Back To the light is a little better, on the other hand, then Another World. Though it is a good album, it is lacking! Brian May, may not posses huge singing skills sing like Freddie Mercury, but he can sure damn well play guitar! For die-hard Queen fans,like me, this is a treasure! <br /> <br />From a fan...
B0001LJC2K|5.0|What an album. This is Muse at their nihilistic best. Writing this shortly before the July 3rd release of their new album \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\", I can't help feeling a sense of slight trepidation: will the new, apparently more \\"poppy\\" Muse stay true to their roots? That's what inspired me to set down my thoughts on Absolution.    1. Intro  This 22 second instrumental sets the theme perfectly. The pounding, seemingly \\"approaching\\" the listener, recalls something primal, something monolithic. We are prepared for darkness- and darkness we will get.    2. Apocalypse Please  A beautiful piece of operatic rock. Droning vocals mix with a classical driving piano line to create a gloriously significant song. Once again, Bellamy prepares us for \\"something biblical\\", an event of such profound importance that we can't help being afraid.    3. Time Is Running Out  A seminal work and a fan favourite. An intensely catchy bass-and-click line is followed by an increasingly urgent Muse classic. In keeping with the theme of apocalypse, \\"time is running out\\" is powerful and menacing. The song peaks several times, not least with the harrowing line \\"how did it come this?\\"    4. Sing for Absolution  This initially subdued song turns into a frenzied masterpiece. This is the most apocalyptic song on the album. One reviewer (who will always remain immortal in my mind) described it as \\"the sound of church bells crying and a thousand ambulances falling from the sky\\". Exactly. This song is about praying before the imminent end. It's not urgent, it's beatifully mournful and each note is laced with regret.    5. Stockholm Syndrome  Frenzied, brilliant. This is Muse at their most operatic. The chorus reaches new heights and the harmonisation is magnificent. The oddly dreamy keyboard effect really captures the idea of falling in love with someone who does you harm (as we see in the US video, in which a cheesy whiter-than-white TV show audience is corrupted by the powerful but evil sounds ofthe song). This song is at once depressing and immensely uplifting. Top notch.    6. Falling Away  It's back to the end of the world for this initially quiet song that grinds its way to a beatiful, emotional climax. Lovely. The video-gameesque themes add lots to the song, the intensity of which, as the title suggests, falls away. This song captures the sadness of destruction and disorder.    7. Interlude  Just that, really. A well-worked, tuneful, 37 piece. Nicely distorted guitar work and harmonisation to boot.    8. Hysteria  A crunching, brilliant, monster of a song. Menacing guitar lines precede more falsetto followed by some of Bellamy's strongest vocals on the album. A change of pace and the song is back on track. Lovely. Understandably, another fan favourite. This was received with rapturous applause when they used it to open at Glastonbury in '04.    9. Blackout  A genuinely quiet song for once! Maybe a good idea after the deafening brilliance of Hysteria. Meaningful and morose, with great harmonies kicking in after about 1:24. The violins rise and fall with Bellamy's voice. A great interval of a track, and one that suggests that (unlike most metal bands), Muse don't mind showing a sensitive side.    10. Butterflies & Hurricanes  More Operock! Heavy on the harmonies from the start, this song is immensely uplifting with an invigorating driving piano line and an urgent message (\\"you've got to change the world\\"). This song is intense and, save the minute or so that serves as the \\"calm before the storm\\" nearish the end, scarsely relents. Finished off by a wonderful rachmaninoffesque/wagnerian piano solo building into a final cathartic climax. My favourite song on the album. The frenetic and urgent final minute is supreme.    11. The Small Print  This song is about Faust (an early Christian German legend about a man who sells his soul to the Devil, adapted and immortalised by Goethe into a troubled man who sells all for success). Hence \\"I'm the priest God neverpaid\\" and more lines about possession, loss etc. The song is devilishly clever, and the guitar lines are suitably menacing. More classic metal than many of the others in this album, but it's a refreshing and unique song. Very nice. Just remember: always read The Small Print- Muse exhort the listener to take the advantage of one poor Teuton who didn't.    12.Endlessly  Beatiful, warm, synth lines curve over this song with a strongly artificial operatic falsetto creeping in at opportune moments. A profound, lonely song. More perfectly crafted angst from a band that obviously have a lot on their collective minds. Relatively short compared to a lot of the songs on the album. It's deceptively simple, intense stuff.    13.Thoughts of a Dying Atheist.  Ay, there's the rub. What happens when we shuffle off this mortal coil? Hamlet's dilemma. To sleep, perchance to dream. \\"Thoughts\\" expresses the same fear of venturing into the unknown. The line \\"It scares the Hell out of me\\" captures perfectly this fear. If you renounce God all his life, what happens if you come face to face with him? Do you \\"look through a faithless eye\\"? (great line...)    14.Ruled By Secrecy  Once again, Muse prove that they make rock for clever people. The title of the song is adapted from that of Jim Marrs' \\"Rule By Secrecy\\"- the mother of all conspiracy theories, a book that contains ideas ranging from the Freemasons to psycho-electric mind control. Thus the enigmatic, complex beginning. The song rises to a beautiful classical piano solo by the ever-impressive and multi-talented Bellamy. The album ends with a suitably obscure but awesomely emotional piece.
0156027321|4.0|It would be fair to say that \\"Life of Pi\\" is unlike any other book I've ever read.  Fantastic - yet utterly believable.  Vaguely reminiscent of a combination of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" and \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" in its own quirky way.  Even sections containing the most serious of subject matter are written with a wry, ironic tone.  Enjoyable from cover to cover.  Everyone should read it.
0679721037|5.0|It's pretty impressive to think that a book like \\"Hiroshima\\" was written, and appreciated, less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped.  John Hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the Atomic Age.<br /><br />Interviewing six survivors, Hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city.  Pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not.  The color of your clothing means everything.  White clothes reflect the heat, while dark clothing absorbs it.  Even if you survive the initial blast, what you see next might make you wish you hadn't.  But human beings are stubborn creatures, and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances.<br /><br />I have been to the Hiroshima Peace Park several times, and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal.  It is a humbling experience, and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes.  Hersey's book has a similar impact, being told in such a clinical, observational writing style that you can't help but be moved by the reality of it all.<br /><br />My one criticism of \\"Hiroshima\\" is the cast of characters that Hersey chose to showcase.  For some reason, they seem to be largely Christian, including a German Jesuit priest and a Japanese Methodist minister.  With Christians being such a tiny percentage of the Japanese population, considerably less than 1%, the choice to interview Japanese Christians seems a deliberate one.  Hersey is telling the largely-Christian US readers, \\"See? They aren't heathen devils.  They are Christians, just like you and me.  That's who we dropped the bomb on. That's who we killed.\\"  This puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book, and has Hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I've been eagerly anticipating this album for several months now. A long time Three Days Grace fan, I've listened to their debut CD countless times. I wanted their next CD to be familiar yet matured, which I think every band should try to do, and Three Days Grace has not disappointed me here. The album is not as heavy as their first album, at least not in my opinion, there are more softer songs on it. The songs are about stuff you can hear from pretty much every rock band, yet it manages to sound fresh and cool nonetheless.  <br /> <br />Here is my breakdown of the CD: <br /> <br />01.) \\"It's All Over\\" - 9/10 - A song about drug abuse and addiction. Everyone does this but the music in the song is great, and it's a good way to start out the album. <br /> <br />02.) \\"Pain\\" - 10/10 - Hmm, this song is either about self-harm or kinky sex. Whatever it's about, it's cool, although if you go with the self-harm meaning it's kinda...morbid. But the music rocks, the way the lyrics are delivered is cool, it just has an upbeat and youthful vibe to it, despite it's negative lyrics. Everyone seems to love this song, going by online discussion. This will probably be their next single, and I'm sure it will be successful. <br /> <br />03.) \\"Animal I Have Become\\" - 10/10 - I've listened to it constantly since it was released online several months ago and it's still not old. This song sounds the most like the stuff found on their first CD. The beat is incredibly intoxicating. <br /> <br />04.) \\"Never to Late\\" - 11/10 - The more I listen, the more I love. This is a softer song that totally RULES. It's hard to describe, but it sounds so personal, like the singer is talking to someone specific. It really strikes a chord within me and I can find it so relatable, but I do. not. know. why. Whenever I listen to it I get goosebumps and I get this sad feeling...it's just a great song. <br /> <br />05.) \\"On My Own\\" - 9.5/10 - A song about being left alone when your lies seperate you from the person you love. The verses are softer and sort of sad, while the chorus is harder and more rock...it's nice.  <br /> <br />06.) \\"Riot\\" - 10/10 - Wow, this song is so friggin' awesome. Was my favorite for a few days before I fell so in love with \\"Never Too Late\\". A rather simple song. \\"Let's start a riot\\", but it's the kind of thing that just pulls you in, grabs you, and doesn't let you go. Excellent excellent rock song. <br /> <br />07.) \\"Get Out Alive\\" - 10/10 - Yet another perfect song. The first two verses are amazing. No idea what the song is about, but I love EVERYTHING about it.  <br /> <br />08.) \\"Let it Die\\" - 9/10 - I assume this song is about falling out of love. The song is pretty catchy and is delivered nicely, it's the kind of song you can listen to several times over and over without getting sick of it. <br /> <br />09.) \\"Over and Over\\" - 8/10 - A beautiful song, and a very different one for the band, but it's just not my favorite, although I do like it. <br /> <br />10.) \\"Time of Dying\\" - 10/10 - The last great song on the CD. A song about surviving, either metaphorically or literally. Just a cool song, I like listening to it. <br /> <br />11.) \\"Gone Forever\\" - 7/10 - It's a beautiful song but I can't connect with it. The chorus is the best part. <br /> <br />12.) \\"One-X\\" - 6/10 - My least favorite song on the album. It's not bad, but boring compared to the rest of the CD, I usually just skip it. <br /> <br />Overall, the songs I rated 10/10 are great enough to keep this CD at five stars. Three Days Grace has delivered a great album and I hope it's not three years for the NEXT CD.
B000000LZV|5.0|This is the greatest album of all time. I am nearly 40 years old now, and have listend to Double Nickels hundreds of times, but each time I listen the album unveils new levels of depth, richness, passion and fury. There is no other album close to this on planet earth.<br /><br />My praise might sound extreme? This album changed my life, how I listened to music, and most of all: how I lived life. This album is life, and everything that is good about being an air breather.<br /><br />D. Boon. Mike and Hurley. Thank you. Meet you on the other side.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|If you're a fan of vampires, werewolves, action, or gothic suspense, this is probably a movie you'd be interested in checking out. While it's not a groundbreaking film, it's a highly entertaining one, and one that, for me, is something I can rewatch several times per year. <br /> <br />The filming is very attractive. Everything is dark, yet not so dark you can't see what's going on. The movie has a gothic look to it - from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting. (Please don't mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle.) The music, mostly heavy rock, fits in well with the movie. And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch. The movie uses several techniques made popular by \\"The Matrix\\", but who cares? It works perfectly within this movie. <br /> <br />The only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor...there's not a single joke in the entire thing! Everything is so serious and dark that unless you're in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down...that's how heavy it is. <br /> <br />As for the set. The added scenes provide more insight, and the special features are a treat, especially the 45-minute documentary \\"Fang vs. Fiction\\", which talks about vampires and werewolves. It was very intriguing. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of this movie and you own the DVD already, I would recommend selling it and buying this version, it's worth the money.
B0000844I8|1.0|I love Stargate, and give the movie 5 stars. I own a VHS copy, and have watched it many times.<br /><br />With that said this \\"Ultimate Edition\\" is not ultimate at all. There are no real special features. The documentary is a cheesy one that explores if there is a real stargate, but there are no...NO...behind the scenes/making of Star Gate insights at all. This documentary has nothing to do with the cast/crew/design/production of the movie. This does not, by any means, make this DVD ultimate. This DVD edition isn't ultimate at all, but extremely mediocre.<br /><br />The only special feature on this disk is a producer/director audio commentary that can run during the movie. That's it. Really. No kidding.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Now THIS is a great movie! I watch it every chance I get! It has <br />something for everyone! <br /> <br />I think SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE goes right to the top of my list for <br />best action/adventure/comedy/romance/family film I've ever seen! <br />Of course, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA is the best but SUPERMAN:THE <br />MOVIE comes in an awfully close second! <br /> <br />There is a brief scene where it shows baby superman nude. but <br />that's only on the VHS! The DVD doesn't show that, thankfully. <br /> <br />I recommend it to all families! <br /> <br />
B000000M4M|5.0|This album, along with Double Nickels by the Minutemen, and all albums by the Replacements changed how I listened to, and appreciated music. J. Mascis is an incredibly unique guitar player. There is no one on earth similiar to him in style and grace. I hope that on the other side his solos roar on for eons.
B00065U08Q|2.0|After The Will to Death, I was convinced that John Frusciante is a god. His solo albums like Shadows Collide With People, Curtains, Will to Death, and Inside of Emptiness are so great that they get rotations in my CD player, and on my iPod every week. This album, well, it doesn't get too many plays because it just isn't as good as the rest of this amazing man's albums. <br /> <br />2 stars for two good tracks: Sphere, My Life.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I was drawn to this album do to some of it's tracks; but I love it for the body of work it is.  From a very punkish sound, this is a sophisticated accomplishmet.  When you get it, listen to it from start to finish as soon as you can, appreiciate the work they did on this. <br /> <br />That and this tune rocks.
B000067CPX|5.0|Okay, so you prefer the old, funky Red Hot Chili Peppers albums like Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and Freaky Styley. That still does not mean By the Way is an excellent album. There isn't a single bad track on this CD. It is much different, but more mature effort than the Red Hot Chili Peppers' earlier music, and I love it. It also does have some funky tracks: the title track, Throw Away Your Television, and Can't Stop are hints at some of their older stuff and some of their newer music as well. <br /> <br />Standout tracks: By the Way, Universally Speaking, This is the Place, Dosed, Can't Stop, Throw Away Your Television, Tear, On Mercury, Venice Queen.
B00005R62K|5.0|I first heard Stained Class on 8-track about 25 yrs ago and since then it is engrained into my soul. Stained class has a classic heavy metal sound that is like no other and it fits perfectly.  <br /> <br />The guitar work by Glen Tipton and KK Downing is Masterful and the guitar sound is different from any other guitar sound from any other Priest album. It's awsome! The only way I can describe the sound is, \\"Classic\\".  <br /> <br />I Remember years ago Guitar Center had a radio add and during the add in the background was a guitar solo from one the songs from this album. Rob halford's vocals are impeccable and engaging!  <br /> <br />For those who have not heard this album and are considering buying it, If you like high energy heavy metal with great guitars and superior vocals; you've got a winner in Stained Class! Most of the songs aren't the type that jump out and give you that top 40 hit feeling, but they stand on their own!  <br /> <br />If you're the type listener that likes to go a little deeper then your in for a treat! This work will inspire you the more you listen to it. No Other Sound Like It! One of my favorite Priest Albums! <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Many people will disagree with me here, but I think this is Tool's most mature effort, and it has some of their finest songs. The filler does not retract from all the great songs on this album. Danny Carrey and Maynard James Keenan really shine on 10,000 Days. Just listen to Maynard's wide vocal range on \\"The Pot\\" and \\"Right in Two\\". This album is downright crazy on some songs, especilly in \\"Rosetta Stoned\\". But most of all, the lyrics on the title track are some of Tool's most mature to date, it is about Maynard's mother, Judith Marie Garrison. I am glad Tool have decided to make a record like 10,000 Days. It is a personal work, and I always thought that personal works have a much stronger impact on me. <br /> <br />Vicarious - 10/10; a fantastic opening track! <br />Jambi - 10/10; one of the finest tracks on the album with a great opening guitar riff. <br />Wings for Marie (Part 1) - 9/10; a set-up for the next monster of a track... <br />10,000 Days (Wings Part 2) - 10/10; this is my favorite song on the album. <br />The Pot - 10/10; I love Maynard's vocals at the beginning of this song. <br />Lipan Conjuring - 7/10; one freaky minute of chanting, or whatever is going on here! <br />Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman) - 5/10; this album would have been better off without this. <br />Rosetta Stoned - 10/10; another monster of a track, an eleven minute one at that! A very experimental track. <br />Intension - 8/10; not a bad song by any means, but it kind of loses its luster after a while. <br />Right in Two - 10/10; very awesome track with great lyrics. <br />Viginti Tres - 6/10; the last track on the album, and while it does qualify as \\"filler\\", I think it ends the album perfectly. <br /> <br />Overall, if you REALLY like Tool, you will definitely love 10,000 Days. Shame on all of you for reducing this album down to 4 stars average! Definitely recommended.
B00008LDPU|5.0|All three of the live-action \\"Matrix\\" films were at least good, but the best thing to ever come out of the Matrix concept is \\"The Animatrix\\", a collaborative effort by some of the best animation talents from America, Japan, and South Korea that presents a number of shorts taking place in the Matrix universe, some of them before the live-action movies and others concurrent with them, including some that fill in spaces between \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\". <br /> <br />   This is an anime regardless of what part of the world it has its genesis in, and it's one of the greatest animes of all time.  The individual tales are done in a widely contrasting array of animated styles, and represent a high point for science fiction as a whole.  Taken in its entirety, \\"The Animatrix\\" is philosophical, awesome, sexy, thrilling, moving and frightening.  \\"The Second Renaissance\\", Parts I & II, are especially noteworthy because they're the kind of story and the kind of angle that science fiction has needed to address for a long time.  These segments tell the full origin of the world of the Matrix, from a point in the near future right through the final war, largely from the machines's point of view.  If you've ever wondered why so many big SF action movies present a world in which mankind has created sentient machines, know they're sentient, continues to treat them like slaves, and yet we're Still supposed to view the machines as the bad guys when they strike back, then you're going to love the 'Second Renaissance' segments.  Humanity's behavior in the early portions of the man-machine difficulties is terrifyingly believable. <br /> <br />   Inside the Matrix System, \\"Beyond\\" is a huge standout, a gorgeously animated tale that moves from classic anime territory ( a girl searching for a cat in a haunted house) into dark Matrix territory, and in the devastated Earth outside the Matrix, the stunning 'Matriculated' is a powerful and amazingly imaginative new look at the world, the minds of the machine scouts, and the whole nature of perception, to name just a few of the angles in this one segment. <br /> <br />   All of the stories feature excellent animation, some of them including some of the best astonishing visual images ever seen on film.  To science fiction, \\"The Animatrix\\" is as essential as the likes of \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Solaris\\", and to anime it's as essential as such greats as \\"Spirited Away\\" (although \\"Animatrix\\" isn't for young children) or \\"Princess Mononoke\\".
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Who are all these negative reviewers?  Are we even talking about the same movie here?  Personally, I liked the '95 BBC version (loved Colin Firth)...I must have, I sat through hours and hours of it.  BUT, this P&P version is much, much better, it is visually exquisite!  Everything about it is supremely perfect --the cinematography (glorious), the musical score (fabulous), and the cast of actors (incomparable).  All the actors did a fantastic job -special mention for Brenda Blethyn who even made me like Mrs. Bennet (disliked Mrs. Bennet in the BBC production, she was a dingbat in that one).  Tom Hollander was great as Mr. Collins, and the Bennet girls, adorable.  Kudos to Joe Wright for casting Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen in the lead roles.  FINALLY, a Lizzie and Darcy who are the ages they are SUPPOSED TO BE, and actually look it  (I couldn't say that about the BBC version, and Greer Garson was 36-yrs old when she played Lizzie in the Hollywood version...36??!!!?? OMG).    The 2 lead roles I saved for last because their onscreen chemistry literally scorched the screen and they are, ultimately, what made this movie unforgettable.  Keira was amazing, luminous -she inhabited the role so completely, that she made you forget how ethereally beautiful she really is and made you believe that Lizzie's true beauty was one that came from within.    Matthew MacFadyen...he turned the rain and the early morning mist into erotic scenery; the nuances he injected in playing a conflicted Darcy was phenomenal, and as stunning as Keira is, THIS Mr. Darcy will hijack your heart, and nothing will ever be the same again.
B00005RHGK|5.0|\\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is one of the ultimate horror movies, scary, awe-inspiring, emotionally powerful, and outstandingly made.  Like its sequel, it's the kind of movie that starts off extremely strong and compelling, and doesn't lag for a single second, right through the end credits.  What it starts out with is a brother and sister driving across the prairielands on a crosscountry trip home during a college break, when they encounter something dark, sinister, and dangerous, but which they're left compelled to investigate because of the simple fear that others may be in deep danger if they don't.  What they encounter is the Creeper, and his lair; and one of the most inventive and flat-out awesome of all horror mythologies to ever spring out fully formed upon the screen.  Twists and turns abound, all of them superbly played out.  Excellent characterization, cinematography, and special effects.  An all-time great.
0345350499|5.0|I first read this book about 14 years ago when I was undergoing my own spiritual battle.  I had been raised christian, but never felt comfortable, always felt I was somehow living a lie.  This book spoke to me and I recognized my truth.  I am now a practicing wiccan and had never felt before the immense peace and honesty of the path I now follow.  Reading this book was a truly life altering experience for me. <br /> <br />That aside, this book is well written and a very engaging read.  While it is quite long, it is engrossing and very hard to put down.  I am ready now to read it for the fourth time.
B00005LC4B|5.0|This movie really is amazing and the star really is De Niro. He does such an excellent job as the villain in this film, you actually cheer for him more than you do for Nick Nolte and his family. I have never seen the original film, but I can say that this remake is stand alone and will become a classic. The music also does a great job at setting the mood. The script is solid and like I said, the performance really is. The movie never is boring, you never know what will happen next. One of the best thrillers of the 90's and it's easy to see how this movie became so famous. It truly is amazing and I highly recommend this film.
0689865384|5.0|I personally adored this book, and everything about it. <br /> <br />It takes place several years in the future, where our era is considered 'Rusties' to the characters in Uglies. The main character, Tally, lives in Uglyville, where anyone normal is considered ugly. She dreams of becoming pretty and one day joining her best friend in Prettytown- where everyone is pretty and thinks pretty thoughts. But, an unexpected friend comes along, and Tally's world is changed forever. She meets amazing people and discovers that she is different, in a good way, from everyone else. <br /> <br />I loved this book- it is something to think about. It gives you a new idea about the future, and it stresses how perfection is so important to society- and that our society has many problems. Reminded me very much of The Giver...It has a similar concept. I enjoyed it very much, and I can't wait to start the third part of the Trilogy. :)
0060751967|5.0|Wow, and I do mean WOW!! Tired rehashed plot? Nope, not here. Fresh and original? Absolutely. First off, it's a comedy vamp romance, and yes, there are plenty of those to be had these days, but again, the humor and situations leading to it are fun and a totally new experience in Spark's version. Let's face it, fellow authors and readers, with the vast majority of romance talent out there, there's more than enough room in the vamp subgenre to welcome this new series into the ever growing vamp fold.<br /><br />Roman Dragonesti is a vamp on the run--for a dentist! Through a freak accident, and a little snafu of misplaced fang action, he's lost one of his sharp eating utensils. He must find a dentist he can coerce into fixing his problem, or forever bo faced with the stigma of single fanged eating for eternity. Shanna Whelan is on the run too, from hired thugs threatening to snuff her life because of murders she witnessed. Due to the murders, her tenuous career as a dentist is rockier than ever, for she cannot abide the sight of blood. When Roman rescues her from an assassination attempt, she suddenly has a gorgeous new savior--one she finds out all too soon is not quite as perfect as she hoped. With problems no girl should have to face in a relationship, will Shanna overcome her fear of blood and learn to see there's more to life than a \\"normal\\" existence? Roman certainly hopes so. Shanna has brought smiles and warmth into a life he thought long dead. He means to have her for his own and he's willing to make some sacrifices.<br /><br />Okay, so this isn't some supercharged, superhero-driven vamp rollarcoaster ride in tight black leather and spandex. Too that, I say good! What we have here are some awesome characters from Scottish vampire security guards (complete with kilts) to a plethora of amusing vamp \\"harem\\" girls ready to get hot and heavy with the hero and heroine. Shanna is a super heroine, torn by her determination to live, despite being marked for death and attracted like nobody's business to Roman. Her reactions to his vamp culture are hilarious and fun to read. Roman is a tortured hero, but what vamp that survives hundreds of years and many gruesome atrocities wouldn't be? He is honorable, good and a true leader to his fellow vampires, one that cares. Sparks has done a superb job of creating yet another vampire world where her particular breed of vamps thrive with vitality, wit and stellar development. There were many characters, but she does a great job of keeping the focus on Shanna and Roman. Good clean writing carries the reader swiftly through the action and romance. Five very enthusiastic and well-deserved stars!d attracted like nobody's business to Roman. Her reactions to his vamp culture are hilarious and fun to read.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|absolutely wonderful!!  i saw this film in theatres about 3 times, and would gladly pay to do so again!  i cannot say how thoroughly i enjoyed it, and how very delighted i was with the acting.  many critized Matthew Macfadyen's portrayal of Mr Darcy, but I thought it was really the most honest and accurate caricature. if you don't believe me, believe the NY times: <br /> <br />\\"Matthew Macfadyen finds a human dimension in the taciturn landowner Fitzwilliam Darcy that was missing in earlier, more conventionally heroic portrayals. Mr. Firth might have been far more dashing, but Mr. Macfadyen's portrayal of the character as a shy, awkward suitor whose seeming arrogance camouflages insecurity and deep sensitivity is more realistic. Isolated by his wealth, ethical high-mindedness and fierce critical intelligence, Mr. Darcy is as stubborn in his idealism as Elizabeth is in hers. The disparity between his diffidence and her forthrightness makes the lovers' failure to connect more than a delaying tactic to keep the story churning forward; it's a touching tale of misread signals.\\" <br /> <br />it's worth it!!!  buy it, watch it, and love it!!!
B000654YK6|5.0|I saw this sometime back in 2001, I believe. A friend of mine bought it on VHS for a dollar from some bargain bin somewhere.  <br />Being a huge fan of heavy music and rock over the past 20+ years, this movie opened my eyes to a whole new scene like nothing ever had before. Of course I had been a fan of Nirvana, AIC and Soundgarden in the early to mid 90's, but this film exposes you to the origins of all that. With a little independant research, you can then find all sorts of gems of bands and albums you might truly enjoy. Mudhoney, The Supersuckers and The Murder City Devils are three of my favorite bands and I first sought them out as a direct result of watching \\"Hype\\" and then doing my own investigating from there. It won't steer you wrong. What's up with the new cover though? Used to be black and white stage diving scene with red letters.
B00005JOSS|5.0|I originally thought that the premise of this movie seemed a little corny but to my surprise I really enjoyed this movie. The premise does play out well and I found myself thouroughly engaged throughout. Keanu and Sandra have great chemistry both together and apart (Yes, I should have remembered that from \\"Speed\\"). <br />Go see it if you want to see a great love story.
B000002UAU|5.0|I don't think I have much new to add to what I believe a lot of people have said. This is one of the great Beatle albums and one of the great popular musical albums of the twentieth century.<br />I remember listening to it when it first came out and being disconcerted by the not- understandable words of 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band' and 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' These two songs were not my favorites though with the years as with most Beatle songs having heard them so many times they kind of enter the heart and mind. What struck me was some of the other pieces,(She's Leaving Home, A Day in the Life)  the great beauty of the Beatle's music. Clearly they were doing something new but at the same time had great lyrical genius creating works on the level of their greatest song- writing predecessors, Kern , Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Rogers and Hart- Hammerstein etc.<br />These songs became so popular that they were listened to, and sung everywhere. Some tremendously great and joyous moments were had with my good friends Steve Brozost and Mickey Greenberg making the joyride from Binghamton to Ithaca and vice- versa while singing these songs at the top of our voices.<br />I read from one of the reviews about the musical revolution in terms of making the long- playing record ( and not the 45 single) the main item for the consumer. The 'Beatles ' put together an album which truly had a unified conception.<br />I say nothing that no one else does not know when I say that they were the Sixties, and only perhaps Dylan can stand with them at the highest level of the music creativity in that time.<br /><br />.

B000050HTO|5.0|Bob Dylan has been part of our sky for so long, it's hard to imagine our world without him. This compilation delivers Dylan's most accessible music in a sweet little package that anyone can enjoy. I know I'll be giving this out to some of my neices and nephews on their birthdays this year!
B000EULJLU|3.0|I thought this Tool release was a mixed bag.  Some decent songs along with more filler than even Aenima and even with all of the filler Aenima still managed to be one of the best Tool albums ever.  Danny Carey did some drum work with Skinny Puppy on The Greater Wrong of the Right record.  That record is better than this one.  Go get that one instead.
B00005JOSS|5.0|\\"The Lake House\\" is a rare gem, the kind of film that Hollywood hasn't made for decades, and has more in common with the b&w classics and some foreign films (like the Korean \\"Il Mare\\" this one was based on) than any contemporary \\"date film.\\" It is the well written script, and the mature and sensitive performances by its 2 leads that set it apart, as well as the many memorable, magical moments: The tree, the dance, the spray-painted inscription on the wall, to name a few. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are superb as Alex and Kate, who try to conquer time and space with their love.<br /><br />I have no problem with time warps, other dimensions, the presence of angels, and that the world just might be a cosmic soup of whirling particles. Seeing is not believing, because we see through a glass darkly, and anything might be possible, even the premise of this plot, implausible as it might be. Director Alejandro Agresti deftly manages to make the complexities of the story flow, and the supporting cast is excellent, including Christopher Plummer (as Alex's famed architect father), Ebon Moss-Bacharach (Alex's brother), Willele von Ammelrooy (Kate's mother) and Shohreh Aghdashloo (Kate's workplace friend). And then there is Jack, a lovable mutt that is shared between time spaces.<br /><br />I cannot think of a living actor that has had a more diverse filmography than Keanu Reeves, and \\"The Lake House\\" is by far his finest performance, in its depth, and naturalness. This is a man who looks so comfortable in his skin, in being who he is, that he adds a dimension of reality to the character of Alex. Sandra Bullock is also excellent as Kate, and both actors exude super star wattage power, and have marvelous screen chemistry with each other.<br /><br />Watch this film with an open mind and a soft heart, and it will delight you. I wept through much of it, enjoyed every minute, and it is a film I will never tire of seeing.
6300216268|2.0|This movie spends way too much time teaching us that life is meant to be loved, lived, and enjoyed, which is, let's face it, an extremely old, hackneyed and boring lesson.  If I want a lecture I'll go to school; a sermon, church.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|The Score to Pirates of The Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the best adventure soundtrack of all time. Composed by Klaus Badelt, and Overproduced by Hans Zimmer, this swashbuckling score will have you screaming for more. This masterpiece will live on forever.   <br /> <br />1) Fog Bound-(8/10){Creepy} It starts off with a lighthearted beginning and goes straight in to the discovery of Will Turner. It begins right after he has been brought onboard and Elizabeth has discovered the Aztec gold as well as her first sighting of The Black Pearl. It then moves into Will and Elizabeth's meeting in her home, directly after Will's sword delivery.  <br /> <br />2) The Medallion Calls-(10/10){Fun} Continues from where Fog Bound left off at the Swann's residence and moves into the Introduction of one on the greatest characters of all time, Capt. Jack Sparrow. The track goes from Jack looking off into the cove, and covers all the way until his \\"First Step\\" onto the harbor. \\"What do you say to three shillings and we forget the name?\\" <br /> <br />3)  The Black Pearl-(10/10){Creepy/Adventurous} This is the scene where Capt. Jack is holding Elizabeth hostage in order to escape from Commodore Norrington. From gunpoint, to flying through the air, to the blacksmith's shop, this track will please any pirate fan. <br /> <br />4)  Will and Elizabeth-(10/10){Adventurous} This track takes place during Will and Jack's Fight in the Blacksmith's shop. \\"You cheated.\\" \\"Pirate!\\"  <br /> <br />5)  Swords crossed-(10/10){Creepy/Scary} This track is where Barbossa tells Elizabeth the Tale, and she tries to flea only to be passed around the deck by the ghost Pirates. Eventually ending up next to Barbossa while he finishes his story and about the moonlight. \\"You best start believin' in ghost stories Miss Turner, your in one.\\"     <br /> <br /> 6)  Walk the Plank-(10/10){Creepy/Fun} This track holds two different scenes in the film. The first is where Barbossa drinks wine and you see his bones soaked in the liquid, and he smashes the glass on the ships doors. The second is where Jack and Will take over the Dauntless. \\"Son, I'm Capt. Jack Sparrow. Savvy?\\"         <br />  <br />7)  Barbossa is Hungry-(10/10){Light Pressure} This is the entire boat chase between the Black Pearl and the Interceptor up until the shooting begins.  \\"Stop blowing holes in my ship!\\" <br /> <br />8) Blood Ritual-(9/10){Romantic/Fun} There are two scenes that take place during this track. One is the scene between Will and Elizabeth bellow decks. The second is where the Interceptor tries to take over the Dauntless, and Jack and Will simply switch ships. \\"That has got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.\\" \\"So it would seem.\\" <br /> <br />9) Moonlight Serenade-(8/10){Slow/Adventurous} There are yet again two scenes that take place in this track. One is the scene between Jack and Elizabeth on the beach. The second is where Jack starts the climactic battle in the cave. \\"Me? I'm dishonest and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly? Stupid.\\" <br /> <br />10)  To the Pirates' Cave!-(8/10){Creepy/Adventurous} This scene starts out where Elizabeth is sneaking around the Black Pearl and she eventually reaches the Jack's imprisoned crew. Also where Governor Swann sees the Cursed Pirates for the first time. Which later moves in to the scene where Barbossa and Jack are fighting, in which Jack gets stabbed, and steps into the moonlight.   \\"If you were waiting for the opportune moment. That was it.\\" <br /> <br />11) Skull and Cross bones- (10/10){Adventurous} There are two scenes in this track. One is directly after jack pulls the sword from his gut and continues to fight Barbossa. While Elizabeth knocks the pirates off the deck of the pearl with the help of the life boat. The second is where Will is trying to escape the sinking Interceptor, which is about to explode, and later dose. Barbossa then throws Elizabeth to his crew and Will appears on the deck of the Black pearl. \\"Barbossa! She goes free!\\" <br /> <br />12)  Bootstrap's Bootstraps- (10/10){Invading/Adventurous} There are two scenes in this track. One is where the black pearl invades port royal, and the second is towards the end of the fight in the cave. \\"You like pain? Try wearing a corset.\\"  <br /> <br />13)  Underwater March-(8/10){Sad/Victorious/Scary} Barbossa is shot and dies sadly never able to eat his apple. The rest of the cursed pirates loose their skeletal form and give up fighting the Commodore and his men. The track ends with Will trying to talk to Elizabeth after the battle while jack sorts through the treasure, and the under water march of the skeletal pirates. \\"I feel...cold.\\"   <br />   <br />14) One Last Shot-(10/10) {Sad/Cheery/Romantic} Elizabeth realizes her love for Will and tells Commodore Norrington.  While Jack Expresses his happiness for them then trips and falls off the cliff into the water below where the Black Pearl and his crew wait. Later Governor Swann expresses his feelings about the path she's chosen. After all he is a black smith. \\"No, He's a Pirate.\\" <br /> <br />15)He's a Pirate-(100/10){Adventurous} Yes you saw correctly one hundreds out of ten. This track is basically the end credits of a magnificent motion picture.     <br /> <br /> There are however some tracks that where not on this album like the full version of the invading black pearl, and Jacks escaping the gallows sequence. But never the less, this score is the best. <br /> <br /> In closing if you enjoy soundtracks at all. Be most certain to pick this one up. For you will never forget the beauty of this marvelous original motion picture score. I give this CD a 10 out of 10.  Bravo Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer, Bravo! <br />
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have never read the novel on which this miniseries is based (and probably will never get around to doing so), so I was not troubled by any departures from the original story or fiddling with secondary characters, etc.  I enjoyed the TV version on its own merits and found it up to the highest BBC standards.  The depiction of the milltown, the miserable lives of the mill workers, the union stirrings and the general labor unrest of the time was very well presented, as was, of course, the basic human drama. Everyone in the cast was superb, especially Sinead Cusack as the millowner's hard/soft mother, Brendan Coyle (why don't they use him more?)as the union leader, and the two leads.In this regard, I have to say that Richard Armitage was a revelation as the sexy, brooding and semi-tough millowner .  I never thought to see a worthy competitor to Colin Firth (Darcy) and Timothy Dalton (Rochester) but I think this guy can hold his own in that exalted company.  I predict a surge of interest in him after this, unless the women of the BBC viewing public have somehow been rendered unconscious.  It is a beautifully produced and acted story and will, I think, become a classic.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|In the fall of 1971, I was introduced to that social contraption called the college party.  These always took place in a dorm room or two.  Some lights turned off and others turned low--often emitting a soft red glow by the odd shirt or cloth laid over the lamp.  Young men and women joked, talked and hooked up.  Weed smoked and alcohol flowed. You had to watch out for the dozens of lit cigarettes.  And the music played none stop.  Stones, Traffic, Moody Blues, McCartney, James Taylor, CSNY and Chicago.<br /><br />One such party, I came across a beautiful girl with long blond hair sitting down on the floor next to the wall, legs outstretched.  I sat next to her and chatted for a long while.  \\"Amy\\" was outfitted in customary tight blue jeans and black turtleneck.  I probably wore the regulation \\"James Taylor\\" uniform of jeans and a blue cotton shirt.  I offered her a beer but she turned it down for the bottle she had already cracked open.  \\"Amy\\" then introduced me to the brain numbing pleasures of tequila.  The first shot was enough to knock the wind out of you; but it got easier as you went along.  I have no idea how much \\"Amy\\" and I shared.<br /><br />Several hours later, I awoke in a dark room in bed with Amy.  We were distinctly undressed and I had a vague memory inebriated carnal pairing.  Amy woke up, rubbed my arm and then sat up, undisturbed by her nakedness, and lit a cigarette.  I stared at her body for a few minutes thinking that I may never see anyone like her this way ever again.  Then I thought \\"what the hell\\" and sat up next to her.  I, too, soon found myself taking drags off a cigarette although I didn't smoke.<br /><br />Then the opening chords of \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" passed their way through the walls of the room.  Amy laughed a little bit and then went about rolling a joint.  She lit it, took a few deep draws and then passed it to me.  While proceeding to get stoned, Amy said:  \\"I love Neil.  You know, I was a groupie for almost six months last year.  Old boyfriend was a roadie and got me on the tour.  It was fun.  Neil and I got real tight.  When it all ended, he wrote this song about me.  Me, the \\"cowgirl\\".  I never rode a horse in my life.  But to old Neil I was \\"Cowgirl\\".<br /><br />Later, after a few promises to stay in touch, we threw our clothes on and parted.  As in the way of these things, we never got together again.  I would see her around. We would talk; but our night was lost the fog of cannabis, tequila and sex.<br /><br />It was just as well.  As we sat in bed together and she told her story of Neil and their brief life on the road I knew it wasn't true.  \\"Cowgirl\\" couldn't have been written about her because it had been put out on record a full year before her \\"tour\\" with Neil.  Furthermore, her entire story about the tour was seriously in doubt.  Friends said that prior to her arrival at college, Amy never had an unsupervised day in her life.<br /><br />Once you got past the fiction, you realized that Amy was telling you something deeper about herself.  Neil Young has that kind of meaning for people.  Long familiarity with his music lets you feel you know him--that he is a fellow traveler with yourself--that he can peer into your soul and understand you.  That's why after all the twists and turns people still love him.  This is also why many outside the \\"cult of Young\\" find him so repellent.<br /><br />Some will go on to assure the reader that it is not Young they object to so much as the undeserved adulation bestowed upon him.  Neil Young is seen by some critics (especially many in the U.K.) as a \\"failed Dylan successor\\".  While sometimes his lyrics are razor sharp, Young's lines are more likely to meander about nothing in particular.  His subject matter is can shift mid-verse and obscure any recognizable human experience.  His reedy voice has a narrow range that at times is not all that pleasant and during live performances can frequently wander off pitch.  Last but not least, Young's guitar style is particularly limited to what these days we call a raw grunge style that often resorts to his trademark \\"pterodactyl\\" mode.<br /><br />If you are of a particular age and think the emergence of \\"punk\\" in the late 1970's was earthshaking and revolutionary--especially if you punch your fist into the air to the \\"London Calling\\" battle cry--Neil Young is all a part of that period of American music you don't understand and don't care.  Nonetheless, for all assurances to the contrary, many do indeed have an intestinal hatred for Young that in turns can get ugly.<br /><br />Personally, I think this has all to do with when it comes to Young what you see is what you get--but with each new record you never know what you're going to get.  Young himself has never made any great claims to be mysterious and as far as he is concerned it's perfectly okay to ignore him.  Just when you think you've got him nailed down, like Huck Finn, he'll \\"light out for the territory [separate from] the rest\\".  While it is true he is no Bob Dylan, I fail to see why so many thought he was in that race to begin with.  As far as being a \\"guitar slinger\\", it is true there are better ones in the Rock pantheon--Stephen Stills to name one--nevertheless he has cut out a poignant style you can recognize in a forest of guitar warriors.<br /><br />Of much greater importance, Young drinks from the spirits and waters of the American/Canadian western prairies for a unique vision all his own.  For those for whom America is summed up in New York and L.A., there is little understanding or interest in this part of the country.  So there is a lyricism and imagination with deep roots foreign to too many critics.<br /><br />This present collection is a fair representation of the Young omnibus.  It totally neglects Young's work with the Buffalo Springfield and is heavily weighted toward his early solo work.  It skips his 1980's period (hey, it wasn't that bad) except for two essential songs and does little better for the 1990's.  The two glaring omissions which are essential to any Young \\"journey through the past\\" are \\"Cortez The Killer\\" and \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love\\".  The goal was to put out a Young \\"greatest hits\\" on one disc; but I would argue that hope was just a bridge too far.<br /><br />Thinking back to Amy, I am less inclined to think she was a liar than to think part of her soul had Neil Young as that imaginary lover she could turn to who spoke of thoughts and feelings she had no words for.  Maybe she should have found her own language and imagination for those poetic realities; but most of us don't have that gift.

B000EQH2QK|4.0|I just bought Shakira Vol. 2 because I heard it was better than Vol. 1.  All I have to say is I was not dissapointed, it took a few days to get used to the style but it is pretty good rock and some good vocal.  There is one part where Shakira really copies Madonna's style (when she asked about her pants, etc in the song Don't Bother, completely a copy of style from the great Madonna's WHAT IT FEELS like to BE a GIRL introduction. <br /> <br />You can observer that Shakira does admire Madonna, more than she wants to admit. <br /> <br />A very good cd.
B000AY74OG|4.0|There are sometimes where a good movie in the theaters can be fairly good, but there are other times where a animated film can miss the mark. That has been the case with films like Shrek, Toy Story, and other good films. What I saw about Madagascar featuring the voices of Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Chris Rock as the silly zebra, was at mostly good animated comedy. The story involves several animal friends and the longing of a zebra who wants to kow what it is like living the wild. When the zebra escapes, Mark the lion, Gloria the hippo, and Norman the giraffe try to go after the zebra, and then find themselves on a boat going straight to the wild. The animation for the film is absolutely delightful, but I just wish there could've been a bit more excitement in this film. It was just a bit too short.<br /><br />Film: B<br /><br />Animation: A-<br /><br />Overall: B-
B000EGCIU0|4.0|It may not have been as large a hit as her 2001 triumph \\"M!ssundaztood,\\" but P!nk's 2003 LP \\"Try This\\" certified her artistic prowess and left no doubt that she was in a class all her own. She continues this trend of increasing musical quirkiness and thus quality with her aptly-titled comeback effort \\"I'm Not Dead.\\"<br /><br />With lead single \\"Stupid Girls\\" P!nk has affirmed in a downright infectious way what many have felt in frustration for the longest time - this culture cultivates stupid girls, and everything about it is despicable. Also, follow-up single \\"Who Knew?,\\" on which she collaborated with pop tunesmith Max Martin, shines and sparkles in all the right places and is a likely summer hit.<br /><br />However, sharp material abounds in much variety on \\"I'm Not Dead.\\" The title crack crackles and lilts with forthrightness amid its raw arrangements and stream-of-conscious lyrics, while \\"Dear Mr. President,\\" collaboration with the Indigo Girls, may be the most dignified and effective protest of the Bush administration recorded yet.<br /><br />\\"How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?/How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?/How do you walk with your head held high?/Can you even look me in the eye?\\"<br /><br />She also includes an excellent slice of pure power pop with \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" that fits her personal style while still sounding pointedly mainstream, while brooding over intense subject matter in selections like the passionate \\"Long Way to Happy\\" and \\"Runaway,\\" the latter of which serves as a companion to \\"Conversations With My 13-Year-Old Self.\\" Both realistically articulate the darkness that often accompanies growing up, a skill P!nk has proven deft at.<br /><br />Also included are the illustrious \\"Nobody Knows\\" and \\"The One That Got Away,\\" the latter of which finds her sounding like a much more talented Phoebe Buffay. Last but not least, she displays her signature attitude with \\"`Cuz I Can\\" and \\"U + Ur Hand,\\" the latter in which she forthrightly tells her man that she refuses to be objectified as a sex object.<br /><br />Overall, P!nk has come a long way since the pop/r&b trappings of her debut album six years ago. Not only has her music increased in quality with each successive record, but she has proven herself an excellent role model for young people through her lyrics, individuality and political awareness. Pop stars may be a dime a dozen these days, but she is an exception to the rule.and,\\" the latter in which she forthrightly tells her man that she refuses to be objectified as a sex object.  <br /> <br />Overall, P!nk has come a long way since the pop/r&b trappings of her debut album six years ago.

B000002HMH|5.0|When I was 14 years old in 1996, when this one came out.. all I ever knew of Metallica was \\"Until It Sleeps\\".. the first single from this. And I ate it up.. I LOVED that song.. Guitars in this song especially. I didnt know \\"Leper Messiah\\" or even \\"Enter Sandman\\" (I was 9 when the 'Black Album' came out) so I had no other Metallica album to compare this to. So.. it was like the 1st and only Metallica in existence to me when I got my hands on it.  How can you seriously say \\"Aint My Bitch\\" is not a rockin' song? Very \\"Motorhead-ish\\". And \\"2x4\\"? It has Sabbath written all over it. \\"The House Jack Built\\" was my favorite song off of this for YEARS! How can you not love that solo that Kirk does in there where he makes his F*****G guitar TALK?! \\"Hero Of The Day\\" is a beautiful song.. rocks harder than \\"Nothing Else Matters\\"! And of course, my favorite nowadays is \\"Bleeding Me\\".. I love how that song has 2 parts to it. I can go on and on... on how each of these songs has something great about them. If you're looking to get into Metallica.. start here. This is one great album.. one of the best ever released.  I DID almost drop it a star because of \\"Mama Said\\".. that song is horrible.. unless you like country music. I do like the genuine feeling that Hetfield puts into it.. but I do not like country music. That ruins it. You should probably, DEFINITELY check out \\"The Outlaw Torn\\".  Great album.
0060934913|5.0|I found Kitchen Confidential at the library, and I stayed up late reading it.  When I finished Kitchen Confidential, I was envious--I wished I had written it.  My version would be from a different perspective-- I was a waitress for 12 years.  I never cooked.  As a former restaurant employee, I can vouch for Bourdain-- I have seen or heard about many of the things that go on in a kitchen.  I have even done some ( I won't say which) of the things Bourdain describes.  If people knew the truth about restaurants, they'd never eat out.  Read Bourdain, and follow his advice.  He may be crude, but he's honest.
B000F1IQMS|5.0|When I go to see a movie, I either go to be entertained, or to learn something.  I don't want to sit and analise a movie through and through, so I'm not going to write about the direction or the score or stuff like that. <br />I believe this to be very close to the truth (there were a few differences from what I can remember about what I learnt of this topic in history).  Several teams were sent within Europe for revenge killings, but anyway ... Eric Bana was excellent in this.  His accent was down perfectly, and you could see he was a conflicted guy.  He was glad to get revenge, but yet he did things he thought were beyond him as a human being and he worried for his family.  The determination in his eyes was obvious but there was sadness too.  When he heard his baby on the phone for the first time and he broke down, that was heart-wrenching. <br />Overall, this is a fantastic movie that doesn't go into major depth about the actual Munich games themselves, but the aftermath of Israel making those responsable pay.  From the real footage of coverage on news tv (with Peter Jennings voice) to the final scene, I really enjoyed this great movie and I barely noticed that it was in fact 2 hours and 40 something minutes.  I highly recommend this. <br />

B000AMJDHY|5.0|I have been reading through these reviews and had to add in my views.  First off, just so you all know, this was not another MTV ploy.  This band was actually formed by the members and written by the members.  No one else.  No executive producer put together a bunch of people and called it a band or group.   <br /> <br />But this CD is great.  I love how it is set up with \\"Introduction,\\" and, \\"Intermission.\\"  It's different, we need that. <br /> <br />I find every track amazing and thought filled.  I say this is a must have CD!
B000F3TBIO|4.0|Wow -- I'm listening to this for the second time right now. The first time through, just under half of the record was great on first listen -- more so on the second trip. This is a great effort. <br /> <br />On the X-Excutioners collaboration, I was frequently left thinking \\"D'oh! But I liked that part! Do that a while longer!\\" This album has the same feel as that one (not as Zorn-like) but less indulgent. Definitely lots of conscious pop-styling. <br /> <br />When I introduced one of my friends to GWAR many years ago, he said after his second or third show \\"You know why they're better than any other metal band? Because they're making fun of metal AND they're a great metal band. Thus they transcend all others.\\" <br /> <br />Patton is doing the same thing here. He's frickin' Dionne Warwick on track 7 and it's great!  <br /> <br />Yes, this one will probably grow into 5 stars.
B00005JP4U|4.0|When they write the history of our Civilization, this film will take its place along with Gore's earlier book, \\"Earth in the Balance\\" as milestones in the evolution of American thought and consciousness on global warming.  Unfortunately, the film, which does a good job at describing the seriousness of problem, never rises above simplistic solutions which are doomed to failure.<br /><br />By now, most of us have heard of global warming.  We've been told that our use of fossil fuels emits CO2 gases into the atmosphere which trap the suns rays, heating the planet up like a greenhouse.  So maybe the temperature of the Earth has gone up a degree.  So what?  We've all got more pressing problems to worry about, right?<br /><br />\\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is designed to shock us into awareness that the changes that are happening are dramatic, and if unchanged, cataclysmic.  Gore uses the analogy of a frog placed in a pot of water.  If the water is heated gradually, the frog will be boiled alive before it notices.  Similarly, the changes to our environment seem so subtle and gradual to us that we are lulled into inaction, but meanwhile processes are underway that could result in tremendous destruction.<br /><br />This is essentially a film about a slide presentation on global warming that Gore has given, he says, over 1000 times.  The film expands on the points in the slide show with footage of exotic locales, as well as personal reflections by Gore about his lifelong relationship with the topic of global warming.  Yes, it's a documentary, but it's well-made, and its topic and predictions are so dramatic, that it holds our attention until the end.<br /><br />This is Gore at his best: intelligent, articulate, clever, charming, even passionate at times.  What gives the film its credibility is the personal relationship between Gore and the topic of global warming.  We see the emergence and growing importance of the topic through the prism of Gore's life.  Starting from when he first learned about the new theory of global warming as a student nearly 40 years ago through today, we track Gore's --and our-- growing understanding of the effects and consequences of the planet's warming.<br /><br />There are plenty of charts, figures and statistics to impress any layman.  But most dramatic and convincing are the photos of various locations a generation ago and today.  We see glaciers that have disappeared, snows that have melted, huge lakes that have evaporated into deserts, and ice packs that are breaking up.  Clearly, changes are occurring.<br /><br />But then the film makes a subtle transition-- from what has occurred to what will occur.  Gore gives his forecasts with the same confidence as his history, lulling the casual viewer into accepting that they carry the same degree of certainty.  And if we didn't get it already, this is where we learn that this isn't just another Nova science film, this is a film with a mission.  As Gore proclaims, \\"this is a MORAL issue\\", by which he means there are things we should be doing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is where the film is the weakest.  Gore pronounces that when the ice of Greenland melts, or half the ice of Antarctica melts, it will raise sea levels 20 feet.  We then see very dramatic graphic effects of how this will alter coastlines in heavily populated areas of the Earth.  Hundreds of millions will be at risk.  But is this going to happen suddenly in the next few years? Or gradually over the next few centuries?  Gore doesn't say.  Probably because no one knows.  And are there self-correcting mechanisms that could slow or reverse the effects of global warming, such as the growing scarcity of fossil fuels and the likely evolution to other sources of energy in the coming decades?<br /><br />And here we get to the \\"inconvenient truth\\" that mars the film's mission:  It's difficult to ask people to make certain sacrifices today when the future benefits of those sacrifices remain unclear or controversial at best.  For example, most of the people who see this film will be receptive to idea of switching from a gas guzzler to a vehicle like the Prius.  They will feel like they are doing the \\"right thing\\".  But what if it turns out that all of the benefits of this are outweighed by the millions of new cars being added every year in countries like China and India.  What if instead of asking people to switch to the Prius, we told them instead you can only drive one day a week.  Then you might see a different reaction.  When you REALLY ask people to make sacrifices, you'd better be able to tell them for sure what they're getting in return for what they are giving up.<br /><br />In short, the film does not do justice to the vast complexity of issues that get in the way of the world facing up to this problem.  It is not as simple as just knowing there is a problem.  The world has economies in all stages of development with different values, cultures, governments, etc.  Getting them all to agree on a common approach to reducing greenhouse gases will take more than showing everyone this film.  But it would be a good start.e benefits of those sacrifices remain unclear or controversial at best.

0743454537|3.0|The premise of a child, genetically manufactured for the sole purpose of being used as vessel from which parts can be harvested for a dying older sister, grabbed my attention as a relevant issue, both socially and legally.  In the story, Anna's mother demands that Anna give up one of her kidneys so that her older sister has a chance of surviving for a couple of extra years.  After suffering 13 years through procedure after procedure for her sister's benefit, Anna finally takes a stand and hires a lawyer to work to get her medically emancipated from her parents.  <br /> <br />I had very high expectations for the novel mainly because I believed the thorny moral issues it grapples with demand a level of sensitivity and compassion.  I was not disappointed with this respect.  The novel is told from the perspective of six characters:  Anna, the healthy genetically engineered child, Jesse, the older and troubled son, Sara, the mother, Brian, the father, Julia, the ad litem for the court, and Campbell, the attorney representing Anna.  All of the different perspectives bring something unique to the table and demonstrate how a situation of this magnitude can affect everyone involved.  The writing was excellent, the details were realistic, and the story was told with great pathos. <br /> <br />However, the book is not without serious faults.  The first is a useless subplot.  Picoult includes a highly unrealistic romantic subplot between Campbell and Sara dating all the way back to their years in high school.  Subplots are only necessary if they fulfill some role (i.e., they are used for development of an important character, they some how facilitate the movement of the plot, they aid in presenting the author's message, or they somehow \\"explain\\" the ending of the story).  However, the Sara-Campbell subplot does none of these things.  If anything, it draws attention away from the main progression of the story, slowing it down with scenes that have no bearing on the case, the suffering family, the plot, or the ending.  Moreover, Sara and Campbell, while important, are not the main focus of the story and they did not really need the extra attention provided by the subplot. <br /> <br />The second fault deals with the ending, which was horribly horribly horribly contrived.  Because of the story, Picoult had several different, plausible, and \\"realistic\\" endings from which she could choose.  However, instead of selecting one of these endings, she chooses one that comes right out of left field.  It doesn't make sense in the story, and it very unrealistic.  It is a huge leap in logic on behalf of the reader, and it severely stretches the reader's ability to believe in the possibility the ending could occur.  It, in effect, really ruins the story.  Instead of courageously standing up and making a very difficult choice for her character, Picoult takes the easy way out. <br /> <br />Overall, the book was very well-written.  You could easily skip over the Sara-Campbell parts and still make sense of the story, and as for the ending . . .  well, I suppose all I can say is that you'll enjoy it up until that point.  Grade:  C+/B-.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|Peter Jackson is a talented director, but he doesn't seem to know the difference between a roller coaster ride and a film. In this Kong version the special effects have become so \\"over charged\\" they have overshadowed everything including Kong himself. While the animation is very detailed and true to form. I did find much of the action / motion to fast and seemly lacking the mass of real life. This isn't helped by the fact that many movements are simply to impossible too believed.     Small point I personally would have liked more time exploring Skull Island! Less gore(skulls and bones)and dark atmosphere!  Fewer numbers and more varieties(i.e.Apatosaurus stampedes and cervase insects).     The acting wasn't bad but the writing and characterization are unnerving for lovers of the orginal 1933 KING KONG.  Jack Black is miscasted as Carl Denham.    I am not fond of the way the natives are depicted as sub-humans.    In closing I note the PG13 rating this really isn't a film for young Children.     Postscript: I must say I was very pleased with the pseudo-documentaries included on the second disc.  The \\"Skull Island a Natural History\\" is remarkably well done I personally found it more interesting and entertaining than the Feature. Also I was impressed by Kong's New York 1933 which adds much to the times that Kong is set.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet. Certain bands and certain albums take time to digest and to really hit you. TOOL is such a band, and 10,000 day's is such an album. The mix of the album may be the best that I have ever heard. If you have a killer pair of headphones and a killer stereo, crank it up and kick back and marvel at the production. The music and the lyrics are powerful, and at times will give you chills. As a whole, I think that this is their best album. I love AENIMA. I still hear new things every time I listen to it, and I still listen to it. AENIMA is probably in my top 10 of best rock albums of all time. For me, 10,000 days is at that same level. I must admit though that it took me a good 3 weeks, and at least 2 dozen listens for the whole album to come together for me. But that is what's so great about TOOL. Their complex, and their music is even more complex. I hope to be able to live for 10,000 day's so that I can enjoy this album for 10,000 day's.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|Ridley Scott is such a \\"great director\\" I can't put into words how disapointed I am in \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\"! While director Scott is \\"masterful\\" in his battle scenes and Special effects, he apparently has no regard for his or his films creditability. \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" was too \\"important\\" a film to trash historical accuracy for some \\"Sunday School\\" agenda. Oddly he does this in what should be well known \\"Christian\\" history (I speak here of his treatment of the Templers as well many historical figures.) On the other hand his treatment of Saladin may not be \\"exactly\\" factual it is none the less ground breaking. Scott shows Saladin the Great Islamic General as the skilled Military Leader he was rather than a simplistic evil monster. Also Saladin's army is shown as disciplined warriors instead of the usual mindless \\"HORD\\".     Let me be perfectly clear, my criticism of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is for Ridley Scott's uses of dramatic license in altering and   revising important history. Not for being anti-Roman Catholic. In fact I contend that because of his trashing of the Templers and altering the roles of key Christian players. This effectively muddles the history. The end result is  \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is very pro-Roman Catholic (anti-Templer).      In other areas this is a fine film. Scott's seige of the city is especailly well done and effective.
B000021XS0|5.0|For those of us that have experianced DREAM THEATER, we have been lucky enough to be a part of a rare musical dream. SCENES FROM A MEMORY is the highlight of that dream so far. A true masterpiece from a legendary band in their prime. To have a band that has five virtuoso rock musicians in one band is very rare. And for them to create incredible music that will hold up for generations is almost unheard of. I know that this is debatible, but I believe the only other band that can make this claim is LED ZEPPILIN. SCENES FROM A MEMORY is one of the greatest rock albums ever created. It is flawless. The production is excellent. The musicianship is incredible. And the lyrics(or story) are perfect. Let's all hope that DREAM THEATER is around for another twenty years. If you are new to DREAM THEATER, be warned. Once you hear them, you'll be spoiled forever.
B0002YLC24|1.0|I bought this without previously knowing anything about it, not knowing it was a sequel. I was taken in by the title, and the blurb. That's it. It sounded like a really romantic film, one that I might identify with, as I've always wondered what would happen if I met my first love again, if I would have the same feelings. After watching the very, very long trailer, I was slightly disappointed, and I only managed to half an hour into the film, before I started to doze off. It's so incredibly boring! And although I wouldn't say I normally mind \\"real time\\" films, it's all set in the mid-late afternoon, a very dull time of day if you ask me. It was the only time of day director Richard Linklater would shoot the scenes in the film. He felt it added to the reality of the film, and often relied on the actors to get perfect takes at the right time, and it shows, as it was shot in a mere 15 days.<br /><br />But it's nothing but talk and meandering around Parisian streets in the parts I watched. I just didn't identify with it. Nothing happened. And I hated the two actors. I don't normally like Ethan Hawke anyway, but I thought I might be able to ignore this, but no I disliked Julie Delpy too.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, although I know other reviewers are gonna disagree with me, but it just wasn't what I expected.
B00005R62N|5.0|UNLEASHED IN THE EAST is true JUDAS PRIEST. I first saw JUDAS PRIEST live when they played their first show ever in the U.S. opening for LED ZEPPELIN and RICK DERRINGER at a day on the green in Oakland, Ca. in 1976. I had never heard of them before, but I was blown away by them. I have seen them five times since then, and every show is very memorable. UNLEASHED IN THE EAST is a perfect example of what JUDAS PRIEST is like live. They are true metal gods. UNLEASHED IN THE EAST captures the best of ROB HALFORD, K.K. DOWNING , AND GLEN TIPTON. ROB HALFORDS vocals are in legendary form on this album. This is a must have for any fan of heavy metal, and heavy it is. There are other great live albums in other genres of music, but for heavy metal, this is in my opinion the best. A must have for every metal fan.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|The other 1-star reviews say it all. I'm just here to lower the overall film rating! I loved the book; this film was atrocious and boring (all the meaningless, added dialogue!). I'd probably say that even if I weren't an enormous Austen fan and hadn't felt like this was a travesty to Austen's legacy: no subtlety or humor, and completely dumbed down. Read the book, watch the BBC miniseries (in that order)--don't waste your time on this film.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|like the title reads, this is an upgrade from \\"three days grace\\". The thing I noticed the most is the guitar playing, which is much better.  My favorite songs are (Animal I have become) (Never too late) (Riot) (over and over)
B000FBGBPC|5.0|WOW, this is by far the best CD I have ever purchased, and probibly will ever purchase. A really big improvement over their last album. There is no other CD that i would want to have over this. Riot, Animal I have become, and pain are the three best songs on this CD.
0142000655|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who has time to spare. I could not put it down. I highly recommend it for anyone. (It is thick though so be sure that you have some time set aside.)
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am a budding period movie buff and have seen all the movies based on the works of Jane Austen (BBC, A and E and hollywood versions), as well as some others like \\"Tess of the Durbervilles\\", \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\", several versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\", the works of Charles Dickens, Shakespeare and more. I can honestly say that I have never been as entralled with anything as I was with this movie!! <br /> <br />I bought this movie based solely on the reviews on this site, and the fact that it is an A&E production and I had recently enjoyed watching \\"Wives and Daughters\\", also based on a Gaskell novel. I put the dvd in one night before bed to watch the first episode and see what it was like. Big mistake...I proceeded to stay up WAY passed my bedtime to watch the entire thing in one sitting (I should have known better, as A&E miniseries often have that effect on me) <br /> <br />I may even like this movie slightly better than the ever-famous \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" starring Colin Firth, and before I get brow-beaten by a bunch of P&P fanatics (I was one of you once, please be kind), let me explain myself. The love story here is very similar to that between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. She takes an initial dislike while he reluctantly forms an attration, there is a botched proposal, she gradually comes to see his good qualities and falls in love herself. It is the REST of the story that puts this one over the top. The hero, Mr. Thorton, is the master of a cotton mill, while the heroine, Margaret, befriends a group of strike-ready mill workers. The viewer can understand both sides of the struggle and it is really interesting to see how it plays out. And of course, as others have mentioned, there is that last scene at the train station which is incredibly romantic : ) <br /> <br />In short, if you are at all interested in period films, don't hesitate to purchase this. Believe me, you will want to watch it more than once.
0553208845|5.0|I can't express how much I took a liking to this book. Even though this book is recommended for many junior high students I still believe that it should eb read by everyone.
B00005JNRY|5.0|Who would have thought a movie about cars could have so much heart? Not me, and honestly I went into this movie with low expectations, despite the fact that so many Pixar movies are so well done. Well, boy was I surprised. <br /> <br />The beginning of the movie was much like I expected the entire movie to be..loud and fast, with so much going on onscreen you can't keep track of it all. But the movie switches tone and pacing when the star racecar ends up (by accident) in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, with a bunch of good-ol-boy cars who haven't heard of the Piston Cup and just want to bring their little town back to its heydey glory. <br /> <br />Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as Mater, the tow truck who befriends the self-centered racecar and inadvertently helps to teach him the value of teamwork and putting others before yourself. <br /> <br />Overall a great movie and I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
B000929AJQ|5.0|As Reznor moves away from the industrial scene and into the alternitive scene, he had to prepare for a bumpy ride. With Teeth is quite different from what we've seen from him before, but that doesn't mean it can't be great.

0930289234|5.0|\\"I hear always the admonishment of my friends:<br />'Bolt her in, and constrain her!'<br />But *who watches the watchmen?*<br />The wife arranges accordingly, and begins with them.\\"<br /><br />During the 30s through the late 70s, superheroes were the biggest trends on the headlines, especially a group of superbeings called the \\"Minutemen.\\" Everyone loved the heroes for a while, until the government passed the 1977 Keene Act, which outlawed costumed vigilantes, sans Dr. Jon Osterman (the nuclear \\"Dr. Manhattan\\"), Laurie Juspeczyk (\\"Silk Spectre II\\") and Edward Blake (the tough-as-nails \\"Comedian\\"). The remaining members at the time, Adrian Veidt (\\"Ozymandias\\"), and Daniel Dreiberg (\\"Nite Owl II\\"), however, were forced into retirement. Other heroes are either incarcerated, or deceased. Now, in the present time--October 1985--The Comedian is murdered in his home by an unknown assailant, and the remaining, non-government-employed masked adventurer, Rorschach, a ruthless vigilante detective so-named after the ever-shifting ink-blots on his faceless mask, investigates the attack. Afterwards, he warns the other local ex heroes--Dreiberg, Veidt, Osterman, and Laurie--of the Comedian's demise, saying he suspects Blake's death may be part of a much bigger plan to destroy all \\"masks.\\" Though the year is 1985, Richard Nixon is still president of the US because of some aid from Dr. Manhattan in the Vietnam war that brought about an amendment that granted him a third term in office--that, and the Comedian's implied, ordered killing of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein before they could expose Nixon's involvement in the infamous Watergate scandal. The entire \\"superhero\\" mania is even as much as a political issue (conservatives think they are wrongly defamed, misunderstood do-gooders, and liberals consider them dangerous and should be banned). But even all of this superhero controversy won't stop Rorschach and his \\"mask killer\\" theory, nor will it the other retired heroes when they are finally inspired by Rorschach's words, and when more attacks ensue, to return to the same world that outlawed them, and find the mastermind behind these so-called \\"mask killings...\\"<br /><br />This is it, folks. You found it--the book (along with Frank Miller's \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,\\" released around the same time as this, the mid 80s) that forever changed a previously underappreciated art form and challenged an entire medium. This is a gripping story that demonstrates that writing is more than just an art form, it is a craft, and that the true craftsman can achieve flawless perfection. What Alan Moore, a veteran fan favorite in the comic book business, did with his timeless masterwork is take the age-old concept of men-in-tights and revolutionized it into something nobody had ever imagined possible before--he placed them in the \\"real world.\\" I'm sure all of us--young and old--have, at one time or another, pondered what our own world would be like if superpowered beings were real. If you're thinking it would make the world a better place, then you need to stop watching \\"The Powerpuff Girls\\" and quit reading the \\"Funnies\\" in the newspapers and read \\"Watchmen\\" immediately. According to \\"Watchmen,\\" there really are no such things as \\"superheroes,\\" nor have there been to begin with. The very term \\"superhero\\" doesn't even mean anything. The story is mainly about how much one can do to save the world, versus how much one *should* do--sanity vs. insanity.<br /><br />In addition to the fictional history of the characters, Moore also discusses true world history and the characters' reactions to them--particularly World War II, McCarthyism, Vietnam, and the Cold War, which makes this an all the more interesting, not to mention frighteningly real, read. And if you look closely, you might some significant things that can relate to today's world. The plot is very deep and complex, and a mirror of it's own self--the very last frame, if you look close enough, is a deliberate echo of the first, as is the final chapter of the first. Moore always does this in his works, and it's fantastic. There is not one piece of wasted dialogue here. Moore orchestrates everything flawlessly, even some events that might, at first, be considered unneeded are important because they fit into the final outcome (I'm being vague on purpose, don't to spoil anything big). In conclusion, Alan Moore proves himself the genius he is regularly dubbed with his undisputed classic. \\"Watchmen\\" is a masterwork I would recommend to absolutely anyone--not just graphic novel enthusiasts (like myself), but anyone who likes intelligent, thought-provoking literature in general. There is a reason why \\"Watchmen\\" belongs in *everyone's* personal library.<br /><br />I very strongly recommend \\"Watchmen\\" to anyone who likes to read.
1400034205|4.0|Mr. Maugham's writing style is superb and he describes his characters with great care. All the characters that he decribes -- Elliot, Isabel, Sophie, Suzanne, and ofcourse Larry -- are very likable and the detail with which these characters are painted, is of superlative quality.    I got attracted to this book after I read the one line summary on the cover saying ... \\"story of a man in search for the answer to his question\\". But I'm afraid to say, that it did not quite match my expectation. It's only in the last but one chapter , does the author talk about Larry's findings and his journey of getting answers to his questions. For most part, I felt like it's a book more about Elliot or Isabel, leaving me impatient. All I wanted really was to know about Larry, about his findings, about his conclusions, about his journey ... and I don't think I got satisfactory answers for any of the things that I wanted to know.   However, I'd recommend this book for the sheer pleasure it gives to read Mr. Maugham's writing. But you will perhaps not get any answers to your questions!
6300268993|4.0|This film is really not much better or different then the official \\"Superman II\\" credited to Richard Lester which was released in the USA in 1981.<br /><br />In 2006 Warner Brothers Released the fan demanded \\"Richard Donner Cut\\".  Now this forst time in film history that a director was brought back to a film after he was fired.  However it was over 25 years that passed between his firing and his re-hiring.<br /><br />Now the Film \\"S2: The Richard Donner Cut\\" does suffer because it sticks to all the footage that Richard Doner had shot. Only Lester Footage was used when it had to \\"Plug the Holes\\".<br /><br />The (Spoilers) Scenes in Niagara Falls suffers the most.  Here they should of stuck to all the Richard Lester Footage.  Also they could of re-worked the screen test footage (as many film fans have) to created a better \\"Blank Bullet Scene\\".  What they did here was enjoyable but it could of been 100x better.<br /><br />The Gem of this Version is all the Brando Footage has been restored.  Also a new Opening to the film is very enjoyable.<br /><br />I hope in the future Warner Brothers will allow more improvements to this film.  Now either version of this film is still one of the best comic book films ever made.  \\"Superman\\" from 1978 is still the film all other comic based movies are measured by.  \\"Superman II\\" however is still a very enjoyable and highly respected sequel.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|It may have taken three years for the rock band Three Days Grace to punch out another album since they released their debut record, but ONE-X was well worth the wait. There is so much more to their music compared to their previous record. The band is using a lot more melodies and harmonies for both their insturments and vocals. There is still the constant progession of power chords, but they are also using other chords as well and there is more melody to the guitar. Sure it is the standard rock style and sound of melody, but it adds so much more to the band's sound compared to how they performed on their pervious album. There are also identifiable solos being given to instruments. The opening bass and guitar introduction to \\"The Animal I Have Become\\" is unique and a good hook. ONE-X is a good record in the example of how one's music progesses to higher standards just by adding more melodies and harmonies to one's orignial sound.     Stand out tracks include:   \\"The Animal I Have Become\\"  \\"On My Own\\"  \\"Get Out Alive\\"  \\"Let It Die\\"  \\"One-X\\"
B000BKVQTS|3.0|First of all, let me state that this review is not about the movie, but about the special features included in the dvd.  As far as the film itself goes, I find myself somewhat in agreement with the above December 27 review by B. Marold, although I probably like this odd, disjointed film better than the above reviewer.  This film is definately worth a watch for curiosity, though it is far from perfect.    However, if you decide you like the film enough to give the DVD a try, I would definately recommend you take a look through the deleted scenes.  90% of them are absolute gems, and you can decide for yourself whether they deserved to be cut purely to speed up the pacing of the story.  Important: You should watch them first all the way through (Play all) without the director's commentary, and then again with the commentary on for Director Terry Gilliam's take on each scene (the commentary track washes out most of the audio from each scene, so you won't really get the scene without watching it first without the commentary track).    Sadly, the deleted scenes contain some of the best jokes and gags in the entire movie, as well as a somewhat spectacular unfinished battle scene with a living tree.  There is one scene in particular in which a rereading of the tale Cinderella is given a comically spooky twist with some creative saw-playing, and which ends with a great riff on necrophelia.  The deleted scenes also explain a lot of the plot discontinuities that one feels on watching the final - edited - version of the film.  These plot jumps include the strange bit with the snails at the beginning, how Angelika (Lena Headley) escapes from her French captors near the end, and numerous other comments and references that seem out of place throughout the film and are better explained upon viewing the deleted scenes.  Another great moment between Cavali (Peter Stormare) and Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) provides a hillarious cap to the ending of the dinner scene in the castle.    Thecommentary is also quite enlightening, as Terry Gilliam explains why these jewels of scenes were cut from the final movie.  He laments that each scene had to be cut because of the pacing of the film - a fault of the writing rather than the direction - and pokes fun at the digital DVD medium, challenging fans to recut the film with the deleted scenes.
B0000028RR|4.0|If ever there were a record that did what it said on the tin, then this is it, and when it's good it's sublime. Boy there are some fantastic moments on this record. Rage Against the Machine dates from that brief point in time when it looked like rock, funk and rap were going to merge, amalgamate, and go off in a beautiful new direction. Where Faith No More and the Chili Peppers were ultimately more progressive and adventurous, Rage Against the Machine sticks firmly to its elemental knitting: Loud, HUGE heavy rock riffing, and loud, shouty, angry lyrics.<br /><br />While no doubt there will be those who disagree, in my view what makes this record is the band, not the singer: in Bombtrack, Killing in the Name..., Bullet in the Head, Settle for Nothing, you have some of the greatest heavy rock riffs committed to vinyl. Zack de la Rocha's vocal contribution, on the other hand, is fine as long as you don't listen to it as such, but treat it as some sort of additional percussive instrument. In some cases, this is easy to do (Killing in the Name... for example), since the words don't seem to make a great deal of sense anyway. But as the record wears on, de la Rocha's swearing for effect and continued complaining about school and the system begins to grate, and the listening experience accordingly palls - a pity, because the band becomes more explorational as the record goes on, too.<br /><br />Surprise surprise, the next record the band released (Evil Empire) was as silly as it sounded, and after a third go the band realised what the problem was: De la Rocha was booted out (I mean, \\"quit, citing artistic differences\\") and replaced (sub nom AudioSlave) by the outstanding Chris Cornell from Soundgarden, and the band renounced explicit left-wing whining for just getting on and making music. Good move, all round. De la Rocha, who hasn't renounced left-wing whining, is currently residing with Spinal Tap in the \\"where are they now\\" file, AudioSlave has its third album due out later this year.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonut later this year. <br /> <br />Olly Buxton
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Okay, so its another sci-fi action with a female lead.  These sci-fis tend to fizzle at the box office (see Cat Woman, Elektra and Underworld).  The only ones in recent memory that cracked the $100 million mark is Angelina's Tomb Raider 1 & 2.  But that came with a set audience.  The game was accessible, far more so than the original MTV Aeon Flux animated series, which had only built up a cult following. <br />Translating something so dark and alternative was always going to be a challenge.  Not going the black vinyl and leather look of The Matrix and perpetual rain and gloom of Bladerunner, The Crow and any Batman was a welcome change.   <br />Sure, it took a while to get into the story and the plot was only revealed half way through but at the end everything falls into place.  I have not seen the original Aeon Flux MTV series, just snippets and what I have seen reminds me a lot of The Animatrix and 2000 AD. <br />But if you're an original Aeon Flux fan, then give this movie a chance.  Understand that in most Hollywood quarters the bottom line in profits and returns is what counts and some producers have to toe the line if they want a movie made. (Hence Bladerunner's watered down ending).   <br />So, in this version of Aeon Flux the producers have had to find a medium between being faithful to the source and at the same time being accessible to the general public. <br />The budget was not huge and there was minimal CGI but the action sequences were excellent.  Although there should have been more. <br />Charlize should stand above the other female action leads.  This is better than Elektra, Catwoman and Underworld.  I enjoyed Underworld and hey, Kate Beckinsale in skintight leathers is hot, but the doom and gloom (which seems to be a constant in any vampire/werewolf movie) was just too much. <br /> <br />All in all, Aeon Flux was more hit than miss. <br />
6305428271|5.0|Dangerous Minds starring the tough as nails Michelle Pfeiffer as ex-marine turned English teacher, Louanne Johnson is proabably her finest performance onscreen. Pfeiffer is such a raw, timeless actress. Her portrayals never seem fake or over-indulgent. How come she hasn't done a movie since 2002's White Oleander? Please come back to us Michelle, we love your incredible work. Dangerous Minds is kind of like To Sir with Love, Stand and Deliver and Blackboard Jungle but with a better plot and ending. I love her southern accent in the film, very cool! More than just a student/mentor film, this film is an under-rated gem, buy it as soon as possible.
B000F48D3C|5.0|<br /> <br />I agree with the other poster on the extended blackhawk down.I think the new footage makes a much more layered story.

B00000099Y|5.0|I'd review this album but that would slander everything Tool represents.
B00005JOVH|4.0|X-men the last stand is a movie that was highly anticipated since X2: Mutants United. Going in, I felt a very high tense moment thinking that this movie would be bad. But, as always, I knew that whether bad or good to me, to another person it would be totally different. I've read only a few, maybe about twenty or so, of the original x-men comics so I think that chances are that this movie will most likely be ripped apart from that fan-base. I'm sure there will be things that they liked and did not like.<br /><br />For me, X-men last stand truely stuck out as the end of the trilogy but not necessarily the end of the concept. Lord knows that they have Wolverine, Magneto, and the students spin-offs in the works.<br /><br />This movie doesn't pick up right where it left off, but rather jumps back and forth in time to give us some new information regarding the surrounding characters. Wolverine looks the same if not a little more gruffier in the last two movies. But, sadly, some parts were trimmed down in order to fit everyone in. That aspect is the one that I didn't like about this film. They crammed too many characters in with very little screen time if any.<br /><br />Although, I will say that \\"Beast\\"(Kelsey Gramer) was born to play that role and is needed in this movie. He plays a pivitol role between politician and mutant, which is a clever twist considering that his name is beast.<br /><br />As for the story, I think it was well-crafted, workable, intriguing. Epic? Well . . . almost epic. They could've made the movie longer and they could've added more mutants and given them more screen time. Plus, there were shocks in this movie that I wasn't ready for. But I will say that it held my attention and it convinced me to stay. I would say that it is just a notch below Epic. It's more in the \\"Grand\\" scale if you ask me.<br /><br />Some say that the characters didn't have enough depth to them. But, there were already two whole feature-length movies explaining the characters so I say how much more depth do you need? Everyone knows all there is to know about the characters.<br /><br />See it to believe it. Watch The Last Stand!eed? Everyone knows all there is to know about the characters.      See it to believe it. Watch The Last Stand!
B000005JA8|5.0|Trout Mask Replica is one of my favorite albums.  It was the first Beefheart album I ever got, and it's still in my subconscious.  This is the album that my brother refused, or to put it more accurately, couldn't, finish.  My brother, who was a reasonably intelligent individual, played side one, and could not bring himself to finish it.  He was too scared.  He literally was terrified of it, and didn't understand how I could not only listen to it, but love it.  It's one of the most unique, greatest albums ever made.  The album is intimidiating and scary all at the same time.  I loved this thing from day one.<br /><br />I loved the surreal, beautiful lyrics, and lately, I love the intricate music.  This is one of Zappa's most memorable productions.  The Magic Band is unbelievable in their precision and intensity.  Beefhart would brag about how he wrote all the songs in 8 1/2 hours.  This isn't true.  The Magic Band had a lot more to do with this album than is usually reported.  This, Lick My Decals Off, Baby, and Ice Cream for Crow are my favorite Beefhart albums.  There is nothing in rock (or any genre of music) quite like this.  Favorites of mine:  Pachuco Cadaver, Hair Pie (both bakes), My Human Gets Me Blues, Ella Guru, Frownland, and Orange Claw Hammer.  This could make you insane.  Perhaps that's why my brother wouldn't listen to the rest of it.  Go ahead, go insane.  Embrace the chaos of the Captain.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|One thing the Peppers have always prided themselfs with is the fact they never try to duplicate the sound of their previous works. Stadium Arcadium is a perfect example of this. It's amazing to me that a band that has been around so long can still put out fresh sounding music while maintaing their trademark sound. <br /> <br />I do agree with some others that the album is a bit of an overkill, and does have too many mid-tempo songs. Personally, it would have been great to have a few more \\"harder\\" songs put into the mix. \\"Around the World\\" \\"Can't Stop\\" type songs would have been welcomed addition.  <br /> <br />If anyone hasen't heard. Tom Petty is taking the Peppers to court claiming that \\"Dani California\\" is a rip off of his \\"Mary Janes Last Dance\\". I've listened to them both and Tom might have a case. :))) <br /> <br />This album is packed with at least ten above average songs and about 5 great songs and well worth buying.
B000FIMG68|2.0|I'm sorry to say that this show has been spiraling downward this past season. I was a pretty big fan of the first though. In the second, there are so many new mysteries that's it's hard to keep track, and almost no answers to any of them. I found myself getting so confused that I just stopped watching entire episodes towards then end. And let me tell you something, if you miss an episode, you'll be lost yourself. I have to say, it was a great idea, but if they don't start answering the questiosn that they throw at veiwes, they're going to burn.
B00005JOSS|5.0|If you enjoy love stories, then you should delight as much in this modern day fairy tale as my wife and I did. Sandra Bullock (one of my favorite actresses) as Dr. Kate Forster and Keanu Reeves as Alex Wyler complement each other extremely well and manage to develop a tangible chemistry despite the unique nature of their \\"long distance\\" (in time) relationship. However, you have to be prepared to suspend your usual conception of the relationship of time and place and accept unconditionally the truly unusual and scientifically fictional aspects of the storyline. This film is about emotions, interpersonal relationships and personal discovery, and needs to be engaged with your heart, not your mind. <br /> <br />CAUTION: it was obvious from the comments of other moviegoers who watched the film with us that our enthusiasm was not universally shared. Perhaps understandably given several of Sandra's Bullock's previous films, some people obviously expected to see a typical romantic comedy, which this most definitely is not despite some truly funny sequences. Others seemed to be unable to let go of their attempt to rationally analyze the techniques which the story utilized to further the relationship between Kate and Alex; this trait led to their inability simply to accept the facts as the writer and producer chose to present them in furtherance of the story and thus distracted from the essence of the film, which is the development of the central characters' relationship and the mystery of how the story will conclude. And finally, a few seemed bewildered that anyone would find such a ridiculous story appealing and frustrated that they had wasted almost two hours of their time watching it.   <br /> <br />As the film begins, Kate and her female dog Jack are ending their tenancy at an architecturally  unique LAKE HOUSE and moving into a modern new apartment in downtown Chicago near the hospital where she is on staff. She leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant, which Alex finds when he moves into the house. Thus, very early in the film, the four main actors in this drama have already been introduced - Kate, Alex, Jack, and THE LAKE HOUSE itself. However, the key plot twist of what briefly appears a rather conventional and undoubtedly otherwise pedestrian romance (which would simply be a showcase for the stars) is introduced. It is a concept familiar to science fiction fans but seldom used in other genres; specifically time shifting together with some aspects of parallel universes. Since what has happened is incidental to the story and never explained, it is not clear at any particular point in the story what rules will apply to the situations in which the characters find themselves. (N.B. This film should definitely not be included in the genre of science fiction, it involves neither time travel or futurism.) <br /> <br />However, when Alex replies to Kate's note and a correspondence ensues,  their initial misunderstandings soon turn to disbelief when she claims to be living in 2006 and he is in 2004. What! How could she move out and he then move in?  Despite their incredulity, they eventually both become convinced that their lives really have been linked through some sort of time warp. Of course, since this is a love story they then both become increasingly attracted to each other  (Remember, you can't expect to understand how the intermediary device of the magic mailbox operates, just enjoy the flag waving which results.) The story is incredibly cleverly constructed, with several threads gradually coming together and increasingly causing their lives to become intertwined. THE LAKE HOUSE, a memorable edifice built on stilts and reached by a walkway over the water is reminiscent of Phillip Johnson's signature Glass House. It not only unites Alex and Kate but plays a crucial role in Alex's family history and his strained relationship with his father, the noted architect Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer).  <br /> <br />The enjoymentof the film is in fact heightened by its leisurely pace, the cast (and the supporting roles are uniformly well acted) has time to develop the story and let us get to know Kate and Alex as they get to know each other; thus we also experience their frustration that thyey may have to accept the fact that they will be resigned to living separate lives. The most difficult aspect of the film for me to follow was the fact that the sequence of  the scenes as presented to the moviegoer was not always immediately clear. Not only are Alex and Kate simultaneously living in different years, but their individual experiences are not presented in chronological order. There are frequent flashbacks and the jumps forward to their individual present day selves, interspersed with one chance meeting of which only Alex is aware. Remember, concentrate on their story - not on trying to figure out how it is occurring. One incredibly deft touch is the use of a copy of Jane Austen's PERSUASION as both a very important point of contact in their relationship and also with the story as a metaphor for their situation. <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you enjoy fantasy, then you should enjoy this unconventional love story. In addition, you also get as a bonus to try to figure out how an appealing dog such as Jack could somehow live with both Kate and Alex and maybe you will even receive a few insights about architecture. Just remember to pay attention to details, because at various times during the film events occur whose complete relevance only becomes clear much later. Interestingly enough, if you do pick up these clues, while they foreshadow some of the later events (in the sequence in which the movie unfolds), they in no way make the eventual outcome predictable and thus do not spoil the story.  Fun, interesting, well acted, emotionally satisfying and unpredictable enough to keep your interest - certainly a more attractive set of attributes than most of today's film fare. <br /> <br />Tucker Andersen
B00005JKG5|5.0|An awesome transfer to dvd!  The sound and picture are excellent.  What was already a fabulous movie on vhs/laserdisc..is even better on dvd.  How many times can I buy it?
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I too was initially disappointed with the CD.  I had been listening to Dark Side of the Moon for months.  I only became reinterested in Pink Floyd after the Live 8 concert. <br /> <br />But after I really listened to the CD as a David Gilmour CD, not Pink Floyd, I loved it.  I feel the words are inspiring, the music itself is sensational and no one plays guitar like David. <br /> <br />I am on an island when I listen to this CD.
B000F48CD8|4.0|musically the raconteurs prove to be genius. a careful blend of simple melody and abnormal harmony that comes together strangely but amazingly delightful. i was impressed with the entire album. however, the lyrics????? way below par. i was horrified that such musicians could come together so nicely and then kill it with absurd lyrics. a five year old could have written the chorus to much of their music. i mean come on! \\"you've found yourself a friend, that knows you well But no matter what you do, you'll always feel as though you tripped and fell\\" get real. but the raconteurs prove to be refreshing (even from the white stripes who would find a great bass line and then blow it out of proportion by repeating it constantly for the entire song)above all, definitely a good album.
0792843584|5.0|If not the greatest western ever made, one of the three best, including THE SEARCHERS and HIGH NOON. The story, the settings, the music (absolutely captivating),everything is great. I love every minute of it. I've seen it more than 15 times and I would see it over and over again. It takes a great position among the greatest westerns ever made, such as (besides the ones already mentioned) THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, LITTLE BIG MAN, CIMARRON (the 1931 version), STAGECOACH, SHANE, THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY and UNFORGIVEN. There you have my western decalogue. To rate it just with 5 stars does not seem fair: it deserves 10.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|It ranks among the greatest miniseries I've ever seen, in the manner of ROOTS, I CLAUDIUS, UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS, THE THORN BIRDS, QB VII,HOLOCAUST or ANGELS IN AMERICA. Quite faithful to the novel by Larry McMurtry (whom I had the honor to have dinner with when he came to Chile several years ago), this six-hour epic movie gives the audience one of the most fascinating time pieces ever done for TV. The actings are superb, specially the leading roles (Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Angelica Huston and Diane Lane). The locations will take your breath away and the music by Basil Polidouris is simply haunting. Engaging from the very first sequences, it grasps you and never leaves you. The last hour makes the rocks weep. Don't miss it. In one word: A MASTERPIECE!
B000008LIX|4.0|I didn't know much of their music but went to their gig in The Hague, Netherlands in 2005. <br /> <br />After having been put through a dreadful support act by Dreadlock Pussy which consisted of 6 band members, it struck me how Therapy? managed to produce such a terrific, full sound with just 3 members. <br /> <br />Later that night they played Isolation and this song really hit me. I just stood there in awe. The atmosphere that song brings! It was stuck in my head the rest of the week. Amazing! That song alone is worth buying this album.
B00005JNRY|4.0|Pixar and Disney are a wonderful team. After huge successes like \\"Toy Story\\" \\"A Bug's Life\\" \\"Toy Story 2\\" \\"Monster's Inc.\\" and \\"Finding Nemo,\\" they come out with another Box Office winner in \\"Cars.\\" But compared to their previous releases, I rank this latest offering last. It just isn't as well written a story, and I believe most will be disappointed to find very few actual racing scenes. And nowhere near as funny as their previous releases. One highlight though, is the message it brings. A reminder to all of us that, winning is not nearly as important, as how we treat others in the process of achieving our goals. Something every child in the audience needs to hear, and possibly every adult even more so.
B00005U122|5.0|Like most others here, I love this DVD - along with Symphonic Yes, it now has pride of place in my collection.  However, I'm a bit amazed that almost nobody has mentioned the drummer (Graham Broad).  I reckon he did a top job - very tight, controlled and focussed.  His sound was like the backbone of the whole concert, while the guitars and keyboards, all of them excellent, wound their magical way around it. I especially like watching him hard at work at the start of \\"Time\\".  <br /> <br />As for the setlist, I don't think I could have asked for a more representative and richer sampling from the Pink Floyd collection.  I'm not very familiar with Roger's more recent stuff, but I'm beginning to get to know and enjoy those as well. <br /> <br />This is a DVD which I regularly listen to (up loud, when I'm alone!), and which I don't think I'll ever get sick of.
B00005JP01|4.0|So the fast and the furious series has had a reputation for bad plots, bad acting, and nothing but racing and scandelous looking women... but, I do believe the third installment of this series is by far the best. If you look past Lucas Blacks bad teeth and backwater country boy act, the movie isn't so bad. The cars were simply amazing and all the asian women, running around in short shorts and skirts so small they shouldn't even be wearing anything, made me practically blow a load in the movie theatre. Even if the import scene just isn't for you and you're a fan of the classics all the way, there's still a few scenes which will throw you in your seat. Sure there are many unrealistic parts where people would most likely not have lived from a dangerous crash or stunts but lets face it.. it's a movie... The action is awesome, the visual effects are smoking, and it keeps you on your toes and interested. I think the most exhilerating thing from this film was the orange RX-7 the character \\"Hahn\\" drove which was constantly bouncing off it's rev limiter and leaving trails of smoke in it's path. That car.. was so nuts. Go see it, watch some racing, have fun.
1932100660|5.0|There are good scientific arguments out there for eating or not eating animals, this book argueing for the latter. If you pay attention very closely to how your body reacts to different foods, it will tell you what is right and wrong for it. Self awareness is key to correct eating. After about 4 years of paying attention and experimenting with food, my body has choses for me a near vegan whole foods diet. I feel at my optimum physically and mentally with such a diet. Sometimes on rare occasions, my body tells me to eat salmon or eggs to feel right, so I do, and it feels right.  <br />Science and studies are all well and good, but self awareness will always help you make the right decisions on what to eat, how much to eat, and when to exercise. This self awareness can be obtained through meditation/yoga. Most people who practice these techniques have a tendency to eat healthier only because they pay attention to what their body is telling them. <br />You will also find many \\"champions of health\\" like Paul Bragg and Jack Lalane sticking to a vegetarian,whole-foods diet. Many herbivores claim to feel good, look good, and live long healthy lives, the same people who would supposedly lack the DHA's, EPA's, Vitamin B12s, and certain amino acids in their diet that can only be gotten form meat. There must be something to be said for that. I found this book enjoyable and hits on the same basic principles I've heard time and time again about the benefits of a vegetarian/vegan diet.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|I must admit, I am not a major Hans Zimmer fan but do have a small selection of his scores on cd. However, I can honestly say that Zimmer's score for The Da Vinci Code is, without doubt, one of the best soundtracks avaliable at the moment; if not amongst the best ever written. <br /> <br />His score is simple, quiet and yet, at the same time, stirringly beautiful. I have read reviews on other websites stating that Zimmer has made no effort to create major themes for the different characters; I disagree. Having listened to it many times since I bought it, I believe there are several cues, motiffs etc that represent not only the characters of Sophi, Silas, but also different emotions etc. <br /> <br />The stand out track on this album, in my opinion, is Chevaliers de Sangraal - it is absolutely breathtaking. A simply brilliant piece of music; even before seeing the film, I could picture this music being played as the final resting place of the Holy Grail is located; the timing is correct, the sound is right - it's just perfect for such an event. <br /> <br />If you get one classical, or soundtrack album this year; make it this one.
B000031WD9|3.0|The way I see it there are five American Pie movies at this point depending on how you look at this things. The pathethic thing is that I have all five of the DVDs for these movies sitting on my desk right here in front of me as I write this review: \\"American Pie,\\" \\"American Pie 2,\\" \\"American Wedding,\\" \\"American Pie Presents Band Camp,\\" and \\"Date Movie.\\" Although the last one is only loosely related to the other four, I still lump it in with the others. Of these five movies the first movie is the best and the second movie is a close runner-up. The other three are just so-so. The first two both have highly memorable scenes that were just plain hilarious. The original \\"American Pie\\" had the webcam scene and \\"American Pie 2\\" had the walkie-talkie scene. None of the other movies have standout scenes which compare to these. Although the humor may be scatological at times, in the first two movies the humor was inspired. The humor in the other three movies had much less of an impact. So, I'd recommend getting this one and if you really like it get the second, but be cautious on the other three... they may not be worth your time or money.
0451526643|4.0|This story follows the lives of two good-looking, hip, and sufficiently wealthy people. They do not need to work, and in a sense don't know how, and this, among other privileges, eventually leads to their undoing. Their leisure condemns them. I read this book while I was going through a season of envying the people in my life who are independently wealthy, and don't have to punch an alarm clock each morning to \\"join the fray.\\" They seem oblivious to the frustrations I encounter working two jobs, watching my budget, buying sensibly. This story served as a reminder that, while challenging, my lifestyle of \\"earning my living\\" provides a healthy groundedness and sensibility that I may not get any other way.
0743457900|4.0|Le Carre transcends the limitations of being a genre writer because his psychological observations about human relationships apply to everyone.  We all must deal with sabotage, duplicity, and subtle deceptions in some ways and to some degree, and Le Carre's portrayal of these things is realistic and profound.  The extent to which you enjoy this book will depend in large part on how much you like to be kept guessing for hundreds of pages.  This goes not only for the ultimate whodunnit of the plot but even for many of the more minor details.  For this reason the book requires some patience and gives the intellect quite a workout.  But there is considerable achievement in Le Carre's ability to open up new questions even as he is stringing the reader along with breadcrumbs of facts to answer other questions.  The result is a hall of mirrors structure to the novel that resembles the very world he is writing about.
B00007163D|5.0|A major accomplishment for director James Foley. Working with a small budget, tight schedule, paying scale wages, and able to gather a cast of the finest stage and screen actors around to create this film version of the David Mamet play. <br />  The language is crude. The guys are a bunch of liars and cheats. They're all Vice Presidents and can  put a viable spin on buying land in a hazardous materials dumpsite.. <br /> It's infighting in the raw and probably most realistic. <br />  The Mamet dialogue will force you to pay attention. <br />  The acting is flawless. <br />  If you don't hate Alec Baldwin 2 minutes into his performance you have a serious mental disorder. <br />  Then again, you have to feel a little sorry for Jonathan Pryce who plays the gullible mensh. <br /> The Machine says the leads are weak. He's talking about sales. The leads in this film are anything but weak. Maybe even frightening.  <br />  Bravo.
B000000OSE|4.0|This was the first GNR album I had ever bought - I was 15 years-old. Back then, I only was interested in buying the latest album that a band came out with. Hence I also bought Metallica's black album, Nirvana's Nevermind and Skid Row's Slave To the Grind. That's why I didn't buy Appetite back then.<br /><br />Anyway, the only songs I had heard before buying it was \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"November Rain\\". I was quite amazed at all the other songs on it. Whenever my mom pissed me off, I would go to my room and blast this album on my stereo - I listened to this album more often as a teenager than I do now. This is a really good album to listen to if you're really mad at someone, especially if the person is a woman. It's really good for letting out your frustrations.
0930289234|2.0|Watchmen is bloated and overwritten. Moore drags the story on far too long, and his obsession with literary significance destroys any sense of clarity and power(an all too common thing in comics now). I gave it 2 stars just because of Gibbon's adequate pencils and character designs. One of the few interesting artistic elements is that very juxtaposition between flashy, hollow writing and relatively solid drawing. Unfortunately, if this project were to be done now, it wouldn't even have the relatively solid drawing.
B000000OSG|5.0|When I bought Use Your Illusion I back in Jan. 1992, I didn't realize that the different colors represented 2 separate albums. I wasn't able to buy Use Your Illusion II until I was 18. It was a good thing I waited, so that I could mature a bit, because if I had bought it when I was 15, I would have been disappointed.<br /><br />I was quite amazed at the tone of Use Your Illusion II - it was more laid back, and seemed more artistic, whereas part 1 was more aggressive, angry metal.<br /><br />The songs I really like on this album are Civil War, 14 Years, Yesterdays, Knockin' On Heaven's Door, Breakdown, So Fine, Estranged, and You Could Be Mine.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely consider this album to be a classic - it seems to have a lot of influence from older rock bands, and it seems to be GNR's most artistic album they've ever come out with. It's very different. Too bad they ended up going on hiatus for so long.
B000000W5N|5.0|This is the one to have in your collection.  More than any other release 'Sticky Fingers' captures the essence of the band during their climb to superstar, jet-set status.  Much has been made of the Jimmy Miller production and how this cd is one of the big 3 releases by the band - Beggars Banquent, Sticky Fingers, Let It Bleed - and it's all true.<br /><br />I've always loved the songs on Sticky Fingers and it is awesome to hear it on this remastered cd.  If you have any interest at all in the Stones then you'll want this in your collection.
B000002INR|5.0|I remember when I first saw Skid Row's \\"18 & Life\\" video on MTV in 1989 - I was hooked on them since then. Also Sebastian Bach is really cute, which also helped the band become popular. Also, at the time, I was into really heavy metal, I didn't care for the \\"whimpy\\" bands back then - I liked bands with squealing guitars, and Skid Row and Motley Crue were the only bands that I heard on the radio or saw on MTV that had the squealing guitars (I didn't have much of an allowance so wasn't able to buy my own music, Metallica wasn't played on the radio in my town back then), so you can imagine why I liked Skid Row so much.<br /><br />For the past decade, my taste in metal has changed - I prefer glam metal over all other metal now. Or at least bands with really cute guys - that would obviously include Skid Row.<br /><br />I listen to this album almost everyday, at least when I'm in the heavy metal mood, this is the first album I put on. Anyway, this is THE album to listen to - it is what landed Skid Row on the map, and every song on this album is good to bang your head to. I love it!
B00007KWHG|5.0|I wasn't around in the 1960s-1970s and people find it strange that someone my age loves to listen to music before my time. I'll tell you why: music back then was PHENOMONAL. I never would've known anything about Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons and their music if it wasn't for my bus driver who listened to the oldies station while taking me home. This greatest hits collection is *excellent* and one of a kind.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|the best movie i've seen all year, and probably the best i'll see all year.
B00005JOSS|5.0|This was a fascinating movie!!!  Based on time anomalies and artistic ways of showing communication between characters that reside in 2004 and 2006 so to speak, it's well done, artistic, AND Keanu Reeves really comes of age in this movie.  He was excellent...very believable and relaxed into his character.  His emotional portrayal comes thru as true to life.  He proves himself as a major actor in this movie. It was delightful to see Sandra Bullock in something besides a thriller or a silly comedy.  She plays a real person and was wonderful--not overdone or underdone--just perfect.  I recommend this movie highly. (Please don't ruin the end for others if you happen to guess it!!! I only guessed it because I'm a writer. My opinion: It was written by experts & comparable to  M . Night Shamalya.)
B000002UJQ|1.0|OK Computer was one of the most overhyped, overrated, redundant critical favourites to ever come out of the 1990s.  It is almost as bad as Nirvana's attrocity against music known as Nevermind; and as you can see by my screen name, I hate Nirvana with an extreme passion!  It is hard to believe that rock critics often compare this mindless, brainless cr.ap to progressive rock gods Pink Floyd.  Radiohead in the same league as Pink Floyd?  Putting a horrible, untalented piece of sh.it band like Radiohead in the same category as those giants of melody and musicianship is nothing short of sacrilige!  Those rock critics will burn in He.ll for their blasphemy!!!  Can't they see what a vast difference there is between those two bands?  The most obvious difference between these bands is that Pink Floyd is the better of the two; Radiohead on the other hand has no talent what so ever, and that mindless, brainless rubbish they produce is complete and pointless noise pollution.  Haven't Radiohead heard of a little thing called a memorable riff?  All the great bands have them...Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Rush, Yes, Van Halen, etc...if you don't have recognizable riff, your song just falls flat on its @ss and doesn't go anywhere.  Radiohead is a perfect example of a band whose music is completely flat and stale because they're too da.mn stu.pid and talentless to come up with anything that makes an impression on the listener.  Their songs all sound exactly the same and just drone along with no hint of variation of any kind.  At times, OK Computer sounds more like the monotonous hum of an electric fan than anything even remotely passable as music.  It is not even music at all.  It is just a steady droning sound!  Listening to Radiohead is a gigantic pain in the @ss, not to mention the ears of anybody with any musical taste!  If you've heard all the hype about this album and how it is supposedly the \\"Greatest Album of All Time\\" or whatever it is the rock critics say about it, whateveryou do DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!  I fell for the hype about them back in 1997 and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever made!  $25.00 wasted on this worthless piece of cr.ap!   And TO think that some people actually enjoy this tuneless,  mindless, brainless racket...it simply boggles the mind!   Radiohead's music is so annoying that if I was in prison in a place where they were playing Radiohead, I'd strongly consider han.ging myself just to put myself out of my misery.  Having to endure the horrid sounds of Radiohead eminating from the speakers is a fate worse than death!  RAdiohead...they are the worst band the world has ever known!
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I don't know, how do you not love a movie that includes lines like this one, about women in Los Angeles:<br /><br />\\"I swear to God, it's like somebody took America by the East Coast, and shook it, and all the normal girls managed to hang on.\\"<br /><br />And that's what Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is like: Relentlessly clever dialogue, witty screenplay, extremely self-aware without crossing the line into being eye-glazing about it.<br /><br />Essentially an update of a second-tier LA-based noir film, the film moves so quickly and is so funny that many audiences may not catch that they're watching a film that could have once starred Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart. There's the beaten-to-a-pulp detective in over his head, the rich movers and shakers who can crush him at will, the dream girl who's alternately sexually available and loathes him, dead bodies that get moved around, seemingly on their own and lots more standard bits.<br /><br />Toss in Robert Downey, Jr. doing his best work in years, Val Kilmer, funny again for the first time in decades and the new-to-me-but-ought-to-be-a-star Michelle Monaghan, and you've got a solid, solid cast capable of making the clever script pop. Heck, there's even some footage from a truly awful 1980s Corbin Bernsen action movie, which isn't something you see every day.<br /><br />It's hard to figure how this got overlooked in theaters, but no fans of buddy movies (the film is written and directed by the creator of the first -- and vastly superior to the sequels -- Lethal Weapon movie), Downey or Kilmer should miss this.<br /><br />Sensationally great fun.
B00005JOSS|4.0|Not since Jeannot Szwarc's gooey \\"Somewhere in Time\\" (1980) have I seen a movie so willing to suspend credibility and logic for the sake of conveying an idealistic romance, but Argentinean director Alejandro Agresti (in his American film bow) and screenwriter David Auburn somehow manage to keep their convoluted fable afloat despite the layers of fantasy-driven contrivance. Underneath it all, the 2006 movie is really an old-fashioned 1950's-style woman's picture, and one wonders what Douglas Sirk could have done with the material in a lavish Ross Hunter production. Instead, we are given a precocious, time-jumping tale detailing the improbable romance between Alex Wyler, an angst-driven architect who has become a condo developer, and Kate Forster, a lonely doctor. Their common thread is the unique glass house designed by Alex's father that sits literally on a lake near Chicago, where both have lived at different times. They correspond through handwritten letters, but the twist is that they are existing two years apart and have only a magical mailbox to transcend the time difference.<br /><br />The fantastical premise sounds silly, and to some degree it is, but in a surprisingly effective manner, the filmmakers and cast take it all quite seriously. It's all about execution and the emotional subtleties in the script. Luckily, Auburn dances around the credibility issues with a swooning sense of romance. The externals capture the feeling as well - Alar Kivilo's crisp, autumnal-to-wintry cinematography and Meg Everist's set decorations both capture Chicago at its most cinematic; and Rachel Portman's evocative score filled with music from baby boomer icons like Carole King and Paul McCartney. There is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in Sandra Bullock's Kate since the actress has played variations of the same lonely girl over the years, though she has gratefully dropped her perky demeanor for a more resonant performance. Keanu Reeves is sincere as Alex, though a bit too overtly new-age-male to compensate for his innate inscrutability. Still, aside from Bullock's sharply vituperative turn in Paul Haggis' \\"Crash\\", this is probably the best work either has done in a while.<br /><br />Individually, Reeves and Bullock convey the solitude of their characters with a minimum of fuss, and when they do connect, they generate real chemistry in rather creative ways. That's what really matters with a movie like this. The supporting cast consists mostly of unsurprising stock characters, in particular, Dylan Walsh as Kate's insecure intended, Morgan, and Lynn Collins as Alex's anxious co-worker, Mona. There are three international veterans who inhabit their roles with more verve and individuality - Shohreh Aghdashloo worldly wise as Kate's workaholic colleague; Christopher Plummer (who coincidentally co-starred in \\"Somewhere in Time\\") hammy as Alex's irascible father; and Dutch actress Willeke van Ammelrooy (of \\"Antonia's Line\\") full of romanticism as Kate's widowed mother. As contrived as it is (and if you have seen Brad Anderson's \\"Happy Accidents\\", you will notice plot similarities), the ending does satisfy in a way loyal to its genre. The movie is definitely a wallow but a well-done one.ge-male to compensate for his innate inscrutability.

B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie will always be one of my favorites. Though more entertaining when I was younger, I view it as a great trip down memory lane. A humorous story of kids and teens trying to save their beloved 'Goondocks' from rich developers.

0743487486|2.0|I was very excited when I read this book, but after a few weeks of trying out some of the philosophies, it lost it's warm glow.  Firstly, I don't find many of the assumptions the author makes logical.  One of his premises is that a time-out or withheld privilage is actually \\"love withdrawal\\" He presents a lot of research that shows \\"love withdrawal\\" methods of disipline can be ineffective or undermine self-control/esteem, but he never really proves that children experience timeouts or privilage loss as love withdrawal.  By this rational everytime you don't give a child what they want, you are showing them you don't love them. I tried to check into the research mentioned in his book, unfortunately it seemed very difficult to find, but I did find many articles and papers online that contradicted the findings he writes about.<br /><br /> My three year old daughter is very smart, fun loving and strong willed...when I was attempting to use the unconditional parenting philosophy, my daughters testing, hitting and tantrums increased quite a bit.  Obviously children are individual and different philosophies will work differently, but for my determined three year old I find clear consistent limits and consequences go the farthest toward keeping things on an even keel.<br /><br />I am also put off by the emotional language used in this book. The author's use of loaded phrases such as \\"unconditional love\\", \\"love withdrawal\\" punishments and many more suggests that traditional reward punishment is not just ineffective or counterproductive, but hurtful and unloving. Really, it  just sound like emotional manipulation, which I find quite disconcerting in an author selling parenting materials. (Gosh, if you feel bad enough, you might just buy the DVD and the workbook too.)
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I will start by saying Ang Lee's directing is another subject, as it is one of the most stunningly filmed movies I have ever seen. I don't believe that making this movie was brave, as someone has also said before. You don't have to be brave to tell a story you know is very good, fictional or not. I do believe, however, that one is brave in watching it. You don't have to be gay or straight to have curiosity about the movie, and I think either side would have their preconcieved ideas disappointed. It is also, in my opinion, one of the most terrifying movies I have seen in my entire life, aside from the first time I saw (the original) \\"The Omen.\\" If you have ever loved someone in your life, or let a feeling pass by without its communication - you will know what I mean by this. By the end of this movie, every one of those moments will come heaping down upon you, and you will understand the magic of the story. Watch this movie, and you will find yourself in one of the characters. Watch it and it will tell you something about yourself. The real story is about the chances we've taken or lost to find real, unspeakably pure happiness. <br /> <br />It is a love story, but this time it is not impossible. *That* is terrifying.
0812550706|5.0|I don't know where to start. This book touches so many feelings. It is probably the most intense book I've ever read. The book never settles down to happiness, it just keeps building and building fast-paced and suspenseful from the first page to the last even after it should have settled down. I did not find it a happy book at all. If fact I am surprised I even liked it, but it has become one of my favorite books in just the time it took to read it. It shows the \\"worst\\" side of human nature. How we lie and manipulate to save ourselves. How we always believe the worst in people. And mostly just how for humanity will go far survival of their kind.<br /><br />If you are over 13 and under 9 thousand you need to read it. You will be swept up in its pages and into the future with Ender. You will feel what he feels and live what he lives. On the journey you will find something, learn something, and lose a little childish innocence that you didn't even know you had. You might not like it, but you will be glad you came.
B00003CXI1|4.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is the first film in a seven film series, based on the first Harry Potter book of the same name by J.K. Rowling. <br /> <br />The film, like the book, sees young Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) receive an invitation to Hogwarts School of Wizardy and Witchcraft, discover that he's a wizard's child and gets caught up in the mystery of a strange package, a bank robbery, a forbidden third floor and suspicious teachers, along with his two newfound friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). <br /> <br />In the world of Harry Potter, illustrations, paintings and photographs move. I like to think of this film the same way. Rather than be a stand alone film, I see this film as a visual companion to the book, moving pictures that give you an idea of what everything in and around Hogwarts looks like, (like what being in a building full of moving stairways actually looks like, for instance) giving the fictional world just a bit more depth. It's not as if the film would be completly alienating to newcomers, not at all, its just that if I hadn't read the book beforehand, I'm sure I would have found things a bit harder to follow, as things move fairly quickly and there's an ever thickening plot to keep an eye on. <br /> <br />Everything looks great, and pretty much everybody is cast well. I particularly liked the choice of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I quite liked the fact that Warwick Davis (of \\"Willow\\" and \\"Leprechaun\\" fame) got a double role in this film, both as a banker of Gringotts and as Harry's charms teacher, Professor Flitwick. I reckon Warwick should do a film where he's a whole bunch of characters one day, it'd be great! <br /> <br />Fans of the book will notice that a couple of plot elements have been combined, making it easier to follow. Take, the baby dragon subplot, for instance. It needs to be taken home. In the book, Ron's brother's friends take it home toRomania, but in this film, Dumbledore does this, snipping out the book's reason for his absence. It's understandable they did this, and its not terribly major. <br /> <br />Included with this DVD is an extra disc of special features, that plays a bit like a DVD remote controlled point and click game. There are seven deleted scenes from the film to watch, but you'll have to work for it, going from virtual room to virtual room within Hogwarts School. Can you find the Philosopher's Stone that will turn menus to cutting room gold? If you don't have the patience for DVD games, there's plenty of other stuff to look at, including a virtual tour of Hagrid's cabin and the Gryffindor Common Room, a \\"Catch the Snitch\\" game and explanation of Quidditch, various montages of all your favourite characters, conceptual sketches, clickable every flavour beans to \\"eat\\", and an interview with director Chris Columbus and the producer of the film, David Heyman. <br /> <br />Definitely worth a look, though I'd definitely read the novel first. Fans will probably want to watch this again and again, I'm sure.
0684824906|5.0|\\"Team of Rivals:  The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\" is unlike any biography or history book which I have read before.  It would be best described as a multi-biography, centered on Abraham Lincoln.  While most biographies fill in some background on important figures in the life of their subject, \\"Team of Rivals\\" takes that to an entirely different level.  In addition to Abraham Lincoln, the book offers extensive biographies of William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edwin M. Stanton and Edward Bates who were the rivals referred to in the title.  It also contains a good biography of Mary Todd Lincoln.    The book does an outstanding job of explaining the delicate balancing act that Lincoln performed in making the decisions which ultimately kept the country together, and how he used his formal rivals to gage the feelings of the radicals and the conservatives, and the Democrats and the former Whigs, to decide when to act.  She shows how even early in his political career, he was able to make friends and earn the respect of former rivals.  The development of the friendship between Lincoln and Seward, and Lincoln and Stanton are tremendous stories, as is the ambition of Chase and how Lincoln handled that situation.  Mrs. Goodwin handles all the stories with an engaging style which brings them to life even after more than 100 years.    One can only imagine what would have happened if Lincoln had not been President during that period of our history, and if Seward had won the Presidency in his place.  It seems highly unlikely that Seward, or anyone else, would have been able to have kept the country together.  There has never been a President that did more to preserve the union than Lincoln, and Stanton's words when Lincoln died are perhaps the most fitting tribute:  \\"Now he belongs to the ages\\".    Doris Kearns Goodwin was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in history for \\"No Ordinary Time:  Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt:  The Home Front in World War II\\".   \\"Team of Rivals\\" wasawarded the `Book Prize for American history' by The New-York Historical Society, and it also received the 2006 Lincoln Prize awarded by Richard Gilder and Lewis Lehrman and administered by Gettysburg College.  It was also a finalist for the 2005 National Book Critics Circle Award for biographies.
B000E33VWW|2.0|S-L-O-W!  The pacing of this film almost put me to sleep and had I not seen it on DVD and had the capability to pause it every so often, I wouldn't have stayed with it.  Yes, Phillip Seymour Hoffman did a remarkable job portraying Capote, but in duplicating Capote's distracting, effeminate mannerisms and nasal, mousy voice, it was hard to pay attention to the story of the film. Clifton Collins, who portrayed Perry Smith, one of the killers, did a remarkable job which I thought was more noteworthy than Hoffman's efforts. <br /> <br />In short, I wouldn't recommend \\"Capote\\" and I don't understand what all the hype was about.  I guess the crowd that revered Capote saw to it that this DULL movie got nominated even though there were many better movies this year.
B000002LFZ|4.0|I don't really consider myself a Fleetwod Mac fan, and I don't know any of their music beyond this album. However, I really enjoy listening to this. Quite honestly, I was surprised by how many songs of theirs that I knew when I first listened to this \\"Greatest Hits.\\"     As is always the case with collections of this sort, I have noticed that other reviewers are disappointed with the song choices, especially because this doesn't reflect the early days of the group. I cannot attest to the validity of these claims. I can only state that the songs that have been chosen for this album are solid.    There are a few weird songs, like \\"Tusk\\" and \\"Big Love,\\" which include strange groaning and panting sounds in the background. But there are also some fantastic tracks, like \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" \\"Everywhere,\\" \\"Say You Love Me,\\" and \\"Little Lies.\\"     If you're a committed Fleetwood Mac fan, you may find other collections to be more representative of the entire history of the group. But for more casual fans like myself, this is a solid album that I happily recommend to folks who want to listen to some wonderful music from a great group.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|This movie is an especially revealing look at how the quest for oil causes great friction between Islam and the western world (and there is no good side here). The movie features an ensemble cast playing the various interest groups that interact with each other in their quest to profit from the oil beneath the sands of the middle east. It shows how our government's public side put's it best face on our dealings with corrupt regimes while it's covert side does whatever it must to assure a never ending supply of oil for our cars and SUVs.  George Clooney plays veteran CIA agent Bob Barnes. He is quietly being pushed aside, marginalized, after a politically driven oil deal goes awry. Jeffrey Wright plays corporate lawyer Bennett Holiday who is trying to bring together powerful legislators and his corporate sponsors to gain approval of a deal that would be very lucrative to all. Alexander Siddig skillfully plays a young Emir to be. He threatens to upset the apple cart when he begins to speak about new deals that would benefit all of the citizens of his oil rich country not just a handful of powerful and self indulgent Sheiks. This movie is provocative and revealing to the end.

B00005JLPK|5.0|I am a teacher of art to middle school juvenile offenders. We have studied Frida along with numerous others. Unfortunately I am restricted from showing the movie to \\"my kids\\". I do know that with the background knowledge I have given them (articles, documentary film), they are chomping at the bit to see this production. Personally, I believe it is the best representation of any artist I have ever studied. I would put \\"Frida\\" in the same category as \\"Lust for Life\\", the story of Vincent Van Gogh portrayed by Kirk Douglas and the \\"uppety\\" Gauguin (Anthony Quinn). Salma's portrayal of the mentally and physically wounded wife/artist are right on the mark. If you have read Frida's writings or studied her at all you will appreciate the richness of Salma's portrayal of her. The colors and sheer vibrance of the film transport you into her world. I would recommend this film to Bohemians and anyone wanting information on one of the greatest female \\"surrealist\\" painters (although she didn't appreciate being categorized as one!)that ever lived.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Here's a real review of this album, not a biased 1 star review, nor a Tool's-the-greatest-ever review.   <br /> <br />First, if you don't like \\"Third Eye\\" off AEnema, you won't like this album much.  Long, musically exploring tracks are the trademark (except \\"Vicarious\\").  There's a lot of influence from their previous albums on here.  Which, for me, is interesting to hear. <br /> <br />Second, there are some tracks that seem too long:  \\"Wings for Marie (pt.1)\\", \\"Lipan Conjuring\\", \\"Blame Hoffman\\", and \\"Vigenti Tres\\".  The so-called \\"filler\\" tracks.  If they would have been closer to AEnema length it would be better, plus would leave room for a couple more songs (which we could all deal with). <br /> <br />Thirdly, it does take a few listens to really get into this album.  The first few times, you'll find a couple songs to listen to.  The more you listen, the more tracks you'll want to listen to.  The only song I skip is \\"Lipan Conjuring\\".  It just seems out of place on here. <br /> <br />All that said, it's still the best album I've heard in awhile, beginning to end.  I listen to it at least once a day still (I usually get burnt out after a couple weeks on an album, then come back to it after a few weeks).  So, I feel it deserves 5*'s.  If you have a good stereo, turn this album up too.  It makes the listening experience that much better. <br /> <br />Also, for those who are going to buy the next APC before Tool again; keep waiting on the next APC album guys, because it's not coming.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Besides echoing the wonderful reviews, I can only lament the fact that, rather than having Maureen McGovern's beautiful voice singing the love theme, we have Margot Kidder doing a voice-over above an instrumental of the same.
0451191153|5.0|This novel is definitely one of the best books I have ever read.  It portrays Ayn Rand's philosophy called Objectivism through the lives of her characters.  Rand's character, Howard Roark, is truly role-model material.  I highly recommend this book to all teenagers and adults.
B000006NUW|5.0|A well-assembled box set containing just some of Motown's most golden and definitive classics. Nobody knew Motown Records was going to take off in the way it did. Berry Gordy intended to use his artists to break down the then racial barriers, intending to encapsulate a golden and distinct sound that would not only please a black audience but would too appeal to whites. Berry Gordys visions for the company paid off. Key artists like Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder attracted a huge following from both blacks and whites.  <br /> <br />Seemingly echoing the restrictions of ghetto life in Detroit (which is where Motown began) was the effective, bluesey Money (Thats What I Want) by Barret Strong, Motowns debut release. There is a raw, earthy feel to the classic that has stood the test of time impecably well. There is a strong injection of Rock and Roll on Motowns early releases though they found a more commercially favourable sound with vast elements of pop neatly blended into the production with The Marvelettes famous classic, Please Mr. Postman.  <br /> <br />The Marvelettes were Motowns premier female group and took the credit of delivering Motown its first chart topper. The Marvelettes didn't have an entirley successful run at Motown. Though they pumped out a sprinkling of fantastic hits eratically through the duration of the decade, their acheivements were pretty limited, probably as they were overshadowed by Martha Reeves And The Vandellas who too admitedly found themselves overshadowed by Motowns biggest act, Diana Ross And The Supremes. Both Martha and the Vandellas and Diana and the Supremes had individual and unique qualities of their own. A vast selection of Martha Reeves finest recordings turn up here from the sassy Come And Get These Memories, the pop masterpiece Heat Wave (though I have to admit I actually prefer Diana Ross' version of it which was featured on The Supremes Sing Holland Dozier Holland album) and the rolling DancingIn The Streets. Just listening to the sheer volume and power of Reeves voice makes you appreciate her often over-looked vocal talents. Diana Ross had a much softer soprano which had soulful qualities, oozing heavy emotion and genuine feeling that showed subtle hints of a raw vulnreability in her vocal delivery and neatly surfboarded along Motowns complex musical arrangements. Many of their classics are here including the finest of their career with the raw, gritty Love Child and their breathtakingly beautiful ballad, Someday We'll Be Together. Holland Dozier Holland was the main driving force behind a lot of Motowns most golden classics. They wrote and assembled some of the most remarkable pieces of music for both Diana Ross and the fantasic Four Tops.  <br /> <br />Lead singer of The Four Tops Levi Stubbs rocketing voice was just amazing and even managed to give you goose bumps. Several of their most famous classics turn up here including their pair of U.S chart toppers, I Can't Help Myself and the hauntingly atmospheric Reach Out I'll Be There.  <br /> <br />The Temptations were one of Motowns hottest and most versatile acts. The splitting of lead vocal duties between the smooth, sensuous sound of Eddie Kendricks falsetto combined with the explosive volume of David Ruffins more forceful delivery marked an interesting transistion in their work. Tracks like the jamming Get Ready and My Girl respectivley show up on this box set though also highlights some of their most exciting work from the early 70's with the undertones of hot, pulsating funk on Cloud Nine, which saw Dennis Edwards being lead vocalist after the swift departure of David Ruffin and the utterly fantastic classic, Ball Of Confusion, divulging into contemporary social issues.  <br /> <br />Smokey Robinson was a key artist at Motown who wrote some timeless music and was generally an all-round and highly versatile entertainer. Some of his most enthralling work is on here such as the infectious sounds of The Tears Of A Clown and the breathtakingly beautiful, The Tracks Of My Tears. Stevie Wonder was a sheer genius and some of his greatest work is included here, from the masterpiece production of Fingertips to the playful funk of Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours.  <br /> <br />Marvin Gaye was another one of Motowns definitive artists. His work progresed from the formulaic sounds of Motown on tracks like Stubborn Kind Of Fellow to the masterpiece of I Heard It Through The Grapevine to the profound political statements expressed on the timeless Whats Going On that is deservedly included on here.  <br /> <br />There is oddly only 1 offering from Diana Ross' solo career with the absolutley magnificent, golden Soul classic, Ain't No Mountin High Enough. Ashford and Simpson always knew how to make good records for Diana Ross and that tracks is one of the many landmarks in her career. You just get goose bumps as that exalting and rip-roaring climax builds and Diana effectivley talks through the verses, emphasising her truly sensual vocal style.  <br /> <br />This box set hosts so many classics thats its impossible to chronicle them all but there are some surprisingly rare features on here such as a version of I Can't Give Back The Love I Feel For You by Rita Wright (later covered by Diana Ross on her Surrender album) and some offerings from the over-looked Brenda Holloway. Amongst other familiar classics are the fantastic and the at-the-time controversial nature of Edwin Starr's rip-roaring War, the beautiful This Old Heart Of Mine Is Weak For You by the highly underated The Isley Brothers, the sensational ShotGun by Junior Walker And The All Stars who bought a unique touch of Jazz to their mainstream sound of Soul/R&B/Pop, Needle In A haystack by The Velvettes, ABC by The Jackson 5 (featuring a young, nasal sounding Michael Jackson),Stoned Love by Thr Supremes (possibly their best post-Ross recording featuring Jean Terrell as lead vocalist) and the unforgetable classic,Nowhere To Run by Martha Reeves And The Vandellas. The lists could go on and on and on but the whole box set deserves a thorough listen!  <br /> <br />Consistently bubbling with red hot, distinct and positivley infectious musical arrangements, Motown opened many doors for black singers and broke down many racial barriers. The golden Motown sound ceased to exist after its headquarters move from Detroit to L.A but all the magic is clearly encapsulated on here. Motown remains a key landmark in the history of black music and also made a significant impact in Pop music all together. Never has there been a record label that has managed to capture and encapsulate such a unique, distinct sound with such a wide range of diverse singing talents. The classics on here are timeless and enthralling. Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection is both superb and timeless but also essential to any serious Soul/R&B collection!  <br /> <br />Ian Phillips <br /> <br />
B0006TROAO|4.0|I first heard the music of Damien Rice in the movie \\"Closer\\" with Jude Law.  I frantically searched at the end credits of that movie for the song \\"Blowers Daughter.\\"  I wanted to know who sang it so I could buy the album.  I love folk music and this whole album is absoulutely beautiful. Damien Rice is a master at writing poetic songs.  <br /> <br />In particular I grew quickly attached to the songs: Cannonball and Eskimo.  I think you will too.  I highly recommend this CD.  So go ahead and buy it already.   :)
0440241588|4.0|John Grisham tends to write two types of stories:  books about practicing law and \\"chase\\" books.  The Broker falls into the chase variety, in which a lone individual must use his wits to evade powers who would like to see him dead.  The connection to practicing law is tenuous at best.  The Broker is a worthy addition to \\"chase\\" stories such as The Firm and The Partner.<br /><br /> In this story, a disgraced lawyer is given a last minute pardon in the waning hours of a failed presidential administration.  Joel Bachman had been a Washington power broker who parlayed his connections into huge wealth.  However, his fortunes rapidly collapsed when he and his partners tried to peddle secrets related to control of a mysterious spy satellite.  After his partner dies in a suspicious \\"suicide,\\" Bachman pleads guilty to avoid a similar fate.<br /><br /> Bachman's pardon provokes a firestorm of controversy over whether he used hidden assets to buy his way to freedom.  However, the truth is far more sinister.  An ailing CIA director has arranged Bachman's release in order to use him as bait for the owners of the satellite.  In order to \\"protect\\" Bachman, the CIA spirits him away to Italy where he must learn the language and culture in order to blend in and avoid detection.  As Bachman quickly realizes, the selection of Italy as a hiding place does more to leave him vulnerable and dependent upon his protectors than to effectively conceal him.<br /><br /> As the middle portion of the book develops, Bachman throws himself into his Italian lessons while looking for opportunities to evade his watchers.  Meanwhile, the CIA moves towards its end game of revealing Bachman's whereabouts to see who takes him out.  This section is necessarily a bit slow, allowing Grisham to bathe the reader in Italian language and culture while building tension for the action packed escape sequence with multiple sets of assassins in pursuit.  Along the way, Bachman must come to terms with the mess he has made of his life.  His character matures as he attempts to reconcile with his son while trying to stay alive.<br /><br /> While The Broker covers largely familiar material, the Italian locale adds a touch of freshness.  While we have seen this type of story before, it is still enjoyable to root for Bachman as he avoids death and seeks redemption.come to terms with the mess he has made of his life.

1594200823|3.0|Sheeze, I wonder about this society. <br /> <br />And this book is part of the wonder. <br /> <br />This reviewer grew up on a farm.  I've pulled fields of weeds.  I've hand hoed acres of corn, beets, and beans.  I've planted and harvested crops.   <br /> <br />The West and America want cheap crops.  The fact of life is you can't put out production of bulk crops if there isn't modern farming techniques.  Organic accounts for less than 5% of food.  Also, Organic gets a free ride.  Since 95% of the crops are treated with chemicals there is little chance the other 5% will come down with a blight.  Want a agricultural system with no chemicals?  Look at Ireland's potato crop of the 19th century.     <br /> <br />In a way I just don't care.  When you read a book like this you can't help but have the impression that when city people, with no agricultural experence, are trying to make agricultural policy it's like Jerry Seinfeld trying to manage a farm.  Emotion does not make good farm policy.  Smugness does not make one superior in intellect. <br /> <br />A dirty fact of life is America no longer makes all the food it eats.  Why?  We have regulated most of the farms to well out of sight of cities.  Indeed, places like the State of New York and Michigan have some of the most anti-agultural policies of any state governments.   <br /> <br />You folks who want to regulate to death agriculture better remember one lesson.  When your messing with your food supply your dancing with famine. <br /> <br />It's beyond me why people don't have a more moderate attitude towards food.  In American we're told that we must have a tolerant attitude towards sex.  However, that same group of people will not think twice about regulating what a person eats.   <br /> <br />The fact is you can get any of this information in this book from reading a book or two.  The political and history information is marginal to say the least.  No examples are given on what happens with over regulation.   <br /><br />Note, prior to 1945 Starvation was not unknown in America.  Also, a good number of people who live below the poverty line are obese.  Thus, it's not there is a lack of calories in America.  There is a lack of people using the information.   <br /> <br />This book is preaching to the choir.  The fact is 99% of the people who are reading this book have never raised anything but a little garden.  You may have never known real hunger.   <br /> <br />Buy this book and feel smug.  But do pray the proposals for agriculture in this book are never done. <br /> <br />The Russians have a saying, \\"there is nothing so terrible as a hungry man.\\" <br /> <br />
0446577383|3.0|Sometimes Oliver Stone is not just a crackpot conspiracy theorist.  In David Baldacci's The Camel Club, a man without a past who cynically takes the Oliver Stone moniker leads a group of eccentrics searching for the truth.  When that search causes them to inadvertently witness a murder, they are drawn into the middle of a very real conspiracy which threatens the nation from within its own security apparatus.  After numerous painstakingly developed plot twists, Stone and his comrades fight a pitched battle to avoid mass destruction.<br /><br />The Camel Club is a fast-paced tale of intrigue.  Its plot is taken from current headlines and involves an all-powerful director of national intelligence and an unstable situation in Iraq.  However, it offers an unusually nuanced view of the world.  In particular, the book offers an empathetic view of Muslims who have suffered greatly as a result of American policies and are willing to sacrifice all to change those policies and attain eternal glory.  The Americans are an ambiguous mixture of idealists and killers with some characters sharing both qualities.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn.  Within the Camel Club itself, the two disillusioned men of action are balanced out by an OCD computer geek and a rare book enthusiast who likes to dress in period constume.  The contrasts between this ensemble add some comic relief allowing for characters to grow.  Secret Service Agent Alex Ford and Department of Justice Lawyer Kate Adams are the grounded realists who are reluctantly drawn into the implausible story.<br /><br />The Camel Club is imaginatively plotted.  While some of the events being set in motion are elaborately telegraphed, their significance to the story is not apparent until after they happen.  As Stone's truth-seekers battle against various factions, it is not clear who the real bad guys are until the end.<br /><br />Perhaps the only flaw in the book is the unexplained inconsistencies in some of the main characters.  As the book reaches its several conclusions, one faction scrupulously acts to avoid taking innocent life (which is not so easy in a violent narrative).  However, the same characters were much more blas&eacute; about killing when the story began.  While this helps to maintain suspense, there is little attempt to rationalize the conflicting motivations.  Instead, the sudden twist ending makes the initial scenes all the more shocking when viewed in retrospect..

1594200823|3.0|I didn't expect to learn much from Michael Pollan's new book, _The Omnivore's Dilemma_ - since I write and talk regularly about the problems of industrial agriculture, local food production and sustainability, I thought that while I'd probably enjoy his writing (I took a great deal of pleasure in his prior books on gardening), his book would be enlightening to a rather different audience than myself. But, in fact, I did learn a great deal. Pollan's gift is to entertainingly present complexities, without being weighed down by his own excellent scholarship - it is a gift, to know that much about something and to know which bits of evidence will compell and which will merely bore. He's an enormously erudite guy, without being even slightly dull. Several people I know who are far less engaged by food issues than I say they found it compelling and readable.  <br /> <br />I will add up front, that one of the two things that most irritated me about this book was that in the mid-1980s, Margaret Visser, a brilliant food writer, wrote a very similar book, _Much Depends on Dinner_. Neither the book nor the author were particularly obscure - the book won several awards, and Visser went on to write another one about table manners (great book, btw, and highly recommended), and the books were published by Pollan's own publisher. And yet, Pollan's book does not cite or acknowledge the book, even though many of the chapters (those on chicken and corn especially) were very similar in their approach and analysis. Someone, either Pollan in his research (which, I think, was otherwise good), or his editor missed something - because the concept of eating a meal and being outraged by the history of its context is not his. Visser's book, particularly the chapter on rice, which I read in high school, was my biggest early influence in thinking about food, so it rankles me (even though these things happen in books) that Pollan ignored her. <br /> <br />But returning to the main point, I did learn a great deal from Pollan - I found out, among other things, exactly what Xanthan gum is (hadn't you always wondered, even if you knew it couldn't be good?), made a connection I'd never perceived before between the widespread alcoholism in America in the 19th century and the widespread obesity of today (both due to the need to use up agricultural excesses of corn) and heard as concise and compelling an account of the complexities of farm subsidies as I've heard before. I hadn't thought, for example that anyone could give me any more reasons not to eat at McDonalds, but Pollan added a couple. <br /> <br />The first section of the book traces a meal at McDonalds back to its basic ingredient - corn. From the corn that feeds the chickens to the xanthan gum in the milkshake to the sweetener in the ketchup and oil in which the fries are cooked, McDonalds is mostly corn. Since Fast Food Nation and the other exposes, I don't think there's anyone who cares who doesn't know how gross fast food is, and Pollan admirably stays away from the yuckiness factor (not that there isn't reason to go there, but it has been rather overdone of late). Instead, he goes to the aesthetic one, accusing Americans who eat fast food of having become like koalas, capable of absorbing only corn, to terrible cost. In some sense, as someone who likes to eat, his description of our reliance upon (and the costs thereof) corn is more grotesque than any expose of slaughterhouses could be. <br /> <br />He then describes the history of two organic meals, one of them bought on a trip to whole foods, and an industrially produced organic meal, the other local, sustainable and produced to a large degree from Joel Salatin's Polyface farm, where he acted as reporter/farm hand for a week. It may be here that Pollan's book is most valuable, because it makes a distinction that your average Mom who buys at Whole foods has never made - that industrial organic food is more industrial than organic. This book has beenroundly hyped on NPR and in the New York Times, and has the potential to change a lot of minds - and despite my later critiques, I will be enormously grateful if Pollan can simply convince people to look beyond the word organic and think about the costs of their food to the environment and the people who grow it. This is a potentially influential book, and Pollan does not make the mistake that many, many food writers make, of reading the word \\"organic\\" to mean sustainable.  <br /> <br />While acknowledges that large scale, organic, industrial food is better than nothing, he doesn't cut it a lot of slack for its drenching in fossil fuels, use and sometimes misuse of migrant labor, and general unsustainability. Perhaps his best writing in the book is when he attempts to analyze whether it is possible to grow food sustainably and well on any scale at all, and when he concludes that you can't, someone like me, who is trying to grow food on a small scale, looks up ready to cheer. Because such a conclusion should lead inevitably to the next step - ie, to the idea that the only solution to the problem of industrial agriculture is that a lot more people have to grow food, both for sale and at home. But he never quite gets there, and that may be the great flaw of the book. Still, however, I think that the line that the distinctions Pollan does draw are deeply helpful, and could potentially change things a great deal. <br /> <br />In the final section, Pollan eats a meal that he has hunted, or gathered, or grown himself. In doing this, he spends a lot of time coming to terms with hunting and meat eating (he kills his own chicken for dinner at Polyface farm, and also purchases a steer destined for McDonalds, although its final end is as much of a mystery as such things could possibly ever be). Here is where, I expected, Pollan will figure out how we might reasonably eat, humanely and sustainably. But in fact, the last chapter could be described as \\"Yuppie Jewish guy goes hunting for the first time\\" - and not just any kind of hunting, but hunting for wild boar in the California mountains with a bunch of European chefs bent on recreating the food of their homelands for Chez Panisse. Pollan may be violating the traditions of his Jewish upbringing (Jews don't hunt, not just because they are often urbanites, but because the laws of kashruth forbid it, and the sense of it as unfitting has lingered long past the observation of the law in other respects for many Jews), but he never actually leaves his class behind. And that is one of the deeper problems of the book - the meal he seeks to make is not a deer burger and homemade potato fries, but wine-braised leg of boar with boar liver pate and cherry something or other (admittedly, it sounded terrific).  <br /> <br />Intermittently throughout the book, Pollan attempts to deal with the problem of elitism - whether or not sustainable food is yuppie food. And there's a legitimate case to be made that there is. Pollan, of course, points out the illogic both of what we spend on food (less than anyone in the world) and the externalities that are not figured into the cost of the McDonalds meal, but he never gets down and dirty with the question of class. He quotes Joel Salatin on the subject that regulation adds more to his cost than organic production, notes the costs of meals and that Salatin's customers are mixed in economic situation, but he never fully addresses who it is who mostly eats fast food and who it is who mostly eats organic, and the all-important whys of that question. <br /> <br />When Pollan finally gets down to the ultimate local meal, the chapter is mostly about his angst over killing animals and meat eating (although it was fun to watch Pollan duke it out intellectually with Peter Singer), but it all gets played out over a meal with class overtones so profound and powerful that you cannot escape them. Going boar hunting with a sicilian chef doesn't seem to have much relevance to going deer hunting with a bunch of blue collar guys who live next door, nor is the meal he plans to produce something that anyone could make and eat very often. Speaking as someone who does not hunt (that kosher thing) but whose father did, and who believes that human predation is a perfectly normal thing, and preferrable, say, to having lyme disease from an excess of white-tailed deer (oh, it isn't that easy, of course, but I'll write more on vegetarianism and meat eating another time), I think Pollan ends up using the meal he decided to make as a way of choosing to avoid the logical conclusion of his writing, and the book is the poorer for it. The closing chapter is not about how we could eat, but about the impossibility of producing our own food, and, to a large degree, about the impossibility of even eating sustainably. And I think to a large degree that's because he chose a meal that is unreproducable for millions - as opposed to the simple, ordinary chicken and corn or french fries of his organic and conventional prior meals. <br /> <br />His conclusions, drawn from his experiences on Salatin's farm and of hunting and gathering (and presumably of eating at McDonalds) are implicitly that sustainable eating is never going to happen on any great scale. At the end of his section on Salatin's farm, he likens Salatin to Luther, creating his own new denominations of people for whom food quality and healthfulness matters, small niches of (elitist) people who care about their food in the great wilderness. But implying this suggests that most other people (I wonder who - the ones who eat at McDonalds more and are mostly of a different class?) don't actually care deeply about their food's taste, health and environmental cost.  <br /> <br />And his final set of conclusions are deeply disappointing to me, personally. Because he creates the ground work for a fairly simple conclusion - industrial scale food production, whether organic or non, is a failure, a disaster for thosewho care about ethics or the environment. In a way, it doesn't matter whether what you care about is the suffering of animals (industrial slaughter) or the suffering of humans (malnutrition), the extermination of songbirds (pesticides) or rising cancer rates (pesticides) or the extermination of everyone due to global warming, the conclusion that Pollan expertly and gracefully leads us to - ie, that many more people need to take a role in their own food systems, both by buying locally, encouraging the creation of millions of new small farms instead of an expanding industrial system, and by growing some of their own (or hunting it, or foraging), is finally left off, in the interest of implying that the problem is irresolvable. This, I think, is rather a cheap ending, and an unfair one to the person who has sorted through the complexities of his arguments and analysis and comes out wanting to know what to do next. <br /> <br />Pollan tells us at the very end, referring to his home produced meal and the one from McDonalds, \\"...these meals are equally unreal and equally unsustainable.\\" But the fact that the home produced meal is unsustainable and unreproducable is his choice - because a dinner of potatoes and eggs with salad, equally local, equally gathered, is sustainable and available to anyone with a bit of backyard if they want it. By implying that self-provisioning is a fantasy in this modern world, Pollan essentially suggests we leave the farming to the farmers - but there simply aren't enough farmers to have a small, local, organic farm everywhere. If we're to reduce our footprint more than anyone can by hopping over to whole foods in the SUV and picking up a box of whole wheat mac and cheese and some organic apples from China, people are going to have to take some responsibility for feeding themselves. No, they don't have to go hunt wild boar. But they might have to grow a garden, or make possible a nearby farm. They might have to encourage their children to grow up to be farmers. And they might have to imagine a world in which feeding oneself is not either a work of magic or a work of industry, but simply the ordinary job that ordinary people have been doing for thousands of years. <br /> <br />
0553801503|4.0|But it should have been expected after all of the many big developments that happened in the previous book. Compared to the other books the tone is calmer. That's not saying there isn't any action, believe me, there is plenty! But this just reminds me of calm after a storm that leads into another. So definitely read this book if you are into the series but don't expect too many developments of storylines. The book features only half of the main characters, but the author assures us that the others will be featured in the next book which I assume is almost finished. Martin said that for him to include all the character into one volume during this break period from the war would have been too much. He could have edited some of the events from minor characters but it would have not been complete, and I think Martin knows where he's headed with the focus of the storyline (he gave hints with Sam Tarly's chapters and the \\"Prophecy\\") so I'm not worried about Martin finishing the series with 20 filler books. The best parts of the book featured Brienne, Arya, and Jaime. Cersei was completely annoying but that made events toward the end seem more satisfying (believe me). The ending was left with a cliffhanger that wasn't wanted but I think Martin may start the next novel with an interesting twist. The events in the book are really rising action to hopefully a satisfying conclusion later on.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool has grown and changed over the years just like other bands do. Their songs have become more and more profound and it takes a few weeks or months to begin to really love what they produce. Like someone has mentioned before they have evolved into a band that creates music for their own pleasure and self-expression. Tool nowadays does not make music to please listeners. They make music to please themselves and thats what its all about. If you are a really die hard fan of Tool you will love everything they produce. Of course this album is very good however it does not rank among their top 3. If you want instant gratification, this album is not for new-comers to Tool, instead they should listen to Undertow and Opiate and come up the order as they were produced. Lateralus in my opinion is the best album ever produced by them because its a transitional album from the old Tool to the new Tool. You know the best thing about this new type of self-expression? You can listen to these songs for years and years and still never get bored. Its very easy to get bored of the majority of the songs from Opiate and Undertow. Thats why they are so unique and no other band in the world does that. Lateralus was produced in 2001 and after all these years I am still not bored of it. Since this album is new there are a lot of negative comments but surely it will change over the next few months.
0788815490|5.0|Iain Softley directed this elegant film yet it reminds me of a Merchant/Ivory production, not just for the Helena Bonham Carter connection, but because of the incredible production values (costumes, art direction, and cinematography) that make the film look more costly than the actual numbers. The acting is good from most if not all the cast. And the screenplay deals well with the triangle that Kate (Carter) allows herself to fall into despite the emotional danger to herself. Despite a dark premise the character Millie adds a bit of brightness to the story. And the views of Venice really capture the exotic nature of the place with comparison to 1910 London. This film earned its R-rating with the ending. But it did show how much the two main characters have changed by what previously occurred. It's a well done costume-drama.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Great movie!  <br /> \\"If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.\\", <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|simply beautiful! my only advice is trust them on this one and  listen carefully.  at first it's hard to swallow, but the more you listen, the more you find yourself waiting for a certain moment in each track the sends chills down your spine.  (excluding maybe one or two \\"fillers\\".) the only reason some of you are upset it's a short cd it because it's amazing, and who wouldn't be clamoring for more??  this album caries some influence from other albums (there are distinct times where I hear Lateralus and even older) but these moments are infused in a new level of maturity.  This is another chapter in Tool's grand experiment and I wouldn't miss it for the world.
0743238257|5.0|INTRODUCTION - Assumptions: 1) mind = spirit, mental growth = spiritual growth, 2) process of spiritual growth is a complex, arduous and lifelong task<br /><br />PART  I - DISCIPLINE = Basic set of tools to solve life's problems = means to spiritual evolution.<br /><br /> Comments - life is difficult, life is a set of problems. Confronting and solving these problems can be painful (often it involves suffering), but doing so gives life its meaning and leads to growth. Avoidance of problems is the primary basis of mental illness. Discipline is a system of techniques; there are no shortcuts to sainthood. Discipline involves four techniques for experiencing pain (suffering) constructively:<br /><br /> 1) - Delaying Gratification - schedule pain and pleasure so that we get pain over with first. The quality of parenting is determinative in children developing this discipline. Irrational or global punishment is undisciplined discipline and worthless. Good discipline requires good role modeling, love, time and genuine caring. Children need self-disciplined role models, a sense of self-worth and a trust in the safety of their existence.<br /><br /> 2) - Acceptance of Responsibility - we must accept responsibility for a problem before we can solve it. Neurotics accept too much responsibility and are plagued with I \\"ought to\\"; those with character disorders don't accept enough responsibility and feel I \\"had to\\". Escape from the freedom and responsibility of choosing is common to mental illness; adopting a \\"victim\\" mentality is far easier.<br /><br /> 3) - Dedication to Truth - truth is the reality map we use to negotiate life's journey, but maps need constant revision. People will cling inappropriately to old maps (transference), but truth must be more vital to our self-interest than our comfort. This requires openness to challenge and seeking psychiatric help is a legitimate shortcut to openness. Lying (either black = whole woof, or white = partial on purpose) is used to avoid the truth. Three considerations help use truth compassionately: a) Never speak a falsehood, b) Withhold truth only in light of moral consequences but never for purely personal needs, just on the basis of the other person's needs (and this requires genuine love for the other), c) The primary factor in deciding to withhold the truth is the person's ability to utilize the truth for spiritual growth; the capacity for doing this is usually underestimated.<br /><br /> 4) - Balance - flexibility and judgment are required in discipline. Judgment must regulate emotion perhaps to express rather than, as usual, suppress. Essence of the discipline of balancing is \\"giving up\\" --- sometimes giving up life styles or behaviors (e.g., necessity to win).  Depression is often from the feeling of giving up something loved. Bracketing is balancing the need for assertion of the self with a need for putting one's self aside. Our lifetimes are series of simultaneous deaths and births. Life can be free from emotional pain because spiritual evolution yields extraordinary joy and love.<br /><br />PART II - LOVE = The motive and energy for discipline = the will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth. This definition emphasizes that love depends on a conscious or unconscious purpose, includes self-love with love for others, requires effort, requires will (which is desire resulting in action), and involves an active choice.<br /><br /> What Love Is Not - 1) - Falling in love is a temporary erotic experience involving a collapse of our ego boundaries (this is neither an act of will, nor an extension of one's self and has little to do with nurturing). It can be a trap to marriage.<br /><br /> 2) - Romantic love (a myth, like falling in love) can stultify growth rather than extend ego boundaries (mysticism is the belief that reality is oneness, but we must find ourselves before we can lose ourselves in oneness or in a beloved).<br /><br /> 3) - Dependency (= inability to experience wholeness without being cared about) is a passive, not active relationship (addictive personalities are dependent on externals and unconcerned with spiritual growth).<br /><br /> 4) - Cathexis (= emotional attachment to a person or thing, e.g., love of money or golf or a pet). Only humans can grow spiritually through love; love is not merely giving but judicious giving and withholding.<br /><br /> 5) - Self-sacrifice that is given to meet one's own needs without regard to the spiritual needs of the receiver.<br /><br /> 6) - A feeling; the feeling of love is the emotion of cathecting, not of loving. Genuine love implies a commitment and an exercise of wisdom.<br /><br /> What Love Is: 1) - A work of attention; listening, total concentration and empathy (non-love is laziness or alternative focus)<br /><br /> 2) - A risk of loss to evolve from mere cathexis, requiring the courage to change.<br /><br /> 3) - A risk of independence in which one must accept opportunities for one's own destiny, i.e., to grow up.<br /><br /> 4) - A risk of commitment to a relationship of constancy, self-confrontation and extension.<br /><br /> 5) - A risk of confrontation; exercising power with humility; self-scrutiny must precede criticism for we must realize we are playing God.<br /><br /> 6) - A disciplined relationship; one's feelings are a source of energy, but an energy that needs to be mastered by constant judgment and continuing adjustment.<br /><br /> 7) - Separateness wherein a distinction between oneself and the beloved is maintained. If the focus is on oneself, then narcissism results; marriage is likened to a base camp for individuals to make their unique mountain ascents.<br /><br /> 8) - A relationship that can benefit from the mutual guidance of psychotherapy.<br /><br /> 9) - A product of grace. Grace is the source of love.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />{The following are notes on love from an article by Tim Foard which reinforces many of the ideas presented by Peck. Unfortunately, I didn't record where the article was published, nor have I been able to find any information about Mr. Foard (not even on Google!)]:  Many mistake the feelings of, say, kindness, affection, attraction or tenderness for love, but no feeling ever constitutes love. Love is not an emotion, but a will like, say, sincerity, patience, justice or mercy. Every type of legitimate love is rooted in disinterested love; love is good-willing. It is a commitment to benevolence regardless of self-benefit or feelings involved. Love based only on feelings is always self-motivated and is only as consistent as the desire that creates it. So, many supposedly \\"in love\\" display jealousy, usury, dishonesty, impatience and fickleness - stronger emotions! When trouble arises true love shows willingness to adjust (make sacrifices, swallow pride, etc.). Disinterested love establishes lasting friendships (that grow in candor and trust). Love doesn't depend on the return one gets. Love provides the basis for a beneficial, reasonable, self-love, a willing of one's own and other's good in balanced proportion.}<br /><br />_______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />PART  III - GROWTH AND RELIGION - Religion = our understanding of what life is all about; (thus, everyone has a religion!)<br /><br /> World Views and Religion- There is an extraordinary variability in the depth and sophistication of religion in the sense defined above; this understanding of religion doesn't require belief in God, insistence on some necessary practices or membership in a given organization.<br /><br /> Everyone has some implicit or explicit set of ideas about the world; e.g., that it is chaotic and meaningless, ruthless and cruel or nurturing and benevolent, owes them a living, is full of rigid laws that must be followed, etc.<br /><br /> Our world view (a.k.a. religion) is incompletely conscious and one's real religion may not be what one claims it is.<br /><br /> Our world views develop in our formative years by what we sense around us (often from others behavior more than what they tell us).<br /><br /> Since world views are individualistic and fragmentary, conflicts often result; in this sense all wars are holy wars.<br /><br /> The Religion of Science - Spiritual growth is a journey from a microcosm into an ever enlarging macrocosm. The path to holiness lies through questioning everything! Some find this happens in college where the religion of their parents is replaced by the religion of science.<br /><br /> Tenets of the Scientific World View (Religion):<br /><br /> 1) - The world is real and a valid object to examine.<br /><br /> 2) - Examining the universe is of value for human beings.<br /><br /> 3) - The universe makes sense.<br /><br /> 4) - The scientific method is a necessary discipline since humans tend to see what they want to and, thus, are susceptible of being biased, superstitious and prejudiced.<br /><br /> 5) - Experience requires verification (preferably by controlled repetition).<br /><br />Thus, science can be seen to be a religion of skepticism. Science is an improvement over unquestioning faith, but science has difficulty with the reality of God. Science looks at the history of the belief in God and sees dogmatism, wars, inquisitions, persecutions, etc., with those professing brotherhood killing others in the name of faith. In this respect, religion has a pretty poor track record.<br /><br /> Is Belief in God a Sickness? Freud viewed religion as a neurosis. Clinical data suggest that a therapist may enter a therapeutic alliance to work through church-inspired guilt and sin. Peck cites three cases from his experience with patients to answer the question \\"Is God a psychopathology?\\" He concludes that the answer is complex, both yes and no; mostly dogmatism, not religion, is at fault. Perhaps a skeptical agnosticism is needed to go on to spiritual maturity. But carried to an extreme, this results in tunnel vision where evidence for God is neglected by those who forget that scientists now realize that paradox is real and some phenomena lie outside the applicability of the scientific method.<br /><br />PART IV - GRACE = a force that operates routinely in most people to protect and foster their mental health (a phenomenon unexplainable within the framework of modern science).<br /><br /> The Miracle of the Unconscious - perhaps up to 95% of mental activity is unconscious and we become aware of this activity only through:<br /><br /> 1) - Dreams - are routinely helpful in various forms - guides to problem solving, warnings of personal pitfalls, indications that something is wrong when we think it is right or that something is right when we think it is wrong.<br /><br /> 2) - Idle thoughts - musings that unexpectedly come up with ideas that we may have struggled to reach.<br /><br /> 3) - Freudian slips - unintended behaviors that reveal how we really view apparent situations.<br /><br /> Our conscious self-concept almost always diverges from the reality of who we are; our unconscious is wiser and more fully aware than we are. Jung's experiences led him to talk of the wisdom of the unconscious and to suspect that we are all in contact with a universal unconscious, a collective store of wisdom.<br /><br /> Serendipity = a paranormal phenomenon in which highly implausible events occur with no natural cause and with implausible frequency. These events often produce benefits, perhaps, in proportion to the extent to which they are recognized and appreciated.<br /><br /> Grace = a powerful force originating outside of human consciousness which nurtures the spiritual growth of human beings. Spiritual growth is the miraculous evolution of an individual which counters entropy in that it increases organization. It requires effort, involves all of humanity and is powered bythe force of love.<br /><br /> The Alpha and the Omega - Where does this love come from? No one has come up with a better hypothesis than there is a God who loves us and wants us to grow; God wants us to become God. Spiritual life begins and ends with God. The fact that we are being nurtured to reach godhead brings us face to face with our own worst enemy, our own laziness.<br /><br /> Entropy and Original Sin - Non-love is the unwillingness to extend one's self; laziness is love's opposite. In the Garden of Eden (metaphor), Adam and Eve failed to obey, but more significantly, they failed to seek from God why they should obey; they avoided the time, energy, suffering, struggle and possibility of rejection that their questioning might require. The original sin was taking the easy way out.<br /><br /> A major form that laziness takes is fear - often the fear of change. The fight against entropy never ends; our healthy self (which we all have) must always be vigilant against our sick self (which we all also have).<br /><br /> The Problem of Evil - psychology has, up to now, acted mainly as if evil didn't exist. Peck's clinical experience has led him to conclude: 1) - Evil is real - there are people and institutions who respond to goodness with hatred and seek to destroy the good often in the name of some misidentified greater good. 2) - Evil is laziness carried to its extreme; evil people actively avoid extending themselves. Ordinary laziness is non-love; evil is anti-love. 3) - The existence of evil is unavoidable at this stage of human evolution; the force of entropy and the possession of free will make inevitable the existence of those who work against love. 4) - In entropy's most extreme form (human evil), it is strangely effective as a positive social force in that the outrage against it saves many from its excesses.<br /><br /> The Evolution of Consciousness - spiritual growth is the coming to consciousness of the knowledge that the unconscious possesses - the knowledge which we need is there because God's wisdom is within us, and within the collective unconscious. Our goal is to become God while preserving consciousness.<br /><br /> The Nature of Power - there are two kinds of power: 1) - political = the power to coerce others. 2) - spiritual = the capacity to make decisions with maximum awareness. The latter power is a factor in the calm ecstasy of being able to feel \\"not my will but thine\\".<br /><br /> The Welcoming of Grace - redefine serendipity not as a gift, but as a learned capacity to recognize and utilize the gifts of grace which come from beyond the realm of conscious will. We live our lives in the eye of God, in God's loving concern. The reality of grace indicates that humanity spiritually, if not physically, has a rightful place at the center of the universe.r formative years by what we sense around us (often from others behavior more than what they tell us). <br /> Since world views are individualistic and fragmentary, conflicts often result; in this sense all wars are holy wars. <br /> The Religion of Science - Spiritual growth is a journey from a microcosm into an ever enlarging macrocosm.

B000F1IQN2|5.0|Based on the slaughter of the Isreali Olympic team in the 70's (and on the book \\"vengence\\") Spielberg shows a dramatic version of the Isreali response to arab terrorism, break international law by hunting them down & killing them across Europe.  (Really a blue print  the US would like to follow with Al quede )Its a fictional characterization of the events though, one thing that did'nt make it into the film, was the fact that they accidentally clipped an innocent civilan in one case.  Just got the identity wrong.  Like all of his films, it is done well.  However... Don't expect many extras on this dvd, there is only a short director commentary before the movie... thats it..

Untitled 8 is quite possibly my favourite song the band has ever written.   <br /> <br />Recently, however, I saw the band perform [my third concert] and they played Untitled 6, a song I had never really paid a great deal of attention to.  But from the moment the ambient noises faded in, and Orri started pounding his arduous march, I knew I'd never listen to the song in the same way again.   <br /> <br />I feel like I understand the second half of ( ) better; it's destruction.  8 is by anger, 7 by depression, 6 by sorrow, 5 by doubt.  The first half is beautiful, though 3 is the only track I ever end up actively listening to all the way through. <br /> <br />But the beauty of ( ) is that I know someday I will discover the first half in the way I discovered Untitled 6.  It just hasn't happened yet.
B000EULJLU|3.0|As a Tool & Perfect Circle fan I'm underwhelmed with this CD.  Only 2 maybe 3 good songs in here.  Sorry.  But its true.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|Why no trillogiy set of these movies. It would be worth it with it that way. It would also be easier to buy it that way so you won't have to go to the store 3x.
0385338686|3.0|The Undomestic Goddess is entertaining enough to be a quick solid 3 hour beach read.  It tells the story of a high-power attorney who works 24/7 and has zero social life and her sudden life changing decision that leads to her becoming a housekeeper.  Naturally, said attorney knows ZERO about being a domestic diva.<br /><br />This book is not nearly as entertaining as Sophie Kinsella's other work, the Shopaholic series.  Goddess is written in the same vein as Shopaholic and Can you Keep a Secret, though, and does have its moments.  What it is lacking are good plot twists and more laugh out loud moments.  The character, Samantha, is not as likable or funny as Becky Bloomwood.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I saw the shawshank redmeption when I was around twelve. it was long, boring, and I didn't relate to it at all. Six years later I was at a local store feeling depressed after sevral bad things had happened in my life when I saw The Shawshank Redmeption tennth anivarsary DVD. My best friend has always said it was his favorite movie and I don't know why but I just decided to buy this thing. I went home and popped it in and two hours and twenty minutes later I was shocked that this movie had been around for ten years and I hadn't seen it in this way before.  <br /> <br />The Shawshank redmeption is more about long term friendship then it is about a guy in a prison. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic as Andy Dufrane and Red. The film goes on for a good two hours without seeming dull and there's great character devlopment. The prison break scene has always stayed in my mind and the score to the film is magnificent and I haven't heard a better one to this date. The last twenty minutes or so of Red's life outside the prison is wonderful. there's no bad part of this movie in my opinion. This film went larlgy unnoticed and even though it was nominated for 7 academy awards it won none. I strongly suggest that if you haven't seen this movie, please see it. It has a history of getting people through tough times (It got me through some troubling times) but even when you're not down it's a wonderful film and I can't honestly say I've seen a better movie.  <br /> <br />Ok, that was the film itself, but this is the ten year edition. I must say that the special's are not anything to get excited about. There's two documentaries. One on the themes and why so many people love this movie after it went to home video, and another on the acutal making of the film. There's a director's commentary on the film in which Frank gives us very good insight to the film, and there's a parody movie \\"The Shark Tank redemption\\" starring Morgan Freeman's son (Who also made a cameo in Shawshankredemption) and the interview between Charlie Rose, Frank, Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins. You'd think there would be more for ten years, but there isn't. Really, you're getting this film for the movie but if you already have the film it's probably best to just stick to that although the two documentaries are nice, it's probably not worth the money.
B000002UAR|5.0|I listened to this again only a few nights ago. It hasn't lost any of its magic for me.  Just a super album, but then I know all the songs by heart by now anyway since I've owned the album in one form or another since it was first released.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|A lot of people seem really excited about this album, and for some reason I'm not totally convinced. I've been in and out of a Pearl Jam phase for almost a year now. I like Pearl Jam, and I have the strange advantage of having approached all of their previous music all at once instead of following the band's evolution as it happened. <br /> <br />So one thing that people seem to love about this album is that it returns to the days of Ten. But it really doesn't. I mean, the first five tracks or so rock a lot harder than some of their recent music but this album has almost no other similarities to their earlier stuff. It's still to raw and stripped down. <br /> <br />Somehow I'm one of the very few that thinks that Pearl Jam's softer, more reflective, and stripped down music is the best. Vedder is seriously better at mumbling along to softer music than he is using his trademark mush-mouth screaming. This album somehow matches this, too, as the second half really slows down and broadens out. <br /> <br />So I like it because it's got both the harder rocking and the softer ballads. But somehow to me it doesn't seem classic enough. I don't know what I feel it's lacking - and perhaps I'll connect it more to the flow of Pearl Jam's music over time the more and more I hear it.  Anyway, any fan should own this.
B000EHSVQE|1.0|There are two camps.Some find it funny, some find it stupid.If you like stupid films then this is for you.<br /><br />This film is bad taste at it's best.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour, rent it and watch it before you buy it, you will thank me.
B0000019PA|5.0|In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the definitive indie album. It is simply incredible. It is not, however, for anyone who isn't willing to invest him or herself just a little. <br /> <br />Every indie music fan who has heard this album lists it as one of the best. It has it all: Deeply introspective and interpretable and even slightly confusing lyrics. Lo-Fi recording that opens up, intensifying and building on simple sounds instead of using production tricks for easy emotional payoffs. Hum-along melodies so engrossing that you don't even mind if the songs are stuck in your head for weeks. In short, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is both striking and beautiful, and should be considered by anyone who expects more from music. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, some of the defining qualities of the album keep casual listeners away, such as the production and vocals. What some see as honesty, others see as poorly recorded and executed. The only thing I'd say to anyone who doesn't initially see the beauty in this album is that it is totally worth the investment. <br /> <br />
0792163710|5.0|Got rained out this past Saturday night so I trotted this 50 year old plus film out. It's still great and but for the dialogue, which makes sense although still a little whimsical, this is by far on anyone's short list of great westerns.<br /><br />It's the old conflict (you see it again 50 years later in the great Duvall-Costner western \\"Open Range\\") of the cattle drivers versus the new farmers. Alan Ladd, searching for a quiet life following too much gunfighting, stumbles on Jean Arthur and Van Heflin struggling with the conflict. Heflin befriends him and so he hangs up his guns and makes a go of it. He and Joe (Heflin) work together, but as the picture evolves Joe knows that his wife, Marion (Arthur) fancies Shane but as Joe says, he's aware of it but trusts her.<br /><br />My father used to tell me that this was great movie making because both Ladd and Heflin and Arthur never act on impulse. It's all done with their exceptional acting skills.  It's a feeling that permeates their dialogue.<br /><br />The perfect villain is Walter Jack Palance who earned his movie spurs for his role a Jack Wilson, an evil killer and hired gun.<br /><br />The child of Joe and Marion is Brandon de Wilde as the ten year old Joey. I have never made up my mind about Joey. His line \\"come back Shane\\" is the line we remember from the movie (although Ladd's delivery of 'Marion, a gun is just a tool, as good or as bad as the man who holds it' may be the best line of the movie), but the kid certainly played on your nerves. Who knew.<br /><br />A sidelight is what happened to Shane? He leaves of course and we also know that he was shot in the final scene with Wilson. I heard one reviewer say that he died but I wasn't able to determine that. Still a great, great western and you should see it or see it again. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B000002UJQ|4.0|The funny thing about Radiohead is that it's easy to listen to and easy to get into but it's really not that catchy. The melodies don't suck you in; the sounds do. A typical song off of this album has a nice riff or beat that pulls the listener in at first, but backs away into the background mostly because of repetition and the vocals that don't really follow the predictably unpredictable chord changes. <br />The vocals are the signature across radiohead's work, yet they don't capture what the band does well. At times it feels like the vocals are there to carry a melody, but aren't all that central to the music itself. The lyrics don't shape the mood, the ambience does.  <br /> <br />I really wanted to mention the mix on track 3: Subterranean Homesick Alien. It's amazing. Soft organ and undistorted guitar sounds shift left and right rapidly but calmly. A harmonic structure builds from deep bassy to heavy mid with pretty much consistent tone to wrap the listener up with insulation. The whole track is comforting but disorienting. <br />What's nice about this album over their later work (I'm talking about Amnesiac here) is that through all of the ambience, something is still happening that captures the interest and pulls the listener in. There is a presence on Ok Computer begging to be heard, instead of just turned down while one is falling asleep. <br />---- <br />hummit.blogspot.com
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I LOVE this product, and can't say enough good things about it.  I purchased this product after being extremely disappointed with a more-expensive Bissell sweeper I purchased (see my review for Bissell 2800B Perfect Sweep Turbo Electric Sweeper). <br /> <br />There are numerous complaints in the reviews from people saying that their battery will no longer hold a charge.  In reading the owner's manual, there is a warning addressing the battery life: <br /> <br />\\"IMPORTANT: ...When recharging, charge time will vary dependent upon the amount of power left in the battery after its last use.  Recommended recharging time for the battery after completely depleting is 6-8 hours.  Battery may be left in charger for extended periods of time, but do NOT exceed 24 consecutive hours.  Doing so may lead to shortened overall battery life.  It is not necessary to wait until battery power is fully depleted before charging.\\" <br /> <br />I would be willing to bet that this is the cause of the problem for many of the negative reviewers.  In their defense, the warning is somewhat buried in the manual and is fairly easy to miss.  The manufacturer of should make this warning much more visible.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Okay, I'm really glad this album came out. But damn it has a stupid title, and even more stupid cover art: <br />Yeah. <br />My favorite RHCP album has got to be One Hot Minute, but I think most fans of that album will sort of concede that it doesn't really fit into the Peppers' natural progression. I like Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but it sort of gets bogged down somewhere in all the same-tempo funk/reggae thing that they do on that album. Californication, on the other hand, sort of drags in all of the melodic slow and soft junk that they do so well on that album (which is why I didn't even spend time listening to By The Way ;I'll have to revisit it). <br />Stadium Arcadium feels like it's somewhere in the midde of these three albums. It's got a lot of melodic softness with some really great hooks and melodies and so on, and the softness is balanced with straight-up rocking, and the rocking is fully loaded with RHCP's trademark funk and even some of that old-style rap that they used to do. Yeah, lots of attitude. <br />The technicality of (some of) the songs is stepped up a few notches from their usual, which is really cool. Frusciante is all over the guitar with some technical soloing, a lot of effects-driven guitar noise, and some excellent and quicker leads in both soft and loud songs. The drums freaking pound. I wish Flea was a little more free go do his sloppy slap thing; he seems sort of restrained and a bit too perfect. <br />Of course the lyrics are, as usual, sort of stupid. <br />I like the whole disc. The soft stuff is catchy and has a surprising amount of variety. The rocking stuff just rocks. Listen to it. <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|All right, I love this movie as much as the next person, and I have just one thing I want to say here. <br /> <br />Don't believe the people insisting that the dub sucks (mostly in all caps, no less, just to get your attention). Most, if not all, of these people are the kind who automatically assume that a dub is awful, even when they haven't heard word one of the English vocal track, and so set themselves up to have no other possible opinion of it once they actually have taken the time to see it. I watched it with no preset opinion of what it \\"should\\" be like, even though I really liked the Japanese cast, and I thought the English cast was amazing. Everyone I know who has seen the dub watched it with an open mind, as well. We all had high hopes for it, and we all really liked it. A lot of people who I don't know but have heard the opinions of also think it's great. <br /> <br />Actually, I have to take back the statement that everyone I know watched the dub with an open mind. I know a few people who started out expecting it to suck but ended up really liking it once all was said and done. <br /> <br />It's true that the English version has some stumbles, but the Japanese version isn't perfect, either. There are plenty of cases in this movie where I prefer the English voice for a character, in fact. <br /> <br />So, if you haven't seen the dub yet, give it a shot. Watch it without deciding beforehand what you think it will be like. Then, if you do end up disliking it, you can say it's because you actually dislike it, not because you convinced yourself that you should.
B0000640VN|3.0|I love Meg Ryan I do.  But this performance feel like a paint by numbers sort of thing on her part.  Plus, it pains me to look at the plumped up lips and botox forehead.  Why, Meg, why?  Hugh Jackman, on the other hand, armed with youth and great looks is giving all he has in this performance.  And it is he in the end that has you sighing and melting for gentlemen of yesteryear.  The script does gloss over this \\"portal in time\\" and either you go a long for the ride or wonder how one even begins to experiment with leaping off a bridge.  Overall, Cute but not a Ryan classic.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book a few summers ago, and I couldn't put it down.  I've never read a story from the perspective of a dead person.  This is unique, unlike anything most people have read.  If you aren't hooked in the first chapter, don't bother reading the rest.  Everything you need to know about content and the disturbing nature of the story is relayed in Chapter One. <br /> <br />If you are like me, though, and enjoy something out of the ordinary, written with a unique perspective, and heart-wrenching at times, you've found the right summer read.  And, it's short! <br /> <br />A++ on this effort.
B00006IU73|4.0|Well-written with much variety from song to song.  For listeners who appreciate thought-provoking lyrics and musical sounds to accompany those, this should prove to be a worthy purchase.  This record would have earned 5 stars; however, I feel that it is possibly slightly too polished during some parts, if there is such a thing (?).  I listen to a lot of TOOL, Radiohead, Pink Floyd, and this album blends in nicely with such a mix.  Enjoy.
B000FILW86|4.0|All of the hype on this web site is correct.  This is the best Trick Album since Dream Police. For those of you that don't agree, listen to it a few more times like the rest of us.  The song writing is very strong and the vocals are the best in years. The melodies are catchy and stick in your head. The harmonies and Tom Peterson backup vocals are back big time.  The band also included a small dose of keyboards that gives us the larger than life Cheap Trick sound from the 70s and 80s.  <br /> <br />Robin Zanders is simply amazing. Just as the live shows, his vocals and musical presence steal the show.   <br /> <br />Best album of 2006 so far.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Martin Scorsese's The Aviator is a fascinating film about a fascinating man. Beautifully filmed and acted, and feels much shorter than its 2.5 hours. <br /> <br />Cate Blanchett especially is amazing as Kate Hepburn. I have much renewed respect for her. And, er, desire. She was smoking hot. <br /> <br />Same could be said for DiCaprio. (Uh, minus the desire part.) \\"The Beach\\"* did nothing to enamore him to me, but he really is good. <br /> <br />The visuals is a story onto themselves, just gorgeous. <br /> <br />As is Howard Hughes of course. Just like van Gogh, who in the popular mind is \\"the painter who cut off his ear\\", Hughes is mistreated by the small attention span of the popular mind. He was not just fabulously rich and extremely neurotic. He accomplished a fantastic amount of stuff, and the film industry as well as aviation was changed forever because of him. <br /> <br />* (To be fair I did not see it. I really don't want to. If I ever go to hell I am sure The Beach and Titanic are on the screens there 24/7.)
B000002WYT|5.0|It's one of those rare albums that you can listen to without skipping a song.  The blend of different instruments, combined with Dave's voice makes for a great sound.  Tracks like \\"#41\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\" really show how dynamic Dave's voice can be and how great they can play their instruments.  If you're not a fan, listen to this album and you may feel differently about the band.
B000F3AAUW|1.0|I freaked out when I heard \\"Crazy\\" for the first time and did something I never do - immediately went out and bought the album just because of that one song, knowing nothing about the group. I even made a special trip across town just to get it. I listened to \\"Crazy\\" about 3000 times, e-mailed friends and asked them it they'd heard of this group and told them how great they were, and searched the internet for info. about the group and when they would be in my area. Although I wasn't as entranced by the rest of the album, I did like it - some of it alot. I thought (and still think) that \\"Crazy\\" was the best song I had heard in years. <br /> <br />Then as I was working on the computer with the album playing, the lyrics of the song \\"Necromancer\\" caught my attention. My jaw dropped. I went and got the lyric sheet. Somebody please explain  to me how this song is \\"witty\\" or \\"brings a smile to your face\\", as other reviewers have said. Seriously. I don't get it. After searching the net for an explanation, I found an interview which seemed to indicate the \\"death\\" or \\"suicide\\" in the song is a metaphor - it's not meant to be taken literally. Hmmm. That doesn't cut it with me. As it stands, the song is incredibly nihilistic with a nasty, mean, callous spirit. That's putting it mildly. \\"Without a care in the world I'm compassionate about killing her.Ahh to have my way with what's Left of the will in her.\\" \\"\\"A body in my bed. She was cool when I met Her but I think I like her better dead.\\" \\"...The cords are of cold-blooded murder\\"...\\" I keep her it's cheaper I love her too much To let go.\\" \\"We discussed over dinner how she would die. Before the day was done. so I caught her just in time to have a little fun...So scream and holler run and play. Wish you could die another day.\\" \\"May bet she was alright When she was alive.\\" <br /> <br />The song turned my stomach. It is, at the very least, the voice of someone who has no concern or human feeling whatsoever for the woman in the song. It's really very hateful. Do these people (the  artists) read the papers? Do they know what happens out there in the world? Would they be so callous about glamourizing what could easily be interpreted as murder and rape (implied - in that murder is sexualized) if their sister or mother had been a victim? How is this okay? Why do people overlook this stuff and just sweep it under the carpet? It's a sick song, and I don't think it is meant to be metaphorical at all - the lyrics contradict the alleged premise (that she is more fun \\"dead\\" - indulging in substance abuse - than she is \\"alive\\" - without the drugs, etc.) No-one is going to get that alleged interpretation without explanation anyway - it IS going to be taken literally -particularly since the way it is performed punches the more repugnant lyrics and is very jarring and sinister sounding.) I think that explanation is just a cover-up for the artist indulging in some sick fantasy.  <br /> <br />Why would you WANT to alienate at least one half of your potential audience? Why would you WANT to sing about something so dark and sick? Does it illuminate anything, is it thought provoking? No. It's just indulgent and a cheap attempt to shock. I guess they think it's cool and hip and \\"out there\\" - but personally I don't think there is any cachet surrounding rape, murder and necrophilia. How would they feel about a song glamourizing lynching? No mistake about it -this is a hateful, nasty song and these talented artists should be called out on it. <br /> <br />The long and the short of it is that I was ready to become a huge fan - now I want to get rid of the CD. It's a big disappointment.  <br />Don't tell me I'm overreacting. Listen to it again and put yourself in a woman's shoes. It's just a nasty, mean-spirited, sick song that made me feel hated.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|A 4 year hiatus?  They should have just stayed gone.  Another band that cant sing, or play.  Just trying the easy way to get you to give them money, after all, there are over one hundred used for sale already.  That should say something about how bad this garbage is
B00014TQ7S|4.0|Fraz Ferdinand are a toatally kicking band and this album rocks, I saw them recently in Singapore live and they were the real thing. Accomplished musicians with (rather unusually these days) some originality , style and personality. As for Scotland's contribution to the world , I think history will judge them more kindly than Tampa Florida seems to. Haggis what ? This is a forum to review music not show your ignorance and insult other peoples culture.
6305388458|5.0|John Cleese once said that this film is what he'd most like to be remembered for, which coming from a man who wrote some of the best Python sketches and Fawlty Towers, should tell you something about how good this film is. <br />Hugely controversial at the time, the subject matter of 'The Life of Brian' was considered strictly taboo in 1979, and even today it can still rattle a few cages, but ultimately the Python team all shared the same conviction that they were not poking fun at religion (or Jesus) per se, but at the people who blindly follow and misunderstand. In this way, 'The Life Of Brian' became not just a comedy classic, but a ground-breaking movie that pushed the barriers of what was previously considered 'off-limits'.  <br /> <br />Graham Chapman revels in the lead role of 'Brian of Nazareth', and the rest of the team play multiple rolls, in a very Goon Show-esque type way, with the story always revolving around Brian. The turning point comes when, in an attempt to evade the notice of the Romans, Brian pretends to be a street preacher and gathers the attention of a small crowd. Once the Romans pass by, however, he stops preaching and tries to walk away, only to find that the small crowd want to hear the rest of what he was saying. As more and more people come along to find out what is happening, his followers multiply until they are convinced that he must be some sort of messiah. They follow Brian home only to be told by his mother that \\"There's a mess alright, but no messiah..\\" (I'm paraphrasing, by the way!) <br /> <br />Each member of the Python team contributes immensely to the film, with Eric Idle supplying a classic Python tune as Brian is being crucified (\\"Always Look On The Bright Side of Life\\"), Terry Gilliam with some great visual gags, Terry Jones as the director of the film, Cleese and Palin turning in multiple brilliant performances (like Cleese's Reg, the leader of the PFJ, and the classic \\"What have the Roman's ever done for us?\\" sketch), not to mention Chapman as the unsuspecting hero. There are also a couple of cameo appearances (notably Spike Milligan and George Harrison) which can be spotted by the eagle-eyed viewer, but are all too brief if you ask me. <br /> <br />If you haven't got this film in your collection, then now is your chance to correct the error of your ways!... and as the \\"Not the Nine O'Clock News\\" team once pointed out, Britain is still ostensibly a Python-worshipping country, so do your duty and buy a copy of this classic today!
B000F9UE4I|3.0|RCB is not Primal Scream at their finest - but it still has some fine tunes on it. <br /> <br />It is a complete change in direction and is akin to a fusion of folk and C&W (think the humour of Cracker and strut of the Stones)  <br /> <br />If you love the sonic of XTRMTR you'll probably hate this - If you ever thought BG would make a reasonable Jagger you might just find this enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Trial listen first!
B00005O3VC|5.0|There are so many things about this (and indeed any) Monty Python movie that one hardly knows where to begin. Nothing is left out of the mix--history, religion, politics, personal relationships, prejudices, intellectual prowess or the lack thereof. My title, of course, comes from an early scene in with Arthur approaches a castle, inexplicably occupied by French k-nigits, who claim to already have a grail.  <br />The Monty Python troupe, led by the creative talents of Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, incorporated John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman as King Arthur, the dominant role in the film. No animals were harmed in the filming, not even an African Swallow, non-migratory as they are. A few coconuts bit the dust, however, as did more than a few comic images. Logic bits the dust, too, on more than one occasion. I did a paper once for symbolic logic which I was told ten years later was still being passed about because I had dared to use something so unconventional as this Monty Python movie in the references (I couldn't see why that wouldn't be much more common, and indeed, hope it is today--I use 'Life of Brian' in homilies, so why not this film in logic?).  <br /> <br />The particular logical incident (or rather, illogical incident) involves the trial of a woman accused of being a witch. Through 'logic' it is demonstrated that she would be a witch if she weighed the same as a duck (which, surprisingly enough, it turns out that she does -- 'It's a fair cop' she concedes as the general rejoicing commences at the prospect of a bonfire). Those who have benefit of the 'Executive Version of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail' are also treated to an exposition of the logical problems which itself concludes that 'sex is better than logic'. And who could argue with that reasoning?  <br /> <br />However, my favourite scene would have to be the liturgical procession and reading of instructions for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, with the leader's instruction 'skip a bit, brother' -- an instruction which I've searched in vain in the liturgical handbooks, but would vastly improve many readings on some mornings in church. This is a perfect parody of the sonorous but deadening readings that seem to drag on interminably.  <br /> <br />A close second would be the scene in which Arthur tries to explain his kingship to members of an autonomous collective (read, peasants without a lord) who view him as just another oppressor, and inform him that watery tarts throwing swords at you is not an adequate basis for the exercise of supreme executive power.  <br /> <br />Those who have visions of Great Britain as royal and cultural icons are often amazed-the likes of Monty Python and Benny Hill (among others) show the inhabitants of the UK as just as human (if not moreso) than the rest of the world. And we are all the richer for it. Alas, the Holy Grail is never actually attained by the seekers, who run into trouble with more French k-nigits and the local constabulary. But, the journey's the thing, so they teach me in seminary, and thus, this journey is well worth following to the end.  <br /> <br />The DVD comes with many extras, including the Camelot song being sung by Lego-land figures, and extensive commentary by actors and others involved in the production.  <br /> <br />Prepare to be amazed! Prepare to be offended! Prepare the popcorn in advance.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is not a story of heroic action with full of adventures.this is a true story of a sensible artist who suffers in the world of Chaos and war.most of the people complained  about the characteristics of Wladyslaw Szpilman (played brilliantly by Adrien Brody...one of the finest actor)but i can understand truely the situation and his standpoint.and without any hesitation i can say this is possibly the best movie ever made in the backdrop of World War II.the music is great.techincally perfect...brilliant direction.this is a movie you must watch...one of the best movies ever made.highly recommended

B000E97Y6K|5.0|I waited for months to see this movie again. I wanted to see it on DVD to make sure that it wasn't just the stunning visuals from watching this movie in the theater that made me like it so much. I watched it and realized that it wasn't that. It was the story and Peter Jackson's excellent movie making. This is the first action movie that has ever made me cry. <br />  <br />This movie should have been nominated for an Academy Award.
B000F39MAQ|4.0|Anna Netrebko is a very great soprano.  She has that wonderful Russian dark quality to her voice.  But Rolando Villazon is something so special.  He is so good looking and such a great singer -along with his acting ability and that could make him one of the greats someday.  I am new to opera and got hooked when the 3 tenors came on TV.  I will gladly shell out any hard earned cash I have for anything by Rolando Villazon.
B000086EPF|4.0|The price of this collection is excellent for two above-average metal albums.  And one must remember that the music itself is the real value here, because the collection's packaging is ugly, the original albums' artwork is poorly represented, and the few lines of notes (brief description of Blackie's career and the band's fortunes through the eighties) are unsatisfying.  The comments particularly on the two albums here (Inside the Electric Circus and The Headless Children) are misleading, apparently written by someone who did not actually listen to the albums. <br /> <br />The music itself, though, is another story.  Inside the Electric Circus, W.A.S.P.'s third album, remains a mild disappointment after the excellence of the first two (W.A.S.P. and The Last Command), but it nonetheless bears repeated listening and holds up better, twenty-plus years after its initial release, than most of the other metal released at that same time.  Generally, the songs are a bit shallow, and the hooks aren't as catchy as those on W.A.S.P.'s first two efforts, but it still rocks, and occasionally (for example, on \\"Restless Gypsy\\") the album brings the same kind of shivers as those inspired by earlier songs like \\"The Last Command\\" or \\"L.O.V.E. Machine.\\" <br /> <br />The Headless Children, on the other hand, represents a long musical stride forward for Blackie and the band.  In emotional tone and musical form, it builds on the foundation formed by earlier successes such as \\"Sleeping in the Fire\\" and \\"Widowmaker\\" and is easily the most lyrically mature and musically ambitious album that W.A.S.P. had produced to that point.  Stressing politics and emotions over sex, and frequently eschewing the standard binary song structure in favor of more complex arrangements, The Headless Children is the rarest of metal beasts:  the heavy, head-banging album that actually has things to say *without* becoming pretentious, boring, or preachy. <br /> <br />Short answer:  This is a damned fine collection.
B000FILW86|4.0|After the weak effort \\"Special One\\" I did not expect a whole lot out of this album.  Wow.  This album is solid from top to bottom.  It may not have any killer songs, but all of them are good (well except for the funk begining to \\"One More\\", but even that song gets better as it goes on). <br /> <br />It may not do much for your Greatest Hits collection, but if you are looking for a CD that you can listen to without skipping any songs, and you can listen to over and over, this one works.
B00009UW0N|5.0|HALLOWEEN... one of the best horror films for me... what can i say??? mmmmm<br /><br />well, i love the suspense, the tension it makes you feel... the horror... everything... i loved the 2 discs dvd.. if you're a fan u must get it!!!
B0000057C5|5.0|This along with mutter is my favorite rammstein CD.  This release is about exactly what you would expect from the band and there is little experimentation, just full fledged rammstein.  I love the keyboards and synthesizers as well, which are absent in some of rammsteins later albums.  My favorite song on here and from rammstein is \\"Bueck Dich\\", which literally means bend down.  The topics on here are pretty disturbing but what else would you expect from rammstein?  My favorite song include: Sehnsucht, Engel, Du Hast, Buck Dich, Spiel Mit Mir, Eifersucht.  Eifersucht (jealousy) kind of reminds me of Laichzeit from rammstein's previous album, the rythms are just so catchy its hard not to like.  Rammstein also continues its trend of having 11 songs and one slow song on the album.  In this case its Klavier (piano) and this song is still pretty good.  Its a nice change and shows off tills ability to drasitcally change the pitch in his voice (the other songs he sings in such a low voice).  Also, I love Engel, it starts out so eriley, kind of giving you the feeling that Heirate mich did from their last album.  Overall I'd say this one of the best rammstein albums and a great one to start you collection on.  The US version has some english song named \\"stripped\\" which really isnt that great but all the other songs are fantastic.  This is classic rammstein, you wont be disappointed

B000F7CMRM|2.0|When I saw the trailer for Syriana, I was completely delighted that a 'fiction' film exposing the oil was would be coming out to theatres, enlightening the masses on how it is indeed a fight to the death for the corrupt oil industry. When my fiance and I rented this, however, we were beyond disappointed. Let me explain:<br />First of all, I want to point out that I LOVED the actor who portrayed the juste prince and was blown away by his stunning looks and performance. George Clooney, too, did a good job. However, Matt Damon was forgettable and so were most of the other actors, save Amanda Peet who did well when she was onscreen.<br />The film was very, very slow, and since it was tracing quite a few stories and going over a ton of information that takes a little bit to ingest ( even for the intelligent, it takes a moment, as the dialogue is very quick), I had to force myself to get through it, in hope that some kind of resolution would occur.<br />This film, with its multiple stories, was not as connected and alluring as Crash, and this irritated me. People all over the US know about the corruption we deal with, and the pseudo brainwashing that is done overseas to create bombers and terrorists, but still many don't understand just how serious the war for oil is. This film could have appealed to them IF it was more fast paced and connected. But as there were some scenes and stories that really had nothing to do with anything ( like Matt Damon and his family; though it was sad and shocking about his son, it was not incredibly pertinent and threw you off. Also, the  interesting and sad tale about the father and son immigrants who turned to Islam and got invovled with Cloon's weapon kind of threw you off, though it easily could have been made more relevant.)<br />I know this review may have offended som Syriana lovers, and I understand that. The message of corruption in the CIA and oil is beyond important to portray, but I realy feel that it could have been done in a more fast paced way, and the stories could have been even more connected and powerful.y, and the stories could have been even more connected and powerful.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I know that a few people who criticize this movie presume the movie is political, propagandic, and too specifically demeans Christianity.  This assertion is totally the nonsense of the confused!  I can explain everything about these assertions and defend the movie from them, and show them that they are not only justifiable, but also necessary in order to EXONERATE THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.  This movie is about justice!<br /><br />To say the movie specifically demeans Catholicism because it paints Catholics as murderers, is only 50% true, and no one likes half-truths.  The value of the movie is in separation of Christian principles from the non-Christian principles, specifically murder.  Murder is not a Christian principle (or a Muslim principle).  Being Christian (or Muslim) doesn't make murder devourable.  The movie portrays the Muslims and the Christians as equals in their bigotry, contrary to the belief of my review opposition.  The movie assumes the point-of-view of the Christians who aren't murderers but soldiers in protection of all white Westerners of Israel, and they defend Christian civilians who cannot fight for themselves; this is their duty as a Christian army.  This protection is perfectly in line with Christian faith and Christian principles.  But, because a lot of religious bigotry occurred, which allowed the murderous wars of the Crusades in the first place, maintaining a peaceful co-existence in Israel between the Muslims and the Christians was difficult at best.  Some Muslims and Christians murdered people of the other religion, and the armies of the two would have to get involved.  It was a very touchy situation that was constantly inflamed by some people from BOTH SIDES, and the movie shows that.  The reason the movie disturbed a few of the reviewers is that the movie must depict the trouble-makers of the Christian side because the movie takes the perspective of the Christians.  Viewers should expect this (even if a few reviewers don't like to be reminded of the culpability of some people of their own side or religion) since the movie assumes the point-of-view of the Christian soldiers who, in their good and true Christian faith, have to keep the peace by handing out justice against the trouble-makers who break the laws and break the Christian-Muslim truce, especially since the Middle East Muslim army was larger by an exponent.  Good Christians do not want to piss off the other side by acting inhumane and un-justified, not because they are scared, but because such acts determine the fate of the Christian image.  The Muslims could've avenged the Christian invasion of a century before by wiping out all the Christians in Israel, but they did not; because, some of the Muslim army leaders were just as humane as some of the Christian leaders (despite that not all of each were humane), and recognition of humanity is what led to the peaceful co-existence between the two races there.  They were both generally considerate of each other and did not want a war.  War means deaths.  Attitudes determine the true character of the Christians and Muslims and why the superior-strength armies of the Muslims did not avenge the Christians for what they did to them a century before.  This movie takes place a hundred years AFTER the original crusader invasion on the Middle East Muslims, so none of the movie's Christian characters were directly responsible for the bloodbath in the Christian siege on Israel a hundred years earlier.  Since the trouble-makers (of both sides) desire a \\"religious war\\", the movie subjects viewers to the specifics of how the Christian army has to handle their own who break the truce (and those who invoke God's name as they curse or murder Muslims for having a different social attitude, religion, and skin color).  When a trouble-maker murders a few people of the opposition, the TRUE CHRISTIANS of the Christian knights have to carry out justice upon their own by imprisoning their Christian trouble-makers, even hanging them as was done back then depending on the crime.<br /><br />I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THIS IS, and I now address recent politics, that world crimes do not see true justice, but rather seem acceptable because we lost our vision of justice and our vision of the characteristics of murderous acts carried out in the name of a country, a land, or a religion that seem supported by confused patriotism or confused religious beliefs.  This is only my opinion.  Nevertheless, the flag or other icon cannot be an excuse to subject others (of different races, religions, and countries) to criminal acts which start through dehumanization of people from another side.  If the movie's going to show the perspective of the Christian army, people will have to see some Christians who dehumanize Muslims of the Mid-East; a fact of life even today!  However, the movie's statement is not a direct associate to a political wave, but it is instead merely an allegory that, in meaning, would rather seem to support religious beliefs, AND the United States which believes that freedom is not obtained through murder, but through acceptance of social differences.  But, I shouldn't have to say what the United States stands for to show why it is a good idea to side with the film instead of to crucify it.  It has nothing in relation to the United States, in any direct way, whatsoever.  Anyone who says so is painting an inacurate picture based on their own culpabilities and not the culpabilities of the truly patriotic, nor the truly Christian.<br /><br />This is a very good movie, an epic that rivals the scale and greatness of Lord Of the Rings: Return Of the King.  (The movie-makers even constructed the largest set ever built for a film, with set-dressing and props covering a 360-degree view of that set!)  The great shame of this movie is what happened to it, its mediocre U.S. box office sales, because finicky people there don't seem interested in intelligent allegories about real justice.  However, most of the movie's feedback was extremely positive, and, where Americans saw the film, they felt it was a success and a great action film with a lot of depth in its underlying principles.  Otherwise, the film had better box office sales in foreign countries and they all felt great about the film, of particular noteworthiness were today's Mid-East Muslims who seemed to appreciate the film's responsible tale as reflective of the greatness of Western culture and principles: of special note are the multi-national, multi-religion cast and crew of over a thousand people who all got along working on the set.  Only a few Americans saw this movie as an infringement, to my knowledge.  Even France's people whose Christian crusaders were depicted in this film appreciated its story and plot!<br /><br />The people who gave negative reviews of the movie on Amazon all declared Ridley Scott's \\"Director's Cut\\" as better than the theatrical release.  Excuse me, I meant to say \\"Sir Ridley Scott.\\"  And, I noticed that all of them watched the lengthy special features that pan across discs 3 and 4 because they said so.  They write like their hearts and minds liked the movie and felt compelled to give a lacking star-rating because of their confused notions about political views.  Aside from that, the special features are about the fun had by the multi-national cast and crew while making Kingdom Of Heaven, and they are just as fun to watch as the movie was to make.  Because of Sir Ridley Scott, all of the money spent for this film is on-screen.  It had a gargantuan budget.  Over a quarter-million dollars were spent on flags and guides-on, alone.  Despite the length of Sir Ridley Scott's \\"director's cut\\" of the movie, a 3-and-a-half-hour road show version with entrance music and intermission, it is perfectly enjoyable, and this \\"Director's Cut\\" version is better than the theatrical release.

0312323867|5.0|I didn't think I would like this book better then Something Borrowed because I wasn't crazy about Darcy, but this book really brings out a different side of Darcy. Many milestones and realizations confront Darcy. By the end the book Darcy had grown on me. Spectacular!
B000E994KE|5.0|This is Amorphis' seventh album. Now initially Amorphis started off as a Melodic Death Metal band and it is prominent in the first 3 albums. Many fans agree \\"Tales From The Thousand Lakes\\" is a work of genius. Then the next three albums evolved into more mainstream metal, with nevertheless complex arrangements. And now returns the new album Eclipse. I must say I prefer the Melodic Death Metal Amorphis to the Melodic/Heavy Metal Amorphis in the last three albums. Eclipse is a return to form, perhaps not truly  - but only because the production is much better than Tales From The Thousand Lakes.  <br /> <br />This is a grand album and the guys return with astounding new songs. The new vocalist is very good. He uses three types of vocals: death vocals, \\"growly\\" clean vocals and soft clean vocals. Two Moons is a heavy track with excellent keyboard parts and driving guitar parts. There are softer clean singing songs such as House Of Sleep and Born From Fire. I love the pianos in these songs. The vocalist (Tomi Jousten) sings his heart out in House Of Sleep. Fans of the repeated arpeggios with the guitars (in Tales) will love the chorus of this song. In the chorus the heavy guitars plays the expressive melody with one guitar and intense chords with the other. Born From Fire is similar with a majestic solo.  <br /> <br />Leaves Scar is my favourite song and reminds me of \\"Black Winter Day\\" (from their second album). It's quite a slow song, has a beautiful melody, and long drawn out death vocals. The combination of death vocals and guitars works brilliantly. The clean choruses are outstanding. The folk-like keyboard work brings the song to life. <br /> <br />Under a Soil starts off slow and moody with perfectly placed pianos but then progresses into a fast solo. It leads into the next song: Perkele, which is the heaviest song with lots of death vocals for the verses and clean vocals for the chorus. It's a very dissonant moody song, and has a grandiose solo then ends on a very powerful and moody note. A good thing about Amorphis is that they don't foolishly stick in solos every five seconds, but adorn each song gracefully. Solos are a good thing, but when a band concentrates on the solos ALONE, it gets tedious. <br /> <br />The Smoke and Brother Moon mostly have clean singing but have death vocals here and there that fit in perfectly. The Smoke Starts off with a piano to gentle strumming then proceeds to the verses. The verses have clean singing, but in the choruses death vocals join in that fits in perfectly. Again there is another beautiful solo and the chorus follows. Brother Moon starts off folk-style. At the 57-second mark a fine guitar riff is played. The song is sung in clean vocals until 3.04 where the death vocals come in. The drumming is great in this song.  <br /> <br />Same Flesh has rather distorted guitars and Tomi shows his talent as an apt vocalist. This song is a bit slower and quite drawn out. The ending is very good, with an amazing melody being played. The album ends at Empty Opening, which features some angry singing to impressive background music. <br /> <br />This is an excellent beautiful Melodic Death metal CD. It shows Amorphis' continuing progression to create a unique soundscape. Amorphis is Melodic Death but quite different compared to the speedy fast Gothenburg metal, even though Amorphis are from that area. It's like Opeth. Opeth are a (progressive) Death Metal band, but they don't have brutal lyrics, or play at top speed. Instead their music much is slower and they have poetic lyrics. In the same way, Amorphis is a slower Melodic Death metal band; with poetic lyrics, still maintaining the heaviness. It's not your average metal album: it's extremely emotive and atmospheric. The merger between folk and death metal is individual and almost undiscerning, because they fit together really well. Along with Tales, this album is greatly captivating and ambient. Few Metal bands are able to produce an album, which is both talented and atmospheric. Quite a lot of metal is brilliant, but don't leave an emotive resonance. Opeth does, along with Amorphis. Words cannot really describe how grand this album is. Buy it!

B00008DDRX|5.0|The Porsche 917 was the greatest...and many drivers say the scariest... LeMans prototype ever made. Top speed on the Mulsane straight in 1971 was 291 mph. The 1971 winning car still holds the 24 hour distance record...3317 miles!!!! and it held the total laps record until today 6-18-2006 of 379 laps. <br /> <br />The happy news for all of us is that the brilliant chaps that made this movie had the inspiration to capture the essence of the 917 vs Ferrari 512 battle royal raging at LeMans in '69 '70 '71. This was the first movie I saw in a theatre that made the seats vibrate where you could literally feel the raw power of the 5 litre 12 cylinder machines. <br /> <br />The essence of the LeMans event is captured as well. The ultimate and constant danger of the race is part of the allure of LeMans...a 24 hour event in which anything can happen at any second and there are 86,400 seconds to race. One of the great dangers, overtaking slower cars in the 917 at a closing rate of over 150 mph, is captured brilliantly when McQueen has an incident with a 911...one sleepy second and disaster. <br /> <br />When asked by the love interest why he must get into the other team Porsche when asked/told by the team...McQueen delivers a line that has been a mantra in racing circles since <br />\\"racing is life...everything before and after is waiting\\"
0375507256|3.0|This book was a page turner only because I kept trying to discover the point of it all. I never found it. Seems like the author couldn't see the forest for the trees, or maybe he was just too focused on technique.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Asimov himself said something along the lines that a movie and a book are 2 different forms of media and that the two can never be translated to each other accurately. <br /> <br />That being said, don't expect this movie to be exactly I, Robot the book. However, it is quite good and while some rules are bent, none are broken and overall, this movie has subtle references to quite a number of Asimov stories. If you're an Asimov fan and you can accept the fact that a movie is not a book, you should find this quite enjoyable. On the other hand, if you're a purist you probably won't like it much, but then you probably won't be satisfied with ANY Asimov translation from book to movie. <br /> <br />All in all, its a very entertaining movie that honors the grandmaster.
B0002WYS6S|4.0|I think this DVD is fantastic. This live performance is one the best i've seen. The music turns from heavy and angry to soft and melodic. The production is superb, the audio is great and the songs are played without a mistake. Once again these guys prove that they are amazing players. Petrucci, Portnoy, Rudess and Myung are awesome with their instruments. LaBrie is singing better and more controlled than in previous tours. I give a 4 star rating because the song list it's a bit disapointing, it could have been better. But, if you are a die hard fan, get this DVD! It's a must.
B00005JO0J|5.0|This movie is, to me, the perfect follow on to the tragically short lived TV series. <br /> <br />The same characters play the same parts in the movie as in the series, which makes continuity a breeze. <br /> <br />The characters get a cjhance to stretch a little more, and none of them let us down.  I have been a SciFi fan since the 1950s and this is one of my all time favs. <br /> <br />Enjoy!

B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series and have had to of played at least 500 hours of final fantasy all together, and I have to say that FFVII was by far my favorite. It had everything a gamer could ever want. So naturally I was excited about Advent children....When I saw the japanese version the hype kind of overjumped the lack of depth in plot and I said I loved it...but after watching it a few more times, I realized that the storyline was stupid...one of the few good things about it (besides animation which is a given) was the voices....the voices, even though I didn't understand them,  were able to capture the correct emotion of each individual character.....I knew for the english version that the acting for each character had to make up for the lack of story...I was hugely disappointed to found that the english acting was horrible....I think the only voice that was casted right was sephiroth's....and that the worst voice was clouds. His voice came out nothing like his personality. It was after I had watched the whole english version that I realized that there was nearly nothing good about this movie, besides the animation.....I waited two years in suspense and excitement getting to see the crappy FFVII animation to come to life and see all the characters back again, but I ended up coming close to hating it.....If you really want to see this movie I recomend borrowing it from a friend before you decide to use your money on a piece of garbage....
0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is the story of Liesel Meminger, a young German girl living in a small town near Munich during World War II. There have been a variety of other children's and young adults books that tackle World War II. The Book Thief is unique because of the choice of narrator and because of the author's voice. The narrator of the book is Death, and he has quite a unique perspective. As for the author's voice, Markus Zusak is a genius in his use of language. By the time I was 80 pages in, I wanted to go back and start over again, so that I could experience the early parts of the book again.<br /><br />Here are a few of my favorite quotes from the book:<br /><br />- \\"Every childhood seems to have such a juvenile in its midst and mists\\" -- page 49<br /><br />- \\"You know, it actually makes me wonder if anyone ever lost an eye\\" from heil Hitlering -- page 111.<br /><br />- \\"The secret sat in her mouth. It made itself comfortable. It crossed its legs.\\" -- page 246<br /><br />- \\"You're human. You should understand self-obsession.\\" -- page 307<br /><br />- \\"The sound of crying children kicked and punched.\\" -- page 380<br /><br />- \\"Her feet scolded the floor.\\" -- page 428<br /><br />These are just a selection out of countless clever phrases and ideas sprinkled on every page. The narrative structure of the story is complex, told with flashforwards and flashbacks, and inset with asides and quotations, and occasionally with excerpts from hand-made books. But the story itself is actually fairly simple. The Book Thief depicts World War II from the perspective of ordinary German citizens, and from the perspective of young Liesel, who is far from ordinary. And, we see World War II from Zusak's envisioned Death, who had a lot of work to do during those years. The Book Thief is also a window into the dangers that World War II held for non-Jews, and particularly what happened to those who spoke up too late.<br /><br />Liesel is most definitely a cool girl of children's literature. She's brave, funny, loyal and caring. She steals books a) because she loves them with a passion that she can scarcely express and b) because it feels good to take something back, after all she has lost.

B00005JOSS|4.0|It was a good movie...and it makes you think! I watched this movie with four other people, only one of which understood it like I did. The other three people were quite confused about how the ending came about. The people sitting behind us didn't get it either...I won't say what they said since that would spoil the movie for you, but let's just say that they didn't get it at all!<br /><br />Anyway, it took me about half an hour to get everything straight with the one person that *did* get it and another half an hour (and some visuals!) to get one of the other people to understand what happened.<br /><br />If a movie makes you think that much, then it's probably worth your money! The love story was a bonus compared to the logic used to explain how the ending came about.<br /><br />Interesting!<br /><br />-Ater
B000006TRV|5.0|Few would disagree about the fact that The wall would figure in the 10 best albums.This terrific double album has sold more than 23 million copies to date on strengths of masterpieces like Comfortably numb and Another brick in the wall.Recommended.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series and have had to of played at least 500 hours of final fantasy all together, and I have to say that FFVII was by far my favorite. It had everything a gamer could ever want. So naturally I was excited about Advent children....When I saw the japanese version the hype kind of overjumped the lack of depth in plot and I said I loved it...but after watching it a few more times, I realized that the storyline was stupid...one of the few good things about it (besides animation which is a given) was the voices....the voices, even though I didn't understand them,  were able to capture the correct emotion of each individual character.....I knew for the english version that the acting for each character had to make up for the lack of story...I was hugely disappointed to found that the english acting was horrible....I think the only voice that was casted right was sephiroth's....and that the worst voice was clouds. His voice came out nothing like his personality. It was after I had watched the whole english version that I realized that there was nearly nothing good about this movie, besides the animation.....I waited two years in suspense and excitement getting to see the crappy FFVII animation to come to life and see all the characters back again, but I ended up coming close to hating it.....If you really want to see this movie I recomend borrowing it from a friend before you decide to use your money on a piece of garbage....
0425156842|1.0|This is a poorly written novel that pretends to be philosophical but doesn't quite make it. The dialogues are terrible, pre-packaged, cooked up, unbelievable. The idea is stupid: a recast of a high school philosophy textbook into series of letters from a creepy old man to a 14 year old girl. This is a bad way of getting teens into philosophy. Anyone with brains would prefer to read Plato or Nietzsche directly to being stalked by self-proclaimed philosopher. The novel is clearly aimed to people who are not capable going to the sources get the real deal. This is philosophy for sophists.
B00004Y6NV|1.0|How can anyone like Dire Straits so much?.I really think that they are overhyped.Sure their self titled debut was decent,but not the others.Heavy fuel is a joke.Right now I am trying to play COMFORTABLY NUMB on my guitar as it has this terrific solo from David Gilmour.Get The Wall from Pink Floyd instead.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I absolutely am obsessesed with this show.  I watch at least on episode a day.  The DVD set also comes with We stand alone together, which is a very compelling video to watch to get to see and hear the real men that were actually there.  It is a masterpiece for any war buff to own.  The men are easy to get to know and I sometimes cry watching certain episodes even after have watched them so much I can recite every word.  Fantastic story telling and wonderfully casted characters.  Great video.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Guns N' Roses are one of my favorite bands of all time. They are <br />talented and make pretty good music. If you've heard Civil War <br />and thought GNR sucks, then you're tasteless moron. Well, ok let <br />me tell you what. The idiot who rated this 1 star must not have <br />a good taste in music who dosen't like my favorite band Dire Straits. He needs to stop being so picky about my favorite bands. <br />And He sure loves Pink Floyd who are terrible!!!! Well, Guns N' Roses are great!!!!! Please buy it right now and avoid the moron <br />below me who isn't in good taste... <br /> <br />PS. GUNS N' ROSES ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST GROUPS IN HISTORY!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Perhaps one of the best movies ever made. Concise, Intense, and all the actors performed incredibly well in the movie. Completely focus on the purpose.
0451450523|5.0|I read this for the first time when I was perhaps 12 years old. While I enjoyed it, I knew that there were deeper undertones that I wasn't quite grasping. <br /> <br />The quiet beauty of the tale and the lyricism of the prose create a fantastical landscape that frees Beagle to address core human issues, such as the search for one's identity as well as the illusions of innocence, truth, and beauty--arguably more effectively than a \\"realistic\\" story would. Its gently ironic wit is some of the most sophisticated I've had the pleasure to encounter. <br /> <br />As I internalized the words, they brought home the omniprescence and sometimes inescapable necessity of lies and deception. Despite the presence of these evils, one can find truth and beauty as well; however, merely being able to differentiate between reality and illusion is not an end in and of itself. Uncovering truth is the first step of our responsibility; the second is to use it wisely and compassionately. <br /> <br />It was my favorite novel then, as it is now: my poor homage to its haunting elegance.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|The reviewer who has it dead-on right in these pages is the one who calls out the fact that Jonathan Larson conceived 'Rent' as more opera (using 'La Boheme' as inspiration), not a musical.  And what that means is the the connecting dialogue is sung in stage-voice, not chatted as dialogue.  So, to see Jesse L. Martin forced to speak dialogue like \\"I rewired the ATM at the Food Emporium\\" when you know it's killing him not to sing it and it's equally killing every Rent fan to hear him constrained to simply mouthing the words...well, it's a major flaw because it deals major blows to the flow and energy of Larson's work.<br /><br />Other concerns:<br /><br />* The first-half of the play is re-staged pretty much shot-by-shot. Then, bizarrely (given the fidelity in the first half), the second half veers wildly from the original.  Director Columbus wastes too much time staging \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\" in a way not intended.  Fun, no doubt, but the additional 5 - 10 minutes he tacks on here could have been used to keep the deleted scenes intact.<br /><br />* The deleted scenes aren't trvial matters - 'Rent' is a hard story to follow for the unitiated.  Each one of those scenes could have helped explain the the storyline.<br /><br />* Surely one of the reasons to prop up \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\" was to get more Idina Menzel in there.  [Menzel (the original Elephaba in \\"Wicked\\" and the original Maureen here) has ascended to Broadway royalty, so who can blame Columbus?]  But, if so, why leave out 'Happy New Year?' which features a goodly amount of Maureen?<br /><br />* The deleted scenes end up de-emphasizing Anthony Rapp's Mark, which is unfortunate because he's the voice and connective thread in the play.  Leaving out his '3D IMAX of my mind...that's poetic...that's pathetic' number is a major ommission, both to Rapp as an actor and to anyone trying to follow the movie - this is the key piece that puts things into perspective for the viewer time-wise.  Why else would Larson strain to put lines in Rapp's monologue like \\"Christmas...Christmas Eve last year\\"  He's framing the scenes for us.<br /><br />This would be a three-star review, but I'll go for four because of the redeeming nature of the nice documentary about the Larson family - this is very powerful stuff.  It's obvious the family is still hurting deeply 10 years after their loss.son strain to put lines in Rapp's monologue like \\"Christmas...Christmas Eve last year\\"  He's framing the scenes for us.  <br /> <br />This would be a three-star review, but I'll go for four because of the redeeming nature of the nice documentary about the Larson family - this is very powerful stuff.

B00004Y6NV|5.0|How could anyone hate Dire Straits??? They are terrific, incredible, and great!!! I really love this great album and <br />has some of their greatest songs in 'Heavy Fuel'. 'Heavy Fuel' <br />is what I'm trying to play on my guitar. By the way, the art <br />to this is really beautiful and why not do me this favor, MAKE <br />MORE OF THESE LPS.

B00003CWL6|3.0|American Beauty though visually appealing, well acted, and quite entertaining in many places, is still a very troubling film experiance to suffer through. It is a film that tries to pass itself off as a realistic piece, but is in actually hypothetical to a fault. It is as if the writer, Alan Ball, decided to pull a bunch of \\"What ifs\\" from his hat. What if there was a high level administative type guy entering his midlife cricis, so he dicides to say \\"Bite Me!\\" to the man, quits his high pressure job in favor of a fun fast food environment, starts smoking a lot of pot, buys the muscle car of his dreams, then begins getting buffed out in an attempt to have sex with his daughters hot young cheerleader friend? What if this mans wife thinks that her husband is an inadequate closet case that deserves little more then contempt, so she undermines the realationship and has an affair with the number one realter in her city? ( played by Peter Gallagher who has made a carrer out of playing the adulterous other man) What if the new next door neighbor to this same man happens to be a starched militant drill sergeant who is in actuality a repressed homophobic homosexual with an unwholesome tendancy to fly off the handle in violent outbursts of uncontrollable rage? It can be argued that these \\" What ifs\\" I speak of are merely the results of good fiction writing, but that excuse does not explain the rather questionable behavior of the characters in this farce. To better explain my point let me now ask you, the reader, a little hypothetical question of my own. <br />Lets say for the sake of arguement, that you were over a close friends house chatting in the upstairs bedroom, as their father sat downstairs by himself in a darkened kitchen. All of a sudden you hear the unmistakable explosive sound of a large caliber hand gun echoing through the house from the very location of the said father. So now your friend and you in sure panic hustle down the stair case with your hearts poundingin your throats anticipating God knows what, only to find your worst fears realized. Your friends father is hunched over a blood and gore coated table, deader then a doornail with a sizable seeping hole in his head, and an eerie smirk frozen on his dead face. What would you do? <br /> <br />A) Would you flip out and go hysterical and possibly run down the walk way screaming blue murder like the poor maid who discovered the butchered bodies at the Sharon Tates house? <br /> <br />B) Or would you study the dead body like an exhibit at the Smithsonian, and smile back at the smirking corpse while your friend does nothing but act all nonchalant about their freshly murdered father?  <br /> <br />Unfortunately the fine people who brought you American Beauty did not answer A, they figured that B, was a suitable ending for this fine story. Believe you me, the sigh of dissapointment I let out in the theatre was heard 10 rows back. To make matters even more dire, they also chose to have the murderer be the militant homophobe next door, talk about problematic representation of sexuality, according to these guys, homosexuality might as well be a mental illness that brings with it the confused desire to kill any straight person who snubs their passes, YIKES!! My second sigh of grief was fallowed by a rather lenthy profane grumble of disgust. As a result I have only seen this film two times, once in 1999 at the theatre, the second time about four months back in an attempt to give this film a second chance. The result is obvious, the same sence of betrayal I felt still prevaded any enjoyment that the situations may have provided me in this film, overall the film was killed by its hypothetical cliche's. <br />P.S. as a side note, I think that Meg Griffen from the Family Guy played the role of Kevin Spacy's daughter in this film, but don't hold me to it.

B00004Z459|1.0|Decent rapcore/nu metal (I use those terms VERY loosely here) began and died at the genre's roots: Bands like RATM and Faith No More. Linkin Park is music for 14 year old girls to make Inu-Yasha music videos with.
0440238609|3.0|WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS! <br /> <br />Plusses were the cool ideas and overall subversive tone.  A diverse array of creatures large and small populate various worlds, which all seem to be in some sort of crisis centered around the ever-mysterious \\"dust.\\" <br /> <br />Minuses: the overall length (I thought it could have been about 100 pages shorter), absence of humor, and cold-bloodedness. <br /> <br />The gadgets and magical devices have a sort of retro-future stylish coolness which makes me automatically like them, since I simply adore retro-future anything.  Oddly, the use of zeppelins as a form of transport in various worlds is widespread, in spite of their obvious, well-known hazards, and this results in a number of spectacular explosions.  Fortunately, it's mostly the bad guys whose zeppelins explode, but still you gotta wonder why they couldn't find a better way to get around. <br /> <br />Many vague pokes at the \\"church\\" and \\"authority,\\" though exactly where they're pointed is not entirely clear.  A healthy skepticism seems to pervade, and we're given some hints at Eastern philosophy (e.g. the I Ching), but there is little indication where the line of questioning might lead. <br /> <br />Down sides include a general absence of humor, which I find odd coming from a British writer. There is nothing to compensate for the generally aloof atmosphere.  <br /> <br />Big downside: the reader is led to develop affinity and affection for many characters who wind up dying in order to serve the greater cause of, well, it's not exactly clear.  The dust, I guess.  Fortunately the deaths aren't generally gory, but they often seem rather pointless. <br /> <br />The resolutions often left me with somewhat of a hollow and perfunctory feeling.  For example, a cataclysmic ozone-hole-sized leakage of the valuable 'dust' into the infinite abyss suddenly ceases when the two main characters engage in a bit of sparking and smooching.  Its explained by vague references to the garden ofeden, Eve, and original sin, but I found the logic unsatisfying and anticlimactic.  And worse -- the 'romance' was unconvincing. <br /> <br />Perhaps the author was trying to explain things a bit too well.  For instance, the dead are all teleported into this grim, dismal underground cave, where they traverse a large body of water to land of ghosts.  Fortunately, one of the main characters creates a doorway back to the land of the living, so the ghosts can -- well, vanish into oblivion.   <br /> <br />An improvement over being a ghost in a dreary cavern, I suppose, but somehow lacking in a quality of mystery which I somehow associate with one of the greatest unknowns in the sphere of human experience (i.e. death). <br /> <br />In the last few pages, the author begins dispensing morals, which seem oddly disconnected with the rest of the story. <br /> <br />Despite imperfections, I would still recommend it.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|One of the most wonderful things about the character of Lizzie Bennet is her superb wit and intelligence. I couldn't find any in Keira's portrayal. With so much inane giggling going on, I wondered as to what made her Elizabeth so appealing to Mr Darcy with so many other girls falling at his feet with the same temperament and character. It was very disappointing.
0060925000|3.0|It took me many months to finish this novel, especially with the course meetings I was attending that winter, and what slowed me up most was my disbelief about the tone of the dialogues. I showed many passages to my mother and she thought it unbelievable that these things should have happened in that way in the 1950s. I think this is a sincere book but it is not accurate and it is not vivacious, and this disappoints me.
B000286SCO|3.0|This is a good DVD. It contains lots of rare performances, music videos, and 3 hours of band commentary. The only problem is the sound quality, which is dreaful. Because of the EQ, John Petrucci sounds paper thin, Myung can barely be heard, and James sounds horrible (partly because he \\"screams\\" half the songs and partly because of the way it's mixed in). For fans who have a genuine appreciation of Dream Theater, this DVD is worth it. For mere casual fans or new fans who are just getting to know the band now, I'd recommend \\"Scenes From NY\\" or \\"Budokon\\" instead.
1400079179|1.0|This is such a dull book, really, but lots of people bought it! It is great undigested pieces of information downloaded from Google and pasted together with rubbish cliche characters! And it is also very disrespectful to the Christian faith, only not even in a funny or clever way. It is a sad comment on Canada that I have seen so many people reading it in public these last years.
B00005AR3G|5.0|This movie is really funny. Kids will love it. This movie was made for family enjoyment. The movie is not just for kids, adults will find it very funny also. <br /> <br />
B000AP04FG|2.0|This poor attempt at re-creating the magic of True Lies fails miserably.  Both Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie are extremely stiff in their roles as the stereotypical upper-middle class couple in appearance that are secretly government operatives.  Of course their next sanctions are each other.  Their attempts at murdering each other is way below the caliber of The War of the Roses and Vince Vaughn plays a poor version of Tom Arnold's character from True Lies.  The special effects pale compare to any of the Charlies Angel's films or even True Lies which is about 15 years old.  Better to wait for this one to come to cable than to waste your money on it!
B00005R87Q|5.0|Who doesn't like to drive fast? I'm pretty sure everyone does. Those guys in the movies are crazy, but it makes me want to drive like they do, and not get killed. Vin Diesel is his best in the movie. It's a very moving and interesting movie to watch. <br />
0312995423|5.0|It is never a bore to read Dan Brown's novel.  His novels are always well-researched.  Not only they thrilling and exciting, they are also educational and informative.  Fast-paced and very unpredictable!  TRIUMPHANT!
B00005JM4Z|5.0|If you liked the first one, you have to like this one. It's good. It made me smile. It's funny but at the same time serious and sexy. The first one and the second fast and furious are the bomb. <br /> <br />
0920668372|2.0|I liked the story up until the part where the mother goes across town, climbs through her adult son's bedroom window, and rocks him while singing.  Then we have the next section of the story where the son has to rock her because she is too old, frail and possibly dying.  Who wants to read something like that to their child as a bedtime story?       <br />My husband thinks it's a sweet book.  I think it's strange.  Therefore it is not allowed to be read in this house again. <br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B000059TEP|4.0|Very interesting plot of the movie. Very moving and interesting. Funny and serious at the same time. Overall good movie to watch with a loved one. <br />
B000EHRVP6|2.0|It wasnt really all that good, it was more of a soft corn porn...and not enough glore or torture like you think it would be.
B00007K02F|2.0|As Rochester remarks, there is much more to Jane Eyre than her starched demeanor allows and in turn, more to Rochester than his repressed and sometimes cruel stance.  The book is a testament to character shaping destiny and of course a love that transcends and transforms their lives.<br /><br />The movie fails at all levels and despite a good star cast, leaves the viewer betrayed.  That might seem like a harsh adjective to use but after reading Jane Eyre and being moved by Charlotte Bronte's excellent story, the movie is a complete let down.<br /><br />The bright spark in this adaptation is Anna Paquin who brings young Jane to life.  William Hurt and Charlotte Gainbourg have no chemistry.  Her acting is wooden and Rochester looks like he would rather be anywhere else than Thornfield.  I don't blame him!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has to be one of the best bands ever. This album was just amazing and puts you in that odd mood.<br /><br />there Genius.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I'm due to be married later this year & have always adored the song 'the way you look tonight' & had chosen Rod Stewarts version for our 1st dance, that was until I heard Michael Buble sing it & instantly changed my mind & am now having his version. There was only ever one person I thought could pull off jazz music successfully & that was the wonderful Frank Sinatra but I have been proven wrong after listening to Michael Buble sing he certainly is the 21st centurys Frank. He is so fresh & talented & at such a young age he truly is gifted he brings a whole new meaning to jazz. Even if jazz music isn't your thing give Michael Buble listen & I promise you'll be swayed.
0761944524|5.0|Normally I wouldn't take the time to write a book review but this one is so good that I want to share.  You can use this book to teach yourself a years worth of statistics.  While it includes introductory material suitable for undergrads, this book addresses the complexity that graduate students require to use the procedures with confidence.  Additionally, this book skips unnecessary math, is written with accessible language, and has self explanatory references.  Write another book Andy, I could use one on SEM!
B00005JOUM|5.0|An outstanding thriller that you won't want to miss. Spike Lee shows hius genius with this one.
B000957O82|5.0|I know this won't get me a lot of \\"helpful\\" votes, but I have to say it.  I am not a big Will Smith fan.  I don't like Science Fiction.  Hated \\"Prince of Bel Aire.\\"  Thought Men in Black was slack!  But I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  It really is fantastic!<br /><br />I have to say first of all, major kudos to the Music arranger and music writers.  I really loved the soundtrack selection, as well as the original sound recordings for this movie.  From the first hit song, playing during the opening arrangement, Hitche's intro, to the final notes, every song is dead on, and perfect.<br /><br />Michael Rappaport.  Can somebody explain to me why this guy isn't a bigger star getting bigger roles?  Is he somebody's buddy?  He plays every part he's in perfectly, and I wish we could see more of him.  He's in one short bar scene playing pool with Will Smith's character, as we get to know who Hitch really is.<br /><br />I also like Eva Mendes, and the other smaller roles throughout.  And of couse, Kevin James steals every scene he is in.  He really is a great physical comedian.  Every scene he is in made me scream with laugher.  I'm exaggerating a bit, but you know what I mean.<br /><br />I originally watched this on the UMD on my PSP, but I also rented it on DVD, and enjoyed the extras very much.  Commentary is great, and enjoyable.  I liked learning about the decisions about soundtrack, especially since I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />Great twin storylines between Hitch and the Kevin James character. I liked the dance scene at the end, at their wedding.  I really liked this movie!
044651506X|5.0|I might be the only person in the world to read the John Corey series backwards (\\"Night Fall\\" then \\"Lion's Game\\", and finally \\"Plum Island\\"), but it doesn't matter. However you read these novels, you will walk away wanting more!  <br /> <br />John Corey is a charming lead character who is smart enough to know when to act dumb. He likes to act like he doesn't care, but his problem is often that he cares too much.  <br /> <br />I have November 6th circled on my calendar for the next installment and until then I will find a copy of the Gold Coast (not a John Corey novel, but a page-turner by all indications...) and enjoy! <br /> <br />If you want to get drawn into a wonderful series, pick this plum and enjoy!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Oh, rock on!!!! This was a wierdly awesome movie about a kid named Donnie Darko. I am afraid to say that this will not be a wonderful reveiw because Donnie Darko is too wierd and complicated to really explain without spoilers. BUT the acting is great, the wierdness is...expected, and the plot is so incredibly original that anyone who appreciates new ideas and is not put-off buy oddness and tall bunny rabbits will love this movie.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Well here it is. Another 75 minutes of epic metal. I doubt your average Tool fan will be disappointed. I honestly would have been happy with something shorter and with more punch like \\"Undertow\\" again, but here we get what \\"Lateralus\\" basically was, in a good way. A lengthy disc where no song stands-out, but the entire album does as a whole. One thing I wanted to mention that few have, is how incredible the packaging is. Each Tool album has had consistently unique artwork, and \\"10,000 Days\\" takes the cake so far. It has numerous double images in a cd book, that when viewed through the special glasses (which are part of the case) make for excellent 3-D pictures. Under the right light they just jump out at you. Very colorful, very creepy, very Tool.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Oh God this is a tie for best series ever (With BSG)!!!!!! Oh, God, the writing, the acting, the special effects...even the theme song! It's all wonderful; if you like Battlestar Galactica (the NEW BSG) you MUST check this out. Rock ON, Serenity!!!!!! <br /> <br />--A Firefly Fan
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Rihanna's sophomore album is very good, better than her first. SOS is a great dance-pop song, even if it is a little overplayed. Unfaithful is also a great song. Over all, this is an enjoyable CD.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|First off, let's attack the hypocracy head on .  Yes, I bought the different VHS versions and YES, I will probably buy the first disc of this (surprise) rerelease.  Now, with that out of the way, to business.... <br /> <br />Why was anyone surprised at all this would be the way Lucasfilm would handle the final (?) release in what has been a lucrative franchise?  After all, the proposed television projects (and the IMAX 3-D versions being rumored) aside, there will be no more \\"Star Wars\\" in the future.  Let's at least recognize, albeit grudgingly, the genious of Lucas to maximize beyond even his expectations, the profits from this \\"labor of love.\\"  I think what bothers me about the whole thing was how sanctimonious and hypocritical Georgie-boy is by saying that money really isn't important to him.  Isn't important?  How so?  Hasn't he become the businessman, the ESTABLISHMENT, he says he hated when he began his career?  In this regard, he sounds much like Claude Rains' character in \\"Casablanca\\" when he shuts down Rick's Cafe Americaine. \\"Shocked, SHOCKED, I am to find out people will keep buying the same thing over and over, if I keep releasing minutely different versions of it!\\" <br /> <br />That having been said, for those who aren't going to make the jump to the High-Def DVD format right away (like me), at least the first one will be necessary.  I want my childhood memories back.  I've heard that both formats of High-Def DVD will be retro compatable, so this will probably be my last \\"Star Wars\\" direct purchase.  Hey, since I'm pointing out hypocracy, I must at least be honest about my own.  I'll probably buy \\"Star Wars\\" for nostalgia, but that will be surely it.

B0002XVQNU|4.0|It's SO hard to review this disc fairly.  I mean, if there was EVER an argument over the studios wanting to maximize the profits from one movie by releasing several versions of it, \\"Daredevil\\" makes a compelling piece of evidence for the trend.  (George Lucas himself would be the clincher for the plaintiff, but I digress).  As the talking heads say for themselves, there will always be praise and dirision for both versions.  I actually LIKED the cinema cut, despite some rather huge plot holes, but there is a case for telling what amounts to be the real story of \\"Daredevil.\\"  The theater release was on the receiving end of some scathing reviews, and most of them were dead-on:  too little story, too many arty jump-cuts and \\"cutsy\\" bits (particularly in the playground \\"fight-dance\\"), and too much buildup for too little payoff (the \\"Kingpin Showdown\\"). <br /> <br />So why was all the primo story sequences and extended fight stuff cut?  Demographics, my friend.  And I get the feeling most of the creative crew weren't involved with what went out, as the story only benfitted from them being left in.  THIS was a necessary rerelease.  Yes, the first disc is still a must have, but one must wonder as to why, if the memory was chock full with the first DVD, wasn't this movie WORTH a 3-DVD treatment the first go-round?
B000002UEB|5.0|OK, yeah, so I reviewed this already, but that was a stupid as s review. Well, maybe it was not that bad but my views on it have changed, so I must rewrite it.    For those who don't know, Queensryche is an American band from Seattle that fuses power metal (Iron Maiden) with prog rock (Pink Floyd), but it sounds nothing like grunge and it doesn't have cheesy vocals and Helloween-esque dungeons and dragons lyrics. Their 3rd album 'Operation: Mindcrime' (1988) is simply one of the best albums ever and my review title is no exaggeration, this stands as the best album I've ever heard. When it comes to a concept album, this is by far the best ever put out. Yes, it's even better than 'The Wall', 'Tommy' and 'Scenes From A Memory'. This has everything a rock/metal fan could ask for; superb vocals, musicianship that doesn't fail to impress, thrashy and speedy moments and even ballads. Sure, it's not very heavy and not very technical either. But that's not what matters here. What really matters here is the depth of the songs. Although don't get me wrong, I do appreciate techincal skill (that's why Dream Theater is one of my favorite bands), and I also like listening to technical music yet brutal (ex. Cryptopsy's 'None So Vile', Morbid Angel's 'Covenant' and Slayer's 'Reign in Blood'). Geoff tate is one of the best songwriters ever (with all the help of Chris DeGarmo), and is an amazing vocalist. Aside from his great voice he has ability to hold high notes and switch from a high shriek to a low growl (NOT a death metal growl), much like The Air Raid Siren. And the musicianship, while not that technical, does go perfectly with the vocals, what makes it a PERFECT album with no single boring moment. EVERY second of the whole hour it takes is just perfect. There is no filler to be found here. Every song here gets at least a 10 out of 10. The album also tells a story (duh, it's a concept album). I agree with other reviewers who said this is the besr story to be told an a CD. The main character is Nikki, a drug addict who seeks help, then meets Dr. X who brainwashes him and orders him to kill a politician and an ex-wh ore called mary. The rest you'll figure out. Anyway I'll go through my favorite songs.    After a short introduction (I Remember Now) the album starts with an instrumental (Anarchy X) that goes into 'Revolution Calling' which is my favorite song on the album, it has a very catchy chorus and an incredible solo in the beginning. Then come the title track which is another one of my favorite songs. 'Speak' has an Iron Maiden-ish opening riff with creepy vocals an in all is another good song. 'Spreading the Disease' has a great drum sound and vocals. 'The Mission' is the best ballad on the album, it starts soft with a phone ring, but during the chorus it becomes heavier. 'Suite Sister Mary' is the longest song on the album as well as the darkest song on the album. And also consist awesome female vocals, and Geoff Tate is like one BMF here. The comes the much maligned 'The Needle Lies', it is the heaviest song on the album, the guitars here kinda remind 'Freewheel Burning' by Judas Priest, don't skip this one. 'Electric Requiem' and 'Breaking the Silence' while not my favorite songs are still superb tracks. 'I Don't Believe in Love' is the best song between TNL and EOAS. Then there are 2 skits, 'Waiting for 22' and 'My Empty Room' which lead into perhaps one of the best hard rock songs ever, 'Eyes of A Stranger'. This one left me speechless when I first heard it, it ias one of the best album closers ever. No words can describe this song.    Another thing I should point out, while the production here is awesome I think the remastered has even more clarified the sound, the reason I didn't review that is because something seems to be f uc ked up with reviewing that. So I recommend that over the original.    I guess I won't go on anymore, I can't really do this masterpiece justice. It's just unbelievely good. If you are a rock/metalhead you MUST have this in your collection.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|Harry Lockhart is a petty thief who has a turn of good luck when he's running from the police and enters an audition for a movie.  The cops don't find him and he's shipped to LA to screen test for a role.  Along the way he encounters Gay Perry, a consultant who is supposed to help Harry get into character for his role as a private investigator.  In preparation for the role, they unwittingly become involved in a real LA murder mystery involving Harmony, a struggling actress from Harry's past.<br /><br />This film was very funny and wasn't afraid to make fun of itself by using stereotypical Hollywood cliches.  In fact, one of the funnier things about it was the storyline revolving around how fake and ridiculous life in Hollywood is.  Good examples: A woman who comes up to Harry and says, \\"I do a little acting\\" is then shown to be the type of actress in late night Cinemax movies, or when a catty girl says Harry is checking him out he notes that they must have taken America by the East coast and shaken it, only the normal girls stayed and the others rolled down to LA.<br /><br />Overall this movie was funny and full of self-deprecating humor.  Val Kilmer's role as Perry was the highlight for me, as he was understatedly amusing in his supporting part.  The murder mystery takes a backseat to the comedy in this worthwhile film and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
1400079179|3.0|I usually like my murder mysteries under 300 pages, so when Dan Brown stuffed 200 pages of repetitive mumbo-jumbo about the Crusades and Opus Dei and double-secret Roman Catholic societies into his muted thriller, he lost me. I had to finish the book for my discussion group, but the effort didn't pay off. I tip my hat to him for finding a formula that sells 60 million books plus, but I don't think the Da Vinci Code will be an enduring read. There's nothing wrong with having a gimmick and he's wrapped a decent read around this one. Don't confuse it it with a) literature b) history or c) religious revelation.
B000AYEI5Y|2.0|Other then \\"You're Beautiful\\" and \\"Wisemen\\", this is a pretty crappy cd!  James' voice sounds the same in every song.  When I first heard those two songs I thought WOW, this guy's cd must sound fantastic.  I was wrong, really wrong.  I have to agree though that some songs are somewhat catchy, but it's nothing special.  \\"Voice of an angel\\" my butt, his voice gets annoying after awhile.  He sounds like he's getting over a cold or something.  Not recommended, unless you're a fan of You're Beautiful and Wisemen, or better yet, download the songs.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|If you like Sabbath, Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, T-Rex, Rainbow, and Spinal Tap, you'll LOVE this band.  It's good for a game of \\"name that riff.\\"  These guys wear their influences on their sleeves, and aren't afraid to talk unicorns.
B00005NRO3|5.0|What do i have to say except far,far  better than the 1st.
B00000F2GH|5.0|Thanks for expressing what many people want to say....How could a 40th Anniversary outdated VHS tape be issued for BILLY BUDD?  I'm sure a multitude of movie goers are waiting for the DVD version, which is LONG OVERDUE as older movies have been released already.  It is unbelieveable that whoever is responsible for holding this film from the public is doing a disservice to the cast and crew of this quality movie.  Anyone know who is holding \\"the rights\\" to this film?
B000ESSTKG|5.0|If you have a universal player, the DVD-A portion of the second disk (which has both a 24/96 hi-rez stereo and 5.1 mix) is outstanding.  I actually think that this is one of the better hi-rez mixes that I've yet heard.  Very much worth the extra $$ IMHO.
B00005JO20|2.0|My basic analogy for what Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' is like is: what if you took a blender, and tossed in grilled hamburger, pickles, chocolate ice cream, ketchup, cheese, wasabi, vodka, peanut butter, guacamole, orange juice, mashed potatoes, maple syrup, hot chili peppers, one Mountain Dew, four espressos, and then you set your blender on 'HIGH' and ground all this stuff up together, until you came out with a big, frothy, gloopy, stinking porridge of stuff that might've been tasty on its own, but now makes absolutely no aesthetic sense at all!     Case in point: what possible sense does it make to have a violently repugnant scene of men being eaten alive by surreally huge, slimy, grotesque worms with fangs in one scene - and then cut to the next scene, where the big gorilla and his lovely human damsel-in-distress recline together to watch the ultimate Hallmark-card sunset together in some sort of 'romantic idyll'? Way to develop the dramatic/romantic atmosphere through scene structure, Mr. Jackson! I honestly can't remember another movie having more jarring & outright ludicrous shifts-of-tone since David Lynch's 'Wild At Heart.'     I think this would be *the perfect* movie for students in film schools to be given, to learn the 'art of editing;' their assignment would be: Take this bloated, unruly behemoth of a movie, and chop out ONE WHOLE HOUR of the super-extraneous, pointless, redundant & downright annoying material. Because the fact of the matter is, ladies & gents, perhaps in the entire history of movies has there never been a more obvious case of a potentially impressive and enjoyable 2-hour-long movie lurking inside a swollen, obnoxious, post-Oscar-winning-monomanaical, \\"everything I write and shoot is golden,\\" director's-head-up-his-derriere 3-hour (or 4-hour, depending on your DVD) pseudo-epic.     The movie is far from worthless - but it wouldn't be so infuriating if it was worse.  The production design and special effects are mostly brilliant, and Kong's final scaling of, and fall from, the Empire State Building is very satisfying (with exception to the completely implausible choreography of the human characters throughout the sequence).  Unfortunately, as beautifully as Kong has been digitally realized, the story completely fails on any recognizable human level, mainly because all of the characters seem wheeled out of the movie studio's decades-old Closet of Stock Cliches (the screenwriters and director haven't even dusted them off - they LIKE all that dust).  Naomi Watts brings zip and life to whatever she does, and of all the actors present her generic down-on-her-luck-flapper fares the best.  The incredibly gifted Adrien Brody, so extraordinarily compelling and heartbreaking in Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist', brings an understated charm to his underwritten and underdeveloped Depression-era Broadway playwright; his character's relevance becomes increasingly lost in the din and dank of Skull Island, and is all but completely discarded by the time Kong reaches the island of New York.  And Jack Black as the opportunistic-filmmaker-turned-totally-craven-businessman acts like he just brushed up on (but didn't bother to finish) his Intro-To-Theatre-101 Cliff Notes; Black's marvelous comic potential, which always has the possibility of hitting some wickedly enjoyable high notes ala Jack Nicholson, is used by Peter Jackson for less than five minutes of this entire dreary endeavor. (Black and his supporting cast basically spend all their time amateurishly over-emulating in this Tin Pan Alley action-adventure soap opera, desperately trying to bring some life to the endless and interminable procession of lifeless scenes in Jackson's & Fran Walsh's & Phillipa Boyen's shrieking-for-rewrites screenplay.)     From his truly-worthy-of-the-title-of-\\"masterpiece\\" 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' to 'King Kong', Peter Jackson, The Director As Superstar, has gone from emulating a masterly David Lean of 'Lawrenceof Arabia' to the insufferable artistic egotism of a Michael Cimino circa 'Heaven's Gate,' only with a zillion geeky fanboys around the world willing to shill out an extra $20 to obsessively salivate over his every passing thought and mundane remark on bonus supplementary DVDs (which lately seem to be just as important a concern, if not more so, to Jackson than the actual movie which he's working on).  I sincerely hope in the coming years of his career that Jackson does not become a prisoner of his own multi-million-dollar FX and art departments at his rightly honored WETA Workshop in New Zealand, and instead gets back to doing what he does best: making movies featuring compelling human characters and stories.  His earlier masterpiece, 'Heavenly Creatures' (1994), one of the very finest movies of the last 20 years, was made for around 1/100th of the budget of 'King Kong,' and has 1,000 times more genuinely human emotional impact, not to mention truly audience-invested entertainment value.  (It would be most heartening if Jackson follows through with his tentative plans to scale his operation down & adapt Alice Sebold's terrifying modern literary classic 'The Lovely Bones' for the screen, because at the moment there is no living movie director who is more in need of a stupefyingly-overwrought-big-budget-blockbuster aesthetic enema.)     My girlfriend's review of Jackson's 'King Kong' was simple enough: \\"That movie was a pain in my a** - literally & figuratively.\\"
B00005JOVH|5.0|I was upset to learn the X-MEN franchise would be releasing the final film in the series.  Ever since the first installment, these movies have been a real rarity -- a superhero blockbuster with depth, emotion and, of course, out-of-this-world special effects.  However, THE LAST STAND gives the audience a fitting ending... as well as a believable, not hackneyed, \\"open door\\", just in case the principles (well, most of them, at least) decide they want to don their costumes in another X-MEN endeavor somewhere down the line. <br /> <br />Whoever's currently in the driver's seat of the upcoming FANTASTIC FOUR sequel should watch this movie (as well as the other two films in the series) as they're a clear and concise \\"how-to\\" instructional guide on how to produce a superhero epic that's much more than big explosions, colorful costumes and a Hollywood flavor of the moment looking cute.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Once again, the wondrous world of the Vampire descends upon the modern audience. However, if filmmakers are to succeed in this dark genera, the ingredients must be sufficient to capture and hold the attention of an increasingly sophisticated viewer. Thus any attempt to hold an audience today must not be aimed at the adult, but at the terrifying nightmare world of the child. Spare the incredible and you lose your audience. Underworld, The Evolution, has done just that. It fires the imagination with a Gothic story which spans centuries and synthesizes it with the latest in special effects and modern weaponry. The Result, a superb, action-driven and utterly fantastic film which entreats and then terrifies the curious and medieval child in each of us. Adding to the darkly savage, high speed, bullet-ripping landscape is the rare appearance and over the top performance of Sir Derek Jacobi as Alexander Corvinus. He is aptly aided by Tony Curran and Scott Speedman as his sons, Michael and Marcus Corvinus. Kate Beckinsale returns as Selene. Together, they weave a black tapestry of blood, betrayal and vengeance which dates to the Roman era. The entire cast refines the blood-sucking, throat slashing and nightmarish, but evolutionary saga of the legendary Vampire and Werewolf. ****
0307275639|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie teaches you a lot of life lessons.  Mitch is best friends with his professor, Morrie.  Mitch never really liked school, but he liked Morrie and they became best friends.  At graduation, Mitch told Morrie that he would keep in touch with him, but he let his work get in the way of keeping in touch with his friend.  Mitch sees Morrie on TV after he has been diagnosed with ALS, also Lou Gherig's disease.  Mitch flies out to see Morrie and reconnects with him and after 16 years of not seeing each other, Morrie is very happy to see Mitch.  Mitch flies back to see Morrie every Tuesday until Morrie dies.  Morrie teaches him a different lesson every week and the book is based on this. I liked this book because even thought Morrie knows he is dying he is still so happy about living every day.  I think other teenagers would like this book because it holds your interest and it is not too long.
B000001FDQ|5.0|This album is one in a million in more ways than one.  Yngwie is a one-in-a-million guitarist.  He's made about a million records, and this is the best.  As far as the songs go, Black Star and Far Beyond the Sun are the most famous though my favorite track is Evil Eye.  Evil Eye has a great start/stop neo-classical feel to it.  Through the magic of overdubbing, Yngwie switches back and forth from his strat to a classical guitar.  BTW, he plays the bass parts on Rising Force as well.  Scott Soto is NOT the greatest vocalist ever, but it works here as just another instrument in the mix. <br /> <br />Many have charged that Malmsteen's music lacks soul and on some of his subsequent albums I might agree.  As time progresses, he starts to fall back on the same licks over and over again and the speed gets overwhelming.  But of all his albums, this is by far the most soulful.  There is so much feeling and fire behind his playing on Rising Force.  You can hear him backing off a bit on the speed and holding some of the notes longer with more vibrato on tracks like Evil Eye and Icarus's Dream Suite. <br /> <br />People love comparing guitarists and calling them virtuosos even if they aren't that technically proficient as long as they have \\"soul\\".  \\"Soul\\" usually translates to more pop-influecned sound.  Folks, SRV was NOT a virtuoso, he flat out ripped off a bunch of much more talented black blues masters.  David Gilmour is an excellent guitarist with a great feel for bluesey pop, but once again NOT a virtuoso.  If any of the speed gods plays souless music it's Steve Vai.  A last note, one of the greatest reasons Yngwie does not progress as much as one might expect over the 20 years after Rising Force is that he was involved in a horrific car crash in 1988 and had to relearn how to play the guitar.  Then he suffered a mild stroke in 1993 and had to do it again.  So as much as Jason Becker is one of Metal's greatest what-ifs, so too is Yngwie Malmsteen.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|(Minor spoilers with ###)<br /><br />I wanted to see this movie mainly for the music.  It didnt disappoint!  I've got to say I've developed myself quite a little crush on Rosario Dawson.  I tell you, that girl NEEDS to put out an album!!!!  She was amazing in this movie!!!!  The whole cast were really good in fact.  They harmonized beautifully!  No matter which few cast members were singing they sounded good together!  Its when you got a whole handful of them singing at the same time that the songs really hit thier peak.  But whether many characters or just two, I don't remember a single song that i vehemently hated with a passion.<br /><br />As for the story...well...I kinda felt both beat over the head and stabbed at the same time.  Rich people suck, poor people are wonderful, blah blah blah.  I said this as kind of a joke, but I realized it could've been absolutely true and why they did it.  #####There's a scene in a dinner where all the poor people are going around and pushing the tables together.  At the end of thier line, three rich guys (the ones who want to tear down their apartments to make a cyber cafe or something) are sitting there.#####  Now it just so happens the poor people have square tables.  They can push their tables together and converse.  The rich peoples' table however is round, meaning they can't connect with anybody.  Which is, in fact, the point of the movie from what I could gather.  Rich people are bad and poor people are a proud people.<br /><br />This movie is very black and white when it comes to who the villians are and who the good people are supposed to be.  Maybe the musical itself is better on this.  Dont know, never seen it.  But, for the film, the music is it's strength.  It's worth watching just for that alone.  And I more than suggest that you do.
B0007Y08QA|2.0|The film fails to create a bond between the viewer and Bale's character until the very end, when it's too late to enjoy. Perhaps watching it for a 2nd time might be better, but it would hard to watch it again because of the stupid insertion of the role of IVAN, a character poorly drawn and awkwardly portrayed in the film. And then there's the ridiculous scene when Bale, after having been crushed by a car, runs away from the police. Simply absurd. But when we know what Bale has done to bring on inscrutable insomnia, much of the film comes together a bit better.
B00005JO1R|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  I'm a huge movie fan, and am quite critical.  Reese & Joaquin are extremely impressive in this film, and I'm so glad Reese won Best Actress.  That was the only appropriate award given that night!  This should have won Best Picture by far.  I think Johnny Cash would be pleased.  Nobody can exactly capture Johnny's unique gruff voice, but Joaquin did such a great job.  The movie flowed nicely from beginning to end, and I loved the subtle hints in Johnny's life that inspired his music.  I don't buy movies unless they are very good, and this one is definitely worthy of purchasing.  I will own it and watch it again and again!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I consider Blood Sugar Sex Magik to be one of the finest albums of the 90's, and also one of the most unique pieces of art ever assembled. So, thirteen years later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are back to gather the best of the old, and kick it into the best of the new. Stadium Arcadium is a major step forward for these guys. Flea's bass grooves are as funky as ever. John Frusciante is still a master at the guitar. Chad Smith's drumming is at his finest. But the real star of Stadium Arcadium is none other than frontman Anthony Kiedis. He has evolved and matured so much over the past two decades that it actually makes me cry. Check out tracks like \\"Storm in a Teacup\\" and \\"Turn it Again\\", perfect examples of his amazing vocal range.    Starting off with \\"Dani California\\", the lead single, they hit you with one of their most rocking songs yet. Then, immediately after, they smack you in the face with beautiful and more mellow \\"Snow ((Hey Oh))\\", which is the perfect example of how tremendously these guys have grown up. Unlike By the Way, Stadium Arcadium brings back the funk with tracks like \\"Charlie\\", \\"Hump de Bump\\" and \\"She's Only 18\\". Fans will be overjoyed by these numbers. \\"Wet Sand\\" has to have one of the best endings on any Red Hot Chili Pepper song, ever. This is all great, but...Stadium Arcadium is a double album, and we are only talking about disc one here! Most double albums tend to be bloated, overlong, pretentious pieces of work, but Stadium Arcadium avoids all the pitfalls and shines. \\"Desecration Smile\\", the first song on disc two, Mars, is one of the finest tracks here. It is also surprisingly similar to what could be a John Frusciante solo track. Some of the Peppers' most mature songs await on disc two as well, such as the catchy \\"She Looks to Me\\", \\"Make You Feel Better\\", and \\"If\\". Don't fret, old time Peppers fans! The funk is here again on disc two, and even more prominently than on disc one. \\"Storm in a Teacup\\" is a painfully retarded funky song with nonsensical but amusing lyrics. \\"Animal Bar\\" and \\"Turn it Again\\" also show this. Songs like these are what make me love the Red Hot Chili Peppers: they are serious, fun, and just plain awesome to listen to. The album ends with the brilliant \\"Death of a Martian\\", and once this unique song is over, you will be drooling for more. Stadium Arcadium is the reason why I love music so much. I cannot explain why, other than it is just so fun to listen to.    Standout tracks: Snow ((Hey Oh)), Charlie, She's Only 18, Slow Cheetah, Hump de Bump, Desecration Smile, She Looks to Me, Readymade, Make You Feel Better, Animal Bar, Storm in a Teacup, Turn it Again.    One of the finest releases this year.
B000F1IQN2|2.0|MUNICH is an excellent film with the quality production value and performance of any other Spielberg film.<br /><br />Yet, there is no excuse for the fact that Spielberg FICTIONALIZED a large portion of the film. Especially when the TRUE STORY is out there in so many other venues. Like the novels: Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team & Massacre in Munich: The Manhunt for the Killers Behind the 1972 Olympics Massacre.<br /><br />In my opinion, there is no excuse for someone with such power, influence and experience in filmmaking like Spielberg has, to make a film that DISTORTS HISTORY, intent and emotion like MUNICH does. Those who don't have the gumption to look further into the issue will assume that the MOVIE is TRUTH. They will be misinformed.<br /><br />The film IS EXCELLENT, as long as you look at it as FICTION.<br /><br />The events are violent and unapologetic. The brutal nature of the events that unfolded are captured tremendously. Eric Bana's performance is OSCAR WORTHY. The story does get draggy at points, but the overall movie is a solid and worthy piece.<br /><br />So, you come to the point where you have to decide STARS???  Do not be mistaken... this is a 4 or 5 star movie... but how many stars do you take away from a film and a Director that should have known better than to pass off FICTION as FACT. How incredibly ARROGANT and LAZY is it of Spielberg and UNIVERSAL to not have pursued more truth in their film. Included the REAL HITMEN's 2cents?<br /><br />Or is it that UNIVERSAL and SPIELBERG were more concerned about getting across another hollywood skewed message to the current administration about revenge and war making things worse, that they weren't concerned about truth?<br /><br />I THINK IT WAS THIS. With a little arrogance thrown in too. So... I give it a 2.
B000084T18|1.0|1. Why do we care that you got shot 9 times? <br />2. Why do you make a song about the SAME THINGS, ALL THE TIME? <br />3. Why do you pretend you are a pimp? <br />4.

B000E97HIA|1.0|I hate to go against the majority here but I really can't see why this album has garnered so many 5 star reviews. I, like a lot of people was eagerly anticipating this latest Prince album as all the build up to it was indicating that it was marking some kind of artistic renaissance. It's been a long time since I bought a Prince album in it's first week of release and paid \\"full price\\" for it, but I did with 3121.<br /><br />I have tried and tried to give this album a chance to hook me in (this is why I have waited so long to review it) but nothing has happened.<br /><br />To me it just seems like another slickly produced album of what passes these days for R&B.<br /><br />The frustrating thing for me is that these days there is very little grit in Prince's music. He seems to have lost the touch of the avant garde or surrealism that marked his best works.<br /><br />He seems all too happy to just play it safe. In a way you can't blame him as he's obviously \\"shifting units\\" again after the whole symbol debacle, but I feel this is more of a reflection of the quality of his mainstream competion declining rather than an upturn in the quality of Prince's work.<br /><br />I honestly can't pick out a stand out track as they all sound very generic, it's all rather ordinary bland funk/soul.<br /><br />'Fury' was promising after the blistering SNL performance but the album version sounds castrated in comparison.<br /><br />That said, it's an inoffensive enough album. But coming for an artist like Prince that is faint praise indeed.<br /><br />I'll still check him out live as he's one of the best stage performers/musicians I have ever had the pleasure of seeing in concert.<br /><br />I'd like to say \\"I like it\\" I really would! :)
B00004XOWM|1.0|Seriously, every song on this album is terrible. Is there anything else to say except Limp Bizkit is probably the worst band ever? <br /> <br />Vote yes if you agree that LB is terrible, vote no if you like this trash.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|This is her best Deluxe Edition CD ever! The pics are beautiful and her bonus song \\"Fighting Spirit\\" is wonderful. I still do not understand why such a great song could be out of the album, maybe that is one of the reasons, this Special edition is so great!
B0006399FS|5.0|I have been a HUGE U2 fan. The release of this album was long awaited for me, and I have to say...I'm impressed. This band has come around to it's 25th year, and that they still have incredible songs in their pocket is AMAZING. From the power rocker \\"VERTIGO\\" to the quiet but brooding \\"ONE STEP CLOSER\\" we hear their variety. \\"SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T\\" may be among their most real and most heart-renching songs they've ever written, and \\"MIRACLE DRUG\\" invites us back to their days of Achtung Baby. \\"ALL BECAUSE OF YOU\\" and \\"CRUMBS FROM YOUR TABLE\\" are easily pushed aside as regular rock songs at first listen, but to do that, you lose 2 of U2's standard powerful songs. Boldly singing about his beliefs, Bono sings \\"YAHWEH,\\" and possibly the best song on the album \\"CITY OF BLINDING LIGHTS\\" shines brightly. \\"LOVE PEACE\\" gives Edge a moment of his extremely talented fingers on the guitar, while \\"ORIGINAL\\" also gives him some space to do what he does best. The only weak song on the album is \\"MAN AND WOMAN\\" and even taht singles itslef out of the rest as different. A truly incredible new album by the best band to ever grace the scene of rock.

B00005MP58|5.0|I think the one thing that makes me want to watch this again and again is its superb use of the English language. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle handle the dialogue (which came from one of the most beloved novels in the English language) with such ease and finesse that I'm very much convinced that I'm watching Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy in the flesh. I would very much recommend that others who haven't watched it to try and view it. I am very grateful that we have 6 hours(not sure about the exact time) of this miniseries to enjoy.
0920668372|5.0|I ran across this in my local bookstore.  I don't know why I picked it up because I haven't any children, but as I read the pages I realized that I had to purchase it for my father.  You see, Father's Day was coming up and I am his only daughter.  The story of the book really illustrates the circle of love ... and this theme fit so very well for my grandmother, father, and me.<br /><br />Well, I won't give the ending away, but know that he loved the book!  He, my mother, and I sat around and cried as he read aloud from the book.  It is really a very simple, but beautiful story.
B003M0H4NG|5.0|Dennis Miller once said (before he became a right wing paranoid)that 99% of art is crap but that 1% makes you proud to be a human being.  Art being highly subjective, many people may disagree with me when I say that Bitches Brew is an example of high art.  I'd grown up hearing about this album without actually having heard it, finally getting around to a listen sometime in my early 30's. The music lit up my neocortex. I was completely transfixed, amazement giving way to a whole spectrum of emotions as the music took me through heaven and hell exciting me equally.  I heard an inspiration propelling the album and the contributions by the musicians felt in service to the moods and atmospheres being created.  There were moments that generated feelings of actual terror in me as the band drove the sound deep down into the abyss.  Other sections soared in joy.  I've been inspired by alot of music but this album is different for me.  It's very thought provoking.  It's not a casual listen. It's very dense stuff but in my opinion also very accessible.  This may be experimental but it's not groundless.  It has vision and direction. So many musicians were inspired by this album and created great music of their own yet Bitches Brew still shines through the decades.
B000059Z8J|3.0|I fondly remember this movie and looked forward to watch it <br />with my 7 year old.  Unfortunately, the added scenes on Krpton <br />drag the movie out waaayy too long(154 minutes!).  Maybe the <br />superman purists find this incredibly interesting, but for kids it's a drag.  Superman doesn't even appear flying in his uniform <br />until about 50 minutes into the movie!  This movie could be awesome for kids if it was cut down to about 1 hr 50 min., as <br />the caped crusader provides an awesome role model for kids (never lies, fights for justice, and respects his parents! haha).  Anyways, it's still a classic worth seeing, just skip <br />the first 30 minutes until the part where the baby/toddler of steel is in space and about to reach earth.  (-:
0790729342|5.0|The Road warrior, or to call it by its other name - Mad Max 2 is one of those very rare animals, a sequel that manages to be better than the original. Mad Max was a good film but its budgetary constraints showed. The Road Warrior takes the strengths of Mad Max and integrates them with higher production values. The result is an even better looking film than the original, packed with even more scintillating and jaw dropping stunt sequences.<br /><br />In the plot of this film, civilisation has collapsed completely. Survivors scavenge for food and fuel, ruthlessly eliminating any competition by any means that they can. Mel Gibson plays Max, a former Highway Cop, now eking out an existence in his former pursuit car - a V8 Interceptor. Cruising the blighted countryside, he searches for fuel and food, so as to survive.<br />His only companion is his dog and following the events depicted in the previous film, he has become a cold, untrusting, and withdrawn loner.<br />He encounters a character called the Gyro Captain (amusingly played by Bruce Spence) who pilots a mini helicopter. The Gyro Captain shows Max an oil refinery under siege by an army of thugs, sporting Mohican hair cuts. This pack is led by a psychopath called Humungous who wants the refinery and its fuel for himself. Defending the refinery are a group of ordinary people who want to flee the waste lands and set up a new life in a quiet part of the country.<br />Max falls in with this group and helps them in their battle against Humungous and his cronies.<br /><br />The road sequences are stupendous and are a real white knuckle ride to sit through, especially if you have not seen the film before. There are no CGI effects in this film and what you see is all stunt work and it is brilliant. These car chases are peppered throughout the film, culminating in a massive chase involving a huge and amoured fuel tanker, pursued by scores of marauders in souped up vehicles.<br />Great to watch in the cinema, this film is equally superb on a home cinema set up. Picture is bright, clear, and pin sharp. Sound is 5.1 and it is superb. Congatulations to Warner Brothers for a superb digital transfer from the Dolby Stereo of the original print to a superbly realised 5.1 dvd soundtrack. Just watch that incredible audio/visual opening sequence of the film itself to see what I mean.<br /><br />One of Mel Gibson's best performances in a film that has become a cult in its own right. See it.et up. Picture is bright, clear, and pin sharp. Sound is 5.1 and it is superb.

B00005O3VD|5.0|The whole thing is Streisand. And she is really tremendous here. Her energy freshness comic sense are all winning elements, but of course what does above all is the voice. The voice has character in the more humorous numbers and it has such 'feeling pure feeling' in the 'People ' and 'My Man' numbers. Streisand in one shot establishes here as the supreme feminine singing talent, and as a comic actress of real quality.<br /><br />I do not know how serious one has to take the plot and the story. What the picture really says is that there is this talent Barbra Streisand who will just knock you out with every little thing she does.
0060752610|4.0|This book is a true classic, and most investors would be well-advised to start with this book as they seek to learn more about the process of making their money work for them.  In particular, Graham's book is useful because it recognizes that the universe of potential investments is greater than just stocks - he covers warrants, bonds, etc.   <br /> <br />Graham's main point is that investors look at the fundemantals that underly a potential investment to determine the probability of a satisfactory outcome.  Hence, Graham does not focus on macroeconomic factors, but instead, he determines the \\"intrinsic value\\" for any investment, hopefully buying well below that value, a concept he calls the \\"margin of safety.\\" <br /> <br />As some reviewers have noted, this book has been criticized by some thinkers as being out of date.  In particular, most readers should understand that one of the theories that underlies Graham's philosophy, that a stock is worth the aggregate value of its expected dividends (See John Burr Williams' \\"Theory of Investment Value\\"), has been modified somewhat by \\"discounted cash flow\\" theories.  This means that to some investors, p/e ratios and dividend payouts are de-emphasized somewhat.  To me, this does not mean that Graham's theories lose validity, particularly as concerns the notions of intrinsic value and the margin of safety. <br /> <br />As far as I am concerned, Graham's book is most useful when viewed as a theory about how to invest.  As such, it is a valuable guide, particularly when read in conjunction with Phil Fisher's book \\"Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits\\" and Marty Whitman and Marty Shubik's book \\"The Aggressive Conservative Investor.\\"  Another book that readers of the Intelligent Investor might like would be Dreman's \\"Contrarian Investing: the Next Generation.\\" <br /> <br />A quick warning to prospective readers: at the outset, reading anything by Graham can be somewhat slow going.  I received a copy of this book as a gift years ago, and could not slog through more than 1/2 of it.  It was only years later, after learning more about investing and accounting, that I truly came to appreciate the wisdom contained in this book. <br /> <br />Readers who appreciate The Intelligent Investor might also want to try \\"Security Analysis,\\" which develops the ideas in the Intelligent Investor in much greater detail, and also sets forth more criteria about how to analyze investments (the chapters on financial statements are particularly useful).  I have reviewed that book (3rd edition) as well, if anyone is interested. <br /> <br />Although it takes some work to make it through this book, one point that readers should understand is Graham firmly believes that it takes work to invest wisely.  He would never encourage investing on tips, momentum investing, etc.  A reader would be well-served to apply himself or herself to investing research with the same diligence that reading this book requires, and I don't doubt they will be rewarded as a result.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I don't really know how to start this review.  I'm kicking back, have L' Via L' Viaquez on full blast, and an ice cold beer in my hand, and I'm thinking to myself, life could not be any better. <br /> <br />I think one thing that needs to be established right now is the fact that there is not a *better* or *worst* album out of the epic De-Loused, and absolutely stunning Frances (or any albums for that matter).  I think there is personal preference, and is exactly how people *should* write their  reviews.  So to begin with, I *will* say that I do prefer Frances over De-Loused. <br /> <br />So why do I prefer Frances?  A lot of people would laugh at me and say that it doesn't even touch the beautiful artwork that De-Loused is, and that it's over-ambience is just simply annoying.  I think this album is definately one of those \\"required tastes\\" albums if you may. <br /> <br />After listening to track 1, Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus for the very first time, I felt the song was all over the place, and unfocused.  I knew at that moment that this entire album would take a while to digest.  After listening to it a series of times, I began to realize that it was some sort of effect that TMV threw in as a curveball.  The song seems to be screaming out \\"Will you have the patience to take the time to listen to me?  If not, get the hell out.  If so, sit back and enjoy the ride\\".  And boy oh boy I've been enjoying the ride for quite some time (I got the album when shortly after it came out). <br /> <br />One major thing to address about the album, I believe, is it's amount of ambience.  The ambience doesn't bother me the least bit.  Infact, I think it enhances the life the album presents.  The ending sequence of Cygnus makes me feel like i'm sitting on a roadside, watching and listening to traffic go by.  When I listen to the ending sequence of The Widow, I feel like i'm listening to a broken record that is suddenly and slowly going insane (as if the broken record had any sort of life).  The buildup to L' Via L' Viaquez is completely necessary, as I don't think i'd like the song as much if it completely exploded out of The Widow's ending ambience.  Essentially what I'm coming to, is that the ambience fits, and it fits wonderfully.  The band decided that they wanted to incorporate it in the album, and they executed it beautifully.   <br /> <br />As I listen to the improvisation of the trumpets on Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore, I can't help but focus my attention on the extravagance of their wonderful musicality.  These are fine musicians. <br /> <br />The ambience of Miranda has passed and Cassandra Gemini has exploded into the scene and come to steal the show.  This song is simply indescribable.  I won't go into specific details, but if you focus your attention on this song for the full 33 or so minutes it shines, you will simply be blown away by it's wonderful progression and substance (maybe not at the first or second listen, as this album IS one of those \\"aquired taste\\" albums).  This is such a great piece of artwork.   <br /> <br />To go ahead and answer more thoroughly the question I stated in paragraph 3, I prefer Frances over De-Loused because it took me longer to appreciate it.  That challenge made me really gain very much appreciation for the amount of musicality that flows through this album.  Not that De-Loused lacks that musicality, it just seems that Frances helped me sprout a whole new level of appreciation that I thought wasn't possible, for honestly any album.  (No doubt there are albums I like more than Frances, but this rare appreciation began with Frances and a select couple of other albums I began to appreciate, only after I started loving Frances). <br /> <br />This album is wonderful.  Some people will recognize it, some won't.  If you are the type of person that isn't impatient and loves to decipher complicated and hard-to-like-at-first-listen music, this album is made just for you.  For the person that is impatient and wants to hear the same boring three chorded poppy song that plays on the radio quite often, I suggest you stop reading this review NOW. (Though i don't think I should even have to say that, they've already lost patience enough with my review and probably stopped reading by the 2nd paragraph). <br /> <br />There are many things to discover about this album.  If you do not already have a copy of this masterpiece, do yourself a favor and buy it at your local record store.  Or, if you are lazy like myself, buy it here off of Amazon.  You simply won't regret it.  And maybe, just maybe, it may be more enjoyable than you thought it'd be, and heck, maybe you'll like it (or appreciate it for that matter) more than De-Loused. <br /> <br />And now for a bonus: A quick rating of each song on the CD. <br /> <br />1. Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus - 9.1/10 <br />2. The Widow - 8.2/10 <br />3. L' Via L' Viaquez - 9.4/10 <br />4. Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore - 8.9/10 <br />5. Cassandra Gemini - 9.9/10 <br /> <br />No review will ever do justice to this album.  After reviewing what i've typed out, I feel like i've done the album somewhat of an injustice for failing to give it a worthy review.  Instead of wasting your time reading my garbage, go buy the damn album already!
0316172324|5.0|I am a market research professional.  As soon as I started reading this book I saw all kinds of practical applicatons in my work for using the knowledge in this book. <br /> <br />I doubt many people will see this in such a tangible way as I do, but anyone will be fascinated by this book. <br /> <br />It is a quick and easy read.  I finished it pretty much in two days, but then, I couldn't put it down! <br /> <br />There are techniques in here that can help you pass exams, feel better about yourself, just feel better etc.  In a sense you can use this as a \\"Self-Help Guide\\" in that way. <br /> <br />The main thing you will pick up from Gladwell is to learn to develop your \\"hunches\\" and your first impressions, and to trust them, because sometimes they are better than what you come up with from detailed rational analysis. <br /> <br />All my life I have been told to analyse, analyse, analyse, get the data and let the data drive the decision.  Gladwell is not saying \\"throw all that away\\".  But he is saying that if your first hunch is negative and the data says positive - beware of the data.  Trust your instincts.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|First off, let me state up front that I have been remiss in my reviewing duties. It's just that I haven't really found anything over the past few months that excited me enough to write about it here for you, the Amazon readers who may rely on the guidance of a twenty-six year old grocery store employee who would like to be the next Nick Hornby or P.J. O'Rourke. I apologize for my tardiness.<br /><br />Secondly, I love this movie. I first saw it a few months ago as part of my Film class's critique of traditional Hollywood genres and how they have been tweaked over time. Needless to say, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" provided the perfect example of this: what Western would have the heros run away from the law, much less take time to ride a bike accompanied by an insipid (but inspired) pop song? \\"Butch Cassidy\\" is everything that is right about the big-budget Hollywood film: star performers who don't mangle the material with their egos but rather play with the conventions of what they're supposed to do, all under the watch of a talented if not well-known director, as the screenplay marries the real history of the notorious outlaws with the liberties of a real shoot-'em-up Western.<br /><br />I loved this movie so much, I ended up doing a scene analysis of the second hold-up as my final project for the class. And got an \\"A\\", of course...<br /><br />So now we have the special-edition version, presented in widescreen and clear and crisp as the day it was first shown in American theaters in the fall of 1969. Paul Newman and Robert Redford carry the film through their obvious chemistry, and \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" jokes aside, they make the perfect bickering couple for this rollicking trip through a not-so-familar Old West.<br /><br />The film also features some top-notch work from Katharine Ross (Elaine from \\"The Graduate\\") as the woman they share (no, not onscreen at least), Strother Martin as the one man willing to give the outlaws a straight job (and gets shot by bandits for his trouble), and the world's unluckiest employee of Mr. E.H. Harriman (whose superposse symbolizes the modern times that catch up with Butch and Sundance even in Bolivia).<br /><br />I haven't gotten into all the special features yet, but I recommend the commentary by Goldman (who is rightfully proud of this film). Also, the \\"History Behind the Lens\\" documentary is interesting and (at ninety minutes) a treat for history buffs who want to see not only how the film differed from the story, but how often it got it *right*. The theatrical trailers are interesting nuggets from a time when Jerry Bruckheimer hadn't ruined movies with achingly slow pans and close-ups set in dramatic lighting with overbearing orchestral scores...or Tom Cruise shirtless. And \\"All of What Follows Is True\\" gives us more recent interviews with the principal cast still around (Newman, Redford, and Ross).<br /><br />All in all, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" is an impossibly giddy mix of drama and comedy set against the backdrop of a dying breed (the Western outlaw) and the last days of the frontier (not in North America, but South). Yes, there are problems with the film, but the overall effect of the piece leaves audiences satisfied that they took the journey. And it doesn't hurt that Redford and Newman are enjoying the hell out of the work they're doing, which shows through to the audience. It may be a cliche, but \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" still delivers.<br /><br />If only all Westerns could be this good...hot by bandits for his trouble), and the world's unluckiest employee of Mr. E.H.

B0000021S9|4.0|I like to think of Chicago Live In Japan as The Greatest Hits, Vol.2, Part II.  Both came out about the same time.  It is a way to wrap up the 70s, and enjoy Terry Kath one more time, before Chicago's massive reinvention of itself in 1982.<br /><br />It is hard to compare this CD to the Carnegie Hall album, especially since the Rhino reissue came out (with improvements to the sound and bonus tracks).  I agree with one reviewer, that they do not sound quite as tired as they do on Carnegie Hall.  There is more of a pop feel, and no extended guitar solos (which some people will like).  The Ballet is treated with more respect (they don't do that goofy \\"yah yah yah\\" bit of West Virginia Fantasies), and Free/I'm A Man are way better than on Carnegie Hall.  And I agree that the sound quality on the original release is better than Carnegie Hall.  A Song For Richard And His Friends is better on CH.<br /><br />But I like it, and any Chicago fan should have it, as well as CH.  I also think that collectors of 70s live albums would love it.<br /><br />At $70 a pop, only the most serious fans will be buying it.  Here's hoping Rhino gets it reissued soon (and I'll bet they do!).
B00005JOEA|5.0|This movie was great. For the first time in I don't know how long I left the theater without feeling I had been cheatted out of my money. I intend to buy this DVD, and it will be the first DVD I have ever bought for myself. If you don't like it, you probably just didn't \\"get it.\\"
078062369X|5.0|Blade is a five star movie.  It could be argued to be the best comic-book to movie adaptation of any movie ever made.  Personally, this reviewer thinks it's Wesley Snipe's best movie role and will define him through the next few years.  Blade is such a good movie that it had two sequels and will have a mini-series spun off from it.  That gives great testimony to the strong script and Snipe's role in this picture. <br /> <br />Blade is a fusion of a comic book and a horror movie.  However, in most movies the regular humans are like on a horror ride.  They are reacting to the situation.  Blade is quite different.  When looking over a night club that gives human blood to vampires, Blade tells a cohort of over four vampires guarding the club.  \\"But,\\" Blade coldly remarks, \\"there are scarier things out tonight: me.\\" <br /> <br />Blade makes the best of an excellent plot.  While there are many African-American actors in the movie it does not give it a weird feeling of a \\"black-plotation\\" movie of the 1970s.  Remember, the original Blade comics were written during that time.  But these excellent comics never had the feel of black-plotation, a tribute to the writing ability of Marv Wolfman (Ironic, is it not?  A \\"Wolfman\\" was writing Vampire comics).  Blade comics were written about pure horror.  Deacon Frost, a vampire made by Dracula, is fought by Blade in his mad attempt to enslave the human race as a food source for vampires species.   <br /> <br />The action of Blade only stops to push the story along or give much needed back ground.  The fight/slaughter at the Vampire dance club in the beginning of the movie is still one of the best fight sequences ever put to big screen.  This part stands up well to modern movies and sets the standards.  Indeed, only the recent Matrix movies has slightly better fight sequences.  No movie of 2006 can best the fight sequence <br /> <br />The Vampires are the perfect foils to the singular in Blade.  Deacon Frost, as the leader of the new generation \\"punk\\" vampires, only has one purpose, the conquest of Earth using Vampire black magic.  Blade is the only thing that can stop Frost in his scheme to take over the earth. <br /> <br />The cast of this movie is perfect.  Wesley Snipes perfectly portrays the driven Blade.  Kris Kristopherson delivers one of the better performances of his career as the helper/scientist \\"Whistler\\". N'Bushe Wright plays the Doctor/Victim who learns quickly to fight the Vampires.  Stephen Dorff does an excellent job portraying the evil Deacon Frost.    <br /> <br />Blade is a five star movie that stands the test of time.  It has a black theme but is a horror movie, not a comic movie.  A person can watch this movie more than once and never get bored.   <br /> <br />5 stars and this movie is one of the best of 1998. <br />
0767830555|5.0|What hasn't been said about Taxi Driver? Not much, I suppose. But I still plan on telling the world how much this film means to me personally and why it does. First of all, I love the moral situation Travis Bickle (played by Robert De Nero) is placed in. He can save the 14 year old prostitute (played by a shockingly attractive Jodie Foster) only through a process of sin and murder, so he is left to contemplate the precussions of his actions. I can also identify with the lonliness he feels; being obviously symbolized by the Taxi cab itself, and the rejection he faces almost anyone can relate to. So what are you waiting for? Buy this DVD!
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb of God owns all. <br />Randy Blythe is the true messiah. <br />Chris Adler pounds the skins like he's drumming for crack; and the guitars aren't anything to complain about. <br />Technical Thrash is what I'd label it. <br />Standouts include the title track, Omerta, and Remorse is for the Dead.
B00000FC5H|4.0|The music of the 70's today has shown a definitive effect on what we hear on radio and on television today. Although there are times where we see the past as something better than the future. That has been the case with acts putting their music into musicals like Billy Joel for Movin' Out, and John Lennon's music for the short-lived Imagine. That also has happened with Earth Wind & Fire, who recently had there catalog of great songs showcased for the upbeat Off-Broadway show Hot Feet. It still has proven that there music hasn't been forgotten by the public at all, and this collection of their music is also not forgotten either.<br /><br />Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits is a single disc reflection of the group during their 1970's hey day and all of the tracks that are still just shown as true guilty pleasures today. The songs on this collection still stand out today, and they sound better than they did before on this collection. The album includes classics like their standard Shining Star, the soulful and elequent After The Love Has Gone, Fantasy, the funky & upbeat September, and Let's Groove. They are just delightful to listen to, and still stand out very weel with the essence of Disco, Soul, Funk & R&B.<br /><br />Although it is a shame that the group hasn't captured what they had back in the 70's, but Earth Wind & Fire are still great to listen to today. Their 1998 Greatest Hits is a truly a really definitive record, and I absolutely recommend this a whole lot for anybody who wants to be a shining star.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: A<br /><br />Overall: B+

B00004XMS0|3.0|In 1942, artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger created one of greatest superheroes- Batman, who's once Bruce Wayne, a crimefighter took a symbol of a bat to frighten into the hearts of criminals, many years after the death of his parents, Thomas and Martha. He have enemies like The Joker, The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler, Two-Face, Bane, love interset Catwoman, etc. In 1960s, they made a campy TV show on ABC, which making fun of Batman. Cancelled after 3rd season. Throughout from 1989 to present day, they made Batman movies and cartoons. I'm a true \\"bat\\" fan, grew up watching the cartoons, never read the comics. Only live-action movies that were true to him were Tim Burton movies. I'll clear it up.  <br /> <br />1. Batman(1989) w/ Michael Keaton(Bruce Wayne/Batman), Kim Basinger(Vicki Vale) and Jack Nicholson(Jack Napier a.k.a The Joker) directed by Tim Burton- This is what it supposed to be. a dark, gothic version of New York- Gotham City. a dark, mysterious hero- Batman. Interseting that he just started his crimefighting days, unknown to the city. The villan is former criminal Jack Napier, who framed by his boss Carl Grissom, who turned into the Clown Prince of Crime himself, The Joker. Vicki Vale, who ain't proved much as love interset, came to Gotham to find out about Batman, then she became more interseting in Bruce and attracted to The Joker. Can Batman save Vicki and Gotham City from The Joker? <br />      I love it. Michael Keaton was the best batman. Kim Baginser was good as the lovely Vicki Vale. Jack Nicholson is an awesome Joker. Tim is the best director for Batman. 5/5 <br />   2. Batman Returns(1992) w/ Michael Keaton(Bruce Wayne/Batman),  Christopher Walken(Max Schreck), Danny DeVito(Oswarld Cobbelpot a.k.a The Penguin) and Michelle Pfeffier(Selina Kyle/Catwoman) directed by Tim Burton- Much darker. Style to Gothic version of New York. A baby whose born as a penguin were abandoned to a sewer. He grew up becoming The Penguin. A tycoon Max Shreck plans to steal Gotham's power supply, but the mayor refuses. When The Penguin got his help, he got him run for mayor so reveals his plan. But The Penguin really kidnapping childrens. In the middle of it, Selina Kyle find out Max's plans so he kills her. She brought back to life by cats, becoming Catwoman. Out of their costumes, Bruce and Selina became lovers. Selina is perfect love interset, accorrding to the comics. Will Batman save Gotham from The Penguin? Will Selina go home with Bruce? <br /> I love it. Michael Keaton is still the best Batman. Michelle Pfeffier is great as the fine-looking Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Danny DeVito is an incredicle Penguin. Tim is still the best director for Batman. 5/5 <br />3. Batman Forever(1995)- the franchise begin to be ruined.  Joel Schmucher must be the worst director in superhero movies of all time. it turned into like that campy TV show. It's just a kid movie. Batman became a rolemodel. What? Man, Robin is a freaking moron. I love Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey, but they were awful. I prefer Billy Dee Williams(from Batman) again as Harvey Dent and as Two-Face, and maybe Robin Williams as The Riddler. Nicole Nidman were terrible, like a woman is after sex. Must be a silly script. I didn't like Val Kilmer's character to Batman. 2/5 <br />4. Batman & Robin(1997)- Franchise ruined. What was Joe Schmucher thinking? George Clooney was the worst Batman. Robin is a complete moron. Mr. Freeze, Posion Ivy and Bane were terrible. Not even good Batgirl! Terrible script! 2/5 <br />Begins is like a fanastic fairly tale. <br /> <br />Just stick with first two. They are BATMAN.
0930289234|5.0|It never fails to amaze me how people miss the subtle things that Watchmen has to offer. If you don't get it I guess you never will. Some call it liberal tripe that places Heros above us as demi-Gods and yet (because of their very actions) I see it as just the opposite. Indeed as the title suggests I see a tale that shows us that if we do not police those we place in power they will decide what is best for us without our input.<br /><br />Don't let yourself be swayed read for yourself, think for yourself and don't let the opinions of others sway you from something you just might like.<br /><br />In the end I'll leave you with this, as you can see, with Watchmen (and perhaps all great tales) there is no middle ground you will either love it or hate it.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|pearl jam have always been known to make really great songs and never put them on offical albums and then they decide to put them on b.sides...which is an shame because some times their singles are hard to get hold of.. well now we've got this to droul over and it's a superb album and the five merits just go to disc 1 alone as i haven't listened to disc two yet and i'll will tonight..as i hear that the song \\"dirty frank\\" is an awesome song from the opipions of previous reviewers so if disc two is as good as disc one then i have no other opipion that to state that this is an superb rarities album with all the song writing merits you get from their offical albums maybe even more and some of the \\"ten\\" session songs should of featured because they would of fitted perfectly..       disc two review   as stated above i got round to listen to disc two last night at 111.pm and it really was a magical journey and i know it's an clinched saying but it truly was an beautiful grungy journey through the different evolutions of pearl jam    the disc started off well with the first three songs fatal other side and hard to imagine.. but it was just as \\"footsteps\\" started i was incarcerated by the music..this song was an stone gossard song that was left of the ten album..for what reason i don't know      then \\"wash\\" \\"as stated above from the cutting room floor of the ten album..   \\"dead man\\" \\"dead man walking soundtrack\\" this is an fantastic song.. with eddie vedder playing guitar on his own.   and the song didn't even make the dead man walking soundtrack     the next four songs are from the 1991 fan club christmas single and are all superb.     sweet lew left off the binaural album is an warped sophicated song..one of my favorites     \\"dirty frank\\" from the ten peroid it's increbily, in your face and it acts as it protrays     brother[ten era] another song that could of been a major smash hit!!!     now comes to the end and my favorite song of both albums   \\"bee girl\\" from the radiobroadcast rockline   it's a beautiful intimicy, between jeff ament and eddie vedder   this is one of their all time classics!!!     get the album if you love PJ and what more of the diversity of post ten era
B00003CX9Q|4.0|This product is limited and is no longer being made by Universal studios. Steven Spielberg prefers that you buy his new \\"enhanced\\" version of E.T.    I, like most reviewers here, prefer the original version of this movie. What Spielberg did in 2002 for this movie was he computer-animated E.T., enhanced a few scenery shots, added two extra scenes, and digitally removed all hand guns.    Now I don't mind him adding extra scenes, but all the other things basically changed the film. I liked E.T. the puppet. He was more real. Speilberg basically just threw away all the work that the puppeteers did (which was made up of little people, a boy with no legs, and a lady doing E.T.'s arms). Yes Spielberg, I understand that this is what you WOULD HAVE done if given the technology back 1982, but you don't have to change anything.     And digitally removing the handguns and replacing them with walkie-talkies was stupid too. Government agents will use guns to stop anyone who tries to stop them. Spielberg's philosophy behind doing this was that he regretted having the government agents using the guns to apprehend kids. But that's what agents do. How are they going to stop the kids with walkie-talkies, say, \\"Hey, I have a walkie-talkie and I'm not afraid to use it.\\" Spielberg was also upset about having guns in a family film. Well, he didn't really make this a \\"family film\\" when he allowed cussing in it, such as the \\"b\\" word, the \\"s\\" word, and somebody calling someone else \\"pen*s breath.\\" How come you didn't edit that Spielberg?    So if you can, try to buy this product, because this is the only way to find this film in its original version (unfortunately this product has the 2002 version but it's all worth it). Every director should have the freedom to do what they want to the films, but keep the original versions for fans please! That goes for you too George Lucas.

B000002LHX|5.0|Just to make things clear, I've never owned any Prince albums, and therefore can't consider myself a fan. Most people seem to judge these songs by comparison to his other work, but I'm speaking from a completely neutral point of view when I say: This album is great! I remember I bought this back in the early 90s thinking it was Danny Elfman's score to the film, and returned it when I realized it was actually a soundtrack by Prince. So, over a decade later, when I read that Jack Nicholson himself supported the use of Prince's talent for some of the movie's music, I figured why not give it a shot? I figured right!<br /><br />All nine tracks have their own style and place, but the best ones are full of dance-able funk and hook, like \\"The Future\\", \\"Electric Chair\\", \\"Partyman\\", \\"Trust\\", and \\"Batdance\\" (you gotta dig that breakdown). It has that feel-good electronic goove that's the epitome of 80's pop music. And as a nice little touch, there are several songs that use audio clips from the film (namely Nicholson's Napier/Joker character) that really keep the Bat-atmosphere alive. I've long been a fan of Gotham's characters as well as Jack Nicholson, and now, through this, I think Prince may hold a spot on my list. Basically said, \\"Batman\\" The Soundtrack is a must for anyone who loved the movie!
B000FL7CAK|3.0|Loved season one, i got really dissapointed with season two. In a nutshell: this season is all over the place. The mane story line (the bus crash)dosent get much atention as last season mane story line did (lillys death). It started off good but then around episode 6 or 7 it got confusing, the bus crash episode were so far away you couldnt remeber what was going on. and to top it off, the characters this time around lack the heart, soul and charisma they had last season. <br /> <br />I would rent this season before buying. <br /> <br />Hope that season 3 gets better. Fingers cross.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Some greatest hits packages open with a big splash - others with a big silence. This believe it or not comes in the latter category. It's a fantastic compilation of hits by Huey Lewis and crew. Horns aplenty and good ol' rock and roll. After 3 weeks it is no. 100 on Billboard charts which is a real shame. Highlights are Bruce Hornsby's 'Stuck On You', 'Power Of Love' 'Heart Of Rock And Roll' and many many more. The only dud for me was 'But It's Alright'. 'Trouble In Paradise' is the only live cut and has unbelievable sax. 'Cruisin' with Gwyneth Paltrow is a surprisingly good cut. 'Its Alright' is totally different and 'Small World' features Stan Getz. <br />Over 79 minutes of pure entertainment.
6304258984|4.0|There are a variety of many-splendored reasons to watch this 1996 action flick, where an early peek at pre-9/11 terrorism rears its ugly head. The performances soar: Sean Connery as a nonchalant killer intent on saving \\"The City By the Bay\\" - Nicholas Cage, as his astute but nervous student - and Ed Harris as a fearless mad Marine who formulated a plot to blow up San Francisco through the tunnels of Alcatraz. I enjoyed the love angle between Nicholas Cage and his girlfriend and the redemption of Sean Connery for the one reason on earth he has to live: to make amends with his lovely daughter. See the movie! And have in hand, as I did, your remote control to lower the crash-bang volume. This movie was sooo exciting I lay in fetal position at the end!
B000002OTL|4.0|Great album, but what is the song at the end credits? I love that song!
B000065LZQ|5.0|In my opinion the best record he has ever made. Production, songwriting, everything is beautiful on this record. Most likely because I am assuming it was his last record recorded to tape and not a hard drive. It really makes a difference. Trent, I know you like your toys but you really need to visit this studio again.. <br />
B000FFJ85I|3.0|AFI-DecemberUnderground ***<br /><br />When I first heard the new AFI single 'Miss Murder' I didnt like it and thought to myself this was going to be a horrible album. As I heard the song a few more times I thought well this song isnt so bad, maybe the album will be alright. I now think it is a great song, and so I was excited to buy the album. Well I still wasnt expecting much because while its a good song it could be much better. This is not the AFI I know and love this is MTV's AFI. The second the band started making videos and being played on the radio they changed their entire musical style just to fit radio standards. Im not crying sells out but this is not AFI!<br /><br />The musical talent on this album is a bore and a let down. The guitar playing is nothing like it used to be, it has gotten lazy. The drumming is horible, and the bass player isnt even auidible, you would never even know he was there. Davy Havoks vocals are very good in places and aweful in others and sound like something out of a bad Thursday song. It's like they didnt even try on this album.<br /><br />'Affliction' and 'Kill Caustic' are nice rockers that really give this album a little hope and somewhat remind me off AFI of old and their roots. The guitar on these songs is actually pretty good and Havoks vocals are really wonderful here. The 'Prelude' is decent here as well, it sounds like it is starting off the album good but then its down hill from there. 'The Killing Lights' has the potential to be a great song. The lyrics are great but the delivery and the backing music is bland. 'The Missing Frame' is the second best song on the album. Nice guitar and vocals, as well as lyrics. Sounds very pop but it's still a good song.<br /><br />I hate saying this and I hoped that this wasnt going to be ture but 'Miss Murder' is the best song on the album. The bass intro reminds you that the band has a bass player. The guitar is great on this song, the best it is on the whole album. The march like drumming fits perfectly. Havok wrote great lyrics and he sings them the way he would have say on Black Sails In The Sunset. It kills me that this is the best song on the album. Like I said its a great song, but it aint that great!<br /><br />AFI really let me down with this album, DecemberUnderground. With a cool title like this you would imagine a great album but thats not what you get. This techno-emo/hardcore thing the band started on Sing The Sorrow and dominates this album has got to stop because it is not working for them. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone other then a highschool freshmen girl who likes emo because this is what they have let them selfs become, just another emo act.ch like drumming fits perfectly.

B000063DFN|5.0|This was my first Maiden album, so the following review may be just a bit biased, but what review with a title like that isn't?  Anyway, this album is, simply put, awesome. Every song is epic, and will surely cause neck pain from excess head-banging. From the great interplay between the guitars, to Bruce's amazing voice, to the slick bass lines, to the superb drumming and cool lyrics, this album is essential for metalheads, hard rock lovers, music fanatics, and certainly any Maiden fan.    Up the Irons!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I am an Austen fan and thought that the Colin Firth film gave a great insight into the lives of the characters without overexaggeration or mistakes (except a small majority) but the 2005 was a complete disaster! <br />Kiera Knightly is a brilliant actress but her portrayal of Lizzy Bennet was just lame.  <br />As for the costume design, the Bennets were supposed to be in at least the top 10% of the middle class. Yet this film portrayed them as more working class with their cheap looking gowns and ugly home.  <br />However, on another matter i thought Mr Darcy was fabulous in appearance yet when he opened his mouth he spoke far too fast for the Darcy we all know.  <br />A very disappointing film yet funny in places.  <br />I did buy it and it is good to watch if you have a few hours spare but much better to rent from the video store than actually buying it.
B000002H33|5.0|While Master of Puppets may not be my favorite Metallica album(that would be Ride the Lighting), it is still one of the peaks of heavy metal. From the mellow intro of the opening track, Battery, to the feedback at the end of the last song,Damage Inc., this is as close as metal gets to reaching the musical heights of the works of Beethoven and Bach. The album's sole flaw is the somewhat repetitive riff of the third track, The Thing that Should not be, but anyone who even remotely enjoys any form of heavy metal, hard rock, or music in general who has not heard this album before is in for a treat.

0966638328|5.0|I am a photographer and frequently design my own publicity materials (brochures, websites).  Color design is important to me, and this book is an excellent reference book.  I already know the basics of color theory, but having a guide to refer to when I need suggestions for different color combinations is great.<br /><br />This book also discusses the connotations and implications of colors, which is helpful when you are trying to decide on a color for your logo or website.  I appreciate the visual nature of this book, and the many examples of advertisments illustrate the effects of using a particular color (don't expect an in-depth analysis though -- the text doesn't discuss any of these advertisements in detail).  The color combinations section has an additional feature which could be very helpful -- we are told the pantone number of each color in the combination.<br /><br />For someone already familiar with the visual arts, this book will be a great reference guide!

Steve and Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown are priceless. <br />the ending was disappointing, as there wasn't really an ending. it just seemed like Bourdain decided, 'OK, i'm tired of writing. that's it.' otherwise i had a blast with this one.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|We watched this movie to the movie theater and all of us (incleding our two and a half year old son) were entertained. True the scene with the aliens at the field was a little bit scary.<br /><br />What I want to underline about this movie is the eloquent way it presented about how important it is to listen to what our kids have to say even if some times what they say seems to be unbelievable or unrealistic.<br /><br />Good movie for family entertainment.
0316096199|4.0|This was undoubtedly a well written book, however I have to say that I was scarred by it and that it gave me nightmares for over a week.  Maybe that's a testament to the author's skill in describing a scene and transporting the reader.
B000003TA4|5.0|If you read \\"Former Nirvana Fan's\\" review I think you'll agree with me when I say this, that he is the lamest person on this review sheet...ok where do I start, Nirvana is a classic band that shaped \\"Alternative Rock\\" into one of the most popular genres of all time, they also wrote music that pre-teenagers, teenagers, and post-teenagers can understand...oh yea I know someone over 16 that like Nirvana, in fact many of my relatives like Nirvana. Point being, Nirvana is an unbeatable band when it comes to making a genre popular, because they made they're genre so popular like no other band did before.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|What is George Lucas' problem?  First of all, he denies Star Wars fans unaltered versions of the original films, then in a recent interview he mentions that he is begrudginly releasing them to 'to shut us up.'  Though I am paraphrasing, that was the jist of what he was saying in the article.  As a second blow, he is releasing them in a pathetic substandard format.  It's like he's saying, \\"all right, I'll give you what you want, but I'm going to make it as rotten as possible.  Take it or leave it.\\"  When did he stop listening to we, the fans.  We were the generation that bought movie tickets in the 70's and 80's.  We were the ones that skyrocketed the box office numbers for these films, and he is dismissing us.  Instead, he went back in the 90's, added some of the most dreadful cgi footage I have ever seen, and replaced the old songs with very cheesy remakes.  Lucas is telling the older fan base that our Star Wars were not good films in their original state, and that they have been improved, and we should be terribly grateful for his \\"altered\\" galaxy.  Well I am not amused, in fact, I am insulted that such a large fan base should be so disregarded.  The newer Star Wars films were cinematic abombinations, and now the classics are being sucked into the same terrible void.  Lucas has lost his grasp on the Force, and worse still - on reality.
076790382X|5.0|I had recently finished a string of somewhat more serious, heavy books ranging from social fiction to mathematics.  Needless to say, I was in desperate need of something a bit more relaxing and this book fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />I picked it up because I had read some of Bryson's previous work (In a Sunburned Country, A Short History of Nearly Everything) and considered him hilarious.  He is the only author that has caused me to actually laugh while reading, at times embarassingly and in public!<br /><br />This book is a collection of weekly essays he wrote for a period of three years, and the material is all stream-of-conscious style.  So you can read for 5 minutes or 5 hours and still enjoy it, perfect for commuters, both of the subway and the airlines.  Though it's supposed to cover 'American' life, he really just writes about his own and only occasionally plays up the contrast to the British culture, as an American I never felt lost or confused.<br /><br />All in all, read this book at some point when you've found that your reading material of late has became a tad bit dreary or monotonous.
B0000A14WB|5.0|Everybody is rattling on & on in these reviews about Brian's genius, Beach Boys vs. Beatles, is this the greatest record of all time, etc. If you have heard this particular version of Pet Sounds DVD/audio disc, won't someone please tell me if I need to own it because of the bonus tracks? Or are they all included in the Pet Sounds box set? All other reviews should be deleted or moved over to the regular (mono/stereo) CD version of Pet Sounds.

B00006AVRK|5.0|The T.V. transformation of P.G. Wodehouse's 'Jeeves & Wooster' novels, represents what was a much needed breath of fresh air into the situation comedy genre. Where many other shows will use crude, cheap sexual innuendos, 'Jeeves & Wooster' will use witty, urbane and sophisticated humour. This will prove endlessly enjoyable for many viewers. <br /> <br />The capers of Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves are hilarious. Bertie constantly gets himself into horrendous fixes involving assorted unwanted fiancees and angry aristocrats, only to be rescued by his erudite, intelligent and always loyal man-servant. Allied to Bertie's antics are those of his amusingly named friends in which Bertie is constantly entangled. Chums such as Tuppy Glossup, Gussy Finknottle and Cyril Bassington Bassington add their own confusion into an already amusing mix. <br /> <br />The complete 'Jeeves and Wooster' is a fantastic set for anyone who is sick of cheap toilet humour and would prefer their comedy to be a little more clever and witty.
B00025G2K0|2.0|My views are terribly coloured by a lot of non-fiction type historical reading, so while it was fun reading a thriller after a while, it certainly is not the best Forsythe, or a thriller in general, that I've read.<br /><br />While Forsythe's eye for detail, particularly in the chapter \\"The Vigil\\" is extraordinary, I feel that in general this kind of detail lends itself well to a storyboard for a film but not necessarily a thriller.<br /><br />The silent, street smart & tough Dexter (Ex-Vietnam, Ex-Lawyer) is just the kind of hero you'd expect. The story, too, while it is about extradition of a narcotic & arms trafficker, builds up rather slowly describing Dexter's years in Vietnam, his childhood, his law years & his personal losses which makes him the take up these kinds of jobs in the name of justice or some such moral thingummy.<br /><br />The story has a few other important characters - most of them appear in some context during the build phases listed above & then again reappear to help Dexter out while he is on his assignment. This is a rather trite story-telling technique.<br /><br />In addition, some of the lucky breaks are plain theatrical. Particularly, the way the baddie is first testified against by a scared youth overcoming his fears once he is detected with cancer is just ridiculous.<br /><br />Overall, read this book if you have nothing better to do on a lazy afternoon. I'd suggest you go for a run.<br /><br />Or a triathlon - like Cal Dexter.<br /><br />S!

B000EQH2QK|1.0|This is a re-release? Are you kidding me? This album still sucks! I don't know how anyone can sit down and listen to this rubbish- it's TORTURA. Everything was a complete mess. Shakira's voice is so awful; I didn't even want to listen or try to understand what she was saying. Speaking of oral fixation, why does Shakira always sound like she has something stuffed in her mouth? This woman's voice is awful, just painful to the ears. She goes up, down, in, out, diagonal, horizontal, vertical, Jewel, Alanis Morrisette, and Mariah Carey, while at the same time moaning like a donkey in heat. This chick needs some singing lessons- and fast. I know when she was performing on American Idol Simon Cowell had to really bite his tongue. I wouldn't be surprised if there was third re-release of this album with a song featuring someone like Sean Paul or even Fat Joe. This album was a waste of time and energy. If you like giving your co-workers headaches, I highly recommend Shakira's Oral Fixation Vol. 2. Peace!

B000HBK3MM|2.0|Let's be real here, this CD isn't anything you haven't heard before. Corrine is all over the place on this CD- R&B, jazz, and most definitely pop. Her lack of consistency on this album, along with the vice president of Capitol Records stating, \\"We consider it a strength that she doesn't fit into a format. We can get to a few different audiences,\\" makes this CD entirely pop. It also makes your music sound lousy since you haven't gained sufficient experience with any genre, besides indie. So much for R&B, soul, and \\"smooth jazz.\\"<br /><br />Corrine has been compared to Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, and India.Arie, which is annoying since these women have not watered down their R&B and neo-soul presence just to crossover to the mainstream. One person whom I haven't heard Corrine being compared to is Sade. It's unfair to compare Corrine to other female singers, but the truth is when people do that it means that they can't find anything unique about *her*.<br /><br />Other than that, this album is average at its best. Most of the songs are dull and put you to sleep, which is no coincidence since Corrine has also been compared to Norah Jones, the infamous Queen of Nod. There is no funk, no groove, no pizzazz, no rhythm, no memorable hooks- it's just whatever. The songwriting is okay, but it's not that deep. Corrine has Caribbean roots, but I don't remember hearing any kind of Caribbean influence in this album, which would've been nice. As for Corrine's vocals, she can carry a tune but she can't throw it down. There is nothing distinctive about her vocals at all, even though it is peppered with Billie Holiday-like inflections.<br /><br /> I've asked other people who've listened to this album what they thought of it, and the response usually starts off with a frown, eyes turned up toward the ceiling , and then, \\"Uh. . .well. . .uh. . .it's. . .uh. . .It's okay. \\" I don't consider this \\"real music\\" (which is subjective anyway).  If you highly enjoy this album, good for you! And if Corrine Bailey Rose enjoys performing, good for her! But she is overhyped as being the next big thing to come out of England since Harry Potter.f Corrine Bailey Rose enjoys performing, good for her!

B00008J4P5|5.0|In all my days of album picking, I've never approached an album with more caution than this one. Before I picked it up, I read; read everything from the praise that \\"Seven Nation Army\\" has gotten from critics across the music spectrum, to the wonderfully glorious acceptance speeches fans of the garage rock genre gave to the fourteen track monster. You can see how poised I was to listen to the blasted thing.  <br /> <br />It took a while; I got it about three months after it's initial release, which meant my the time I finally ripped open the packaging, I pretty much new I had a dynamite in my hands.  <br /> <br />And what happened? Nothing. At first listen, \\"Seven Nation Army\\" was less than I had expected, \\"Black Math\\" sounded annoying and \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With My Self\\" felt like a poorly produced cover. I was shocked. I learned one thing that night; don't go into an album expecting God to show you a light.  <br /> <br />So I (on purpose) dumped the album beneath my sofa, and didn't touch it for a week.(Okay, two days; I'm easily tempted!) But when I listened to it again, I had forgotten why I had picked it up in the first place. I listened to it for the second time, this time not knowing what kind of sound they were, how good their supposed tracks were, or even the types of instruments they used. And, finally, I was blows away.  <br /> <br />It then became the disk I always wanted it to become - and then some. Sure, its charm is the semi-minimalist way Jack and his ex-beaux play their instruments, but as you listen to the record, you get a sense how diverse \\"Elephant\\" is. They stick by the eight track recording system, focusing much more on delivering the sound they want with just their instruments, at one go, rather than dubbing layers upon layers of orchestra and nonsense.  <br /> <br />Definitely pick this disk up. Not just for the hits, but for the way its put together. Jagged and rough at parts, but also sweet at other times.  <br /> <br />Notables:  <br />Seven Nation Army <br />Black Math (with a raw sound, something like what Wolfmother's doing nowadays) <br />They're No Room For You Here (it's a cover, but a damn good one) <br />I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself (another cracking cover) <br />Ball And Biscuit (for the lyrics that express explicit sexuality) <br />Hypnotize (yea, they know what hooks are) <br />I Want To Be The Boy That Warms  Your Mother's Heart

0312995423|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down. I read this in 2 days, and I don't normally read novels. I would highly recommend this book.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I love it.<br /><br />Red Hot Chili Peppers is great for older people<br /><br />that still think their hip, tho.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|As a fan of the original graphic novel, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, depth and emotional impact of this movie. Americans really need to watch this one (before it is too late), the story about a mysterious hero named V, fighting a facist regime in a future England.  <br /> <br />The most incredible moment in the film is the speech V gives when he takes over a state-controlled television station - this speech should be broadcast on American prime-time TV, it gets right to the point. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the ads for V, it is a drama, not an action film. Stuff does blow up real good but that is not the point of the film. The film's hopeful message that tyrannical governments fall under their own weight, great acting performances and great cinematography make V For Vendetta a winner.
0887307280|5.0|Gerber's big idea is that (small) business is, at the core, to \\"create more life for everyone who comes into contact with the business, but most of all, for you, the person who owns it\\" (p. 132). <br /> <br />When I think of a small business owner, the first thing that comes to mind is someone who is overworked, underpaid and sacrificing other parts of life to give life to the business. Hoping to own a business in the future, I do not want to be that kind of person. <br /> <br />Similar to Covey's \\"The Seven Habits of Highly Effectively People,\\" Gerber wants you to define the Primary Aim - of your life, and how your business will further that aim. <br /> <br />He makes a clear distinction between the Entrepreneur, the Manager and the Technician inside every person. The E-Myth is that a successful Technician is a successful business owner. <br /> <br />A working small business has systems in place that \\"run\\" the day-to-day operations. Systematizing the business reduces dependence on skilled people and instead favors teachable/trainable people. The systems are always under examination and undergo continual improvement. <br /> <br />Incredibly optimistic, \\"The E-Myth\\" challenged many of my assumptions and intuitions about successful business. It reads quickly and easily. It will remain on my shelf for reference and rereading. <br /> <br />Notable quotable: \\"It's not your business that you have to fear losing. It's something much bigger than that. It's your self.\\" (p. 148)
B000FFJ85I|4.0|I was first interested in this album when I saw the brilliant video for 'Miss Murder' on Scuzz.  When listening to the very catchy chorus of 'Miss Murder' and seeing AFI perform it live on the MTV Movie Awards, I was hooked.  Out of curiosity I got the 'Decemberunderground' album.  Before this album I hadn't heard much about AFI and never heard one of their songs before.  But after listening to 'Decemberunderground', i'm beginning to become a fan of AFI.  At first, I thought the songs were a bit too punky, lame and youth orientated.  For a short while I had regreted getting this album, but soon afterwards the songs began to catch on.  Like Faith No More's 'Angel Dust', it does take 3 or 4 full listenings to get used to and know the tracks in greater detail.  With a brilliant intro and the instantly likeable 'Miss Murder', this album starts off good.  While continuing with some very solid, heavy and intellegent tunes, the lyrics and singing DO take a while to get used to.<br /><br />I've listened to this album about 5 times now and like 'Angel Dust', it gets better the more you listen to it.  Now, I really like this album and i'm glad I got it and I will be interested in AFI in the future.<br /><br />Ratings for each song:  AFI 'Decemberunderground'<br /><br />#1. Prelude 12/21: [9.5/10] (Even though it's 1.33 mins long, its still a brilliant intro. Very catchy)<br /><br />#2. Kill Caustic: [5/10]<br /><br />#3. Miss Murder: [9/10] (An extremely catchy song upon first listening)<br /><br />#4. Summer Shudder: [8/10]<br /><br />#5. The Interview: [6/10]<br /><br />#6. Love Like Winter: [8/10]<br /><br />#7. Affliction: [6.5/10]<br /><br />#8. The Missing Frame: [7/10]<br /><br />#9. Kiss And Control: [7.5/10]<br /><br />#10. The Killing Lights: [6/10]<br /><br />#11. 37mm: [8.5/10]<br /><br />#12. Endlessly, She Said: [7/10] (A great finishing song)
B000000OUJ|5.0|This album is just a timeless classic.  The Genius never disappoints you when it comes to delivering  some \\"Lyrical Hiphop.\\" There are plenty of good cameos from other Wu members on this album, but they don't out shine him in his debut.  So if your new to Wu-Tang you should definitely check out this album.
B000002UDG|4.0|They could make this CD perfect by removing the songs \\"C Moon\\" and \\"Junior's Farm\\" and then adding the songs \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" & \\"Take It Away\\".  Then after that they should digitally remaster it in modern terms and re-release it.  If they did this it would be a perfect compilation.  So do it.  Do it now!
B000FA57RQ|1.0|first of all where is the American life video?,where are the full length versions of concert footage that wasn't in the broadcast?.madonna why do you hate the dvd format so much?.this was the first music dvd from you in 5 years!you can do better than this.the only reason for buying this dvd+cd is for the live cd which sounds great.give us the re-invention tour dvd if it was ever filmed in the first place!
0671042858|5.0|Stephen King has an outstanding ability to make his stories come alive to readers, to not only see the story vividly but to see it through the eyes of the character(s) in the story. This certainly holds true about \\"The girl who loved Tom Gordon\\"; a story about a nine-year-old girl lost in the woods, her only connection to the outside world, giving her hope, is listening to Tom Gordon save games for the Sox.<br /><br />Only Stephen King can take a story so seemingly boring and turn it into such a fascinating tale, weaving between the rational and realistic to the mystical and hallucinatory. He so lovingly takes the skill of a closing pitcher in baseball, and turns it into a running allegorical theme on gaining hope and victories in life.<br /><br />This book is for anyone who appreciates stories well told, with great imagery and imagination. I found myself turning pages, and couldn't put it down untill the final lines. Although I've always loved King's writing style, I've often been turned off by his some of his real strange storylines, not so in this case. The girl who loved Tom Gordon is an absolute winner.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|this is sergio leone's greatest western and one hum dinger of an action movie!this is a languid operatic story of greed and revenge as only leone could tell it. <br />    the first 10 mins. or so is almost silent as we follow three gunmen waiting for a train to arrive and we suspect a man for them to kill! enter charles bronson as the unknown man with the harmonica that he plays at just the right moment,and as the movie goes on you will find out about the reason for this and it's a real surprise! jason robards is an indian who is an outlaw and being charged with the murder of a family that he did not kill,and henry fonda is nothing short of fantastic as the steel blue eyed bad man who really did kill the family robards is being blamed for(in one scene fonda shoots a child just because the boy hears his name,hows that for bad). add the ever beautiful claudia cardinale as the woman all three men are drawn to and this is one of the best, and the transfer is just as good as you could want. the extras are also very good and make this one one to add to your collection of great movie westerns!!!
B000FA57RG|5.0|First thing if any of you saw The Reinvention tour you will know that all the songs except for maybe 2 were sung live so all the talk about lip syncing is wrong also some of the songs on the cd were interludes like the beast within and hollywood and the demo version of I love New york was in the documentary. THe film just shows growth as a person how could you not love that. It cant be compared to truth or dare 2 toltally different films.
B00003CX5P|4.0|i love the series and was looking foward to this episode,and while there is much to like and some great f/x,this first episode suffers from to many plot points brought up so quickly that you need a score card to keep up. i'll be kind and  say nothing about jar jar binks,but i will say the fact that later movies don't feature him much says a lot about his part in the movies. on the plus side the f/x are of course top of the line and the action scenes are very well done and the cast is very good! the two disc set is one of the best dvd releases out,and everything a collector could want in the way of extras! all in all a good but not great start to the first three chapters of the legend!
B000E97HIA|5.0|This is just am amazing cd from start to finish. While I liked Musicology (I saw the tour twice) I believe this cd is much stronger.  I wish I could tell you that I have one favorite song but honestly I listen to the cd from start to finish so I don't know the names of each of the songs. If you Prince a little or a whole lot your should definitely get this cd.
B00003CXCT|5.0|hard to believe that almost thirty years ago these words crawled across our movie screens and changed the movies forever!! now after all those years the films arive on dvd for the first time and they look great! my only wish is that they were two disc sets like the other movies that have been released!  <br />     these are the first(or really the last) three movies in the tale of civil war in a \\"galaxy far...far...away\\" and it is so easy to get caught up with luke,leia,and han that you will want to sit and watch all three back to back! sure the f/x are a little dated now,but they were and still are some of the best ever done and this simple story of good vs. evil is one of the best movie series ever done. the extra disc has a great many extras that will keep fans happy and make this a set everyone should have in their colection!!!!!!!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I love how their songs are very original have twists. They use so many different sounds in their songs it's great. My personal favorite (which wasn't easy to choose) would have to be Time To Dance. I just like how it feels very fast and techno sound in it
067101756X|5.0|This gives detailed descriptions of alien bodies, flying crafts, the crash at Roswell and the invention of the transistor. Forget everything you think about military R&D. Forget what you think you know about our world. This book will change your perspective. If you are already a believer, this book will still blow you away. How one man could be so open and so honest, while the rest run and hide, it is beautiful.
B000FA57RG|2.0|\\"I have no shame\\", Madonna sang that line back in early 80's. With such a credo in mind, she seems to be successfully pursuing her career. While her latest record is still hot, she releases this concert dvd/cd, being convinced her rapid fans will buy it. Even though it's not worth their pennies. Live audio cd? Please, Madge you can NOT sing live. Get some concert records from a Broadway star, Lea Salonga, to find out how moving and precious live singing can be. Madonna's voice may be decent sounding in studio, but just doesn't work on stage. Her RIT dance routine is not that challenging to forgive her vocal flops. The dvd brings some entertaining material to watch, still this tour is nowhere near the brilliant Drowned World Tour or Girlie Show. The tour documentary is meant to make us believe Madonna \\"saw the light\\". She's preaching a lot and talking kabbalah stuff, but still hides her true personality. We see a woman who knows how to act wise and profound in front of the camera - too bad her statements are so vague and cliched. She's clearly proud to a \\"better version of herself\\" and I can't help but ask - why so late? It's hard not to be mature when you're 47; why didn't she feel the need of change some years ago, when she was making money on sex and being raunchy? At the time it was profitable to her and I'm sure she was cold-calculated. She also says tv is trash, but isn't it tv that made her famous and rich? I could write an essay about Madonna the hypocrite, but don't want to get off-track with my review. The package is not worthwhile enough to get the money from your fans, Mrs. Ritchie.
0312995423|4.0|Sometimes you've got to give a book credit for saying it like it is. This is a thriller through and through; not a great book, but exceptionally easy to read and gripping from the get go. <br /> <br />The central character is a soap-opera hottie without a flaw in personality, appearance, or education. The same could be said of her strapping young academic fiance, who anchors the European leg of the story. You don't get a ton of back story on these people, but you don't really need it, Brown's editing is totally crisp and the story doesn't drop below top speed from start to finish. <br /> <br />Despite the occassional bits of researched technical trivia and passing mention of privacy rights, this book is cotton candy to its core. Doesn't leave you any less hungry when you're done, but its sure fun to eat in the moment.  <br />
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|Eminem's group Dirty Dozen aka D12 (Eminem, Bizarre, Proof, Swifty, Kuniva, Kon Artis aka Mr. Porter) has had many joy times and many sad times throughout their career. With their most recent album D12 World, they were out again to show that they wern't just a sideshow to Eminem.<br /><br />The album starts off on a strong point, with the songs \\"Git Up\\" and \\"Loyality\\". \\"40oz\\" would be another strong song, as it seems like their loud and club type songs would be their most sucessful. The Group also keeps their normal style of rapping on subjects that many people are used to such as \\"B***h\\" and \\"Get My Gun\\". \\"How Come\\" would be their second single, and I as of many people have an idea that it's dedicated to an old frined Royce The 5'9\\".<br /><br />There are many parts of this album that the group falls flat when trying to impress an entire audience. \\"My Band\\" might have been aimed to impress listeners MTV wise, but fails miserably (seeing that was the first single). Bizarre would get his cut on a solo \\"Just Like U\\" with his perverted rhymes...shouldn't be suprising comming from him. \\"Leave Dat Boy Alone\\" is suffered by the singing of Eminem with a southern accent which sounds pathetic. The bonus song \\"Keep Talkin\\" just sounds completely terrible.<br /><br />Two touching songs are towards the end of the album. \\"Bugz '97\\" is a rhyme that has late D12 member Bugz rhyming (possibly something they found digging in the crates), as the next track \\"Good Die Young\\" would be a song dedicated to him. The song hits even harder today because of the recent murder of member Proof who says \\"It ain't never late in the game, Satan remains/ with a grudge to see slugs break through my frame/ My heart aches with the pain, the light limits breath/ We gotta have fun now, there's only minutes left...,\\" Damn...<br /><br />Overall It's a decent sophomore album that D12 has made. It suffers some low points as well as it collects some high points. I recommend this to D12 fans, becuase they'll love it more than normal Eminem fans. It's glad to see that all members (including Bugz) were involved in this project. If you enjoyed this, I recommend that you search for D12 very frist album The Underground EP.<br /><br />Rest In Peace Proof and Bugz<br /><br />Lyrics: C+<br /><br />Production: B-<br /><br />Musical Vibes: C+<br /><br />Overall: C+<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: Git Up, Loyality, I'll Be Damned, Get My Gun, B****, Welcome To D12 World, 40oz, Bugz '97, Good Die Younghey'll love it more than normal Eminem fans.

B00028HBKC|5.0|There's one thing about \\"The Passion of Christ\\" that highlights its authenticity:  No one remains neutral after seeing it.  Most of the work seeks the genuine passion; some of it is interpretational; but all of it is intensely passionate.  Mel Gibson didn't simply recreate the scenes well and give history its native tongue, he also presented intensity and humanness in a very real way.  If we are to believe that there was a God-man who died a cruel death on all of our behalf, then that Emmanuel was made human and divine by Jim Caveziel, better than any other actor.  We can make all we can out of our past and \\"the good old days\\" when America seemed more like Christendom, but theatre goers of old would not accept this suffering Jesus, so at least in our post-Christendom time, we at least accept \\"The Passion\\" well enough from several sectors to be able to embrace the whole package.  As a spiritual event, \\"The Passion of Christ\\" is unvarnished, broadening our horizons of appreciation and compunction.  As history or entertainment, it may be merely a fascinating reinactment of a horrific death penalty for a major philosophical and charismatic leader.     Specifically, the focus and intensity of Judas's betrayal, Christ's Passion in the Garden, and his arrest are done with dramatic, slow-motion timing.  The extent of Jesus's suffering has been commented on truly enough, but the ordeal is certainly brought in long and vivid detail.  There is certainly a perfectionism in Gibson's rendering of each torturous moment.  If we doubt the divineness presented, then how about the love and forgiveness presented under torturous circumstances \\"Look, mother, I make all things new!\\"  Then, if there's incredulousness about the human traits, see similarly, the flashbacks of memory to a playful time with his mother or Caveziel shaking and looking with dread as they save their worst whips for last during the scourging.  The presentation of the devil and Judas's anguish after his betrayal arefine interpretive moments.  If you think the text is too harsh on the Pharisees, then just read the Bible.  If you think that Pontius Pilate isn't the political weasel presented or the Roman soldiers were too rough, then think again.      \\"The Passion of Christ\\" is a courageous and authentic reinactment of the Passion and Death of Christ.  For the two-plus hours we go through this confrontation, we are relieved by some beautiful and necessary flashbacks that are well highlighted.  It is an awesome film.
B000002MTR|4.0|I finally listened to this cd after 7 years of it collecting dust, being older and appreciating music more i just cant believe that this is the \\"overlooked\\" chili peppers album, ok it doesn't have John on guitar, and the band were having drug problems, etc etc, but personaly I found it more aggressive/heavier then what i was used to,(BSSM was my 1st chili's experience) Tracks like Warped, Deep Kick, & One Big Mop just get the adrenaline pumping, the song structures, & lyrics just drip with energy, awesome booklet design & proberly the only real creatively different chilli's cd were likely going to hear...
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento is a movie you have to watch again to fully understand the roots of the story behind Lenard Shelby (Guy Pierce) and his relationships with Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) & Teddy/John Gamel (Joe Pantoliano).  Lenard has a condition in this movie where he has no short-term memory (not amnesia though).  He can only remember things for about 10 minutes and then everything fades so he has to take pictures of things he needs/wants to remember and for the important things, he has them tattooed on his own body.  He is trying to find the guy who raped and murdered his wife and you are shown a lovely picture at the beginning of the movie that shows a picture (won't say too much to ruin things for readers of this review who have not seen the movie and are interested) of Teddy shot in the head, but you don't know why this happened and the movie begins its sequences of going backwards in 10-12 minute sequences then moving into no-color sequences where Lenard talks more about his condition.  Be sure that you have full concentration as you will need it.  Overall, great movie.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I find the puppet sex offensive. I find the ending speech offensive.  I guess that the excuse for this movie is \\" humor \\" or \\"satire\\".  It's a classic children's format corrupted. Oh, I forgot the violence, but I guess that is also \\" funny \\". <br /> <br />Clark Conway
B000F6IOC0|1.0|I loved the first Underworld movie. The sequel took everything that I liked about the first, drove a stake in its heart, and left it in the sun to die. There was parts inthe first movie that the second movie totally gets wrong or forgets. Plus, did we really need that stupid sex scene in the middle of the movie. PLEASE!
B000002KIE|3.0|This was the one and only Sex Pistol's album as has been mentioned before.  The problem with it is the replacement of bassist Matlock with Sid.  Sid was talentless but fit the image.  The sound of the Pistol's before this change, if you had the chance to hear(see) them, was raw fury.  After the change you had an interesting caged lion act, but not the band that released the singles \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" and \\"God Save the Queen\\".  As a retrospective and for the two singles this is a decent album.  It does define the time and the scene, and as has been said, if you weren't there, you might not 'get it'. <br />

0684824906|5.0|Add Doris Kearns Goodwin's \\"Team Of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\" to your must buy/must read list of books.  <br /> <br /> If you think that you know the story of Abraham Lincoln, log cabin born, splitter of rails, largely self-educated sixteenth President of the United States,  \\"Team Of Rivals\\" will be a revelation. It certainly was to me and I discovered something new on almost all of the book's 749 pages. <br /> <br /> However  \\"Team Of Rivals\\" isn't just about Lincoln or William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edwin M. Stanton and Edward Bates his once political rivals who served in his cabinet. Perhaps more importantly it is about the the social, religious and political fabric of a nation divided by slavery and torn by a devastating civil war. <br /> <br /> The book is also about the evolution of ideas and beliefs  <br />i. e. Lincoln, \\"The Great Emancipator\\" once considered coupling the freeing of slaves with their colonization in another country and while the Constitution of the United States created all men equal for many this sweeping protection did not include the millions of people held in human bondage. <br /> <br /> \\"Team Of Rivals\\" is also about politics. The Lincoln presidency was filled with enough plots, intriegues and power plays to have kept a Byzantine Court filled with awe, fascination and in a state of constant turmoil. <br /> <br /> \\"Team Of Rivals\\" is meticulously researched historical fact that reads like the best of thriller fiction. This is a stunning achievement and a literary tour de force that will have you staying up long past bedtime turning pages. <br /> <br /> <br />
1400079179|4.0|I find it remarkable how many bad reviews this book still seems to get and I suppose it makes sense. The more people who read a book the more opinions you have and we all know what they say about opinions. Mine is but one more...<br /><br />In my humble opinion the popularity of this novel alone says a whole lot about its quality and about those of us who have read it. I loved Stephen King's judgment of a good novel, in his book On Writing - `it's in the story.' Dan Brown wrote an intriguing story that put a spot light on topics that we were interested in, ready to learn about and compelled to discus. His characters are smart enough to attract us and yet clueless enough to relate to. And in the end, the message is positive and attainable.<br /><br />It's a wonderful adventure with guts. I loved it. Dan Brown ventured boldly into a realm fiction writers often fear to wander. His literary expertise lays in his courage and ability to tell a good story.  It's a hard act to follow and I feel honored to have had my book \\"the 100th human\\" compared to it.<br /><br />-Chris Fenwick<br /><br />author of \\"the 100th human\\" (available on Amazon)
B000007ODM|5.0|Music that runs the gauntlet of the emotions. If you enjoy Pure Moods or Enya you will love this album. This was the first album I wanted to replace after loosing all of my cd's to Hurricane Katrina. It, the cd, leaves that strong of an impression.
B000EGDC14|5.0|i don't know that anyone other than allison goldfrapp could have made the transition from from baroque songstress to techno supervixen.  'felt mountain' was almost sleepy in its production and its execution. it was lush, beautiful and dreamy.  'black cheery' ditched the pleasantries and set its sights on a more agressive, mechanical sound.  often times it succeeded, but in other places it stumbled. 'supernature,' the duo's third album, takes the warmth and stark vulnerability of 'felt mountain' and dips by the ankles into 'black cherry's' icy, eastern european cynicism.  consquently, 'supernature' is the band's definitive statement, an album that allows both allison's vocals and will's instrumentation to take center stage.  the result is one of the consistently satisfying records i've heard a long time.<br /><br />'supernature could easily be divided into three parts: gritty and dancey techno, cinematic balladry, and more mainstream pop songs.  the album's lead song and first single, 'oh la la' sets the tone for what follows.  it's similar in tone to 'black cherry's' 'train' and 'strict machine'--a dancefloor stomper with a dark groove. 'ride a white horse,' and 'lovely to see you,' along with 'oh la la,' make for a pretty impressive triumvirate of cool, detached techno. throw in 'satin chick' and 'slide in' and you have five of the best techno, dance songs in recent memory.<br /><br />as impressive as the dance songs are, the ballads are just as impressive and seductive.  'you never know' is a nice change of pace, and 'time out from the world' hearkens back to 'felt mountain,' but it's 'let it take you' that stands as the album's centerpiece. with a simple piano line and pulsating blips and bleeps behind allison's gorgeous voice, it's an otherwordly song that transports you to a completely new place.<br /><br />'koko,' 'fly me away,' and 'number one' round out the album. they by far the most accessible tracks on the album, but doesn't suggest they're mere shadows of the album's heavier tracks. they're impossibly catchy, hummable, and wonderful, and 'number 1' may just be the best album closer i've ever heard.<br /><br />the beauty of goldfrapp is allison's impossibly gorgeous voice juxtaposed over sythetic music.  it's a credit to the band that they've managed to marry the two in such a seemless way, so much so that the synths, in some weird way, manage to sound alive and vital. in the end it makes perfect sense and allison and will reward their listeners with one of the most consistently gratifying albums this music snob's ever heard.<br /><br />of does, of course, help that allison is drop-dead gorgeous and imbues the music with a pretty overt sexuality and sensuality.  she's quite a sight on stage. she understands that sometimes music is just as much a visual experience as it is an audio.  the accompanying dvd is fanboy's dream come true. she's glamorous, sexy, beautiful, confident, and sounds just as incredible live as she does on cd. she really is that good. the videos for 'oh la la' and 'number 1' are lot of fun just to see allison.<br /><br />if goldfrapp never released another album they will have made their mark with this album.hadows of the album's heavier tracks. they're impossibly catchy, hummable, and wonderful, and 'number 1' may just be the best album closer i've ever heard.   <br /> <br />the beauty of goldfrapp is allison's impossibly gorgeous voice juxtaposed over sythetic music.  it's a credit to the band that they've managed to marry the two in such a seemless way, so much so that the synths, in some weird way, manage to sound alive and vital. in the end it makes perfect sense and allison and will reward their listeners with one of the most consistently gratifying albums this music snob's ever heard. <br /> <br />of does, of course, help that allison is drop-dead gorgeous and imbues the music with a pretty overt sexuality and sensuality.  she's quite a sight on stage. she understands that sometimes music is just as much a visual experience as it is an audio.  the accompanying dvd is fanboy's dream come true. she's glamorous, sexy, beautiful, confident, and sounds just as incredible live as she does on cd. she really is that good. the videos for 'oh la la' and 'number 1' are lot of fun just to see allison. <br /> <br />if goldfrapp never released another album they will have made their mark with this album.
B000000OE7|2.0|...but this album should never have been released as the \\"final\\" Queen-album. A couple of these songs should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those many Best of Queen-releases. \\"A Winters' Tale\\" for example. Do I know much about the background for \\"Made in Heaven\\", well perhaps not. But I know that this is known to be the last studio release. Sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over, not that the melodies are bad, it just sounds... almost cheap actually -and most importantly to my ears (at least) this doesn't sound like my Queen. One of the most important bands in the history of music saying good-bye with \\"Made in heaven\\"? Was this really Freddie Mercurys' wish? It doesn't make much sence after the fantastic \\"Innuendo\\" released in short time before his tragic death containing the haunting ballad \\"These are the days of our lives\\". The words and the music... wow! And the music video to this song, have you seen it? To me that was the real good-bye with Freddie, and with Queen. And it has the sound of how I will remember them.    But is \\"Made in Heaven\\" really that bad? Yes, and no. \\"Heaven for everyone\\" by Roger Taylor made it sound promising, and don't forget; I was exited when I heard about \\"a final material\\"-release. But it turned out, as you might have guessed, far from what I had expected. Old songs from B-sides and solo-albums are mainly fillers for this album... I mean honestly? \\"Too much love...\\" then quite a resent hit from Brian Mays' solo-album \\"Back to the light\\", I remember thinking \\"What's the point?\\" And it actually sounds better from his solo-album without the synth dominating the song here. Don't get me wrong now, Freddies' vocal is as good as you'd expect, it's what they've made out it that surprises me. And what makes me wish they hadn't. At least not for an entire album.     \\"A winters' tale\\" is a positive surprise though. Perhaps not Freddies' best song, and not better than \\"These are the days...\\". But it's a celebration of the beauty in life. At least it sounds like that to me. Freddie captures a moment of harmony and peace. And beauty. And it sounds like a classic Queen-song! \\"A beautiful day (intro and reprise)\\" functions well too. But what tracks 12 and 13 are about I have absolutely no idea..? I wish they would have ended the album with Freddies' last \\"Yeah!\\" on the song. I wish...    So all in all; \\"Innuendo\\" remains the explosive good-bye with the \\"real\\" Queen. At least it does to me.    (Let me add that the cover of \\"Made in Heaven\\" is perfect for the title, and somehow amazingly \\"seals\\" in its' simplicity the fate of the band with Freddie in the lead. The three band members left (Brian, Roger, John) facing the sunset, and a statue capturing Freddie in a remembarable style on stage. Reminding me of him at Wembley 86. To me this actually expresses something beyond words, and it's impossible not to get a bit of an empty feeling watching it while listening to \\"Heaven for everyone\\" or \\"A winters' tale\\".)
B000FIHJLK|5.0|Recorded in Munich, Germany in 1977, Rainbow already had a strong following (gaining superstar status in Japan) mostly due to the fact the band's leader and lead guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had stunned audiences in the past during his tenure in Deep Purple with his soaring guitar solos. With a relatively unknown singer named Ronnie James Dio (originally with the band Elf) on vocals and an impressive list of band members including drummer the late Cozy Powell, Bob Daisley on bass and David Stone on keyboards Rainbow was destined to be huge. Just one listen to these two \\"live\\" discs will remove any doubt that the band was one to be reckoned with. The energy Rainbow possessed with their brand of hard rock on \\"Live In Munich 1977\\" can easily be compared to Deep Purple's \\"Live In Japan\\" album. The songs speak for themselves with a number of them being two to three times the length of their original studio versions allowing Blackmore to improvise on his guitar solos which are incredible. The sound quality of these discs are excellent and Eagle Rock Entertainment has done a good job remastering these discs giving one the feeling he or she is actually in the audience. Four of the songs included are from Rainbow's debut titled \\"Blackmore's Rainbow\\" (\\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\", \\"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\\", \\"Still I'm Sad\\", \\"Catch The Rainbow\\"). One from Rainbow's second album \\"Rainbow Rising\\" (\\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\") and two from the third album \\"Long Live Rock N' Roll\\" (\\"Long Live Rock N' Roll\\" and \\"Kill The King\\") and \\"Mistreated\\" from Deep Purple's \\"Burn\\" album. An excellent two disc \\"live\\" set that all Deep Purple and Rainbow fans will want in their collection.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|System of a down is one of those few heavy metal acts today, which has an original style. I think only such acts as Primus and Mars Volta make more original music. System of a down has a lot of energy and their performance on this album is mostly good. I think Malakian's voice adds more colour to this album, even thought he is not technically great singer. Unlike Primus and Mars Volta this band has pop kind of sensibility. There are lots of strong choruses on this album. Riffs are fast and vicious, but catchy choruses really balance the songs. There are more musical elements here than on Toxicity. Armenian folk influence is stronger here than on Toxicity and that adds a lot more atmosphere to the album and a result is very intense and rich album. <br /> <br />Song structures are quite complex and this album's spirit is closer to prog rock than NU-metal. I think the best cuts are Lonely day, Holy mountains, Kill rock 'n' roll and Tentative. While they are musically diverse, they are lyrically monotonic. War is bad, proganda brainwashes people blaa blaa blaa... Lyrics are occassionaly very weird and I'm not sure the band understand them either. ''Eat all the grass that you want/ Accidents happen in the dark'' What is that supposed to mean? And there is one absolutely horrible track called Vicinity of obscenity, which is lyrical nonsense and a musical mess. So lyrically this is not as powerfull as Toxicity. <br /> <br />In the nutshell this album's climax doesn't reach the brilliance of songs like Chop suey, Toxicity and Aerials, but it is a more uneven and interesting effort. Like I said there are more elements here than on Toxicity and this is a better album as whole. This may be softer and not as wild, but you have to understand that band is evolving and it is necessary for reaching the target, that I believe System of a down hasn't yet reached.
B000FA57RG|5.0|WOW.. what fun to listen and remember the experience of being at the RE-invention tour! AMAZING... The Documentary is fun, sweet,important and evolved. Whats so great is to see the change in attitude and the visuals!  A GREAT addition to a Fantastic catalog of entertainment!
B000F1IQNM|4.0|Nanny McPhee reminds me of Mary Poppins, although for every similarity, such as explaining when she will leave as soon as she shows up, there is a difference, her medicine tends to move about on the spoon and does not taste like anything good.  However, Nanny McPhee, who is passed on the Nurse Matilda stories of Christianna Brand, is more reminiscent of the Mary Poppins of P.L. Travers books than of the beloved Disney film, which is a reminder that in Great Britain children's books are not quite as cheerful as their American counterparts.  After all, when we talk about the first generation of children in English literature we are talking about Oliver Twist and the other poor souls depicted by Dickens.  Nanny McPhee certainly looks like she could come from a Dickens novel, perhaps the woman who stole the curtains from Ebenezer Scrooge's bed before the corpse was cold.<br /><br />The story begins with an empty chair because the mother of seven Brown children has died.  Their father, Cedric Brown (Colin Firth), does makeup for dearly departed at the Funeral home of Mr. Wheen (Derek Jacobi) and Mr. Jowls (Patrick Barlow), which does not provide enough for him to feed his entire family.  Fortunately there is money provided by his wife's Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury), but she insists that he get married if he wants the practice to continue.  Meanwhile, the daily problem is finding a nanny for his children, who take great pleasure in driving off every single one of the nannies hired to take care of them and keeping statistics on their accomplishments.  This leaves Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) the scullery maid and Mrs. Blatherwick (Imedla Staunton) the cook to try and carry on despite the children running absolutely wild.  But they have run out of nannies at the local nanny office.  Fortunately, whispered voices and newspaper advertisements assure Mr. Brown \\"What you need is Nanny McPhee.\\"<br /><br />The next thing we know, Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson, who once again doubles as screenwriter, having adapted the original stories), is at the door.  She finds the children running rampant in the kitchen and explains two things.  The first is that she will stay as long as she is needed but not wanted, but when she is wanted but no longer needed she will leave.  The second is that it is time for them to go to bed.  Led by Simon (Thomas Sangster), the oldest, the children decide that what they should do is stay up all night.  Then Nanny McPhee ominously raises her gnarled cane and slams it on the floor, setting out a wave of magic.  Suffice it to say, the Brown children are soon persuaded that made they should do what Nanny McPhee says, even if it means forcing themselves to say \\"please.\\"<br /><br />We also learn that there are five lessons that Nanny McPhee intends to teach these children and the chief charm of this story is that her primary tool of persuasion is not her magic, but double insistence that the children live with the consequences of their actions and that they think of ways to solve their own problems.  One of the interesting aspects of this story is that every time the children learn a new lesson, one of Nanny McPhee's warts disappears and she seems to be turning into, well, Emma Thompson.  Meanwhile, Aunt Adelaide thinks it would be best if she raised one of the Brown children as her own and Mr. Brown is trying to summon the nerve, if not the stomach, to propose to Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie).<br /><br />Of course Nanny McPhee will set things to right in the end, but not without some help from the Brown children themselves.  The ending smacks of nanny ex machina, but that is to be expected in such a tale, which is target squarely on the little folk.  This is not a film where adults have to figure out the larger allegory meaning of the story or laugh at in-jokes that are over the heads of their children.  Still, I think older viewers will be more moved by the ending where there is certainly something to be said for how NannyMcPhee dresses a bride for her wedding.how Nanny McPhee dresses a bride for her wedding.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|In the future, a lethal disease kills off 99% of the population and what's left of humanity is gathered in the cloistered city of Bregna. Hundreds of years later, Bregna has become a \\"perfect\\" and sanitized Eden, run by an authoritarian regime. But, of course, every paradise has its infestation and the same is true here. There's something not quite right with the citizens of Bregna; they are plagued with troubling dreams and are gripped with a feeling of unsettledness. Enter Aeon Flux, the most capable and lethal agent of the resistance group aiming to overthrow the government. She is sent to assassinate Trevor Goodchild, the current leader of the ruling establishment. But the seemingly straightforward mission quickly goes awry and Aeon finds herself immersed in an insidious conspiracy centuries old, of which scope threatens to undermine the very bedrock of Bregna's ideal society.<br /><br />So we're back in that old \\"been here, done that\\" standby of the Utopian world with a fatal flaw. And yet, Aeon Flux is better than I thought it would be. Admittedly, I didn't know what to expect going into this one. I'd seen (and liked, in a bemused sort of way) some of the weird MTV Aeon Flux cartoons of the 1990s, and those shows struck me at the time as being non-linear, bizarre and angular in animation. For one thing, every single episode I saw had our sexy assassin dying. So I was curious to see how the live action film would be interpreted. I gotta admit, I was sold with the very cool opening scene of Aeon's eyelashes Venus-flytrapping a fly.<br /><br />The overall impression I have of the movie is one of aesthetic sleekness. It's visually arresting, with a semi arty-farty approach that recalls to mind The Fifth Element, in terms of its overall design and look. I like the way the filmmakers integrated nature with the futuristic sci-fi elements (Aeon and Sithandra evading literal \\"blades\\" of grass and tree pods shooting out deadly slivers; Big Brother implementing water in the use of surveillance technology). The special effects are astounding and original looking and alone make the film worth screening. I both liked and got creeped out by Sithandra's four handlike appendages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot is nothing new. And being nothing new, it  commits the unforgivable sin of being dull. The action scenes are fairly trite but are beautifully executed, thanks in large part to the beauty, grace and athleticism of the lead star. She certainly is a credit to the recent slew of butt-kicking females coming out in our media (Buffy, Elektra, Lara Croft, Resident Evil's Alice). Charlize worked out for about 4 months and performs 95% of her own stunts, and that contributes to the film's integral credibility. It's also heartening to witness three females handling the brunt of the action here. The acting...is okay. No one sucks, no one stands out. Because the nature of her internalized character calls for it, Charlize has to come from a minimalist standpoint, acting-wise; her expressive, luminous eyes instead do a lot of emoting. I believe Charlize also is pretty close with her tonal mimicry of Denise Poirier, the voice of the animated Aeon Flux. However, the great Frances Mcdormand is totally wasted in her role as the rebel handler.<br /><br />Special features are comprised of:  2 commentaries (one by the screenwriters, the other by Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd); \\"Creating A World: Aeon Flux\\", the obligatory \\"making of\\" documentary, which includes input from creator Peter Chung; a segment on the various locations wherein the film was shot; a stunts documentary breaking down the workout regimen of Charlize and the two other action-oriented actresses; \\"Craft of the Set Photographer\\", which details the still photographer's job and tools of the trade; and the movie trailer.<br /><br />It's too bad the box office result doesn't seem to warrant a sequel. Aeon Flux has flaws, but Charlize Theron proves to me that she has that certain heroine quality and certainly the physicality to have Aeon Flux become a franchise of Paramount Pictures. Great Godfrey, the sight of Charlize Theron in her futuristic scanties is almost worth the price of the dvd alone.rtain heroine quality and certainly the physicality to have Aeon Flux become a franchise of Paramount Pictures.

B000002MP2|5.0|Alright, So It's not Kerplunk, or 1039, but its a solid album; atleast in my opinion. In third grade, I began to start my love for music. I grew to the sounds of Cake, Butthole Surfers, The Cure, Oasis, Sublime, and who else...Green Day. I like GD, blink 182, sum 41, Allister and Fenix tx, and the Ataris (older material) for pop-punk. Now days, my musical tastes have expanded. I listen to older rock and blues bands  such as The Beatles, Zeppelin, Queen, Boston, Cream, Allman Brothers, Eric Clapton. I love ska, LTJ, Streetlight manifesto, catch 22, Jaya the cat, Big d and the kids table, Voodoo glow skulls. I even like Iron Maiden. Through sixth grade and after I've grown to like the Descendents, Black Flag, Bad Religion,Dead Kennedys, Agent Orange, The Queers, and newer punk material like Lagwagon, Pulley, Ten Foot Pole, BeerBong, Hangover, Hope, Useless ID,Bigwig, Propagandhi, NOFX, Pennywise, ETC . I've also grown to appreciate ambient stuff like Aphex Twin. So music is nothing im narrow-minded about. I like a lot of bands, from Black Flag to Clapton. Weezer to John Mayer. Dookie is a good release. I dont care about all this underground punk lectures people give. Im tired of hearing it, and to be honest, its very cliche, grow up. It seems to me people just say it to be \\"punk\\". Let's put that all aside for a minute. This album is catchy and it appeals to adolescents. I bet if this album was released under LOOKOUT, everyone in the Gillman street punk scene would eat it up, its all the fact that they released it on Reprise, so they got pissed. Same with a lot of other bands, if they would have just released it on their older label, they wouldnt be bashed so much. Its so typical. I have no problem if you think they are sell-outs. Its your point of view, keep it, embrace it. I like music,I listen to a lot of music, and this band is fun to listen to. Just because they got catchy songs, is that a crime? I think not. This CD is great, I can really relate to Longview, Burnout and Basketcase, Billie Joe's lyrics arent the best, but i love how he goes through apathism, being a loser/burnout, being on your own, paranoia, its things that people can relate to. I know its pop-punk, but it will go down as one of the greatest albums ever released. Kerplunk is still my favorite, but this follows in its path. Get it. The music will stick with you. I've been listening to this record for atleast ten years. Get it, you won't regret it.
B000E8N690|5.0|In New Zealand, this was on for about two months at the main cinemas. After that, it was on for AT LEAST another month at the small-town cinemas. This is one of the most fantastic films you have ever see, I guarantee that. It only came out of the small cinemas when it came out on VHS/DVD. <br /> <br />It is a true story of success, fame, drugs, heartbreak and unhappiness - and about getting back on track. It is the story of the great Johnny Cash's life. <br /> <br />Mum (who is a big fan of Johnny Cash) dragged me off to town to see it and I must say I loved it.  <br />It is very well done, and Phoenix and Witherspoon have good voices. I recommend it to all ages, though I don't think anyone under ten should be seeing it, as there is a lot of drugs in it.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|One of the things I love about this soundtrack is that my teen son wanted it after seeing the movie repeatedly.  I found him playing it, loudly, while playing LOTR games.

B0000021RL|5.0|After the relatively downbeat pop of \\"Chicago VI,\\" this album shows an energetic Chicago with a positive musical outlook. While the pop element is retained, there are also incredible jazz moments that can take you back to the first three Chicago albums.<br /><br />The first five tracks are instrumentals, yielding more than 25 minutes of wonderful music that alternates between jazz, progressive jazz, jazz-rock, and other combinations that are easy to lose in the complexity of the music. The instruments include congas, horns, a flute, drums, guitars and keyboards, including a mellotron, Fender Rhodes, ARP synthesizer, and clavinet.<br /><br />\\"Prelude to Aire\\" provides an initial indication of the flavor of the instrumentals with a strongly African influenced beat. If you liked Paul Simon's \\"Graceland,\\" you should also like \\"Prelude to Aire.\\" \\"Aire\\" is a jazz instrumental with but a flavor of the introductory song. Peter Cetera and Terry Kath get to strut their stuff in the second half of the song, with Terry Kath turning funky for a portion of his lead.<br /><br />\\"Aire\\" is complex and relatively long at almost six and a half minutes, but the following instrumental, \\"Devil's Sweet,\\" is even longer. Portions of this ten minute composition are introspective, allowing jazz noodling of a core musical theme. Certain portions remind me of some of King Crimson's more experimental 70s work. The mixture of 50s retro style with Jazz and rock creates an interesting instrumental composition that requires multiple listens for full appreciation. \\"Italian from New York\\" fits well with the previous instrumentals. This instrumental begins with sound effects that are retro, yet modern. The sound effects are married to horns and later a funky guitar to create a fusion that is new and old, interesting and unique. The last instrumental composition, \\"Hanky Panky,\\" sets up the transition from the instrumental mini-suite to the first song of the album. \\"Hanky Panky\\" is a celebration of music and jazz and declares its enthusiasm for the music that came before and the music that comes after.<br /><br />The first song keeps a jazz theme for continuity with the opening instrumentals. The vocals have a Beatle's style when they open, and \\"Life Saver's\\" peppy beat sets the optimistic tone for the music of this CD. \\"Happy Man\\" is a mellow pop love song from Peter Cetera. The pace is slower than the earlier songs, and yet the song is a celebration, with upbeat percussion and vocals.<br /><br />The next song was the first hit from this album. An edited version of \\"(I've Been) Searchin' So Long\\" was backed by \\"Byblos\\" in release. The single reached #9 on the Hot 100 and #8 on the Easy Listening charts. As was typical of Chicago's music at that time, the music was very carefully arranged and heavily orchestrated. This pop song is flavored by horns rather than being a true jazz fusion. This song also features strings to further expand the complexity of the music. The vocals are arranged with similar complexity and make this song one of Chicago's all-time greats.<br /><br />I have no idea what \\"Mongonucleosis\\" is about. The lyrics are \\"Que pe chesa\\" repeated. The music is Hispanic-styled and fast. This music is easy on the ear and fun, maintaining the optimistic tone of the album. \\"Song of the Evergreens\\" is Terry Kath poetry. The lyrics are evocative and the complex music is rock. The repeated \\"snow\\" lyrics at the end of the song could be annoying, and yet they are not. Once again the music is catchy and tempts you to hum along. Near the end of the song the guitars break down into a funky sound characteristic of the mid-70s.<br /><br />\\"Byblos\\" is a lyrically complex song. This song is a story song in the tradition of those sung by Harry Chapin and Gordon Lightfoot. We never learn her name, but we know she affects those around her with her presence, an inner beauty that makes you long for her presence once more, while feeling comfortable just because she is in theworld. This song is yet another Terry Kath poem set to mellow and pretty music.<br /><br />The next song has always been one of my all-time Chicago favorites. \\"Wishing You Were Here\\" was ethereal and haunting well before that type of song was popular in rock. Chicago's vocals are enhanced by the presence of the Dennis and Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys and Al Jardine. There is also an interesting synthesizer contribution to this song that helps provide an eerie aspect to the song's ethereal air. This song is one that must be heard to be appreciated. This song reached #11 on the Hot 100 chart and #1 on the Easy Listening chart, backed by \\"Life Saver.\\"<br /><br />The next song charted #6 on the Hot 100 chart and also went to #1 on the easy listening chart. \\"Call on Me,\\" backed by \\"Prelude to Aire,\\" is a jazz-influenced pop love song. The lyrics are simple with yet more catchy pop hooks. The song speeds up at the end to rush through the last 30 seconds, leading into \\"Women Don't Want to Love Me.\\" This song has a funky blues rhythm and is a breakup song. Similarly, \\"Skinny Boy\\" also has a funky blues style. Both songs are by Robert Lamm.<br /><br />There are at least three versions of this CD available.  This version was released in 1995.  There is also a 1990 release and a 2002 remaster that includes a bonus track.  If you like Chicago's blues music you may prefer the version with the extra track.  You may wish to survey the available versions to determine which version best meets your needs before buying.<br /><br />From \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" Chicago just seemed to get better and better. This CD shows pop influence, but there are just as many other influences, including jazz, blues and even Hispanic. This music is more than just great pop or rock; it is great music. If you are going to own music by Chicago, this CD is a must.because she is in the world.

B000F7CMRM|3.0|This movie is no fun at all. The acting is good and the story is interesting enough, but....... you will fall asleep. <br /> <br />Just buy Munich.
B000F0V0LI|5.0|The Searchers: Ultimate Edition <br /> <br />For most John Wayne fans this is the one JW movie that is the best and hands down there favorite.  So lets review the Ultimate Editon DVD. <br /> <br />First the Packaging: <br />It's a very nice looking box brown carboard kinda looks like leather. Personally for 29.99 it should be in real leather or at least a better binding. No to say its not nice but its cardboard and I personally don't care for card board cases I rather have the plastic ones they tend to hold up better. Inside you will find 2 discs  and some extras. <br /> <br />Disc 1:  <br />The movie one of the best westerns ever filmed finally gets a great transfer and looks the best I have ever seen it owning the original dvd release you will be happy to know its not a flip disc and is presented in widescreen the way it should be seen the it was shot. The story is around the search for a woman kidnapped by native Americans on the plains and Wayne plays one of the darkest and most deep characters in cinema history. You want to hate him, then u pity him, and u end up just feeling sad that you know there no place for him in the time the movie is set. The way ford shot the violence without showing a thing makes for a haunting picture, a movie you won't soon forget. <br /> <br />The Sound is stunning for a movie of its age they did a remarkle 5.1 mix its crisp clear and makes for the total package <br /> <br />There is also a Commentary by Peter Bogdanovich that for the most part seems irrelevant mainly cause only john ford and john wayne would do for this though he is kinda interesting at time but you won't listen twice. <br /> <br /> <br />Disc2: <br /> The Extras  <br /> The Searchers An Appreciation: <br /> This Featurette explores the movie and how actors and others feel about this movie and its location the duke and location interesting but again you won't watch it twice. <br /> A Turning of the Earth John Ford & John Wayne and the Searchers <br /> Some interesting info but all in all starts repeating what they said in the first one. You won't watch this one twice either <br /> <br /> The Assasination of Jesse James <br /> First the movie theater now the dvd COMMERCIAL IGNORE IT. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Now the other extras more stuff your don't need there to separate insert boxes with stuff in them the first one has <br /> <br />A comic book. <br />Its just the movie in comic book form <br /> <br />A book of clipping <br />It has all the info of the searchers from the time newspaper clipping poster ads lots of stuff  they are both small about 5 by 8. <br /> <br />The Other Box  <br />It has  2 interoffice memos about the concerns over the movie nice read <br />And 10 photos from location all 5 by 8's I guess u could frame these and have them they are glossy and nice but all in all not really needed either <br /> <br />So in conclution it's a DVD set but its not worth $29 of $31 if you want this one I recommend getting it like I did in the John Wayne John Ford Collection. Other wise get the Two Disc Anniversary Edition. Or do what I usually do wait 6 months and get them from a seller for 10 bucks. If you own the original flip disc this makes it look like its illegitimate counsin on you moms side that no one talks about so it does improve it.  <br />

B00004HYLF|5.0|The intensity and speed with which these guys play is simply frightening - it's inhuman actually and there are moments in the recording where I literally have to press stop and catch my breath.  OK, so that is overly dramatic but not too far from the truth.  The virtuosity on this 1976 album is mind-numbing and I personally feel that this album may be the high point of RTF's output - although I do like all of their albums and could easily be swayed one way or the other.<br /><br />The musicians on Romantic Warrior include former Miles Davis keyboardist Chick Corea (acoustic piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Hohner clavinet, Mini-moog, Moog 15, micro mini-moog, ARP Odyssey, Yamaha organ, Polymoog, marimba, and percussion); the fastest bass player on Earth, Stanley Clarke (Alembic bass w/flanger, piccolo bass, acoustic bass, bell tree, and hand bells); shredder Al DiMeola (electric/acoustic guitars, soprano guitar, hand bell, and slide whistle); and the thunderous Lenny White (drums/percussion).<br /><br />The six tracks range in length from 5'01\\" to 11'26\\", with another track reaching 10'52\\".  The longer pieces consist of excellent ensemble work interspersed with incredible solos.  Fortunately the solos do not go on for too long - then again these guys are top shelf and I could listen to Al DiMeola play scales at light speed all day long.  In general though, the music is an interesting blend of prog, some classical, straight jazz and jazz rock, with loads of synthesizers (that sometimes get incredibly spacey) and some searing and occasionally heavily distorted guitar playing (Al DiMeola's track Majestic Dance amply demonstrates this).  I think that it is interesting that the album liner notes point out that Chick's \\"flights from his multi-keyboard post, more than took care of the Yes/King Crimson art rock flank\\".  As a prog fan I definitely agree and was more than wowed by Chick's playing.  In addition to the rock elements, of which there are a lot, there are some shorter moments where things get slightly jazzy and Chick's acoustic piano and Stanleys' acoustic bass work can be heard (The Romantic Warrior).  For the most part though, these moments are far and few between and this is pretty much a rock record.<br /><br />This remastered album is OK and features good sound quality and restored album cover art, with some informative liner notes.<br /><br />As a fan of both prog and jazz rock, this album works for me on a number of levels.  I suppose though, that the blinding virtuosity may turn some folks off (along with the fleeting silly bits), although I can say that they do back off here and there so it is not completely insane.  Highly recommended to prog fans and fans of jazz rock.some shorter moments where things get slightly jazzy and Chick's acoustic piano and Stanleys' acoustic bass work can be heard (The Romantic Warrior).

0790729393|4.0|The society drama \\"Sleepers\\" from Barry Levinson tells the spectacular story of four boys (Brad Pitt and Jason Patric i.a.), <br />who grow up in a violent neighbourhood, called Hell's Kitchen. After a simple prank, which goes wrong, their lives change completely. They are sentenced to Wilkinson School for Boys where horrible incidents happen. 15 years later in a new life, they decide to take revenge... <br />The story is based on the book with the same title, but it is not settled if it is really autobiographical. Worth mentioning are the well chosen camera techniques, which reflect the people's <br />feelings and the dramatic events. Because of these effects you can identify with the characters. The presentation of several characters is well done by Robert de Niro, who characterizes the priest \\"Father Bobby\\" and also the ward \\"Sean Nokes\\" is very well performed by Kevin Bacon, who conveys the malignance in a special way. The only aspect, which has to be critizised is the difficult story, which is hard to follow at some stages. With this masterpiece Levinson proves his talent by creating a realistic atmosphere and keeping up tension during the whole film.  <br />This film is worth being nominated for an \\"Oscar\\" ! <br /> <br />Written by : Andreas, Simone, Dina from the GBG School in Germany, Remscheid
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Do NOT buy this CD. Your Just going to make them make another, which will be even worse (if possible). Panic! At The Disco really did have an original idea...But does that make it GOOD? No. This album is \\"Emo pop\\" that doesn't even sound like Emo...It's just repeated sounds over and over with a whiny voice and horrible lyrics...And if ANYONE compares this to fallout boy (Or Atleast \\"Take This To Your Grave\\" Fallout Boy) should be shot. Fall out boy sounds nothing like this. I bought this CD for \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" because I thought it sounded Ok..And I realize its not a good song so I listen to the others and they sound HORRIBLE.Whiney voices over repetitive guitar chords...I'll Admit Intermission and There's a Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't are OK, but the rest is horrible. It's just one of those crappy bands stupid teenage girls go crazy over. I am not a death metal fan. If you'd like actual good music, check out Black Sabbath, Senses Fail, The Postal Service, Sex Pistols...Anything but this or rap.
0790729393|4.0|The movie \\"Sleepers\\" is based on a novel and tells the story of four boys who grow up in Hell's Kitchen, a part of New York, where crime is a normal daily act.  <br />As they commit a prank when they are still young they are sentenced to spend a few months in a detention center. This punishment changes their whole lives because they are sexually abused and later two of them even become murderers. <br />Brad Pitt, who plays one of the four main characters, gives a convincing performance because you can really feel what it must be like for the boys to live a normal life although they have been abused. <br />One actor plays the role of the boy who comments on the whole story. Like Brad Pitt he also gives a detailed inside of the deep feelings of an abused boy who is trying to live a normal life.  <br />Other famous actors in the movie are Dustin Hoffmann, who portrays convincingly the role of a drug addicted and alcoholic lawyer, and Robert DeNiro who gives a strong impression of a Father who seems to be the only person whom the boys can deeply trust.  <br />The feelings are supported by different camera techniques such as many close-ups of the characters' faces and a lot of flashbacks which underline the cruel memories of the boys.  <br />If it has one fail it is that sometimes there are too many cuts which follow each other too fast. <br />The trial at the end of the movie seems to be too long and gives the viewer an impression of boredom. <br />All in all the story conveys a sense of depression. So the movie as a whole may not be for everyone, but you cannot walk away from it without being impressed by the deepness of the story. <br /> <br />Julia B., Alexandra T., Andrea S., Moritz G., Melanie P.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Wayne & O'Hara should be synonymous with Tracy & Hepburn. John & Maureen had that great a chemistry between them. It's a shame they couldn't have done more films together. Though this may seem a silly film, it is fun and funny, it also explores marital relations, child parent relations, and mistreatment of Native Americans. It is one of my ALL time favorite John Wayne films.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|When i first saw alien i was like 9 of 10. even tho they dont show the full alien till the end of the movie it was the best Sci Fi movie i had ever seen. then i got stupid (kinda) and saw Alien Ressurect and said it was even better but 3 yeras ago i saw the error in my ways. so i went on and saw Alien 3. This was really cool and explained alot about 4. Then finaly i saw Aliens which is the best in my opinion. I went back and watched all of then over again 3 years ago and watched Alens again befor AVP. They all still rock and i go back to 4 hoping it got better to me but still nothing. The is truly what an alien freak like me needed. There needs to be a 5th film and a precule to all these films.

0345457684|2.0|It is worth prefacing my remarks on this book with this: I am a huge fan of cyberpunk style science fiction. I wrote my MA thesis on Bruce Sterling's and Neal Stephenson's work.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this is really a cop story - not science fiction. The author seems to need to work in cops that are unchanged since 1970's TV, and are always \\"one step over the line.\\" There's an especially dreary passage where there is a discussion of this line stepping over phenomenon. BORING! I got the impression of the author as someone who read _Neuromancer_ and then said, \\"I'm going to write my own book. Only it will be different because I'll tell it in the first person...Oh and the people can have different bodies...And I'll play up the cop story. You can't have enough cop stories.\\"  <br /> <br />I don't like cop stories. Dull, dull, dull.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|This is good CD, voice melllow and soothing, but soulful.  I love \\"Seasons Change\\".... <br />To the person who asked the question about early CD reviews, CBR's album was released in the UK in March 2006.

B0009OTGWU|5.0|The watch is big, so be prepared for a big bold thing dangling from your wrist.<br /><br />The functions of the watch are just amazing. Everything works as it should. You cant expect a watch with all these functions to be accurate to the minutest detail.For what you paid for, this is pure technology in your wrist.<br /><br />For those that whine about how it was off or this or that, read the manual, it says that you can recalibrate the watch if it ever gets magnetized by constant exposure to large speakers (like placing the watch on a huge woofer)or other things. The compass will also be off by a marging of 15 degress, if you are standing under huge powerlines. Which is completely understandable. Its a electronic sensor and not a magnetic needle. The manual is pretty thick, read it carefully and then try to understand its functions and how it works and you will not be dissapointed.<br /><br />Make sure to place the watch on constant light whenever you can to get the solar cells running.<br /><br />Other than being  little big on your wrist, i have no complaints.
B0007OCG56|4.0|A young spanish speaking mother is hired as a housekeeper for an Anglo family that is on the opposite end of her spectrum. Tea Leoni and Adam Sandler both do well in portraying their characters whether you hate them or not. Tea plays a self-obsessed mom who always feels underappreciated and misunderstood. Adam is the father who loves  his kids unconditionally, but is unable to stand up for himself when it comes to what he thinks is best for his children. (This was a bit infuriating, but he played it well.)While some of this movie is over the top, you can relate to it because there are parts that remind you of your own family.
B000EULJLU|3.0|As others have pointed out, this album has only 5-6 \\"real songs\\".  Vicarious, Jambi, Wings 1+2, The Pot, Lost Keys + Rosetta Stoned, and Right in Two.  Now, I loved Third Eye.  I enjoy long Tool songs.  But here, it's too much.  So much is repetitious, with quiet vocals or no vocals at all.  This album could have been far better, had Tool shortned Wings 1+2 and Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned by about five minutes each, cut the boring Intension by half, removed the pointless five minute Vigniti Tres, and put in two or three more actual songs.   <br /> <br />It's an interesting musical experience.  Vicarious and Right in Two are amazing.  Rosetta Stoned and The Pot are unique and cool.  Wings is haunting and beautiful.  Jambi is good.  But really... couldn't they have cut 20-25 minutes of filler and given us a few more amazing songs?  Showcased Maynard's vocals more?  After five years, this feels sort of like an EP.   <br />
B000F39MAQ|2.0|Esta Traviata, que se presentó en su día y que trascendió todo un año después como el acontecimiento musical del año 2005 nos muestra a dos de los cantantes más mediáticos del momento: Anna Netrebko y Rolando Villazón: jóvenes, guapos, famosos y catapultados al éxito. Una pareja que indudablemente vende y que han rodado varias óperas (el 'Romeo y Julieta' de Gounod especialmente) por diversos teatros con garantía de éxito. <br />Pues bien, observando esta función no puedo si no llevarme una gran decepción. Primero por el canto, que no está a la altura, ni en una Netrebko, a la que el primer acto le queda grande y que pasa muchos problemas para respirar donde debe (no siempre lo hace...) aunque construya una prostituta interesante como personaje, ni en un Villazón que, aunque cante con estilo dominguiano, se ve perjudicado por su excesivo vibrato, y por una tendencia al engolamiento bastante desagradable, así como por una interpretación sobreactuada, quizás pasional en exceso. <br />Junto a ellos, en el papel de Giorgio Germont, Thomas Hampson, que nunca ha sido (y quizás nunca llegará a serlo) un buen cantante verdiano. Baste esto para aclarar que está sencillamente fuera de sitio. <br />A la dirección orquestal de Carlo Rizzi (y tal vez también a la orquesta) le falta italianitá, aun sin ser un desastre; es decir, cumplidora. <br />La puesta en escena (minimalista en un escenario gigantesco) de Willy Decker no siempre cuenta la historia con claridad, y presenta licencias de dudoso gusto... <br />Con estos mimbres, no se entiende por qué ha de considerarse esta como una Traviata destinada a marcar una época (hay alguna mejor, incluso en tiempos recientes), y, aunque recomiendo su visionado porque es un dvd del que se ha hablado y se hablará mucho, no me parece una primera versión, ni mucho menos. Solo para fans o coleccionistas de Traviatas.
0553382179|5.0|I have been using this system for almost three years now and it has proven itself through two moves and going from working to being a SAHM.  Use what you need, ignore the rest.  Have an open mind and you'll see the tools she gives you apply to home, work, hobby, almost anything.  It starts with loving yourself and realizing YOU deserve to live in a clean house, regardless of who else lives with you.  It helps you establish good habits and gives a framework for living your life.  And realize that if you get behind in your cluttered, disorganized life, it's ok - just jump in where you are.  You can do anything for 15 minutes.  It's true!<br /><br />Marla is a sweet woman with a huge heart.  She's not a drill sergeant, your life will not be scheduled from morning to night with cleaning tasks.  Again, it's a framework for taking care of your home, but more importantly, loving yourself enough.  If that sounds strange, you'll have to read the book to learn more.  It took a couple of months for me to see how they related but once it clicked the entire system made complete sense.  I am proud of the person I am and the house that I keep and all the good things that follow from that.  I have time in my life for the people and hobbies that I love and I'm don't feel guilty about household chores (they're done) and I don't waste time on insignificant tasks/things.<br /><br />Give the book a chance and it just may well be the tool you need.
B000HBK3MM|3.0|This English beauty has an exquisite voice. She brings an aura of innocence and purity that's quite rare in today's artists and in the music industry in general. Her music takes you places, and that's what makes this album just a wonderful treat. However, I agree with some people who think that she's overly compared to other artists, such as Billie Holiday, Eryka Badu, Norah Jones, and Jill Scott. That's a problem. It makes it hard to listen to her voice without thinking about those artists. In some ways it makes her just another pretty girl who has a voice of gold that could be heard in every blues, slow jazz, and R&B station in the country. I think that's the downfall about artists such as Corrinne and Norah Jones--their music is admired, but they're overly compared to blues artists from long ago, so much to the point that they're underlooked and tend to fade, leaving people to barely know these artists for who they are.<br /><br />Personally, I found this album to be pretty consistent. A few pretty songs, but no track stood out, except the obvious hit single, \\"Put Your Records On.\\" I found the more upbeat songs to lack something. I guess not much rhythm or excitement, kind of dull and boring. With a voice so soft and delicate, an R&B flair kind of makes it sound out of character and pretty dry. And I found many of the tracks to be a bit too repetitive. No surprises, no different sound, just kind of the same soft and pretty vibe.<br /><br />But this girl has something. Maybe not something special or different, but it's nice to hear a new artist who isn't about rebelling against the world and trying to showoff her sex appeal like most artists. It's just pure innocence, nice, simple, subtle music, nothing more or less.
0061015725|5.0|Just finished reading this book. Compared with the last fiction novel I read - Baldacci's The Winner - this is a far, far better written and researched book. \\"Prey\\" holds your interest, has a good plot, and the pace is well maintained. The details at times may bore those uninterested in the minutaue, but the technical gore is kept to a minimum. The pace at which the bio-engineered nanoparticles evolve is a bit too fast to be entirely plausible, or the level of sophistication that they become capable of within a few weeks, but is well presented to make it at least a little bit plausible. Also, the stay-at-home father routine of Jack Forman is presented in excruciating detail, especially in the first few pages of the book, but this also is a minor quibble with the book. All in all, a full five stars.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This dvd is fantastic; it shows the who throughout their entire years with Keith Moon. The dvd contains many live performances, interviews, and special features. I understand that on this new deluxe version they added \\"A Quick One.\\" That's definitely a plus, but I already had seen it as it's available on the rolling stones \\"rock n' roll circus,\\" which I already had. What angers me is that the live version of \\"my wife\\" included on the soundtrack is not included in the film. This song is easily Enthwistle's best song; why they would include it on the audio soundtrack and not the movie itself is beyond me. Other than that absolutely no gripes except that there could have been more material from who's next, quadrophenia, and By numbers
B0002OERI0|3.0|People have called this album a landmark and a masterpiece... a documentary of American culture during the Bush administration. The beginning of the 21st century has been a time of the Iraq War, a struggling economy, and growing unrest throughout the United States. One can even make a reasonable argument to include a decline in the quality of rock music into the above list of woes-though rock n' roll isn't a concern for much of the country, it is a \\"soundtrack to the lives\\" of the people who love it.  <br /> <br />Anyone who says they know where they will be in 30 years is lying. No one knows what will happen to change history in five years, let alone three decades. How will we feel about songs like \\"Holiday\\" and \\"American Idiot\\" then? Will they still be relevant or will they have become dated? It is too soon to tell - it's only been a few years. Will the class of 2018 be able to call American Idiot their own and identify with the plight of Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy and Whatsername?  <br /> <br />This album has been criticized, Green Day (who I give much respect to as musicians) have been labeled as sell-outs and their empire has become a bloated cash-cow (Adeline clothing anyone?). Sadly, their music has taken second place in the eyes of many.  <br /> <br />I enjoy \\"American Idiot,\\" I have listened to it-hell, I even own it-and I have to credit it as one of the albums that introduced me to rock n' roll in general. It is an album that gets you dancing, and it is good music when compared with the rest of the bands out there (50 Cent, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At The Disco, My Chemical Romance and emo). Its message is a good one for the start of the 2000's... but is it timeless? <br /> <br />Will this album become a classic with the likes of \\"Led Zeppelin IV,\\" Pink Floyd's \\"The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" and even Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\"? We'll have to wait and see...
B00028HBKM|2.0|I'm not squeamish, and I love gory horror flicks. But, those type of films have a different target audience than the Passion does. As others have pointed out, it's virtually a snuff film. The violence done to Jesus was not the sacrifice he made to redeem humanity; many, many people have undergone such savage treatment. What elevates his pain and suffering over anyone elses? <br /> <br />I hope the irony of the masses of Christians subjecting their children to this film while at the same time deploring violence in videogames isn't lost on the public.
B000FA57RQ|5.0|Madonna's come a long way since 1991 \\"Truth or Dare\\", and this film is evident of that.  Although I am a Madonna fan, I'm a pretty objective one and don't enjoy everything she's done (especially when it comes to film).  \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\", though, is a very enjoyable film...and a much more insightful and introspective film then I had expected.  It's worth viewing. <br /> <br />While 1991's documentary of her \\"Blond Ambition\\" tour found Madonna being scandalous, brat-like, and at the complete and total peak of her, then, uber-popularity...\\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" finds her in a very different place (which documents 2004's phenomenally successful \\"Re-Invention Tour\\").  Here we find Madonna 20 + years into her career, and in a much different place.  She's a mother now, she's far more approachable, and she's on a journey (which she has made very public) to find \\"the truth\\" so to speak via her newfound spirituality (via the Kabbalah). <br /> <br />Is this documentary as fun, exciting, and controversial as her 1991 documentary?  Absolutely not.  BUT, it's just as interesting in another sense: Madonna now sees that she has a responsibility as a public figure, but more importantly, she has a responsibility to herself and her family.  Her responsibility lies in many areas, but with this film, she focuses mainly on exuding positive energy to the world, being devoted to her family, and being devoted to her spirituality. <br /> <br />The film is inter-cut with beautiful color concert footage (the remainder of the documentary is mainly black and white).  This film is worth watching...for fans, but especially for people who aren't fans because it makes you *think* about what you would like to do with your own life, what you're doing with it, and who and how you're sharing it with those around you. <br /> <br />Madonna may no longer be wearing cones on stage, but it doesn't make her any less interesting.  This film proves that. <br /> <br />It's too bad thisfilm didn't get a theatre release.  The DVD also comes with a live soundtrack of some songs from the concert (the tracks on the CD are of full-length, while the DVD has slightly edited live performances). <br />
B000BOH8XW|4.0|I'm a little embarrassed to admit this... but I really like this album!  You see, I'm a \\"Radiohead\\" and \\"Portishead\\" kind of guy and if it gets out that I like Shakira, my reputation in shot! <br /> <br />I'm sort of kidding... I actually appreciate a good pop song and this album is wonderful pop.  <br /> <br />WEAKNESSES: <br /> <br />The lyrics can be simplistic, at times, but this is offset by the serious topics Shakira sings about. Hers is a kind of post-post-feminism in that she complains about being a sex object but still wants to be one. Most of the songs are sad. <br /> <br />The album also suffers a little from over-production so some of the songs have just too much stuff going on. <br /> <br />STRENGTHS: <br /> <br />OK, that's the criticism. What's good about this album? <br /> <br />Shakira is a good singer and takes advantage of her dual culture background -- Latino and Arabic. It's more Latino but with enough Arabic to avoid the boring formulas of so much Latino music. <br /> <br />She brings her sexuality but without overpowering the music as happens in her videos.  Yes, it's sensual but in a PG sort of way... which is my preference rather than the explicit lyrics of, let's say, Pink.  <br /> <br />She makes good use of guest musicians, like Santana.  <br /> <br />It is a good full album ... not just a good single with other songs tacked on.  It holds up under repeated listening and, for me, my favorite cut changed as I got more familiar with the album. I really like that in an album. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: <br /> <br />If you like pop music sung by a sexy woman, buy this album.  <br /> <br />Just don't tell your hip friends!
0440213525|4.0|I found this book to be very readable.  I disagree with the reviewers who found it to be a \\"McBook.\\"  It is true that, like most authors, Grisham doesn't always deliver -- but he certainly does in this one!  I couldn't put this book down once I had started.  It is the story of two boys, who see something terrible -- a suicide.  But before that, one of the boys is told something dreadful by the man -- a secret that the mob wants, the police want, the FBI wants.  How the eleven-year old boy deals with that, and the folks who help him, is what this book is about.  It would make a great movie (if iut hasn't already been made into one!).  I enjoyed every word of it.
B0000VD04M|5.0|To affirm this film ha meant that blessing moment for every actor, was far to be an exaggeration. Landau found in this challenging script, the golden opportunity to display all his immense powers as actor to shine as he did it with this extremely complex and difficult role.<br /><br />Perfection is perhaps a term that nearly would describe that overwhelming performance. But to be honest Landau became by himself the 95% of the film, more than to represent Lugosi he was a model, far beyond an actor. He achieved with the role of his lifetime that coveted \\"State of art.\\"<br /><br />In what concerns to Depp we will have to remind how he grew up under this underground filmmaker; I don' t think it may sound the artistic couple Depp-Burton be reminded in the future at the same level that De Niro- Scorsesse or Wayne-Ford, for instance.<br /><br />And kudos too for the most artistic achievement made by Tim Burton.
0784011176|2.0|I was so looking forward to see this movie because it featured some of my favorite actors- Sam Neill, Anna Paquine etc. But gosh, I feel so ashamed of dragging my mother in seeing this movie with me. It was the two of the most confusing-ist, boring-ist and disgusting-ist hours of my life. <br /> <br />first of all this movie isn't at all difficult to comprehend, a Maori guy blackmails a mute, married woman to have sex with him just so she can get her most beloved possession, her piano back. She falls for him afterwards (?!) and her husband got jealous (OF COURSE!) and try to win her for himself, but finally gave her up. happy ending yippy! <br /> <br />Why is it boring? Like so many other people have said, it dragged on way too long, and the scenes are not at all pleasant. <br /> <br />I have NEVER been SO DISGUSTED with the nudity and the sex. Usually I have no problem with it at all and I can feel the love. But this time, GEEEEZUUUS, it's just all porn, nothing else. Why in the world would Ada fall for a guy LIKE THAT? He's rude, a pervert, has no respect for women-basically take what he want just for sex, and not to mention all-time UGLY!  <br />Instead of a love story, it seemed to me that Ada, after having sex with the guy, was jonsing to have sex again when she was nuzzling with her daughter and touching her husband's butt (which really disturbed him, hmmm I wonder why). There was NO chemistry, just erotism.  <br />lots of things are unexplained, as for example WHY ON EARTH did Neill's character marry her? What's with the show thingy? To be honest, Neill's character was much more sympathetic than the two \\"lovers\\" (in quote because I don't feel like they are, they feel more like \\"sex partners\\"). But in order to make him look like the \\"bad guy\\", they had him chop off a finger of Ada's-simply because else-wise (without extreme violence) his rage and anger is totally understandable. Unlike Baines, he gave Ada space to become more \\"affectionate\\" instead of just \\"taking\\" her through blackmaile. the only thing he did wrong was selling her piano, but that's only because of the pervert want to use it for Ada's body and the husband really has no money-sooooo why marry??? geeez!  <br /> <br />the only two good thing I can say about the movie is 1. the acting, especially Anna Paquine and Holly Hunter. 2. the music, the music of the piano theme was beautiful. <br /> <br />And NO, the scenery was disgusting as well, it was muddy, dirty and just feel like not the place you wanna go. Also, the whole Maori situation made me have NO respect for their culture, unlike other movie involved natives have. <br /> <br />The piano is SO OVERRATED, that's my conclusion, I even told people if you want your kids to never have sex, make them watch this movie, they'll never want to have sex ever again.
B00005JP01|3.0|The Fast and the Furious,first movie, was okay. I'm not a big VD fan.Too Fast Too Furious was surprisingly very entertaining. Both Walker and his co-star did a good job. With Tokyo Drift, Walker is gone and in comes 24 year old, Lucas Black with Bow Wow (Mr. yawnfest)<br /><br />The first fifteen or so minutes of this film are wild. Sean(the lead) is sent to Tokyo so that he can avoid himself getting into trouble. In Tokyo, he meets Bow Wow and they become good friends quickly to get the story to move along. Of course, there is a girl in it but nevermind, just imagine a movie based on semi-entertaining drifts and soppy storylines and somewhat cheesy characters.<br /><br />This is not a bad film. It's just that I expected them to raise the bar. The soundtrack is decent and the music will make you tap your feet while you sit in the theater. Vin Diesel makes a small appearance in the end so that fanboys can have something to cheer about. Not a bad move, directors.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say the film is watchable if you do not expect very good actions. The villain could have been made to look cooler than what they did make him look like. The Japanese should love this film. Not the best camerawork in the film though. The sets are below average for an action packed film of this genre.<br /><br />Anyhow, watch it if you must. I would watch it if I read my own review for it's worth watching. That's all.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Not many cds released in the last few years have as many solid tracks as stadium arcadium. There is something in this cd for all generations of chili peppers fans, new and old. Not a single song can be considered filler and what one person might not like, another might consider it a gem. I am more of a new age chili's fan since californication was realeased so my review is biased from that sense. Definitely there are some songs that resemble the BSSM days such as Charlie, Hump De Bump, So Much I, and Storm In A Teacup. In my opinion disc 2: Mars is definitely stronger in rythem and instantly catchy tunes and lyrics. But Jupiter tends to grow on you with the slower songs making a lasting impression lyrically and in tone. A common theme in the most songs is the awesome climax achieved in the last chorus verse, and can't forget the unmistable solo of John Frusciante as he rips away at the end of Turn It Again. Kiedis, Flea, and Chad are also at the top of their game, be prepared to be blown away. <br /> <br />Disc 1: Jupiter <br />Dani California 10/10 <br />Snow (Hey Oh) 10/10 <br />Charlie 8/10 <br />Stadium Arcadium 9/10 <br />Hump De Bump 6/10 <br />She's Only 18 9/10 <br />Slow Cheetah 10/10 <br />Torture Me 9/10 <br />Strip My Mind 9/10 <br />Especially In Michigan 10/10 - Favorite song disc 1 <br />Warlocks 7/10 <br />C'mon Girl 8/10 <br />Wet Sand 10/10 <br />Hey 9/10 <br /> <br />Disc 2: Mars <br />Desecration Smile 10/10 <br />Tell Me Baby 10/10 - Favorite song on disc 2 <br />Hard to Concentrate 10/10 <br />21st Century 10/10 <br />She Looks To Me 9/10 <br />Readymade 6/10 <br />If 8/10 <br />Make You Feel Better 10/10 <br />Animal Bar 7/10 <br />So Much I 10/10 <br />Storm In A Teacup 10/10 <br />We Believe 10/10 <br />Turn It Again 10/10 <br />Death of a Martian 7/10 <br /> <br />Another flawless cd from the RHCP, thats what you've come to expect and they dont disappoint.

0141301066|3.0|Matilda Wormwood is one of the youngest protagonists in YA literature, but don't be fooled by her small stature; she is a genius when it comes to reading and performing mathematical processes in her head.  Her clueless and callous parents ignore her prodigy--leaving her alone all afternoon. Encouraged by a kind librarian and later by a sweet teacher, Miss Honey, little Matilda at 5 sets herself to reading British and American adult Classics.   <br /> <br /> Her father is a dishonest used car salesman who prizes their son, but his unreasonable punishment of Matilda merely serves to inspire her ingenuity for private revenge.   Naturally modest and well-behaved the little girl is pushed to domestic extremes.  All of which proves a prelude to her greatest challenge--the horrendously malicious Headmistress, Miss Trunchbull.  Can a tiny tyke, even with her super brain, outwit and banish the school's entrenched bully? <br /> <br />     This is a delightful read for kids of all ages, as Matilda matches wits with dishonesty on several levels.  There is hope for two lonely females who need and deeply appreciate each other.  This charming book is funny yet thoughtful, as the author takes literary potshots at his own sadistic teachers.  With Dahl one can be sure that social and personal justice will eventually triumph! <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000FA57RG|4.0|U know despite her shortcomings as a vocalist, Madonna has been consistently one of the best live performers in the POP world. So it was about time she'd release an official live cd although there are times that I think she should've released the whole Reinvention Tour on DVD along with the DVD film of I'm Going To Tell You A Secret. Which in the end I believe I'm right for the most part because my opinion is that her stuff is more entertaining visually than sonically. But anyways, it's a good item to have and the DVD film finally comes with some extras after the huge disappointment of her last DVD release of The Drowned World tour not having any.   The documentary film I'm Going To Tell You A Secret is heartwarming and touching although I believe for someone who stated that she wants privacy for her kids is sort of contradicting herself by exposing them so much in this film. But Madonna has contradicted herself many times throughout her career so......  Also it's unfortunate that the film didn't get the exposure that Truth Or Dare did because I honestly believe she had a great message that just seemed to have gotten lost even with her fans.  She has a great secret to tell you in the film but did anyone REALLY actually listen?!
B000002HMH|4.0|when i first listened to 'load' it wasn't anything special. to me it was easily the weakest metallica album ever made, but after listening through it a couple of times it really grew on me and now i just love it, and now would put it in my top 3 metallica albums. 'bleeding me' 'hero of the day' and 'king nothing' are my favorites on this album.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Led Zepplin, Yes' debut album, early Alice Cooper, Black Sabbath all rolled into one.  This album feckin' rocks.  There is not one single track that made me want to shut it off.  Buy it now!  DO IT!
B000021XR5|3.0|On October 26, 1999, Stone Temple Pilots released their forth studio effort appropriately titled \\"No. 4.\\"  Though the album fell below the band's true potential, the failure in sales is a direct result of the band's inability to promote the album while singer Scott weiland was in drug rehab.  Dispite the many obstacles the band had to endure, they were able to create a handful of songs that belong in their greatest hits collection such as \\"Down,\\" \\"Heaven & Hot Rods,\\" \\"Church On Tuesday,\\" \\"Sour Girl,\\" \\"No Way Out\\" and \\"Glide.\\"  They even managed to score one of their biggest hits of all time, \\"Soul Girl,\\" which was written about Weiland's failing relationship with his then wife.  But all in all, the album as a whole is plagued by poor production and numerous songs that could be considered as \\"fillers.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Down\\" - Equipped with solid guitar riffs and a uniqueness to Scott's voice - 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Heaven & Hot Rods\\" - One of the highlights of the album, the band at their best - 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Pruno\\" - The first \\"filler\\" and the worst song on the album - 03/10 <br /> <br />\\"Church On Tuesday\\" - Catchy chorus, great vocals - 08/10 <br /> <br />\\"Sour Girl\\" - The best written song on the album, brilliant both lyrically and musically - 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"No Way Out\\" - Hard-hitting rock song with signature guitar riffs during the verse - 09/10 <br /> <br />\\"Sex & Violence\\" - This aggressive track falls short vocally while the music seems a bit sporatic - 04/10 <br /> <br />\\"Glide\\" - The final quality track on the album - 08/10 <br /> <br />\\"I Got You\\" - 60's-influenced but a bit boring - 05/10 <br /> <br />\\"MC5\\" - A definite \\"filler,\\" this song is everywhere and nowhere - 04/10 <br /> <br />\\"Atlanta\\" - For some reason this song constantly reminds me of a Christmas song I've heard before.  A bit boring but the whistling towards the end gives the song a bit of uniqueness - 04/10
B0000067L2|5.0|Disraeli Gears was Cream's breakthrough achievement. Their most famous piece of work, and their highest praised too. And, it deserves all of this.  <br /> <br />The album is fully entertaining. Some spots may be lower than the usual standard, but it doesn't really get boring. The length is okay, some say it's too short, but I like my albums this long. On to the songs then. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with Strange Brew. Though it isn't much of an opener (I'd put SWLABR instead), it's still a nice song with some nice Clapton blues licks.  <br /> <br />After that, Bruce kicks in with an agressive bass line, and Eric follows with the guitar riff everybody knows: Sunshine Of Your Love. A standout thing from this song is Baker's drums, and of course, you can't forget Clapton's solo. <br /> <br />The last two songs were singles, so the album really starts after Sunshine Of Your Love. World Of Pain has got some mixed up melodies, that may require a few listens to get used to. I like the song.  <br /> <br />Dance The Night Away is one of my favourite songs on the album. Eric and Ginger really make this one. Clapton's rhythm guitar tone is excellent here, and the leads sound pretty psychedelic. I really like the drums during the chorus.  <br /> <br />Blue Condition isn't a very good track. It drags on, the lyrics sound strange and it is repetitive, plus it isn't as fun as the last two. I like some parts of it though.  <br /> <br />Tales Of Brave Ulysses sounds A LOT like White Room, a song the band would release later. White Room is much better. Had it been on the album instead, and put as the opener, this could have been my favourite album ever. Anyway, the song isn't bad. Not much to say about it, though I'm not fond of the lyrics. <br /> <br />SWLABR is a damn fine track, and the most fun on the album. The hooks will get in your head and you'll be singing them in no time. Great solo there.  <br /> <br />We're Going Wrong is excellent. The atmosphere is set up by Ginger's drums, and then Eric joins in with a soft guitar and then some nice licks. I like Jack's vocals on this. I don't know what happened near the end, when Eric and Ginger go crazy and play something completely out of context, but then Jack closes the song nicely.  <br /> <br />Outside Woman Blues I'm not much fond of. The blues lick is repeated too many times, and it isn't a song I particularly like. Take It Back has got a fun start, I like John's vocal on the start, but then it loses its magic. The group finishes the album with Mother's Lament, a joke song, that doesn't spoil the album on any way. I like how they sing boy-by.  <br /> <br />Anyway, a damn fine album, very enjoyable and some nice songs. I highly recommend it.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|The film is beautiful to look at.  Excellent cinematography, design, etc.  Very specific, commited visual choices that really transport you into the world of the film.  Wonderful supporting actors, perfectly cast. <br />Elijah Wood has, unfortunately, misunderstood the concept of subtlety by thinking it means just barely doing anything and overacting with his big glassy eyes.  They're great eyes.  Beautiful.  But they don't do all the acting for him, especially not in this film.  His portrayal of a character that was, in the book, lovingly befuddled and entirely sympathetic (albeit a tad uptight) was turned into an obnoxious, rude, morose take off on the James Leer character in Wonder Boys, without any of James Leer's sweetness or attractive qualities.   <br />Liev Schreiber may have done an excellent job with the visuals, but it's hard to understand what made him want to translate the masterpiece novel into a film, since he has included almost NOTHING of the book's merits.  I don't  mean \\"Oh, I loved that part, why didn't he put that in?\\"  I mean that the book has so much to pick and choose from, it has five different movies in it waiting to be plucked out, and he has ignored them all and instead opted for a watered down, slightly nonsensical half-plot that has almost no arc to it.  And while the Holocaust is an issue that needs to be handled with delicacy and reverence, the film seems to treat it with none of the severity or candor it deserves.  The entire point of the TITLE is how the past becomes illuminated and thereby illuminates the present, so that EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED.  Yer the past in this movie is given barely a nod, and the character of Jonathan learns virtually nothing about his grandfather, and so has changed almost not at all except in some cryptic way Wood seems to imply with an unmotivated smile.  I'm all for letting the visuals do the work instead of the dialogue, but you need to establish a connection to your characters first.  I finished thebook feeling like I'd had the wind knocked out of me.  I finished the film going \\"Well what was the point?\\"  Why was this made if Schreiber didn't appreciate any of the reasons it needed to be made?   <br />Waste of time. <br />Read the book. <br />Really.
B0006J28KU|5.0|When it comes to reviewing a film that's been reviewed so many times as Michael Mann's Heat, original comments are difficult to make. Instead it seems more appropriate to use this review space to urge fans of crime dramas/action movies to check out Heat! Chances are you'll end up buying it.<br /><br />One of the greatest things about the movie is the cast - stellar performances by Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, John Vought, and Robert de Nero make this film an excellent drama and compelling on an emotion level. Coupled with an excellent script, amazing cinematography, a fast pace, non-stop action and engaging storyline, Heat stands apart from other police crime dramas as something rather exquisite.<br /><br />The fast paced story might remind the viewer of Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" and yet isn't as disjointed as that film in execution (something which Tarantino is famous for). The dramatic elements might remind the audience of Mike Newell's \\"Donnie Brasco.\\" But whatever link this film has to either of the two, that's just where the connection ends. Heat is truly a masterpiece of its own kind onto itself.<br /><br />As for this version of Heat, surprisingly although I like the commentaries and extras found within the twin DVD pack, I think they could have done more with the DVDs. For instance, unless it's a problem with the 4 DVD players I tested the movie on, the audio is somehow rather poor. Beside from that I'm pretty neutral as to which version of the movie should best be purchased.<br /><br />If crime dramas interest you, then check out Heat today. If you're a Michael Mann fan, this is probably one of his greatest works since Miami Vice the television show so you should either see it or buy it today.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|I liked Cabin Fever. It had a dark sense of humor. It didn't take itself too seriously. When I first saw Hostel I wasn't really all that satisfied. It was predictable and the story itself wasn't very original. The violence was pretty cool. I just felt like it could have been better. DISCLAIMER: If you haven't seen this film and would like to, then don't read any further because I am about to give something away. In the end of the movie when he kills the guy he makes the guy look at his reflection before he cuts his throat. Almost as if he knew that is what the guy did to his friend. How could he possibly know this though. It was too much to have been just a coincidence. That was giving him a taste of his own medicine. That question immediately popped into my head when it happened and it nagged at me. If I actually found anything wrong with this film at all it was that. The second time I watched the movie I really enjoyed it. Eli is trying to generate some good scares that aren't cheap like the ones you see in films nowadays and I think he is successful here. I have never been to slovakia and after seeing this film I know I never will go. If Eli can do that to a person then I think he accomplished something. I probably wouldn't have gone to slovakia anyways but I think you get my point.  <br />  Now, the first half of the film on the border of soft core porn. That could have been cut down just a little. that is the only reason that I give this four stars. Other than that I recommend this movie to anyone that likes blood and violence in film. There is enough here for you to get your fill. <br />
B000FILW86|5.0|This is a GREAT CD!  What a magnificent return to form after the disappointing (un)Special One.  Believe the other reviews here, this stands up easily with their best work.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Corinne Bailey Rae made a good debut performance on the UK's most respected late-night music programme before Christmas last year, and drew ringing praise out of none other than Burt Bacharach. That, coupled with the record company's insistance that she has the voice to put her up there with Billie Holiday, means that she has an awful lot to live up to. It's impossible, as Como once said. <br /> <br />My initial reaction to this CD upon trying to listen to it was to go in the complete opposite direction. For a start it took five attempts to listen all the way through without nodding off to sleep, because it's so easy, one-paced, and over-produced to within an inch of its life. So the temptation was to dismiss it to the cure-for-insomnia or after-dinner-party categories; however, something has made me persevere with it and has convinced me that it's more than just that. <br /> <br />I can't really see the likeness to Holiday myself, I think it's insulting to both ladies. If it's true that you're influenced by what you hear growing up at home, then I suspect the family record collection boasts some Sade, Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield, and, from the \\"mockney\\" intro to \\"Put Your Records On\\", some All Saints. Corinne's voices sounds very pure and natural, and it's very English (no trace of Leeds (Yorkshire) though). I'm not sure how strong it is - the nature of the songs is such that she's closely-miked and intimate, and they certainly don't warrant or get any vocal gymnastics - but you can hear every word quite clearly, which is fairly remarkable. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are all self-penned, with help in the music department from various members of her backing band. The lyrics are simple and beautiful - some may say too much so - of her experiences in love and, in the second half of the album, of growing up at home. The music is that easy, soul-lite pop, with the flavour here and there of gospel, jazz, dub and R&B. Apart from the lead single / airplay track \\"PutYour Records On\\" none of them sound instantly commercial, but they do grow on you, particularly the first six. Track seven, \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\" is a great title, but a sad song with a dreary, jazz-pretentious melody and things never recover from that, despite some bassy dub grooves in \\"I'd Like To\\". <br /> <br />Corinne plays guitar and percussion on most of the songs, so she's not just a pretty face. It's all very well produced - reading the credits they threw everything at it except the proverbial kitchen sink - but, apart from some overheated bass guitar on some tracks, it doesn't sound too artificial, just warm and comfortable. Yes, this will inevitably join the easy-listening pile along with many other similar young hopefuls these days, but Corinne's voice and songs are sufficiently different, in a pure and innocent way, to deserve listening to more closely.
B000ESSTL0|5.0|I bought the UK version because I wanted it sooner, however the real engineering in these remasters went into the DTS 96. <br /> <br />If you don't have a multi-channel audio system,this edition really won't impress you. The clarity and mixing of the DVD is very enjoyable, almost like hearing it again for the first time. <br /> <br />I hope they continue and do Songs of Faith and Ultra this way.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Alright. I love Star Wars: originals, special editions and prequels (plus the novels, toys and others). We are ALL SW fans. If you didn't like the originals, SE, or prequels is your own decision, a PERSONAL PREFERENCE. This does not mean that you were ripped off, it does not mean that the version or trilogy that you don't like is bad. It just means that you don't like it. The original trilogy is a wonderful masterpiece, a gem that should be kept for all time - but... I would rather watch the SE because I PREFER IT! It is not disrespectful to the OT to like the newer versions. And if you complain that GL is ripping you off, save up for this new batch. OR just have them on VHS if you like the old. This silliness with OT vs. SE vs. the Prequels is reidiculous. They are all Star Wars. They all tell the story, just in different ways. No problem. Besides, there are more pressing problems to address I think, hmm? May the Force be with all of us SW fans!
B000002IWQ|5.0|11 tracks and no bummers. As another reviewer said, naturally, you will prefer certain ones over others.  This isn't my personal favorite Rush album, but it might be in the top 5 just because it's so consistent. And I like some more modern alternative music.  Let's get to the songs: <br /> <br />Animate- 11/10- Easily the best on the album. This song would be the best on a lot of albums.  I like how it's rocking and going really fast then suddenly it's a ballad, then it picks up again.  Awesome. <br /> <br />Stick It Out- 10/10- You're coming off the high of Animate and you encounter another really good song.  Very heavy, but very catch melody. <br /> <br />Cut to the Chase- 10/10- And that's for the lyrics alone!!!  The music just compliments! <br /> <br />Nobody's Hero- 9.5/10- Okay, the first verse is awkward, so I'll take 0.5 points off.  Don't use the word \\"sexuality\\" in an emotional song. <br /> <br />Between Sun and Moon- 9/10- Not as flourishing as the rest. Lyrics are kind of dumb \\"Ahh yes to yes to ahh yes to ah....\\" What? <br /> <br />Alien Shore- 9.5/10- Cool! <br /> <br />The Speed of Love- 8.5/10- The worst on the album. Not bad, just kind of meh... Ya know... <br /> <br />Leave That Thing Alone- 10/10- Funky bassline. Just cool in general <br /> <br />Cold Fire- 10/10- Just because it's commercial doesn't mean it's bad!  It's catchy, like The Spirit of Radio, but in a VERY different way. <br /> <br />Everyday Glory- 10/10- Caps off the album very well.   <br /> <br />In conclusion: I would not recommend starting your Rush catalogue with this album, I'd recommend Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, or Signals, but maybe your 5th or 6th buy.  Gets a 9.9/10 from me because it's not quite perfect, but it's consistently very good.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|This band is one of those bands that is really, really, really fun to watch and listen to... provided nobody takes them seriously.  Unfortunately... we've crossed that threshold long ago.  So now we're left with this interesting, but hardly qualitative, band in our midst.<br /><br />The thing is, they really do try to do things with their music, and in most of their songs I've heard it seems they switch to about five or six different genres of music.  The problem is that they do none of them well.  It works for a local band trying to build themselves together and discover their own tune, something that a small dedicated fanbase can show pamphlets to their shows in dusty bars over college campuses and large high-schools, but it doesn't work for actually devoting airtime and fan-clubs over.  They needed a few more years of obscurity, some time to clean up their sound and figure out what they really wanted to do (I'm not talking genre, I'm talking cohesiveness), before being released in the broader spectrum of marketability.<br /><br />But oh, silly me, forgetting that stuff like \\"quality\\" and \\"dependability\\" has any place in the current consumerist marketplace.  There goes me proselytizing on ideals again.<br /><br />So let's get give them some of the benefit of the doubt: first of all, they could prove to be highly inspiring to someone who wants to take the experimentation further, and who might do it right.  Secondly, they might get enough room in their touring and marketing to hit on something really good, and their sound might develop despite the fact that commonly these situations tend to degrade into blessed obscurity.<br /><br />In the meantime, they sure are cute little fledgling rockers, now aren't they?<br /><br />--PolarisDiB

0307276902|2.0|A Million Little Pieces <br />By:  James Frey <br /> <br />The book A Million Little Pieces is a poorly written, fictional novel.  It is a \\"non-fictional memoir,\\" as referred to by James Frey.  It tells a story about addiction, alcoholism, about recovery, family, friends, faith, love and hope.  Not until recently, does James admit that \\"...I embellished many details about my past experiences, and altered others in order to serve what I felt was the greater purpose of the book.

A Million Little Pieces was selected for her book club, perhaps the world's most powerful book club.

6305903182|3.0|I had purchased Scream 3 as part of the Box set of Scream films. Although the actual disc presentation and extras are exceptional, to me the film let me down. <br /> <br />The premise is intriguing: that there are more mysteries and unanswered questions surrounding the life and death of Maureen Prescott that even her daughter, Sidney, didn't know about. But somehow the plot premise that Maureen was a B movie actress in horror films seems so out of left field it really doesn't go well with the rest of what has happened in the previous films. <br /> <br />There are some excellent scenes and acting in the film. The most haunting being Sidney's visit to the movie set and seeing the exact replica of her and Stu's home from Woodsboro and viewing the scene of Tatum's demise. The opening sequence is also well done, but not as good as the other two. Parker Posey does steal the film as Jennifer Jolie and Neve Campbell is always good as Sidney Prescott.  <br /> <br />An early sequence where a member of a class that Gale Weathers is lecturing asks her if after all the terror that has occured, it was really worth going after the story. That to me would've been a starting point to a similar but different plot.  <br /> <br />My plot would consist of this: There is a third film being done in the Stab series, but they would actually shoot in the town of Woodsboro, which has the community up in arms. The attacks by the killer would be directed at the cast, but instead of just pictures of Maureen Prescott: the killer would leave pictures of all the victims starting with Maureen or maybe Casey Becker(Drew Barrymore). There would be another reporter but their story would cover the human element of the story, interviewing family members of the victims. As the body count mounts, a secret would be revealed about the Prescott family and the real reason for all the trouble would be revealed in the final act that would take place at the house where it all started.  <br /> <br />I think the First two films are fine book ends, but the third one sticks out like a sore thumb.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This film epitomizes what liberals are fanatic about: placing importance on appearance rather than substance. Dr. Marvin SHouser sums things up well with this hypothetical: suppose there is a forest fire in progress and a conservative and a liberal are sent in to put it out, and given complete discretion in how to do so. the liberal will likely fill a teacup up with water, then run to the fire and throw it on. obviously this will do nothing. the conservative, on the other hand, will build a fire break and sacrifice the portion of the forest already engulfed to save the rest. however, the cameras will film 2 things: the liberal throwing the teacup of water on the fire and the fire going out. the liberal will then claim that what he did put out the fire, even though it did nothing. he will even go so far as to accuse the conservative of doing nothing to help. some even go so far the delude THEMSELVES into believing what they did worked! it the world of the liberal, appearance is all that matters, and if you dig down past the top layer, you get slammed with PC nonsense. this film in comparison to celsius 41.11 is THE prime example of this. Celsius was criticized for being too right wing and not entertaining enough. the first words in celsius is \\"we begin with the premise that john kerry is an honroable man\\" and all the speakers maintain a professional repsect for the opposition. the closest anyone comes to breaking that is Medved, who says in regard to bush's statement that we need to fight terrorism by doing something other than turning the other cheek by saying, \\"Bush understands this. THe other side does not\\". but even that maintains a professional respect. Celsius is a REAL documentary-created to inform, not entertain. it gives a factual breakdown of current political issues and the 00 and 04 elections. farenheit, on the other hand, features a bunch of clips that moore twisted completely out of context, and mixed in is rhetorical nonsense from moore himself. Thereis not ONE solid fact in this film. there's just a lot circumstantial stuff that even most liberals would dismiss if moore showed the whole picture. we've actually fallen so far as a country and become so pathetic that we ignore real facts and instead believe a guy driving around DC in a golf cart reading the patriot act over a megaphone. no wonder people were avoiding him-they thought he was retarded! but hey, it's PC, so people will actually believe this. open your eyes to moore's films and other liberal arguments and propaganda. there's no logic or facts to any of it, just a bunch of PC hyperbole that we've been turning into law and social policy for the last 80 years or so.  <br />

B00005NRO3|5.0|Throughout the years, I've grown to appreciate Scream 2 as one of the best sequels ever. It doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience, you care for all the characters and their well being and most importantly when its revealed who's responsible for the killings: the motivation makes perfect sense.  <br /> <br />It's fun to watch the beginning as Jada Pinkett-Smith bemoans the fact that horror films have never really had black actors and/or actresses, and yet this film has four talented black actors including Duane Martin, Omar Epps, the lovely Elise Neal and Jada.  <br /> <br />Even when an actor has a small part like Sarah Michelle Gellar, it becomes pivitol to the plot. I know in the audio commentary Wes Craven didn't really like the explanation of how the first three characters were targeted in reference to the original. For me it made perfect sense, which shows the the genius of Kevin Williams' script.  <br /> <br />With New Nightmare, Scream and Scream 2: Wes Craven completed a neat hat trick. Although in my eyes, Scream 3 was very much a letdown.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|After forcing Sufjan Stevens's \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" on a friend, I received something like the following response: \\"It's just not right that someone should write a song like that about a serial killer.\\"  I think my friend was, begrudgingly, admitting the surprising power the song has.  It's not often one is asked to be moved to pity a serial killer, and it can't help but be a disturbing experience.<br /><br />What makes the song so very powerful?  It's certainly not in the words alone, but in Sufjan's really amazing ability to use music simultaneously to capture the general essence and to highlight the specifics of his poem.<br /><br />Take the piano part: it absolutely, categorically refuses to adhere to the beat, which is followed in a very straightforward manner in both the guitar and vocals.  The guitar and vocals are OUR minds--the narrator's, the observer's--watching Gacy from afar.  The piano, on the other hand, is Gacy's mind, the mind of the madman out of sync with the rest of the world.<br /><br />Significantly, though, both narrator and madman reach their musical climax at exactly the same point--roughly two-thirds through the composition (and here we have the golden mean)--during the line \\"He put a cloth. . .\\"  This is the moment of death for Gacy's faceless victim.  The piano reaches its highest note (tonic, if music analysis does anything for you), and the rest of the ensemble their loudest dynamic.  After the death, the volume and the piano line both fall; they are exhausted by the experience, spent.<br /><br />Sufjan can only take the briefest moment of denouement to consider what has happened: \\"I am really just like him.\\"  He has already shown us this musically by matching the madman and narrator's climax.  The almost unfathomable comparison has been made musically tangible, musically true, and the musical possibility of comparison makes the REAL possibility suggested in the poem's somber conclusion all the more frightening.

630521610X|5.0|I saw this movie a few days after Christmas in 1996 with my best friend. We got there early and with two other people, thought we were going to be the only ones in the theater. But as time went by the theater became packed and when the movie ended it was one of the most fun experiences in my lifetime attending the theater.  <br /> <br />The audience was in it right from the start: from Drew Barrymore's opening sequence to the revalation of who was responsible for the killings (I won't give it away for those who haven't seen it), the audience was hooked big time.  <br /> <br />Although I have the disc, it was extremely disappointing to not have the un-rated version. I actually owned the uncut laserdisc and although it's only about 3 minutes extra footage of the killings, fans should have an uncut anamorphic widescreen version of the film.  <br /> <br />Since this year marks the 10th anniversary of the picture's release: maybe Dimension Films will revisit it and give the ultimate edition to fans everywhere: uncut, with new audio commentary and a new retrospect of the trilogy.  <br /> <br />Scream still scares and enthralls after 10 years. Very recommended.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|if you ever liked Korn, Limp Bizkit, System of a Down, or any of those late-90s nu metal/metal bands... buy this album. go now. stop reading. shoo!<br /><br />okay, now that you HAVE the album, let me explain why you just bought it. \\"See You on the Other Side\\" is Korn returned to their most profitable roots. not all the way back to the days when their albums were more rage than music, but to roughly the sound you knew from \\"Follow the Leader;\\" the sound that catapulted their breakout onto the world stage. take \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" for example, here you have a rollicking good time of a song with Korn's original trademark make-you-jump-up-and-down-and-onto-your-friends crunchy guitar riffs. lots of foot-stomping good times to be found in this song and on this album. the wailing melodies of jon davis' pointed and often abrasive lyrics play off his stacatto vocal mymics of guitar and bass as beautifully as they did on \\"Freak on a Leash.\\" and the heavy thud of drums and bass add the kick to the gritty scratch of so many catchy riffs that you'll be tapping your feet and jamming on air guitar all day long. needless to say, if by the end of this new cd you haven't taken at least one turn of your living room stomping your feet, nodding your head, flailing your arms, and wishing you had something to break that you wouldn't have to pay for, you clearly weren't listening.<br /><br />still, \\"See You on the Other Side\\" isn't precisely a return to the once-ways of Korn. gone are the lyrics so filthy they'd make the boys from Slipknot or Bloodhound Gang sick to their stomachs. and gone are the collaborations with such notables as Snoop Dogg and Fred Durst; though you can see Snoop and some other high profile rappers of yester-year on the recently released video for \\"Twisted Transistor\\" (a must-watch on MTV, btw). i for one am thrilled at the demise of these two ubiquitous elements of previous Korn albums. i never really liked what Jon and the guys cut at their most filthy, or with their friends from other groups. Korn to me is about balling your angst up and tossing it out of your body like a shot-putter as you careen into other black-clad, pasty, thin, white boys packed like sardines in a huge concert hall. and that comes from the riffs, the drums, and - occassionally - jon's bagpipes. i was always disappointed when the songs turned appallingly dirty or included vocals by someone who just laid down a carpet of obscenity over which jon's lyrics could sometimes be discerned.<br /><br />so you can imagine my delight when the b-side of this album wasn't a hodge-podge of duets about homosexual band rivalries or hurting little boys. rather, it is a new forray for Korn into more heavily program-dependant music. now don't think i'm talking about a Static-X b-side here. This isn't \\"Wisconsin Death Trip\\" for all you closet techno lovers who feel entirely too white to learn how to rave. oh no, this is just Korn with a little electronic garnish. but trust me, you'll dig it.<br /><br />so there you have it. if you haven't added this item to your cart yet, i have but one question to ask: what are you waiting for?with their friends from other groups.

0800141660|5.0|A beautiful adaptation. I have read this book three times and am amazed by how wonderfully the story is told in only two hours. All of the actors are absolutely perfect for their parts, save that Emma Thompson may have been a bit old to be playing Elinor. However, her acting was so poignant and exquisite and perfectly subtle that it more than made up for it. Kate Winslet's Mary Anne is passionate and heartbreaking, and radiantly beautiful. I can't say enough about this movie and about those who wrote, directed, and starred in it. You'll love it!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|First of all, If you want to hear about the music, read one of the reviews below mine, or the spotlight review (they sum it up pretty darn well..30STM RULES). This is about the copy protected CD technology employed on this disc. <br /> <br />First of all, the idea is a very good one; A user-friendly application that automatically plays the album and even rips it to your computer for you with options as to the quality of the file you want to produce. I personally only rip CDs in Windows Media Audio Lossless, because I am a stickler for quality and I was happy to see that option in here. You can even copy the CD without a seprate burning utility! <br /> <br />Here is the clencher: For some reason it did not work on my particular computer. Granted, my computer sucks, but it was a real hastle to rip ABL. I ended up using my computer at work and then burning the ripped files to an audio CD and ripping them normally through WMP10. <br /> <br />The copy protection is more of a safeguard against stupid people making 9989084 copys of the CD, but anyone with half of a brain can bypass it VERY easily. <br /> <br />I consider it a faild attempt at Anti-piracy and a real insult to the general public. I personally plan on making 9989084 copys of the CD in my spare time and giving them out to all of my friends just because of the lengths that someone went to in order for this CD to be copy protected! :) <br /> <br />This album is totally worth the price and I reccomend it to everyone who even remotely likes modern rock music. <br /> <br />And seriously, anyone willing to cover a Björk song is worth listening to!
B000056HE9|2.0|**Spoiler alert**  <br />I greatly enjoy classic films, but something went wrong with this one. I agree with most of the glowing reviews of the fine acting, casting, music, and even the Christmas nostalgic feel.  But what ruins the enjoyment for me is the lack of finesse and attention to details I've seen in classics like \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\", and \\"Harvey\\".  \\"K-Pax\\" was far better at showing the fantastic, with some subtlety.   <br /> <br />The miracles are blatant, not subtle. Dudley calls everyone he meets by name, and no one reacts appropriately to this, or any of the other supernatural ocurrences.  The continual filling of the sherry glasses happens too many times, and refilling of the bottle is overused. The skating scene is ... without director restraint and almost silly. So was decorating the tree. Typing the sermon (pressing the keys from across the room?) made no sense, other than to show off.    <br /> <br />Obvious wizardry like we see in this film ... leaves no room for faith, for the viewer or the characters. And all the players that act as if these events are just strange, not fantastic, come across as dunces. Despite a fine premise, the groups of writers that reworked the story for film dropped the ball. I feel they wasted a superb opportunity with an intriguing plot, wonderful actors, and very good direction.  The only way I can recommend this film is like a shipwreck being a warning to other ships where the reef is.

B000FA57RG|4.0|While it is nice to listen to a slight part of the concert as it is missing most of her biggest hits in the program such as Frozen, Express Yourself, Burning Up, Material Girl, Bedtime Stories, Don't tell me, Papa Don't Preach and Crazy for You to the not so good re-invented Hanky Panky or Deeper & Deeper, nothing compares to being able to watch it.  I mean, Madonna is an MTV era star and missing one of the fifth senses is like reading just the odd pages in a book, and then, just 1/3rd of the book!  I was there, 12th row, center seats, so I can tell you this is a great show to watch, like all the others. <br /> <br />I've read before an agreement has not been reached to release the full concert, reason for making the documentary. Fans like me appreciate the 'extras' and certainly, the documentary can be considered a full extra...but not the whole enchilada. Please, please Madonna... RELEASE THE FULL DVD... Practice what is stated in your documentary... NO EGO... So settle please... And avoid disconnecting from your loyal fans from the past 23 years...!
B0002OERI0|2.0|Green Day is probably the most popular, most well known and liked rock group of this decade. Their music is played on virtually every radio station and TV channel; they have won nearly every music award there is to be won; their audiance ranges from Abercrombie wearing teenage girls to fifty year old men riding Harleys. Their message is clear: our country is seriously screwed up, Bush sucks and so does the War in Iraq, we're trillions of dollars in debt and Americans need to do something about it. All of this is true, and I give Green Day points for being so forward about their political beliefs, but that doesn't make up for all of their many problems.<br /><br />Green Day has made several big mistakes in their career. One, they contradict their own message. They murder corporate America and the American consumer who shops at Wal-Mart and spends way too much on a big, fancy house in the suburbs. Well, that's all well and good, but guess what Green Day? Your albums are sold at Wal-Mart and corporate mainstream America is the one who's buying them and making Billy Joe rich enough to buy all of his eyeliner and the make-up artist to apply it for him! The people that he's bashing are the ones who have made him so darn rich and famous. Let's face it: Green Day is being played on MTV and their music appeals to the mainstream masses. In other words, they're an enormous corporate sellout that is funding American consumerism.
6304806426|5.0|Ralph Fiennes plays the handsome Hungarian Count Laszlo Almassy who is a quiet, intense, sensitive educated man. His complicated life is unraveled thread by thread in this deeply inspiring, adventurous and biographical film about love and survival. He awakens in a British hospital without identification and is simply called \\"the English patient\\". His face is scarred beyond recognition, his hands are contracted from scar tissue ... The haunting exotic lyrics to the song \\"Szerelem Szerlem\\" (Love Love) as sung by Marta Sebestyen is heard occasionally throughout the film. It very appropriately symbolizes the basis of his actions and life story. Count Almassy demonstrates courage, resourcefulness, and integrity when he does everything in his power to keep is word and rescue the life of the woman he loves, Katherine Clifton played by Juliette Binochet. In the end, whatever he did was just not enough ... yet he survived.<br /><br />The film begins in Indiana Jones fashion, the cinematography is outstanding as two biplanes fly over mountains and sand dunes ... visible as far as the eye can see. The views are stupendous! Count Almassy is a pilot who leads a British group to some mountains which were described by a Bedouin. They discover a cave which has magnificent archeological value: simple drawings on the walls of ancient man's activities ... Katherine Clifton, the wife of a British mapmaker, is captivated and makes drawings which she offers to Laszlo Almassy. There is an interesting tension between them which later in the film develops into intense feelings of love upon which most of the story is based. Other memories surface of the sand dunes, Count Almassy is rescued by Bedouins who cover his burned face with a wet cloth, wrap his body in a blanket, place him on an immmobilizer and transport him to their camp where they treat his wound with unguent and herbal remedies, essentially saving his life ...<br /><br />The story line unfolds in different time segments, as the memories of the English patient awaken ... this makes the film especially interesting and provides unique perspectives and reveals his life story in a more suspense-filled and intriguing manner. After World War II is declared over, he is transported in Italy by the Allies ... prior to crossing bridges and along the roads, several soldiers check for buried unexploded land-mines left by the enemy. Hanna who is the nurse caring for the English patient lends money to a girlfriend who happily joins a group that will celebrate in town. Within minutes, her jeep explodes from a bomb which kills all the passengers. Hannah is so overcome by her friend's death she runs to the site and starts walking to the wreck ... the mine sweepers stop her so she is not injured right after she retrieves her friend's gold bracelet.<br /><br />After the explosion, Hanna (Kristin Scott Thomas) wants to settle in a monastery she spied on a hillside to care for the English patient until help arrives to rescue them. She talks the mobile hospital unit into moving him into one of the empty rooms of the bombed out building. They leave her to her ministrations. The English patient has a book which he cherishes. It is filled with a few items and momentoes of his past life. He opens up and talks about his life to Hannah as she asks him about the significance of his souvenirs. He reveals his deep relationship with Catherine and how it developed ... They acquire another guest Carravegio, a self-described thief who knew one of Hanna's nurse friends and who comes to learn the identity of the English patient. His original plans were to strangle the English patient, whom he suspected was a German spy but after he learned the circumstances of why he had given maps to the Germans his feelings for revenge evaporated. The thief described his experiences during the war which included some graphic torture scenes (I had to close my eyes, I just could not watch it) ...<br /><br />Hanna is shown to be a vulnerable sensitive nurse who needs to feel love and companionship. She develops a relationship with one of the Sikh soldiers named Kip who was a minesweeper. One of the most beautiful scenes in the films is when Kip rigs a pulley system with a seat to show her the artistic murals on the walls of a local church ... However, after Kip's coworker and minesweeper friend dies in an explosion, he withdraws into himself and the relationship with Hanna dissolves. Hanna begins to accept that at times she needs to just let go of people about whom she cares and loves. She learns to accept it is not within her power to correct and solve every problem. This is a very powerful film that touches many emotions within the viewer. It shows how the human spirit can overcome many adversities when the power of love is unleashed.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|This movie is quite spectacular and has many things to recommend it. Unfortunately, it has many flaws as well. The great Homer epic still waits for a filmmaker who can do it justice. On balance, though, Wolfgang Petersen's version is worth seeing. I liked the sword fights, particularly the one between Achilles and Hector. I've practiced a form of fencing myself, and I must say that Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did bring the legendary heroes to life! This is exactly how two strong, skillful, reckless young man would fight it out. It was 100% believable, which is very rare in movies.  As an extra bonus, the armor was believable too -- modeled after Greek pottery art.  Achilles shield, however, was very disappointing. According to legend, it was made by Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths, and the Iliad devotes pages to its description. One would expect a glorious recreation on the screen, but alas. Hollywood's main goal was to keep production costs low and make a crowd pleaser for profit. The effort to please the female audience is especially transparent. So, Brad Pitt strips on several occasions and almost lets a slave girl cut his throat to prove a philosophical point. The hero of heroes, craving for glory on the battlefield, doesn't mind to be slain in bed by a woman... Ha!!  This made me think how each culture reinterprets the stories of the past through the beliefs of the present. The Iliad glorifies the ideals of bronze-age Greece, where a hero's worth was measured by how many men he slew and how many women he raped. There are perhaps a hundred battles in the Iliad and only one family scene. In the movie we have three battles and three love stories, one of which (Achilles and Briseis) is totally made up. At the same time, the moving parting scene of Hector and Andromache gets perhaps 30 seconds on screen. Peter O'Toole delivers an outstanding performance as the old King Priam, whose submission to the will of the gods comes straight from the Iliad. In Homer's tale, theoutcome of the war ultimately depended on which Olympian god was allowed by Zeus to interfere the most. In the movie, the gods exist only in the human mind, and rather mockingly at that.  Nietzsche said gods die when people stop believing in them. This movie demonstrates that the Olympians are dead today. I wonder, will the jealous god of Abraham suffer a similar fate in some future age?

B000F7CMRM|5.0|Everything is about oil, one way or another in this movie and this movie packs a wallop. George Clooney (From Dusk Till Dawn, Solaris), brilliant as ever here, plays Bob Barnes, a CIA Agent who is used by the CIA for the war on Middle East terrorism. The very start of this movie sucks you in and when that bomb goes off, it gets better and better as it goes along.. Clooney even gets kidnapped in one scene, gagged, rolled into a bag and the he is tortured by getting his fingernails pulled out..wow. Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy), in another great performance and makes up for his damn horrid role in Brothers Grimm, plays Bryan Underwood, an Energy Analyst who has two sons and a wife Julie, played by Amanda Peet (Something's Gotta Give, Saving Silverman). Damon gets invited to the house of two princes and their father, one Prince being Nasir, played by Alexander Siddig (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Reign Of Fire) in a superb performance, and at this party Damon loses one of his sons....so Damon uses this to get into business with Prince Nasir. There's a intense scene where Clooney flags dog Prince Nasir on a highway...it'll blow you away. Meanwhile, Bennett Holiday, played by a knockout Jeffrey Wright (Shaft, Ride With the Devil), is a lawyer who is trying to merge to Texas Oil Companies, the big one Connex and the Small one Killen, which is run by Chris Cooper (Jarhead, Adaptation). The cinematography and landscapes are fantastic and they look beautiful on film and Gaghan gives another great masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year. Syriana blazes. Also starring Christopher Plummer (The New World, National Treasure), William Hurt (A History Of Violence, Changing Lanes) and Tim Blake Nelson (Minority Report, O Brother Where Art Thou?). Clooney one the Best Supporting Actor Award for his role as Bob Barnes. <br />
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Her voice is a sweet twist of Nelly Furtado and Billie Holiday. You've gotta see this girl perform live, it's amazing how natural and comfortable she looks. Her lyrics are endearing and she uses thoughtful comparisons, \\"like oil in my hands\\" and \\"blue as the sky, sombre and lonely\\". Standout tracks: 'Til it Happens to You, Choux Pastry Heart, and Put Your Records On. Her songs touch on acoustic, blues, pop, and folk with gorgeous melodies and dulcet high notes. Tender looks, a posh British accent, and angelic voice, I can see this girl going places.
B000002UJQ|5.0|but I do. Let me start by saying that I'm a big big Green Day, Ramones, Clash, and Foo Fighters fan, to name a few. But I also like softer bands such as AVA, The Verve and Coldplay, which eventually led me to Radiohead. OK Computer seemed to be the most raved about, so I got hold of a copy and didn't know what to expect. OK Computer has been the most difficult album for me to grasp. <br /> <br />But there's something about it that makes you want to keep listening. The music is very deep and layered, and Thom's \\"whiney\\" voice shines. The overall tone of the album is dreamy, but there are some rockers on here to be found. <br /> <br />But this music is only enjoyable to those who have the patience and intelligence to listen, and listen closely, to the underlying meanings of the songs, if any. People who give this album 1 star are obviously only looking for radio-friendly songs that have maybe 1 catchy riff in them. Radiohead does not deserve 1 star, especially for OK Computer, their masterpiece.  <br /> <br />So if you're going to start with Radiohead, OK Computer is where I'm starting. And please note that Radiohead is not a band that's going to automaticly click with you. You almost have to adapt to them, which isn't a bad thing once you have. <br /> <br />Favorites so far: Airbag, Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Climbing Up The Walls, The Tourist. <br /> <br />Thank you for your time, and keep listening!!! <br /> <br />
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Robert Downey, Jr. (The Singing Detective, Two Girls and a Guy) stars as Harry Lockhart who is a thief and who narrates the story. While trying to steal something he stumbles into an acting audition where he wins them over and winds up at a big party where he finds the girl he loved way back when in School Harmony played by the delicious Michelle Monaghan (Mission: Impossible 3, North Country). Lockhart winds up in a situation involving a dead girl with private detective Gay Perry played by the rock solid Val Kilmer (The Doors, Spartan). Lockhart takes interest in Harmony when he finds out that her sister was murdered and she asks him to help her so he does that. Kilmer and Downey, Jr. give fantastic performances as does the gorgeous Monaghan in this great film which deliver some outrageous hilarious moments and yes I'm talking about the peeing scene which I admit I laughed.  Not for  all tastes but surely a look if you're fans of the actors. Also starring Corbin Bernsen (Carpool Guy, General Hospital), Shannyn Sossamon (The Order, Rules of Attraction), Larry Miller (Carnival of Souls, Best in Show) and Dash Mihok (Dark Blue, The Thine Red Line). \\"Don't worry, I saw Lord of the Rings. I'm not going to end this 17 times\\"

0140177396|5.0|By far, one of the best books ever written. I felt as if I was in the book taking part of the adventure. John Steinbeck has made it clear that he is among the elite writers in the margin between William Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe.  <br /> <br />The feeling you get is indescribable when you read this book. The story of when George and Lennie will have their own land, and Lennie could finally raise rabbits - just gives you your own sense of liberty.  <br /> <br />Please, if you are sensitive and/or depressed, be aware. This book is great, but very depressing.
B00006SFLV|2.0|Contrary to what a recent reviewer (from the UK) said, cheap DVD sets from the UK are bootleg, not original, and their video quality is terrible. Still, they gave me an opportunity to watch this series, which I'd only recently become interested in. The series itself is curiously disappointing, as some other reviewers have said.    I grew up long before the 90s, and I see little if anything of myself in it. I can't speak for the millions who do, but they've already spoken for themselves. For me it's just entertainment, and one way I evaluate entertainment is by how much I care about what happens.    On the surface, My So-Called Life seems to be full of honesty and intelligence. Production values are impressive. I was enchanted after watching the pilot. But after several more episodes I discovered that I'd stopped caring what happened to any of the characters. I was actually bored with and tired of them all.    The only thing left that was mildly interesting was the erotic charge between Angela and Jordan, the Claire Danes and Jared Leto characters. But even that felt more like something between vampires than living people. It's not love. It has no potential. Nothing could grow out of it. They're more like Louis and Lestat than Juliet and Romeo.    The fact that I'm judging this as if it were a movie instead of a broadcast network TV series says a lot for it. As a TV series it is indeed remarkable and would be even more so today. It's just kind of hollow. It's polished and often clever, but there's very little substance.
B000FILW86|5.0|Cheap Trick is back on top as the kings of Beatlesque Power Pop.  I have all the old Cheap Trick albums as well as most of the newer stuff and middle period.  After their first 5 or so records they went downhill.  Who could have imagined that they could come back with this powerful, melodic record?  But they did!  This is better than the over-rated \\"Cheap Trick 1997\\" and \\"Special One\\".  This is better than every album back to \\"Budakon\\".  The allmusic.com review is pretty on the mark.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|Rihanna is back with her second album in less than a year which is pretty much unheard of in today's industry.  Her first album Music of The Sun displayed a lot of potential with songs such as Pon de Replay, You Don't Love Me, The Last Time, and Willing To Wait.  Contrary to popular belief, Rihanna really shined on the ballads and midtempos rather than the uptempo tracks.  Recognizing this fact, the second album leans heavily on the ballads and midtempos and it really works.  Some people don't like Rihanna's voice and compare her to Beyonce ( 0which it seems like everyone that comes out female is somehow a Beyonce clone in some way shape or form)...I don't believe any of that; she doesn't sound like Beyonce and she doesn't make songs like Beyonce.  People need to get over it. <br /> <br />Back to the album, A Girl Like Me is a good listen and manages to give a good mix of slow jams (Unfaithful, PS Im Still Not Over You, Million Miles Away, Title song), dance tunes (Break It Off, SOS, If it's Lovin), and grooves (We Ride, Dem Haters, Crazy Thing).  I really like the songwriting on this album too especially Unfaithful.  The album is just the right length at 13 tracks and enough gems throughout to keep you interested.  I would say that this album is a bit of a mood album meaning I can't just sit and listen to it but it's still a good effort especially coming from Rihanna.  This album is a step up from her debut album and if she keeps progressing she'll soon be a real force to reckon with.  3.5 stars.
0783225547|5.0|Amazing! i saw it once on television and couldnt resist buying it. Mainly because i am fascintated with disasters and i love learning about them. So i really anjoyed this! And the volcano was very realistic, halfly taken from the real eruption back in the 80's when the actual volcano erupted.<br /><br />Anyone that is into these films will love this!

Track 9, based on the cue \\"Rupert Bear\\" from Gabriel Yared's score for \\"The English Patient\\", and Track 10, based on the cue \\"On Earth As It Is in Heaven\\" from Ennio Morricone's score for \\"The Mission\\".  Being both a fan of film scores and Sarah Brightman, these lovely tracks stand as my favorites from \\"Eden\\".
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|Ooh, this is innovative metal that draws influence from punk rock, power metal, and melodeath? Do tell. What I hear is more watered-down metalcore that does little to deviate from the \\"Gothenburg + crappy hardcore\\" niche the genre dug itself in long ago. Although the two guitarists are competent, their masturbatory fretboard duelling adds nothing to the songs' structures, which are little more than montages of the music each member of the band enjoys. This band puts the \\"overrated\\" back in [finish pun yourself].<br /><br />For better current American metal, check out Nevermore, Cephalic Carnage, High on Fire, Mastodon, Dillinger Escape Plan, Soilent Green, etc.
B000066C4V|5.0|The upperclass friends and relations of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) arrive at his country house for a weekend of shooting, accompanied by maids, footmen, and valets, all of whom will be staying under one roof. Sir William is a mean-spirited and self-centered old man, married to a much younger, emotionally distant wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), with many family members dependent upon his continuing largesse. The hilariously waspish Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), who believes she has a lifetime stipend, arrives with young Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald), who is trying valiantly to become a good lady's maid. Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), a Hollywood star, and Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), a producer of Charlie Chan movies, are the only guests without aristocratic backgrounds and inherited privilege. The atmosphere of the house, filled with venomous \\"friends\\" and relations, soon becomes even more poisonous.<br /><br />The \\"below stairs\\" lives of the servants are also fully revealed, as they share living quarters, eat meals together, tend to the laundry and cooking, and gossip about their employers. The butler Jennings (Alan Bates) and the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren) run the household and try to guarantee that no real-world cares will intrude upon the lives of their employers. Since \\"upstairs\\" and \\"downstairs\\" occasionally meet very privately at night, secrets abound, many of them secrets of long standing. When Sir William is poisoned and stabbed (\\"Trust Sir William to be murdered twice\\"), nearly everyone has a motive for wanting him dead.<br /><br />For director Robert Altman, the primary focus of the film is on the characters, their way of life, and their values, with the murder mystery secondary. Set in late November, the end of the year 1932, the action takes place when this secure aristocratic lifestyle is also nearing its end, something that the arrival of the newly rich Hollywood characters, Novello and Weissman, illustrates. Dramatic cinematography (by Andrew Dunn) emphasizes the cold and rainy dreariness of the weekend, and suggests parallels with the coldness of the dying aristocracy.<br /><br />Interior shots reveal the contrasts between the elegant and mannered lives of the \\"upstairs\\" characters and the hardworking daily lives of the \\"downstairs\\" characters, who adhere to their own rigid social codes. Every detail rings true, and as the characters' lives and interrelationships are revealed obliquely in brief snippets of seemingly unrelated conversations, a broad picture of the upstairs and downstairs lifestyles gradually emerges. Fully developed, many-leveled, wonderfully acted, often funny, and impeccably directed and filmed, this is a film one can watch again and again with delight.

B000FQJAIW|3.0|The review is for the DVD, as I own the 2004 editions already, and obviously have seen the theatrical release numerous times.  I don't want to join the cacophany of others who whose only sentiment seems to be that lucas can do nothing right.  I (mostly) liked Episode I and (less so) episode II, and enjoyed III quite a bit.  I don't see much problem with the new editions of IV-VI.  What issues I have with them are minor and limited mostly to the additional scenes.  I happen to prefer the \\"polishing\\" that so many purists (gag) took issue with. <br /> <br />I would also like to own a copy of the original theatrical releases on DVD, but I don't want to have to buy or download bootlegs to get them.  But I simply don't want to buy the same product once again in a \\"limited edition\\".  I frankly don't know if I'll buy these.  Even putting aside picture and sound quality issues, relegating landmark film classics to a bonus feature on a DVD seems blatantly disrespectful.  It is, however, in keeping with Lucasfilm's recently adopted tradition of being unable to offer anything without the taint of crass commercialism; i.e. accompanying announcements of DVD releases on the official website with announcements for video games or Lego's.   <br /> <br />What would I like to see?  The same thing every reasonable fan would settle for at this point.  Decent transfers of the original films in their own dedicated set, anamorphic, maybe some cool artwork on the cover.  I don't think that's too much to ask.  Yeah, George...it's cool when you give us what we ask for.  Could you please not slap us in the face as you do it?
B00004YKUY|3.0|Being the Journey addict I am, I had to finally break down and buy this album.  I've got to admit it's better than their most recent release Generations (then again, so is a kick in the teeth -- i.e. Generations SUCKS).  Still  missing the inimitable style and soul of Steve Perry.  Augeri's got a nice tenor range; so he can hold  his own, but his lyrics are pretty junior high school lame.  And he sings along with the songs rather than leading them the way my man Steve Perry did.  Anyway, this is the least offensive of the Journey/Augeri endeavor.  And, being a guitar player, I always enjoy listening to Neal Schon's mastery.  Jonathan Caine's piano cuts through the mix nicely.  So overall, not too bad -- just not as good as anything they ever did with Steve Perry.
B000FA57RG|3.0|This is really bad. Madonna spends her time preaching to us what many of us already know. We all asked questions on why we are here. We all know that material things is not the path to enlightment. We all know that are more important things in life than our ego, pride, and etc. We all know the conflict in the Middle East needs to stop. But Madonna does not give her fans any credit for knowing these things. There are artists who truly tries to make the world a better place with their work (both professionally and personally), but Madonna is not one of those artists. This boring documentary's purpose is to promote  Kabbalah and to show her as a proper British lady. It doesn't matter because it all comes across as pretentious. The concert portion is what you really want and what saves this dvd from failure. <br /> <br />As for the cd, I enjoyed it more except for the fact that she is lipsynching on some or most of the songs. She is singing live on \\"Lament\\" and the tone and power of her voice will give you goose bumps. When Madonna feels a song, she is capable of selling that song just as any of the powerhouse female vocalists. Another plus is the rock demo version of \\"I Love New York\\". It is better than the version on Confession, which is probably why Madonna decided to include the song in this collection. <br /> <br />If you are a Madonna fan, make the investment to buy this dvd/cd combo, but be warned that Madonna's secrets are nothing special.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I'm anxiously waiting for the uncut extended edition to be released, so I can pair it up with my unrated extended cut of the first film. I hope I don't have to wait too long! In the meantime, I'll give this film 4 stars based on how much I like the original. I want the studio to realize that there are many of us who are jumping to buy the uncut extended version. So perhaps this will be helpful to the studio execs. As for DVD buyers who are contemplating purchasing this first theatrical edition, perhaps they will appreciate the fact that it was worth waiting for the unrated extended cut of the first film. <br />
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I thought this was a great cd. The music is mellow and will probably stay in my cd player. I think sometimes we get so used to \\"garbage\\" music, that we won't give a true artist a real chance. I love \\"trouble sleeping\\" especially.
0440416027|5.0|David Almond's Skellig is one of those books that make you believe in such things as angels. I read this book about three years ago, and enjoyed it so much that I still call it one of my favourites.  <br /> <br />The book is about a boy named Michael, who has booked into a house with a run-down garage. He's not allowed to go in there, but boys being boys, he does, and in there he finds a man named Skellig, who requests (correct me if I'm wrong -- three years is a long time) 27 and 53. Michael, being the clever boy that he is, figures it out, and the relationship grows from there. <br /> <br />Michael's next door neighbour is Mina, who is home-schooled, and spends her days learning about William Blake's poetry, making birds out of clay, and drawing. She is the one who teaches Michael (and us) to appreciate all the wonderful little things in life. <br /> <br />This book, although aimed for children, or early teens, is suitable for older readers, too. In my humble opinion, it is never too late to start looking for the miracles that -- you never know! -- might actually exist. <br /> <br />The book is beautifully written. Its characters are tender and lovable, the story heart-wrenching and heart-warming at the same time, and the style of the book is easy and poetic, very moving and imaginative.  <br /> <br />I will definitely read this book again and again, and it will always be one of my all-time favourites.
B000002LND|4.0|I have a theory on \\"greatest hits\\" albums that goes something like this: the more substantial an artist is, and the greater their albums are, the more pointless their greatest hits compilations are likely to be (Just check out the essentially inane greatest hits albums by Stevie Wonder or The Beatles to see what I'm talking about).  And, the inverse is also true, the less substantial the artist, the more important their greatest hits compilations are.  \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilations can be great for introducing someone to artists that they are not familiar with, but with whole albums you get to see the artists' original vision, and I've found that they are usually more rewarding for the listener in the long run (the good ones anyway).  But for some artists, the \\"greatest hits\\" compilation may be the only thing in their catalog worth buying (there are quite a few artists out there that have a few great songs on really crappy albums).  Now that I'm done pontificating, I must say that that is not exactly the case with Madonna because she does have more in her catalog that could be worth discovering, and as an artist she is often more genuine than she normally gets credit for. Yet still, this collection is likely the best buy in her catalog.  This compilation pretty much plays like a good album (helped greatly by both the fact that the songs are sequenced in chronological order, and the fact that the production qualities are so similar throughout).  Few would argue against Madonna's cultural significance (she is likely the biggest pop star of the 80's, challenged only by Michael Jackson), and despite her tendency to use controversy to get attention, she is actually a decent songwriter (I don't care what anyone says :-).  But, unless you are a diehard album completist (with a strong interest in Madonna's work) or you're really into her work from the 90's and beyond (which I think, with just a few exceptions, has actually grown more and more insubstantial, despite the factthat it supposes to have more would-be \\"artistic cred\\" on the surface) you will likely be content with having this as the only selection from her catalog. As I said earlier, I actually think that some of her material is more substantial than she normally gets credit for (unlike the complete drivel being made by the bubblegum pop starlets who have followed and tried to emulate her), but no serious musician or music fan would ever mistake her for a monumental artist.  But, every artist doesn't have to be, and her contemplative songs can still be quite touching (Live to Tell) and her up-tempo stuff can be a whole lot of fun (Holiday!)or even a cross between the two (\\"Borderline\\" would be a perfect example of this).  I've heard many of her 80's albums and they're all at least solid efforts.  This album takes the best from each of them (save for maybe just a few omissions) and puts them on a single CD  It's a plus that this compilation includes the slightly remixed version of \\"Express Yourself\\" which is actually superior to the album version as far as I'm concerned, but the same can't be said for \\"Like a Prayer\\"-the album version of this track is much better.  And, the fact that her funkiest dance song ever, \\"Into the Groove\\" from the soundtrack for \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\", is included sure doesn't hurt this album's purchase worthiness (I do however agree with the reviewer who said that \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Who's that Girl\\" should have been included here in place of \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\", which should have been placed on her next album instead).  If you have a passing interest in Madonna's work, or in 80's pop culture in general, then you should definitely give this collection a listen.
B00003CXD0|5.0|I loved this movie and watch it whenever it's on TV.  I refuse to buy a copy because that somehow makes it less special than just happening on it while channel surfing.      I do not particularly like Dustin Hoffman - he's a great actor but he just never quite does it for me.  BUT I love him in Tootsie.  Actually, I differentiate between Tootsie and Michael Dorsey.  As Michael Dorsey Hoffman is okay; as Toosie he is superlative.  And I make the distinction because this is the only cross-dressing film where I totally buy into the reality of the character.  The role of Tootsie is the part of lifetime -and Hoffman is outstanding in it.  He has us laughing, crying, cheering, and even producing outrage.  We sympathize with his rejection by Jessica Lange (she's not a lesbian) and wait anxiously for Bill Murray's \\"You [...]\\" in response to Tootsie's almost rape by her plummy co-star in the soap opera.    Every actor in this film is perfect - from cameos by Sydney Pollack (director) as Michael Dorsey's agent to Terri Garr as the confused and desperate actress/girlfriend to Bill Murray as the slightly spacy roommate.  And there's Dabney Coleman and Charles Durning and Jessica Lange.  And best of all - Dustin Hoffman IS Tootsie, maybe even more than he is Michael Dorsey.
B00003CXV4|5.0|Sweet November (2001, Warner Bros. Pictures) is a touching movie to watch. I really enjoyed it. The end brought me to tears. Sweet November teaches the importance of the simpler things in life. The film portrays values toward people and relationships. Sweet November isn't a movie with loads of glamour or special effects, but the story and characters will emotionally touch you. <br /> <br />Nelson Moss is an advertising executive. He isn't able to see anything past his busy career. Nelson has it all - total control of his fast-pace life. Everything changed the day Nelson crossed paths with the spontaneous, attractive and good-natured Miss Sara Deever. Nelson's life began a downward spiral. He lost his job after a blowup during a presentation for a client at work. Upon returning home, Nelson's girlfriend bid him farewell. Being a work-a-holic, Nelson's job was his life. Nelson is having a difficult time accepting his current situation.  <br /> <br />Sara pries into Nelson's life. Sara has a special gift, helping men with problems. She brings Nelson into her home and into her life for the month of November. For one month, she will dedicate herself to Nelson so he could learn to live a more meaningful life. Why a month? It's long enough to make an impact without having to become too emotionally attached. Sara's life circumstances prevent her from making a lifetime commitment to anyone. Considering Sara's secret illness, she prevents herself from a lifelong commitment to anyone. <br /> <br />Sweet November helps us see what life is meant to be about, to cherish our time with each other. We can't always predict how much time we have left in life, so it is important to live life each day to the fullest. <br />
B000003TAB|4.0|After taking over the world with the success of their major label debut 'Nevermind' more people were interested in the trios earlier work (even though their first album bleach was still unpopular at the time) To capatilize off the success of 'Nevermind' Nirvana released a Odds N' Sods collection of unreleased songs. How is this compliation read on and find out.  <br /> <br />First of all don't buy this expecting to hear 'Nevermind' keep in mind it's a compliation it doesn't hold as an album and it's all over the place from their earlier bleach sound(\\"Downer, \\"Hairspray Queen\\") to stuff that could have been on 'Nevermind' (Been a Son, Sliver). Such tracks as \\"Beeswax\\", \\"Mexican Seasfood\\", and \\"Hairspray Queen\\" have very sludgey and grunge elements in the music at first they don't sound so attractive and will take a couple listen to get used to. Other songs like \\"Sliver\\" have a pop element and will hook you on the first listen with it's chorus. The band also covers the Vaselines' \\"Molly's Lips\\" and \\"Son of a Gun\\" the cover are great they don't surpass the oringinals but they are pretty good. they also do Devo's \\"Turnaround\\" which is another fairly decent cover. The final song \\"Aneurysm\\" is Nirvana's most regonized as best song in their catalogue it is also in my opinion one of the greatest songs ever. <br /> <br />Overall this is a great compliation for fans but, don't buy this unless your really a Nirvana fan and you've heard their earlier and later stuff which will give you a chances to apperciate this. If your a Nirvana fan don't hesistate to put this in your collection. Highly Recommanded
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Yes, it is a children's movie, but it's really good. It's funny and interesting to watch. It's a different way of telling the fairy tales. The graphics are good. The movie itself is worth watching. <br /> <br />
B00005UW9T|5.0|this is a traditional \\"disney musical\\" (though it was really done by fox) theres the hero (Anastasia) his or her sidekick (Vladimir and the dog) and the love interest (Dimitri) the girl and guy start hating each other but end up falling in love and of course the bad guy (Rasputin)....classic disney musical <br /> <br />this show has REALLY catchy music which is greatly sung and orchestrated...so if u watch it as a disney musical is supposed to be watched (no background, not caring if it's corny at times etc.) then you will love it...if you overanalyze it by going into how it's not historically accurate you will not like this movie at all....but if u watch it like you would Cats or Lion King (because animals can't really sing and talk :P ) then you will ADORE this movie!!

0743424425|4.0|When I first picked up this book I was extremely dissapointed by it. King's wordy and extremely descriptive writing style were a slight turn off for me...in the beginning. However, the second time I tried reading it I actually stuck with the story and I realized that King's descriptions are actually his literary brilliance. He describes the characters in great detail, and as the plot goes on, you are able to see how the Overlook changes them and the way they think. This is the really chilling part of the story- how easily the characters are rattled. You see the gradual demise of Jack Torrance, and how the Hotel gradually, subtley, eats away at his sanity. In the end, Jack, not the ghosts, is what is truly terrifying. His demise is actually relative to a lot of people as well. Although maybe not attacked by an evil hotel, people everyday are being pressured into doing things they don't want to do, by an \\"outside evil\\".  <br />   However, I was slightly dissapointed. I was expecting more ghosts and scary scenes leading up to the climax. I was expecting to see more of Grady and his family as well. In the end, however, the book is a masterpiece, and its easy to see that King has amazing talent.
B000002BYD|5.0|Since releasing their self-titled album, which I think is their best album since \\"Ten\\", <br />I decided to go back into the Pearl Jam catalogue and check out their other stuff. \\"Yield\\" is a promising album, despite the drummer is Jack Irons (who's good but not as good as Matt Cameron), and it starts off promisingly. For some reason the last few songs just didn't me as hard as the first ones did. \\"Wishlist\\" & \\"Pilate\\" are two PJ classics and Eddie's lyrics are top notch (although there are some lyrics here by Jeff Ament & Stone Gossard as well). I do like this album enough to buy, but check out the new album, Ten, Vs., or Vitalogy first. Here are the tracks: <br /> <br />1. Brain of J-5/5-This song is really catchy and good. It's simalar to the song \\"Life Wasted\\" off their new album, but it's good album opener. <br />2. Faithfull-5/5-This song is catchy as well and has some interesting lyrics. <br />3. No Way-5/5-This song has some great lyrics; The lyrics are better than the song itself and the best part of the song is the chorus. <br />4. Given to Fly-5/5-I love the lyrics to this song, but this is a great song period. <br />5. Wishlist-5/5-This is one of my favorite Pearl Jam songs, it's so cool and Eddie sings it perfectly. <br />6. Pilate-5/5-This is another one of my favorite PJ songs. The song was written by Jeff Ament and is such a simple song but it's really good. \\"Like Pilate, I have a dog.\\" <br />7. Do the Evolution-3/5-I know that this is one of their hit songs, but I really don't like this song that much...It's kind of annoying. <br />8. *-5/5-A kind of semi-drum solo weird thing done by then-drummer Jack Irons. It's pretty cool, although it's just a filler. <br />9. MFC-4/5-This song is really short and not that great. <br />10. Low Light-3/5-This song's like the last two, it's just OK. Nothing really stands out about it. <br />11. In Hiding-5/5-This songs a lot better than the last few songs, but it's still not a PJ masterpiece. <br />12. Push Me, PullMe-2/5-This song totally sucks. It's not even a song, it's Eddie talking with a bad musical background. <br />13. All Those Yesterdays-4/5-This song has to grow on you. It's start off bad and gets better as it progresses. There's an instrumental hidden track directly following this song, which is quite good though. <br /> <br />GRADE: B+ <br />
B00005JNRY|5.0|I took my kid (age 6) to see \\"Cars\\" last week, not really knowing what to expect.  I've never been into racing, but was attracted by the concept (anyone else remember the shortlived cartoon \\"Wheelie\\"?).  Both of us were able to connect with the humor right away, which like the diverse characters in this film spans several generations.  The concept of a world populated entirely by inanimate vehicles (mostly cars, but a tractor or train here and there) is a relatively original one on the big screen, and the studio must have had a lot of fun with this one.      Character development was terrific--just as each make and model of vehicle has its own technical characteristics in real life, each personality in \\"Cars\\" has its own talents and quirks.  The plot revolves around rookie racer Lightning McQueen, who is part of a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup, and must cross the country to Los Angeles where there will be a tie-breaker between himself, dependable veteran The King, and perpetual second-placer Chick Hicks.      Along the road to Los Angeles, Lightning McQueen's selfishness is the cause of an unintended detour to a little town called Radiator Springs.  Radiatior Springs is a nifty village on route 66 complete with chrome and neon styling that the new interstate left off the map years ago.  Characters include the older and wiser Doc Hudson (Hornet), who has a secret past and manages to mentor Lighting McQueen and teach him a thing or two.  Sally is a Porsche who left fast-paced Los Angeles to settle down in Radiator Springs and open a Motel. 'Mater is the town's friendly (if rusty) towtruck with a true sense of country humor.  Flo runs the service station, Ramon the Paint and Detail shop (always with a new coat!), Luigi the tire store...There really is something for everyone, including a running humorous dialogue between \\"Sarge\\", an Army-regulation olive drab AMC Jeep who runs the local military surplus shop, and Fillmore, a '60's VW Bus with a psychadelic paint job.I'm not going to give away too much detail, I don't want to spoil the experience for fellow viewers.  My kid loved this film and understood the humor.  There were a lot of laugh out loud moments for the both of us.  As a parent, I liked the lessons \\"Cars\\" taught about ethics, hard work, respect, kindness, keeping your word, and the importance of friendship.  Not to mention appreciating things that aren't necessarily brand new or in the fast lane!  A cute movie, fun for the whole family, a reminder that the best things in life are sometimes hidden off the main thoroughfare.  Oh, and hang around past the credits--you WILL be rewarded with the punch line for an earlier gag!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I think the title of this review says it all, but this is truly a spectacular movie. In retrospect, it's like a guns version of the Johnny Depp movie \\"Blow.\\" <br />Actually in more ways than one. Both films are about men who begin working in illegal businesses while making vast sums of money and watching their dream come true; And then watch their lives crumble around them with time. Also both films received good reviews and featured Oscar worthy performances and scripts but were ignored by the Academy. Nicolas Cage takes a break from playing his loser character (Matchstick Men, The Weather Man, etc.) and instead plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian man who was raised in Brooklyn. Yuri realizes one day that doing what he's been doing isn't working for him, so with the help of his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto, 'Requiem for a Dream') he becomes a private gunrunner delivering to people in places like Sierra Leone, Russia, and Liberia. Meanwhile, Yuri also marries his dream girl Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan, who looks completely different then she did in the movies 'The Recruit' and 'I, Robot') and has a son. The movie says at the end \\"Based on Real Events,\\" which means nothing...I doubt that a man named Yuri Orlov existed but that doesn't make this film any more or less interesting. Writer/Director Andrew Niccol paints a near perfect portrait of a troubled, yet brilliant man who's trying to support his family and make money no matter who or what he risks. This is one of Nicolas Cage's best performances since \\"Leaving Las Vegas.\\" Both Eathan Hawke (That dude who was married to Uma Thurman) and Ian Holm ('From Hell') deliver good supporting work; Especially Hawke who plays an Interpol agent chasing Yuri for years and never truly getting what he wants. The movie presents a great message, something young viewers won't notice sadly enough. This is not only one of the most morally terrific movies of 2005, but it was also one of the best and most overlooked. If you haven't seen thismovie, then just do it. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />
B000000WFF|5.0|I'm giving this cd 5 stars, so I must still like the Spice Girls.  My obsession died down a little since grade nine.  I'm 23 and I have no shame in saying that I think I'm getting into the Spice Girls again.  Anyways, Spiceword is an awesome album, with some catchy songs and ballads.  \\"Stop\\" is one of my favourite songs.  In high school, a few friends and I would do the moves to the song, and make everyone join in.  \\"Viva Forever\\" is a ballad and I love it so much.  It makes me cry every time I hear it.  This is definitely a must have for any Spice Girls fan.
B00005K9LN|5.0|The Judas Priest album that broke the band out into the mainstream is here, remastered, and with new tracks. \\"British Steel\\" is the pinnacle album for Judas Priest and is just a spectacular hard rock album. The songs are great and catchy; This is an album you have to listen to all the way through when you listen to it. Rob Halford's vocals, Glenn Tipton & K.K. Downing's guitars, Ian Hill's bass, and Dave Holland's drumming are all in top form here. Halford doesn't show off her as he did on songs like \\"Rock Forever\\" but this song only proves that JP are true Gods of Metal. Here are the tracks: <br /> <br />1. Rapid Fire-5/5-This a great song, with great guitar playing and Rob Halford hitting a seemingly impossible note at the end. <br />2. Metal Gods-5/5-This song kind of turned Judas Priest into metal gods. This is a great song, except for the panting thing at the end. That's disturbing. <br />3. Breaking the Law-5/5-This song is the big JP song on the radio, but it's such a great song. By the way, am I the only one who thinks it sounds like Rob Halford is saying \\"Freaky Galore\\" during the chorus. <br />4. Grinder-5/5-I like this song, but it's odd. <br />5. United-5/5-This is one of the songs they wrote for audience participation. But it's not quite better than some of the other ones like \\"Take on the World.\\" <br />6. You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise-5/5-This song sounds like older Priest, like something off of \\"Hellbent for Leather.\\" It's a great song, though. <br />7. Living After Midnight-5/5-I think this is one of the coolest/funnest songs Priest ever recorded. It's a totally cool song that would be perfect to play at a party. <br />8. The Rage-5/5-The basslines and guitar solos in this song are great. <br />9. Steeler-4/5-I think this is the weakest song on the album, but it's allright. <br /> <br />BONUS TRACKS <br />10. Red, White, & Blue-5/5-It's a shame they cut this track, it's better than \\"Steeler.\\" <br />11. Grinder (Live)-5/5-This version is almostbetter than the studio version. Almost. <br /> <br />So whether you're a hardcore Priest fan or just a new metalhead looking for a good album to buy. Get this CD, you won't be dissapointed. <br />
0385503954|5.0|I would start my review with a summary of the book, but I believe other reviewers have more than covered for that.  What particularly captured me about McEwan's novel was that McEwan's own writing directly reflected that of the aspiring writer, Briony.  He described how she used odd, yet interesting adjectives to set up situations, and he does exactly this at times.  He is truly gifted at not only setting up extremely creative stories, but at completing the full embodiment of these stories at every level.
B000002LQR|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of The Red Hot Chili Peppers, but don't hate me yet. For some reason, their new album \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" really clicked with me so I went back to the album that most fans call their best and here it is...\\"Bloodsugarsexmagik\\". <br />I did like the album, I liked it a lot. But, while some fans may not agree with me, I like their new album better. This isn't a singles based album, by that I mean it's not an album where only the songs that were released as singles are good, the whole thing is good. All the tracks, for the most part, are pretty solid. But, I don't know...I just liked the songs on the new one better. This album does feature classic RHCP though like Give It Away, Suck My Kiss, Under the Bridge, and some songs that didn't recieve a lot of airplay like The Righteous & the Wicked, Naked in the Rain, and The Greeting Song. There are a lot of highlights to this album though. Flea cranks out some of his best basslines, John Frusciante has grown as a guitarist over the years but does some nice stuff on here, Chad Smith is a talented drummer who's stuff works well on here, and Anthony Keidis on vocals does a lot of cool & weird stuff with his voice on here. I think this is an album that people shoud hear and I'm glad I checked it out...Here are the tracks: <br /> <br />1. The Power of Equality-5/5-Good lyrics and a very funky cool song. The basslines are spectacular. <br />2. If You Have to Ask-5/5-Another really cool song. I like the way Anthony Keidis's voice sounds on this song. <br />3. Breaking the Girl-5/5-This song's good but it's weaker than the others. <br />4. Funky Monks-5/5-This is a great song, the best so far. <br />5. Suck My Kiss-5/5-This song is awesome, it's on the radio a lot which keeps me from liking it the most; but it's a killer track. <br />6. I Could Have Lied-5/5-These are usually my least favorite RHCP songs, but this song grew on me. <br />7. Mellowship Slinky in Bmajor-5/5-This is one of the best songs on thealbum. <br />8. The Righteous & the Wicked-5/5-This is probably my favorite song on the album, so far. <br />9. Give It Away-5/5-This song is killer. The beat, the vocals, everything. <br />10. Bloodsugarsexmagik-5/5-This song is cool, but I like the chorus...The verses are kind of, uhh. <br />11. Under the Bridge-5/5-This is a beautiful song. I like RHCP's funk songs mroe than their ballads but this is one of my favorite songs by them. <br />12. Naked in the Rain-5/5-This is another great song, in my top 5 favorite on this album. <br />13. Apache Rose Peacock-5/5-The lyrics to this song are very sexual and very cool. <br />14. The Greeting Song-5/5-This song has the greatest music background to it than the rest of the tracks. <br />15. My Lovely Man-5/5-Despite the homosexual sounding title the song is really good. <br />16. Sir Psycho Sexy-5/5-The lyrics in this song are very graphic, but very cool and the song itself is great too. <br />17. They're Red Hot-1/5-OK, they were trying something different but this song sucks. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />

B000E97HIA|5.0|I don't know if I can truly call myself a Prince fan. Truth is I pretty much stopped paying attention after \\"Purple Rain\\" and lost respect when he became The Artist Formerly Known as Prince. But, I saw this CD sitting on a shelf and the truth is...The only reason I bought this CD was to hear the song \\"Lolita\\". I love the movie and I figured Prince would slyly reference it in the lyrics. Buying this CD for one song and then listening to all of them, I realized something. This is a killer CD! Every song on it is good and Prince bounces back and forth from funk to jazz. <br />\\"Lolita\\" turned out to be a great song, but not the best. I'm truly surprised, I think this is even better than \\"Purple Rain\\". Since that album, Prince's voice has matured (but he can still do his falsetto thing), his lyrics are still sexual and very suave, and <br />he's more talented than ever. Prince doesn't get enough credit and this CD only proves that he needs more than he gets. Here are the tracks: <br /> <br />1. 3121-5/5-This song is really funky, it's a lot different from his \\"Purple Rain\\" days but it's quite good. <br />2. Lolita-5/5-This song is so awesome. It's extremely catchy and the lyrics are cool. <br />\\"You're tryin' to write checks your body can't cash.\\" <br />3. Te Amo Corazon-5/5-I don't know what Te Amo Corazon means, but this song is really good. It's not like the previous two songs, it's more of a jazzy ballad...But cool. <br />4. Black Sweat-5/5-Even when he's singing in a very female-like falsetto, you have to respect Prince for that pervy charm he has. This is a cool song. <br />5. Incense and Candles-5/5-This song actually sounds like an NSYNC song, but it works somehow. <br />6. Love-5/5-This is one of the best songs on the album. <br />7. Satisfied-5/5-Another change of pace, it's another jazzy song but it's still awesome. <br />8. Fury-5/5-This is another song that's extremely catchy and one of the best on the album. <br />9. The Word-5/5-I love the beat to this song the most, but the whole thing's pretty good. <br />10. Beautiful, Loved, and Blessed-5/5-I wish they would've ditched the female vocals on this song, but other than that... <br />11. The Dance-5/5-His little screaming thing at the end is cool...Also, \\"If I can't be your lover, I don't wanna be your friend.\\" That's a great line. <br /> <br />GRADE: A+ <br />
B0006OBPTA|5.0|The Karate Kid is probably one of the best teenage underdog stories that I have seen. The story was excellent, and Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita brought such chemistry to the unique relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Actually, the entire cast in this movie was excellent - Randee Heller was superb as Daniel's mom, and even the actors with smaller parts brought credibility to this movie. I still get chills at the end of this movie. The extras on this DVD were a nice touch as well.  <br />The Karate Kid II is the less inspired sequel, but it still has some of the magic from the first one. The third installment was a bit strained - how many different groups of individuals are going to torment Daniel (on two different continents no less), but it is still worth watching.  <br />The Next Karate Kid was, in my opinion, uninspired and made me miss the magic of Daniel and Miyagi's relationship.  <br />Overall, this four disc set is a must-have for any fan of this series. The movie is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|This is an absolutely awesome cd. So far this is my favorite cd purchase of 2006. I discovered this band on MTV2's Headbangers Ball and was very impressed. I just had to have their new cd. Every song on this cd could be released as a single. Some of the songs have metallica-like riffs but this band is still very unique. They combine screaming and a great singing voice from the lead singer and the guitarist and bassist also add some screaming giving this band lots of depth and creating catchy songs that u can really get into. BUY THIS CD you won't be dissapointed.
0553212478|5.0|Frankenstein is definetly a lot deeper than I imagined it to be.  Of course I wasn't frightened by it at all, not that I expected to be, considering today's \\"scary\\" standards, but it made me feel like the monster.  Frankenstein's monster, which is an \\"ugly\\" man (to put it lightly) is capable and willing to give unconditional love, something so \\"powerful\\" and \\"beautiful\\", unlike the townspeople, \\"beautiful\\" (not monster-like) who are the \\"ugly\\" ones by attacking the monster with no reason, simply based on his appearance.  Even his \\"creator,\\" who would be his master, his idol, rejects him and disregards him and his needs.  Who wouldn't become a monster, if your \\"creator\\" turned their back on you?!  The idea of this story is so powerful, even if the story wasn't written that great-- some gaps, like how quickly Frankenstein brings the monster to life then quickly rejects it and goes to sleep?!  And the writing is a little long in the tooth, but I don't think the vocabulary is particularly difficult.  A great and quick read for those interested!
006054094X|5.0|I urge you to read this book, which offers a fascinating detective story -- one man's search for proof  -- that an ambitious emperor sent out an enormous Chinese fleet in 1421, to discover and embrace unknown civilizations in order to expand the empire. The fleet included hundreds of ships, over a hundred of which were huge, nine-masted ships 480 feet long, 180 feet wide and several stories high, which included sixty staterooms.  The captial ships were supported by a host of smaller vessels.   <br /> <br />As a result of superior navigation skills and cartography during the perilous two-year voyage, the Chinese developed accurate maps of the coastlines of North and South America, Africa, Antarctica and Australia, at a time when the Europeans had not yet discovered how to calculate longitude. When European explorers sailed west to the Americas, they had access to charts and maps based on Chinese maps, copied and redrawn decades before Columbus's first voyage. <br /> <br />The story starts when a retired British submarine captain investigates an ancient map in a library, discovers an important detail unnoticed by historians for centuries.  Why did he notice? He had used maps and marine charts to sail to the places shown on the map.  He saw four islands out in the western Atlantic that could not be in that location.  The date jumped out at him. The map was drawn decades before Columbus made his voyage to the Americas.  Impossible. <br /> <br />He realizes it is Puerto Rico shown on a map drawn before 1492.  Its name was not given as Puerto Rico, but its characteristics, landforms and position relative to those of its neighbors were known to him. He was intrigued enough to follow up his discovery elsewhere.  Only a seasoned sea captain who had traveled those waters would have recognized the details that electrified him into a ten-year search for proof. <br /> <br />And proof there was.  Find out why there are palm trees in the Caribbean, why South American chickens differ from their European kin, why some Mexican art reflects Chinese styles, why there are Ming ceramics in South America and incorporated into an ancient mosque in East Africa, and how a Chinese artifact was found on the shores of Rhode Island.   Discover evidence of shipwrecked junks preserved in seas all over the world.  More importantly, discover why the absolute power of Chinese emperors, and the reversal of a dynasty's foreign policy resulted in the suppression of the news of this awesome voyage, including the destruction of documents and more. When the remainder of the fleet limped home from a wildly successful two-year voyage, instead of being hailed as heroes, all news of this unimaginable achievement was supressed, as China turned away from the outer world. <br /> <br />The author took no discoveries on face value, searched for proof by traveling the world to follow leads.  He has woven it all into a fascinating account.  He includes a detailed Appendix which directs doubters to the documents, locations, and details he discovered.  The book includes color plates of Chinese artifacts and ancient maps with impeccable provenance.  I am into my second reading of the book, following a trip to China.  It is even better the second time around.
B00004VWAF|5.0|At the time of its release, On the Corner drew the ire of many reviewers because - it was written - it could not be considered a \\"jazz\\" album. The album is brilliant and the only problem I had with the original release on LP was the length; I wanted more music!<br /><br />The dilemma by placing too much faith in the musings of music critics throughout the electric period of Miles was the seemigly placement of each album in a vaccum, as if the artist wasn't building on a concept. And Miles - as always was the case - was creating a sound for concerts and in the studio.<br /><br />By bringing funk to the forefront of the sound, Miles was essentially placing the final paint strokes on a canvas - merging his studio and live ideas in a tight package - that is still misunderstood in 2006.<br /><br />Miles bolstered the sound with a larger studio group, including such regulars like Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin, Jack Dejohnette, Dave Liebman and Michael Henderson.<br /><br />A great live companion piece to On the Corner is Dark Magus, which chronicles one of the last concerts before Miles went into a nearly seven year retirement.
B00005RFVL|2.0|Every singer has his song, on this album Robbie nails Beyond The Sea and the rest of the songs suck.  Louis Armstrong nailed Mack the Knife and Frank Sinatra nailed It Was A Very Good Year.  Robbie William does not have the depth these singers have to pull off these songs.  Sorry.  Hope you did not purchase this album.  You can get the Finding Nemo soundtrack for half the price and it has Beyond the Sea on it.
B00003CXSP|4.0|This movie is great,Anthony Hopkins reprices his role(thankfully) as the creepy Hannibal,he is a inteligent,bold and evil killer.Jodie Foster should have played Clarice once more,but,appeareantly she was busy...  but julianne did a good job.This is a great thriller.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|Aeon Flux lives far in the future.  Unhappy with the government, a radical group called the Monicans revolts by sly and secretive means.  An assassin for the Monicans, Aeon Flux is given an all-important mission that could deliver to her the vengeance she has yearned for over so many years. <br /> <br />This movie presents an interesting concept and might even have been watchable, had acting glitches and predictable outcomes not littered the film. <br /> <br />My first complaint: the plot.  The idea of a futuristic and perfect civilization catches attention, but the story that is placed against this backdrop is positively sickening.  The twists, turns, and realizations (I can't go into them without ruining the movie for anyone that doesn't heed my warning) are so predictable as to become painfully corny.  In addition, the revelations that are supposed to make the audience root for the revolutionaries and hate the government aren't very convincing.  You find yourself wondering what was so bad with the civilization in the first place. <br /> <br />Complaint Number Two: the pacing.  All the \\"important\\" and plot-making dialogues are crammed in between random fight scenes and long shots of Charlize Theron in skimpy outfits.  It's as though the director was trying to attract viewers not with the plot or movie itself, but with the lure of Charlize Theron in some beaded and very revealing concoction. <br /> <br />Complaint Three: acting and casting.  Let's just say that some of the oh-so-serious scenes had me giggling out of pure amusement.  Moving on.... <br /> <br />Acting/Casting, Plot, and Pacing make this movie a sinker. <br /> <br />1-Star - Please don't watch this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000067CPX|5.0|Now before any of you strictly-80's Peppers fans get your pantyhose in a bunch, let me explain the reason for the title of this review. I am a die-hard RHCP fan and I own all of their studio albums:  <br /> <br />Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984) <br />Freaky Styley (1985) <br />The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987) <br />Mother's Milk (1989) <br />Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) <br />One Hot Minute (1995) <br />Californication (1999) <br />By The Way (2002) <br />Stadium Arcadium (2006) <br /> <br />Each album the band has put out is special in some way, even their somewhat lukewarm debut. But By The Way stands out to me for it's audacious melody and sheer beauty. \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is one of THE GREATEST songs I have ever heard. That song alone is worth the price of the CD. Sure, call me a p%ssy, but at least I'm an honest p%ssy.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|It got bashed a little bit when it first came out that the film was poorly shot and Bjork would never be able to carry a lead role successfully. <br />They never figured that the film would be built around her amzing voice though. <br />If I am in mood, (often), and feeling like there's no inspiration left in the world, even if I can't sleep, this is the soundtrack I turn to. <br />Sounds made up for the lead charcter's lack of eyesight - and then some. <br />Admittedly I had this before I saw the film, a couple of things made more sense after watching the movie though. <br />Spontaneous singing and imaginative numbers are given life through Bjork's quirky and charismatic voice. <br />A story that can be followed through song, '100 steps', 'I've seen it all'...you haven't until you've heard this soundtrack. <br />Peaceful and exotic in turns it is a piece that stands alone. <br />Tastefully done and exceuted - not one bad track. <br />
B000063DFN|5.0|It really is a damned shame, isn't it?  This generation's sorry excuse for music is being recieved with misplaced fervor and adulation by would-be critics while grandiose epics such as Iron Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\" are fading into obscurity due to the gratuitous ignorance of the MTV-worshiping youth. Makes me cry. Just the thought of someone choosing Fall Out Boy and Avril Lavinge over Iron Maiden makes me ill. Maybe I'm out of line, but i strongly doubt it.

B000CEVUIK|4.0|I started watching Stargate Atlantis when it began its syndicated reruns for Season One.  I am a long time Star Trek fan and can't help but make some comparisons.  Although one of the overall arcs of the series is darker than Star Trek (a pending invasion), the style of writing for each episode is light and seems to be more for a general audience relative to Star Trek.  They seem to place emphasis on entertainment over social commentary; however, you may find a lot of the same story formulas (and titles) used in Star Trek revisited in Stargate Atlantis.  It seems to be a very family-friendly series (few sexually explicit situations, if any, but nothing R-rated).  Be aware that some of the 'vampire' aspects of the show may leave younger viewers with nightmares.  All of the characters have good chemistry together and the dialogue tends to be very witty at times (esp. Dr. McKay and Maj Shepperd.) <br />There are many tongue-in-cheek references to Star Trek (TOS) in this series.  E.g. Major Shepherd compared to Kirk as 'always falling in love with alien women', a Scottish doctor that always seems to end up sounding like Scotty. <br />The Stargate series is known for their longevity through the ability to keep costs down; however, the special effects are not compromised. <br />Like others, I started too late to get into SG-1, but watching Stargate Atlantis does not require too much knowledge of SG-1 to get started.  It's a good fix for those of us who are waiting for Star Trek to come back to TV production.
B000FA57RG|4.0|While it's great to have (some of) the Re-invention Tour on CD, it's a little disappointing that what was selected here are tracks that were lip-synched.  Why not include performances like \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Crazy For You\\" which were all performed live, and very well I might add.  Having said that, I love the performances of \\"Lament\\", \\"Into the Groove\\" and \\"Holiday\\". <br /> <br />I do enjoy the CD but I can't help but feel that this live CD is a bit of a missed opportunity.
0385512058|5.0|I greedily swallowed a library's copy in a couple of days and was so excited and impressed that ordered own copy at Amazon. This book should be a table book until you practice the ideas it preaches so deep and often that they become organic part of you.    As you may see from the title the book fights isolation and loneliness during a meal. It's not a metaphor though not the gist either. The essence of the book is \\"your network and connections are the pledge of your success; build your network via becoming useful to people, become a hub of connections, eagerly seek opportunities to help others, and never keep score\\".    It may seem that the ideas are not very innovative and it's true - they're not. But Keith succeeds to deliver such a simple message to readers' brains and hearts. A mix of bright and descriptive problem explanation, concrete and pragmatic advice (the book is organized as a set of such), and real life (actually Keith's life) examples makes reading experience gripping and inspiring.    I was quite sceptic when I took this book in my library. It's definitely a challenge to teach somebody on a very basic topic such a network building and nurturing relationships. Readers may soon find the content boring, repetitive, and obvious to keep reading. The problems are known, there is a variety of networking-101 tips published in magazines and the net, and illustrative examples of how right networking changed so-and-so's life. Still Keith amazingly broke the ice of scepticism with the very first pages turning the 'another-business-book-reading' exercise into very pleasant conversation (yes, while reading the book a strong feeling of a dialog doesn't leave you).    The books makes you look at your life's values again from another point of view. I won't re-tell the book's content and ideas here but strongly encourage you to find the book and read it. I wish I found it 15 or 20 years ago but happy that even today I ran across it. I'm sure I'll meet Keith in person one day and we'll eat together:-)
0385495323|5.0|Simon Singh has done an excellent job of narrating the history of codes and ciphers, covering material in quite a comprehensive manner, yet explaining it in a fashion that even readers who are not particularly gifted in mathematics will understand.  His narration of the (frequently military) history surrounding some important events in the history of cryptography added considerable interest for me; there's just enough of it to add another dimension without there being so much that it detracts from the main story.  His decision to include the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics and Cretan Linear B script was a wise one, as well.  As he notes, neither was an attempt to conceal the meanings, but the methods used are exactly parallel to many used in deciphering codes and ciphers. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|This is an interesting psychological portrait of a band with definite interpersonal relationship problems.  Metallica hired a psychologist to spend time with them to help them through their individual differences, and the result is a riviting documentary. <br /> <br />Kirk is the quiet one who submerges his ego for the benefit of the group, James is trying to discover how to get in touch with his feelings after a dysfunctional childhood, and Lars is the negative control freak who is in denial.  Eventually, everything comes together, but the fascination lies in the journey.  Former band member Dave Mustaine makes an appearance as the man who blames the group's success for his inability to pick up his life after his struggle with alcoholism. <br /> <br />Oh, yeah, and they can rock like no one else.  Check this one out.
B00065MDS6|5.0|I feel that every album from King Crimson circa 1969-1975 is essential. They were at their creative peak here before turning into minimalist, machine music in the 80s. <br /> <br />In response to a top 500 reviewer: <br /> <br />reviewer: \\"I may not be the best judge for the record, I'm not a huge fan of the 'progressive rock' sound\\" <br /> <br />Well, spare us your opinion since King Crimson *is* 'progressive rock'. We won't mind, I promise. <br /> <br />reviewer: \\"For Crimson fans, completionists, and maybe the occasional prog fan who likes this kind of stuff.\\" <br /> <br />Translation: Buy this album if you like King Crimson or want to own all their albums or you are somebody who would like King Crimson. Hey, thanks for the advice!
B000FA57RG|5.0|HI THERE! I AM MEXICAN SO HOPE YOU FORGIVE MY OCASSIONAL LANGUAGE FLOPS :). I STILL HAVEN'T BOUGHT THIS CD/DVD SET, ALTHOUGH HAD THE CHANCE TO WATCH THE LATIN AMERICAN BROADCAST OF THE \\"I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A SECRET\\" DOCUMENTARY, EVEN TAPE-RECORDED IT AND BEEN WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN SINCE MIDDLE APRIL... <br />YOU CAN EITHER LOVE OR HATE MADONNA...

0671646788|5.0|This book has made a huge difference in the way I react, work, play and think about things that come up all the time.  The highlighter flowed throughout and my inner lightbulb glowed regularly when reading this timeless marvel.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|The third installment of this series was the only thing that kept me from giving a full 5-star rating.  Of course the original is the best (c'mon it had Bacon, Ward, and Reba), but #2 and #4 weren't shabby themselves. <br /> <br />My favorite thing about these movies though is something that isn't even in the actually movie themselves.  See a few years ago my fiancee was in the hospital with the ear infection from hell.  She was in the hospital for about 60 hours and asleep for most of it.  I hardly left her side.  One while she was asleep I was flipping through the channels and landed on USA which was having a Tremors Marathon, showing all 4 movies.  It was great!  I couldn't leave her side, but sitting next to a sleeping person all day isn't a whole lotta fun, but Tremors was there for me.  Now I think about her everything I watch one of the movies. <br /> <br />A must have for an Sci-Fi Fan or fan of the original.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|This movie is nothing short of brilliant. Eli Roth is amazing and talented. Quentin Terrintino and he are a great match for an amazing horror movie. The story takes place in Amerstam where a group of guys are vacationing. What happens to them is just plain FRIGHTENING. Jay Hernandez is great as the main character who is trying to escape the torture. One of the worst scenes was when Jay Hernandez's character has to cut out an Asian girl's eye. And believe me, it shows everything. This film shows everything and doesn't cut things. I know the film shows so much torture, but you can't help but to watch it with your mouth wide open in shock. This has to be one of the scariest movies to come out in years.
B0004Z33G4|4.0|The packaging design for this boxed set and its individual cover,showing various Stallone's poses from the three films printed in a grey metallic tone,is pretty attractive.    The four stars given are for the movies:the picture quality in widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio is virtually speckless and the sound in Dolby Digital 5.1 provides adequate punch to each movie and is dynamically enveloping especially during the action sequences (most evident in RAMBO III).  There are no English subtitles except for certain dialogues in certain scenes involving Soviet soldiers in RAMBO III.    Where this edition falls off considerably is in the special features.The much vaunted Metavision Survival Mode,which is rather hit-or-miss, is far from informative much less interesting.LGF has made a bad choice to include this as the special features replacing the DTS track and other featurettes available in the previous Special Edition boxed set.The only fairly interesting playback upgrade is the Metascope,which enables viewers to know titbits about people,places and events as they occur in each movie.    Even so,the Ultimate Edition is not a bad purchase, bearing in mind that the far superior Special Edition is out of print. This edition is quite a recommended offer ONLY for those who haven't owned the trilogy yet.
B000069HJL|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a huge supertramp fan. Now that I have that out of the way, let me say that this album kind of sucks. I was very dissapointed after I listened to this embarrassing effort. Hopefully this isn't considered as a \\"good night,\\" because in my opinion I think this live music just isn't nearly as good as their studio recordings. I will admit, even though I love supertramp, the band is a \\"polished prog-rock\\" band that just can't make good music live. At least this album says so, I haven't heard any other life supertramp stuff. I have had this album for about a year and I think I've listened to it all the way through about once... I usually get too disgusted with it before the end. Especially Rick Davies' parts. I don't mean to pick on anyone, and I love Rick's album ballads, but unfourtunately on this album Rick crashes and burns evey time he opens his mouth. Because I am such a big supertramp fan, I really am embarrassed when I hear this. Unfourtunately I have been spoiled by great live albums like \\"How The West Was Won\\", \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\", and \\"Live At Leeds.\\" Maybe that's just it, maybe you can't compare supertramp to stuff like that. What I noticed also was the weak music that seems to be dominating throughout this. When I listen to supertramp I am expecting some complex, full, and well thought out sounds, but when I hear this I hear simple, rushed, and very weak beats and tunes. Don't get me wrong, there are some pretty good live versions of songs here but that is about it. The rest is pretty weak. If you are planning to buy this I suggest saving it for completing your collection. I suggest their main four albums - \\"Breakfast In America\\", \\"Even In The Quietest Moments\\", \\"Crisis What Crisis?\\", and of course \\"Crime Of The Century\\" which is one of the best albums I have had the privelage to put to my ears. So I would get this only if you are completing your supertramp collection because other than that, it really isn't necceassary.
0783225482|5.0|A witty and funny comedy with a dark and hysterically devilish undertone.  The three actors, Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis play their parts brilliantly making what could be an oddball script into a brilliantly comedic classic.<br /><br />Goldie Hawn (always funny) plays a homely woman who nemesis is Meryl Streep.  When fate lands at her door and she becomes a stunning best selling author while Meryl, who plays an aging actress withers away.<br /><br />Twists and turns at every bend.  This is a must see movie.
0962477060|5.0|Forget the rest...beginner to advanced. All of the books together does not equal this book. Better yet, buy the combined vid and book package. Bill Edwards has captured the keys to the mystery of guitar playing. Everything else is kid stuff and if you have chosen the \\"teach yourself\\" method of playing, regardless of style or classic, std. electric or whatever, this book will help you move at a greater pace, will let you see the insight in guitar, whether amateur or pro and will help you become much more proficient playing 6 strings. A system is finally out there that will let you see the cord scales, will lessen your time on \\"the learning curve\\" and is a strong method of analysis and learning. For over 30 years, I have played both for my enjoyment and for the recreation of others, professionally, chiefly in blues and moderate rock. I wish I had this book available from the 1960's...before fingers stiffened and vision tunneled. You feel a strong sense of achievement without playing \\"Mary had a little Lamb...\\" This is stuff you can use.......
B0002OERI0|5.0|VERY good.(exept for the fact that billie joe \\"dosen't want to be an american idiot.\\").......He's goin' to hell!
B0006GQMC8|5.0|This is one of those movies where they didn't intend to make a  classic movie, but they ended up with one. Bronson and Marvin are each excellent, and the way they play their roles perfectly support the plot's development. It's an exciting story and great entertainment!<br /><br />This isn't \\"Battleship Potemkin\\" or something, don't expect the moon, but it is a GREAT movie, and not widely known. Get this one while it's still available!!!
0385338694|4.0|I have read all of Kinsella's books and this one is equally as delightful as the rest.  It is hilarious at times if you can stop yourself from saying, \\"That would never happen.\\" about some of the scenarios the main character gets into.  In fact, the main premis may make you think that as well.  Overlooking this fact, it is fun to see the contrast between the main character's old job as a lawyer and her new job as a housekeeper. Very enjoyable read!
0743454529|5.0|I don't agree with some of the other reviewers here. Yes, the story is fascinating and not too unreal to be unbelievable. Yes, you expect the story to progress towards one of two endings. But just at the very end there is a surprise twist that leaves you stunned, baffled, angry, in denial and finally somberly accepting. All of the emotions you would expect to feel if the ending of this book actually happened to you. Is that not that objective of great writing, and a truly great book? To pull you into the story and make you feel all of the emotions as if you were living the story yourself. This book accomplishes that and more.  <br /> <br />I think it is one of the best books I have ever read. I am on a mission to read all of Jodi Picoult's books and heartily hope that they are all as fabulous as this one.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Over the years, Depeche Mode has grown from a band releasing Pop songs to a band writing some of the most compelling and emotional lyrics. This album seems like a culmination or fullfilment of religious aspects which have pervaded their songs for the past several years. Each song here conveys an emotional depth both in lyrics and music. Not only has this become my favorite Depeche Mode album, it is now one of my favorite albums of all time.
0618477942|5.0|This graphic novel is splendidly written and quite engrossing, an excellent weaving of personal history with literary classics. I went to buy this in hardback the day I read the NY Times Sunday review of this book, but my local Borders had to seek it out from the back room. I hope they have since shelved it prominently. I never buy hardbacks because of the cost, but I am so glad I bought this one. I've never read the author's comics or seen any of her other work, but I will read what she produces in the future.
0375507256|5.0|This is a VERY long book.  Mostly because it is several books in one.  One of the professional reviewers compared it to a Russian nesting doll -- a very accurate comparison.  I enjoyed this book and intend to read it again in the future.  It's difficult to even answer the question, \\"so what is this book about?\\"  It's easier to describe the psychology, philosophy, and themes of the book than it is to describe the plot.  I will do my best.  The book follows several characters as time moves from the 19th century to a futuristic dystopian world with clones and all.  It's like Roots meets Erin Brockovich meets Logan's Run meets Planet of the Apes.    Needless to say there are a lot of Archetypes in this book.  The different stories are woven together very intricately both in a six degrees of separation kind of way and through deeper connections.   Mitchell's greatest talent is being able to switch personas so adeptly.  Each section of the novel is told in varying dialects of the English language.   <br /> <br />My one hesitancy is recommending this book is that each story present its own liguistic challenges for the reader,  especially intensified by the manner in which Mitchell throws the reader into a story in the middle of the action.  The reader is forced to solve a mini-mystery just to be able to figure out what's going on, who's who, and how this odd dialect can be deciphered.   The book definitely moves along.  It is fairly well paced, full of action and suspense, and intellectually stimulating (makes suduko look like tiddly winks).   <br /> <br />The book's exploration of themes such as power, greed, repression, suffering, atonement, grace, and rebirth provide the backbone for this perhaps overly complex set of tales.   The book  is mythological, allegorical, spiritual.  Stepping back, it does seem that it would be necessary to use several inter-related tales  to fully explore these themes.  The novellas become a tapestry of parables.    <br /> <br />For those who don't like gimmics -- well, there is a fair amount of artistic gymnastics on display in this book.   I don't know about you, but part of why I like watching Robin Williams is because he can switch character so effortlessly.  David Mitchell shows precisely this sort of effortless perspective/persona/dialetic/plot shifting.  Look, I'm not going to pull any punches.  This book was a lot of work.  I was exhausted after I finished reading it.  That's why a second read will be rewarding.  I will have worked out the logistics of the book and I will be able to concentrate on the rich themes, the beautifully drawn characters, and the philosophical questions posed.  Most of my favorite works of \\"great\\" literature need to be read several times, after all.  Any place worth staying to explore usually requires that you get the lay of the land first.   <br /> <br />Going back to the standard questions I ask myself when I'm done reading a book:  Was it worth reading?  Yes.  This book is worth reading -- probably several times.  Was it life changing?  Probably.  It made me look at how people's lives fit together, and it made me think about cycles of political power and social dynamics.  I'm fairly certain the life-changes will be more profound  when I read it again.  Will it change the way I live?  Maybe.  I think it made me more environmentally aware and conscious.  Whether I take steps to do anything about it is still up in the air.  It may help me to understand human behavior a little better and therefore help me to react to situations involving power/greed/repression with a more deconstructed calm, intelligent, awareness rather than volatile emotion.  Who would I recommend this book to?  Those who like to read and don't mind working at it.  Those who like artistic gymnastics.  Those who like books and discussions involving philosophical and moral issues. <br />
B00005RDRO|5.0|Our entire family loves this movie and we get it out whenever we want to have a good laugh together.  It is entirely without sense but that is what makes it so much fun.  There are some great one-liners and the collection of cast-members is great.  This is one you don't want to miss.
0446678430|3.0|Look , the book has good general advice, and for that it may be worth the price and time. I enjoyed it up until the chapter on option trading. The events recounted in this section are impossible imo.  <br />He recants the tale of selling naked Put options on a stock to collect the premiums. Claims he made 5 grand in 5 minutes and didn't need to worry about watching the market or the stock or the option. Sorry , but he mentions that the options expired worthless a couple weeks later , so until such time as they did , he was entered into a contractual obligation for the underlying security. 5 minutes me arse. <br />The strategy is sound assuming you know that this is pure speculating , not investing , and understand and can deal with the risks.  <br />Selling the described puts at 5 gives him a maximum potential profit of $5,000 (less transaction costs.) He can NEVER make any more than this on this particular trade. The risk involved? Over the course of the next 'few weeks' , (not 5 minutes Robert) , worst case scenario is you just bet on the next Enron. The underlying stock has an SEC investigation , accounting scandal , whatever. Not likely no , but weighing the rsik reward ration by its very nature implies looking at the maximim potential risk. The stock is halted, files BK , whatever. Mr.K now owns a thousand shares at 40 of a bankrupt company. His loss is $40,000 , plus trans. costs , less the $5 he received in premiums.  <br />In affect he is taking a maximum risk of ~35,000 to make a maximum profit of ~5,000. Simple as that. This is pure speculation. <br />But hey , nothing wrong with taking risks if you are comforatble with the reward potential. <br /> The main problem is the numbers he uses. He claims that he sells these puts at $5 - with a strike of $40 , while the stock was trading at $45.  In addition , they are expiring in a couple of weeks.  My question is who bought these things? Mr K. must have found the dumbest speculator on Earth to pay $5 for a putthat is already 5 points out of the money and expiring in a couple of weeks. This genius would need to see the stock drop more than 10 full points, in 2 weeks , to break even. For comparison , right now, lets look at a similar situation. Shares in Electronic Arts are trading about $45 , just like the stock in his example. The July puts expire in about a month , almost twice as long as the stock in Mr K's example (thus offering more time value and accordingly a higher price 99% of the time). The same put option , with a strike of $40 , 5 points out the money, - just like his example-  is trading at ....  0.60. That's right , 60 cents. If you wanted to sell the puts, like in his example , you'd get $600 , not $5000.  Furthermore ERTS is a volatile tech stock. Mr. K claimed the stock underlying his transaction was a solid earnings-growing , dividend-paying stock. This as a rule would assume less volatitly I presume , and less premiums to the options.  <br />I have checked a dozen stocks in the same price range and with similar options and found ERTS to be typical. I found nothing anywhere vaguely approaching the premiums Mr K claims to have received in his example. Nowhere near it.  <br />He goes on to site the flip side of the example again later in the chapter. He ended up owning the stock.  He claims that the stock had the stock fallen to $35 , he would write covered calls against the position to generate income again. He would sell $40 stike calls. The price he thinks he got is again $5. What nut in his right mind would pay $5 for a short term call that's 5 points out of the money , in a stock that just fell over $30 (his example)? Sorry , no way these numbers meet with reality. regardless of the state of the market in 2002 , I just find the numbers used virtually impossible to believe. Had he offered the name and date of said trade it could be easily checked , but he did not.  <br />Otherwise , he gives you ideas to consider. It's more a self help , motivational type thing than any specific plan for acquiring wealth in my opinion , and some examples gievn are simply not good recommendations for many people,  while others are just not entirely believable. <br />Obviously this is all just my opinions , and I'm no option trading expert or anything. <br />Worth a read though.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Simpily brilliant... by and far the best ALBUM to ever be released!  Its sad that people just don't understand, nor do they want to, because then the would be part of a group that isn't like them.  Simply, a group that has a love for music and enjoys listening to it, no matter who else listens to it.  Once something becomes popular, now its considered trendy or hip.  Screw that... Good music is just that ... GOOD MUSIC. Period.

Sorry , no way these numbers meet with reality. regardless of the state of the market in 2002 , I just find the numbers used virtually impossible to believe. Had he offered the name and date of said trade it could be easily checked , but he did not.  <br />Otherwise , he gives you ideas to consider. It's more a self help , motivational type thing than any specific plan for acquiring wealth in my opinion , and some examples gievn are simply not good recommendations for many people,  while others are just not entirely believable. <br />Obviously this is all just my opinions , and I'm no option trading expert or anything. <br />Worth a read though.
B000000H5J|5.0|You heard me right folks, \\"Demanufacture\\" is Fear Factory's best album ever, and it's also one of the best metal albums of all time. Don't get me wrong, \\"Soul of a New Machine\\", \\"Obsolete\\", \\"Digimortal\\", and \\"Archetype\\" are all great albums, but like I said before, this album is their all time best, and it's down right addicting from beginning to end. I've had this album for two years now, and whenever I listen to this, my mind is completely blown away, I just love it. Burton C. Bell's vocals on here are much more different then they were on \\"Soul of a New Machine\\", but he's just absolutely awesome on here. His angry screams on here echo Phil Anselmo and Max Cavelera, and his clean singing is just incredible beyond words as shown on tracks such as \\"Self Bias Resistor\\" and \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\". Dino Cazares's awesome machine-gun-like guitar riffs shoot right through your body like a cannon shot. Chrisian Olde Wolbers's bass lines are hearable and very groovy. Raymond Herrera's sick double bass drumming is just fast and relentless throughout, man this guy is without a doubt one of the best metal drummers ever. The opening title track \\"Demanufacture\\" is absolute pure bliss. Whenever I hear the chorus to that song, it immediately gets my blood rushing and my fists pumping. Other great standouts on here such as \\"Body Hammer\\", \\"Replica\\", and \\"Flashpoint\\" have crunchy, heavy grooves, while \\"New Breed\\" and \\"H-K (Hunter-Killer)\\" are fast, blood rushing, hard hitting, and flat-out intense. Please note that the song ratings on here apply to the original version of this album (without the bonus tracks) that I own.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br /><br />1. Demanufacture (4:12) - 5/5<br /><br />2. Self Bias Resistor (5:12) - 5/5<br /><br />3. Zero Signal (5:56) - 5/5<br /><br />4. Replica (3:56) - 5/5<br /><br />5. New Breed (2:49) - 5/5<br /><br />6.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|As a longtime Madonna admirer it always surprises me that 23 years into her recording career she can still amaze me with her new explorations of her art.'Confessios On A Dance Floor' is programmed as if it were a retro Eurodico album but the musical pallet is far more varied on this fine dance and club album.On every cut some bassy sound or other pins everything down-Madge has obviously been listening closely to hits by Daft Punk or something because she has found an even better way to intigrate 70's and 80's dance music samples into a modern house/disco context and make it all sound totally fluid and organic.And the songs are excellent-no matter how many times you hear \\"Hung Up\\",you cannot deny it's power.And right on to \\"Get It Together\\",which keeps the groove going on.The whol CD is like that-it keeps moving right along.Other individual highlites are \\"Future Lovers\\",a great musical and theatrical tribut to Giorgio Moroder/Donna Summer sound of the late 70s.On \\"Jump\\" and \\"Push\\" she actually pushes the tempo down a little into a more percussive setting-giving them more of a funk edge then a disco one.\\"Isaac\\" is a spiritual house chant-pretty deep sounding in many ways.One thing you can depend on 100% with this CD is wheather or not every song leaps right out at you (and some of the individual songs don't) the entirety is so kinetic that you'll be moving or dancing too much to care.As with many popular musical greats of her time Madonna has always been more one to experiment and alter her sound then stay in one place very long.But if nothing else she makes one confession loud and clear that her new revolution is going to take place entirely on a hot,sweaty and exotic dancefloor.And as always she is perfectly willing to bring you along for the fun.So if your in the market for a new album that will rouse and get your going 'Confessions On A Dancefloor' is likely your best bet.
B000FA57RQ|5.0|I loved the documentary, it thought it was a beautyful expression of love and concern for our society as well as a candid insight into a person trying to better herself and move beyong the influences around her- trying to express her current self and be understood and understanding. <br />It is great to see the growth of an artist like madonna, who didnt just stay the same producing the same thing over and over again and then dissapering behind an outdated image(Whitney)or Falling From Grace (Britney/Michale) <br />For the people who cant get past her earlyer incarnations stop bitching and trying to hold her back- watch Truth or Dare(In Bed With Madonna)and let her move on. <br />my only point of confusion was the \\"Directors Cut\\" of American Life that was supposed to be in the special features with the deleted scenes- was this wrong or was it just not included in the Australian release??? <br />Long Live the QUEEN!!! <br />Steven Carter <br />Melbourne Australia. <br />
B000F48CD8|5.0|This is a great album, that'll quickly grown on you. The sound is ecclectic, yet somehow cohesive. It rocks.
B0000028VT|5.0|This is the most beautiful cd.  Mariah was at her best here and while I love her music now, I want some of the old Mariah back.  I love ballads and if you do too, there is plenty here to keep you happy.  Anytime You Need A Friend (my favourite song of hers), Without You, All I've Ever Wanted and Just To Hold You Once Again are the best songs on here and are all stunning ballads.  Of course Hero is here too, but that's so overplayed, I'm almost sick of it. <br />On this cd, her vocals shine like they are supposed to.  She doesn't go too far overboard, but sings angel like.  Dreamlover and Now That I Know are here if you want faster music.   <br />Overall, I give this 5 stars because with the exception of Without You, she wrote all the songs and sings them to perfection.  I love it.
0613599071|3.0|We had to read the Life of Pi for a school assignment. It was definetly not something I would choose on my own. Part One of the book was amazing! So witty and fun, I adored it. Part Two sagged along and I thought it was a little disgusting and would never end. Part Three was hilarious and the perfect way to wrap up the story! Yann Martel is a very good writer, I just wasn't too crazy about the story. I'm not sure if I could say I liked it, but I didn't dislike either. If you are into survival stories I would read Life of Pi, it was undiscribable.
B00005JOSS|4.0|Unlike with the overtly sappy \\"The Notebook,\\" I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves have tremendous chemistry together, and that is the key to a successful love story. The fantasy aspect of the film doesn't bother me, as long as I can suspend my disbelief. The characters are very well-developed and they feel real. The slow pace helps us get to know the characters and allow us to piece the clues together. There is a mystery in there, too. While an earlier event might foreshadow what is to come later, by no means does it spoil the enjoyment of the movie and its satisfying denouement. Yes, there are plot holes and logical flaws and sometimes the timelines are difficult to follow as the editing becomes confusing, but none of them are fatal. For the hopeless romantics, this is a must-see movie.
B000009FJL|5.0|Trespass has always been my favorite Genesis album, but the sound quality of the original releases was, well, awful. No longer. This remastered edition is so clear and smooth that it actually brought a tear to my eye.<br /><br />I love the Genesis lineup and music all the way until ...And Then There Were Three..., but each succeeding album seemed to lack the punch of Trespass, though a few came close (Foxtrot, Selling England by the Pound, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Dance on a Volcano). If you like Peter Gabriel, or Gabriel-era Genesis, you'll probably love this remastered classic.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I was scanning the radio channels one day and came upon Johnny Cash singing \\"Hurt\\".  After hearing his somber melodious voice for a few seconds, I couldn't help but to hear the rest of the song; it was so poignant that I remember exactly where I was at that moment and what I was doing.  The song isn't originally his, but it was definately made for him.  Later, I heard the Nine Inch Nails version of Hurt.  Johnny Cashes rendition puts them to shame.  Although I purchased the CD for \\"Hurt\\", the other tracks are good as well.  If you like hurt, you will like most of the other tracks.  My favorite by far is \\"Hurt\\" but I never get tired of listening to \\"The Man Comes Around\\", \\"Give My Love to Rose\\", \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", \\"I Hung My Head\\", \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Sam Hall\\".  One of the things I like about Cash is how he puts so much of his heart into his music and it's so simple with nothing more than his voice and a guitar.  I'm not even a fan of country music, imagine that.
0743243153|4.0|Upon finishing this book (and during the duration of reading it), I found myself even more disconnected and lonely than I have become accustomed to over the years.  It was a strange experience because in retrospect of what I just read the night before of the first three sections, I could not pinpoint what it was that had so drastically changed my outlook and demeanor on the present night.  People noticed a difference in me, asked if I was tired or feeling okay.  Then, as if it all came together, I realized that I was mirroring exactly what it is Dr. Peck explains in his musings on discipline and love.  I had encountered a truth in my life (and in life as a whole for that matter), and responded to it with a sense of solace and lack of drive.  I was reading something my consciousness did not want to address and thereby it left the world as I had known it just the day before starting this book forever changed and lost to me.  It was only when I moved into the forth and final section of the book which addresses the nature of God that the redeeming quality of the inevitability of life's suffering, which is the general theme of the work, became palpable to my sensibility.<br /><br />Yet I've noticed a common theme of those who lack a set religion lambasting this book due to its obvious spirituality.  Perhaps my own story can diversify the response.  I myself follow no set institution of religion.  I have no concept of one religious philosophy as being superior to another yet still, the one thing that I will never be able to accept is the notion of the lack of a higher power.  Atheists like to fancy themselves intellectually superior, believing that by accepting only what they can see they somehow rise above the ranks, whereby in my opinion they meet the very contradiction of their philosophy.  The evidence of Spirit is all around us, echoed most poetically in the fact that we exist.  How is it possibly for us simple to be?  No purpose, no endgame, just here we are, nothing exists outside of this reality.  For my own humble perspective, that's more ludicrous than the notion that something outside of this reality has brought us forth and that this something has done so with benevolent intentions so that we may reflect on what it is to be and to know what it knows.  Having always struggled with issues of cosmic-inferiority, whereby I could not fathom how in a universe that knows no bounds where we are merely tiny little animals that inhabit a tiny little planet that orbits a star within a galaxy of billions we could be seen as something more than utterly unimportant and lost in the mass of all that is, this book's final section provided musings I've longed for for a very long time.  Of particular impact was Dr. Peck's assumption that if the universe is infact so vast and never-ending, then should we not by the mere fact that we exist and in a single lifetime may experience a million miracles, both small and large, that bring us ever closer to oneness with the Spirit, thereby see ourselves as the center of the universe, as somehow chosen and given as a gift the universe in all her mystery to use as our steppingstone for personal growth and ultimately the assumption of the role of God Him(or Her/Its)self.  It's borderline Ayn Rand Individualism, but from a much more humble and spiritual approach.  Obviously this book can't be everything for everyone, and there are for my taste minor missteps in the discussion of love (thus the missing star), yet still I will brave stepping right into the line of clich&eacute; by admitting that I can honestly say that this book has changed my life.ing exists outside of this reality.

B000FA57RG|3.0|How can somebody call this her \\"First Live Cd\\"??? there's a lot of lip-synch !!!I'm not against lip-siynch, but coming from Madonna? Her then stylish-anthem Vogue got destroyed for this cd. Besides her American Life akbum is one of her worst works, so how could she launch a tour for it? I think it's a one off. <br />Oh, yes, certainly, there's something good about this cd; it features a -well, i would call it \\"primary\\" version of I Love New York, and it really sounds a lot better than the \\"Confessions\\" version. Any way, let's hope that the confessions tour has more quality.
0618477942|4.0|I suppose it's difficult enough to reveal one's life on the page, but it must be quite another to then augment the dissertation with personal graphic illustrations that might carry the danger of simultaneously adding dimension while subtracting imagination from the reader's experience. But Alison Bechdel has achieved a triumphant balance with startling fecundity in FUN HOME, her autobiography that's both an explanation of her coming of age and of her father's coming out, sort of. The \\"fun\\" is in the observations of life with father as we romp through her pre-pubescent diary and consider the axioms she posits regarding the nature of her burgeoning sexuality.<br /><br />Ms. Bechdel flits from one year, back to another, forward to another, yet offers the reader a soft landing each time. Within one chapter we find Alison as a young, cut-off wearing child eager to gain favor from her distant father by vacuuming the Fun Home and without warning, boom, she's in her college library, thumbing through lesbian literature. The flippant chronology somehow works to the advantage of the unfolding story, and she displays fabulous, tight literary prose, although I could do without rushing to the dictionary every fourth page to learn the meaning of \\"welter\\" or \\"tautology.\\" She didn't propose that one medium explain the other: the graphics, composed with a brilliant eye for the emotional range of the characters in her life, primarily her father and herself, feed on the written narrative and our imagination, a task made tougher by the intimate subject matter that translated to the comic while stepping along the borders of pathos. It's like Rembrandt adding masturbatory commentary to his muddy self-portraits. The result is a magnificent, if fractured fairy tale.<br /><br />The only rub was the liberal use of literary analogy to explain her innermost discoveries as she grapples with her father's nature and demise. Even she battled her English professors' propensities for drawing far reaching parallels from simple narratives, which tickled me. She's a smart cookie, and Fun Home is a brave, new work, but I might have thought that her observations of a father who spent the bulk of his free time flowering his garden, reading Fitzgerald and Joyce, decorating his library and ignoring her mother, all while she made a hobby of studying other men in her life might have led her to an inescapable conclusion, but then rationalization is a powerful process. Look at Zelda, for Chrissakes.rom simple narratives, which tickled me.

0452282152|5.0|This book was the way I discovered one of my favorite authors, Tracy Chevalier. I was left literally speechless by her blunt, yet beautiful writing style that kept me reading and reading. Set in the seveneenth century, this engrossing novel explores the mysterious origins of the painting, \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" and the heart of a young maid named Griet. I found myself transfixed by Chevalier's way of conecting the readers slowly and carefully to her interesting and unique characters, and the novel maintained my interest throughout its entirety, leaving me with a strange, empty feeling when I was through. I strongly reccomend lovers of historical fiction, romance, and good writing to read this story.
B000EHQ57Q|4.0|Call me disappointed in this SACD 5.1 mix. Maybe its the Quad source masters used. Overall this just isn't one of the better SACD 5.1 surround releases I've heard. Especially disappointing after recently hearing the Dire Straits Brothers In Arms SACD. Or compared to the Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon which is another excellent SACD 5.1 mix. The music contained on this CD is a 5 star for sure, but I can't give this version more than 4 stars due to the relatively weak 5.1 mix. The biggest issue here is the bass. It's almost non-existent, barely able to register on my subwoofer. Once again this may be a result of using the old QUAD masters for this SACD.  <br /> <br />There are some interesting things to hear in the mix especially coming from the rear surround speakers, but overall it doesn't improve the listening experience from the remastered stereo mixes. At times some basic guitar sounds seem to be buried while other unexpected sounds are very prominent. There are still two reasons to buy this cd over the previously released stereo remasters from the late 90's; 1) the SACD stereo layer on this CD is excellent even on a non-SACD player. 2) bonus tracks are nice. If you already have the remastered stereo edition from the late 90's I just don't think this is a worthwhile purchase. If you are buying it for the first time I guess I would prefer to have the bonus tracks and the stereo mix on this CD. That would be my only reason for recommending it except of course if you are a Moody fanatic with a SACD player you will probably want it, too just to hear the contrasts with previous versions and the opportunity to hear it in a different light.
B000002P5W|5.0|AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE is the \\"forgotten\\" Hendrix album, sandwiched as it is between the signature ARE YOU EXPERIENCED? and the dynamic (and double-disc) ELECTRIC LADYLAND. Although AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE is consistently underrated and oft-times ignored, it suffers only from being in the massive twin shadows cast by Hendrix's other works. On its own terms, AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE is as phenomenal an album as any.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE presents Hendrix as a more confident and more mature artist than the creator of ARE YOU EXPERIENCED? This album is contemplative and nearly restrained, containing some of Jimi's best writing and vocals. While ELECTRIC LADYLAND is more eclectic, AXIS: BOLD AS LOVE is more focused, a diamond-bit musical exposition that cuts to the heart of the human experience. \\"Are you experienced?\\" Indeed.
B00005JOVN|5.0|The original POSEIDON ADVENTURE was one of my childhood favourite movies, which I had on video and watched many times, it was big in our house! And I'm happy to say the long-awaited Wolfgang Petersen remake was well worth seeing on the big screen! My heart missed a beat when I saw the name IRWIN ALLEN PRODUCTIONS and also SHEILA ALLEN, Irwin's widow, as executive producer at the start during the intro - awesome CGI shots leading into the jogging-on-the-deck scene! When I saw those names I thought YEEESSSS! Irwin Allen has made some great movies(THE LOST WORLD(1960), ONE HOUR TO DOOMSDAY, the original Poseidon of course, THE TOWERING INFERNO, FLOOD, HANGING BY A THREAD, FIRE!), and also some stinkers(BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THE NIGHT THE BRIDGE FELL DOWN, CAVE-IN, WHEN TIME RAN OUT, THE SWARM) and lest we forget, LOST IN SPACE, LAND OF THE GIANTS, THE TIME TUNNEL et al for TV . . .but at least the baddies were hugely entertaining in a guilty pleasure kind of way that I rate them well. But I digress. Like many disaster movies, the usual nuts line up for the New Year's Eve cruise. When the POSEIDON capsizes due to a rogue wave(?!), a compulsive career gambler played by JOSH LUCAS decides to climb up to the propellor shafts against the orders of the captain who instructs those that survived the capsizing to remain in the main dancehall. Joing  JOsh are an ex NY mayor and fireman Robert Ramsay played by KURT RUSSELL, a jilted gay man(cashing in on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN methinks) played by RICHARD DREYFUS!!!!(Mr Holland's Opus, Close Encounters of the Third Kind), the fireman's daughter played by the lovely EMMY ROSSUM(Phantom of the Opera, The Day After Tomorrow) who looked great wet(hee), and many more. You get the rest. Some live, some die. As this motley group climbs up the ship through a surreal and inverted world, you get to see some awesome setpieces and suspenseful action scenes - the aircon shaft scene was well and truly claustrophobic and the elevator/burning oil sequence was brilliantly excecuted bringing back fond memories of the original. The ballast tanks flooding was good and also like the original, anyone remember Stella Stevens swimming in her panties? You get a snatch of this as well. Of course, with every disaster movie you get an annoying kid, the one here was no exception. Again, I refer to lots of disaster movies of the 1970s like TOWERING INFERNO, CASSANDRA CROSSING(clock this one, this is fun), EARTHQUAKE  . . . the annoying kid cliche makes the experience complete! The ending was truer to Paul Gallico's novel on which this is based than the original too, and again this was well executed. Overall, this remake is genuinely gripping in places, boasts some eye-popping SFX and excellent production design and cinematography. Oh, one moret hing, Black Eyed Peas fans will get a kick out of Stacey Ferguson as the ballroom singer on the doomed cruise! RECOMMENDED!!!g oil sequence was brilliantly excecuted bringing back fond memories of the original.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|I saw them back when they were an obscure, opening band... the progress they have made since those days is incredible.  <br /> <br />A comment for all the bad reviews and forum posts: <br /> <br />One of the major reasons afi has kept their fans throughout all these years, and has made thousands of new ones, is that their music is constantly evolving. \\"Good\\" music may be catchy, but \\"great\\" music transcends genres and expectations. <br /> <br />I'll leave it at that  =)
B000005H3M|5.0|Some of the best big band music I've heard.  The sound is clean and sharp, the improv is excellent, and (of course) the drumming is fantastic.

0385512058|5.0|I read a great book on the way to Fremont, Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi with Tahl Raz. I highly recommend it. Although I network a lot, it was an inspirational refresher. It is about networking (the people kind, not the computer kind â\\" although I am an advocate of both).<br /><br />As a time management person, I often choose to eat alone. And I choose fast restaurants (not fast food) when I do eat with others. Ferrazzi understands good time use. He often eats with groups of people.<br /><br />Never Eat Alone speaks of the value of networking and has a number of ideas on how to network. 3 take aways. Always network first by seeing what value you can add to the person rather than looking at it the other way around. Second, although the book did not state this explicitly, networking is common courtesy and actually enjoyable. It is not a distasteful task. Third, nurture your network. Figure out ways to add value and keep in touch. I suppose in some way, my blog does this.<br /><br />I also realize how extensive my network is. It is not about the 3000+ contacts I have in Outlook, it is about the people I really know and the people that know me (often more people know me â\\" position, speaking engagements, articles and blogs tend to do that). I am charmed to know a lot of highly influential people.<br /><br />I have a very good relationships with CEOs and Presidents of many companies as a result of my years in YPO. Other organizations like top 40 under 40 and other awards also helps build a peer group. I, of course, have a very deep rolodex in the computer industry (27 years will do that). I have many deep contacts in Guelph and Kitchener Waterloo since I have been in business in that area for years. I have numerous senior contacts of influential people from my board positions on companies like RIM. My years of running a public company gave me many contacts on Bay Street and Wall Street. Equally important as the people of perceived high influence that I know, I have lots of friends, all of whom are in my network, from just being alive and involved in things.<br /><br />I loved one quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson:<br /><br />\\"every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him\\"<br /><br />Even though my network is broad, I am inspired to nurture it, build it and organize it more.<br /><br />Now off to a board dinner.

0307276902|3.0|A friend gave me this book when I he found out that I belonged to AA.  As a fictional book I really don't think its all that impressive.  Every character in the book is completely stereotypical.  My sister also went to Denison University in Granville Ohio where Frey attended college and its an extremely preppy school.  To say you were a major drug dealer in Granville is comical.  I also think it serves as a major diservice to those people who believe Frey beat addiction by \\"just holding on\\".  If you've ever known an addict you understand that \\"just holding on\\" doesn't work -- at least not for anyone that I've come across in the years I've been in AA. <br /> <br />Frey did manage to write an impactful book, and for that I give him kudos.  I just wish he would have been upfront with all of the facts rather than trying to dupe everybody.  If you want to read a graphic, in your face fictional book about drugs and prisons this book isn't all bad.
B0002MB7QW|4.0|The Day After Tomorrow came out almost three years ago. This movie depicted global warming events and the ever lasting damages the world would have to face. However the writer did push the movie a little too far, because the chances of an ice age happening over the next two weeks would be highly unlikely. Our weather is changing dramatically; here in Canada, our winters have become much warmer than they used to be. This movie should be a warning sign for everyone. <br />   The movie aimed its audience well, and had some real good facts. Although the events depicted were done in an unrealistic timeframe, the actual events were probably not too far off base. The tornadoes in L.A. and the snow in New Delhi, this will all happen one day. They nailed the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and the effects it has on the world. The movie showed us what we could be headed for if people don't start waking up and seeing and believing global warming. Too many people are in denial and I hope all these people get out and watch this movie at least once. Everyone should have to see this movie once; the facts are there and the reality is there it just needs to be set in. <br />   Although this movie made some good sense out of global warming and its effects, the movie had some good special effects. The actors did a good job playing their roles and played the character real good. The music played in the movie was not bad either. To me, this movie was great and is a must see. I rate the film excellent. <br />
0790729393|4.0|Sleepers is a film about friendship, honesty, justice and violence.  Actors like Brad Pitt, Jason Patrick, Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffmann and Kevin Bacon on their tops show how life can be destroyed by action in affect.  <br />The story sets in Hell Kitchen, New Yorks violent quarter in the sixties. Four boys live a joyfull life until one hot summer day changes their lives completely. A man gets seriously hurt as the four guys play a prank. The teenagers are send to a Detention Center where they experience torture and sexual abuse comitted by the wards. Of course the boys suffer even as grown ups this physical and emotional injure and as two of them accidently meet one of their oppressors they take deadly revenge. As the two are send to trail the old stricks of friendship are newly bound and the other two, one of them a lawyer, try everthing to get the two frienda free. A cruel fight against the wounds of the past begins.  <br />The movie is dominated by flashbacks which show the crimes against the boys at the Detention Center and give the movie sort of mysterious deep.   <br />The story is told by Shakes, one of the boys, who also wrote the same named novel which is said to be based on real happenings. <br />All in all Sleepers is an emotional, exciting film which shows the cruel reality of law and the ways of late justice.  <br /> <br />(Claudia Becker, Claudia Pries, Janina Huljus, Marscha Uredat)
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|Having found this CD after becoming a member on Zach Braff's web forum, I cannot stop playing these songs. Very well written and well placed lyrics create a very warm and comforting calm that you find yourself wanting more of. If there was any downside to this CD, it would be that it ends far too quickly even with 11 tracks. It's such a balanced flow throughout each track transition that it seems like a single song for the entire 38:52 minutes. Definitely one of the best musical purchases I've made in quite some time. <br /> <br />Thanks Zach! <br />
B00005R1N3|5.0|In a time when the average horror movie is a bad remake of a classic, based on a video game or just a pathetic excuse to indulge in special effects, films like \\"Black Christmas\\" makes one realize that horror doesn't mean graphic, too clever for words or necessarily outlandish tactics.  Films such as this one, \\"Halloween\\" and countless other great horror flicks are effective primarily because they take the every day and fill it with an unnerving sense of terror and vulnerability.  I saw this baby back in when it was first released and it scared me as much today as it did back in `74.  The killer inside the house premise that was explored with equal success in the fantastic \\"When a Stranger Calls\\" (the original) is so terrifying because unlike \\"When a Stranger...\\" in the end, he is never caught but rather is still lurking somewhere inside the house, waiting.  Most people consider their homes a sanctuary and what is more unsettling than knowing that it no longer is, that unbeknownst to you it has, in fact, become a death trap and that with every passing minute peril inches closer?  This fantastic example of modern horror relies, like most of the fine films that emerged during the horror heydays of the 70's and early 80's, on tension, atmosphere, ingenious use of sound and silence, light and shadow.  I don't scare easily and having seen all of the \\"great\\" horror movies, I still count this one among the creepiest and unsettling.    BTW - everyone was great with Margot Kidder having a seemingly great time as the foul-mouthed, tough talking, hard driking sorority girl.  Olivia Hussey in the more demure and complex role was equally good.  It's a very well made little gem and it shouldn't be overlooked if you love horror.   Don't pay too much notice to those nay sayers below, because \\"Black Christmas\\" is true horror and not that visual and sonic schlock that tries to pass for it nowadays.   If you were born in the age of excess (post-1975), chances are that you wouldn't knowgood horror if it bit you on the rump.
B000FA57RG|3.0|How much time has to pass before we get the full \\"Re-invention\\" Tour on DVD?  This is ridiculous!  Just listening to this CD reminded how fantastic that show was!  If they are not giving us the DVD of the actual tour, you would think they would at least give us the whole \\"Re-Invention\\" tour on CD... but NOOOOO.  That's where the 3 stars come in.  Now, to make matters worse, the original press release by Warner Bros. (which you can still see on Madonnatribe.com) states the bonus features would include the music video for \\"American Life\\".  So where is it????  What a way to royally piss off the fans.  I love her.  I have since 1982.  I love her enough to buy whatever new release comes out on it's day of release.  I loved the \\"American Life\\" CD too - but apparently I am in the minority.  Not a fair-weather fan here, people.  Her musical compositions and lyrics with Mirwais were nothing short of brilliant.  In fact, the only mistake Madonna has ever made in her musical career was to release \\"American Life\\" as the first single off the album.  She should have started with either \\"Love Profusion\\" or \\"Hollywood\\", then move onto the beautiful \\"Nothing Fails\\".  Anyway, \\"American Life\\", while being a great cut, and a good opener for the CD, should have remained an album cut, and not a single.  The whole atmosphere of the release would have changed.  The album debuted at #1, but with all the post-Bush (a--hole) / Dixie Chicks bashing going on at that time, it bled over onto this wonderful CD.  All it did was poisen the album with all the George Bush / Republican rhetoric that the media placed on the accompanying video.  WHICH WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ON THIS DVD!!!!!  I don't blame Madonna (The \\"Confessions Tour\\" was fantastic - will that one be released on DVD before \\"Re-Invention\\" too??) I blame Warner Bros.  Clean it up over there, and give the fans what they want!  Also, let's get a real DVD release encompassing ALL of Madonna's amazing music videos from the last 24 years!!  How isit that THE premiere video artist of our time does not have such a thing???  Come on!!  I know SOOOO many people that would buy that in a heart beat!  Also, Warner Bros., PLEASE give us fans the complete \\"Virgin Tour\\", \\"Blond Ambition\\" and \\"Re-Invention\\" concert DVD's.  JUST DO IT!!!!!!  The fans will line up on release day, just like they have for every other Madonna new release.  If we are willing to pay $350 for a concert ticket, you can bet we will pay $40 dollars here or $30 dollars there for a DVD.  We who love Madonna want EVERYTHING she has done, not these bits and pieces we have had to live with for the last 20+ years.  Shame on you Warner Brothers.  Heavy sigh.  Madonna deserves much, much better from you - and so do her fans.
B00005JP01|3.0|This 3rd installment of the fast and furious was cool it was better than I thought but it just wasn't enough racing in this one there was a lot of action I like this one you just got to accept the fact that the stars from the 1st 2 are not in this one but its good you should go see this.
076781214X|4.0|Peggy Sue is a bored, unhappy middle-aged mother whose marriage to Charlie Bodell, her childhood sweetheart, is on the rocks. At a high school reunion Peggy Sue collapses and wakes to find she has somehow been transported back to her teen years. As she gets over the initial shock she realises she has the chance to relive her life and maybe make some drastic changes. She also realises she can change the lives of those around her, such as when she encourages one class mate to invent panty-hose and encourages others to invest in things she knows will succeed in the future. Of course those around Peggy Sue are confused by her newly serious nature, particularly Charlie who cannot understand why she is so cool toward him.<br />Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film stars Nicholas Cage as Charlie and Kathleen Turner as Peggy Sue, and watch out for a very young Jim Carrey as Walter, a friend of the young couple. Although the lead actors play their parts well, and try to be believable as teenagers, the fact that they both look far to old to be teens does detract from the film a little. That aside, this is a heart-warming film with some very witty moments. It will make you laugh and cry in equal amounts and, although it looks a little dated now, it is still worth a look.
0973709030|5.0|The latest work by Cyrus Rua is nothing short of Brilliant.<br /><br />Rua shows his admiration for Wilde's work through a very insightful representation of the imagery throughout the book.<br />The artist breathes new life into the Picture of Dorian Gray.  His haunting images are consistent with the tone of the story, but the artist doesn't overshadow the author.  Rua's detailed depictions complement Wilde's work like a fine wine with a good meal.<br /><br />Cyrus Rua shows us various styles and mediums, but brings it together with graceful genius.<br /><br />So, pick up a copy for yourself and a few close friends and relatives, and while you're at it, order a copy Rua's \\"Grimmest of Grimm\\" if you don't already have one.<br /><br />I, for one, anxiously await his future works.

B00003CXIP|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever filmed in Oregon, and I would like to take this opportunity to say that Dillon obviously needs to chill and use some vinegar based cleanser down south and  doesn't know his heinie from a hole in the ground.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|The movie is great and very disturbing however I believe the film will have more of an impact in the Silent Hill video game community. Great acting, amazing special effects, and amazing production values combine to create one of the greatest video game adaptation movies of all time! A note on the DVD: The disc will conatian the movie and a 6 Part Production Diary titled \\"The Path of Darkness\\" that will shed light on the production of this epic scary movie. This will make the purchase of the DVD a no brainer for fans of the series or fans of deeply disturbing horror films.
B000687M48|5.0|okay, those who says Amy sounded so bad live and/or she can't sing has no energy driving behind her voice etc are all just SO. IGNORANT about singing. I was a chorus singer, and BELIEVE ME, you people who don't sing just have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA just how exhasting and energy-draining singing is, especially opera-like songs by using chess-voice. I remember whenever I haven't had a good-enough meal and/or was hungery when I sang, lots of time I almost fainted after my session(I was a Soprano so it's especially energy-draining). And my voice cracked if I sang for too long, and that's just singing while standing, I can't even imagine what it will be like while doing all that jumping and movement. Singing is VERY tiring, it takes alot of energy to sing the songs that are like Evanescence's (which all have that opera choir-like sounds/singing). Alot of singers, in order to survive live concerts, do LOTS exercise to build-up strength.  <br />So basically, after I saw Evanescence live, I was just SO IMPRESSED with Amy who can actually hold her note, and make her voice not cracking 90% of time while doing SUCH intense movements(makes me love her more). Though I would've perferred her movement not as intense, if she just waves a little, walk around a little and taps her feet or something I would've liked it just fine.  <br />And on a side-note, alot of other rock/metal bands use \\"screaming-singing\\" instead of \\"singing-singing\\" so not even to mention opera-singing, find me another rock-band that uses opera-singing, I can guarrantee you there are VERY few. Alot of bands, since they use \\"screaming\\", they won't tire out as quickly. This is percisley because screaming is not as energy-draining as singing.  <br />As for the editing, I would like it better if it doesn't flash too much, but it's still not THAT bad. I totally enjoy it, and it's also short enough for me not to get tired of it.  <br />Amy's voice is just absolutely stunning, the preclude of \\"Bring Me To Life\\" is enough for any fans to get this album. I was not disappointed. And plus, you get four new songs, though I didn't like Thoughtless as much, mainly because it's not their song and that it's weird to hear Amy cussing (which is one of the main problem I have with majority of other rock bands- they just CUSS WAAAAAAY too much), but of course I liked it much better than Korn's version, and it's still a pretty good song.  <br />
1400079179|3.0|I had to read this book after watching all the dust it kicked up. I knew it was going to be disappointing and it was. Usually any such book that builds up the mileage based on public sentiments is disappointing to anyone who doesn't care about the sentiments.<br /><br />I have no affiliation to the church. I don't think any of the stories that the church is based on is really credible. Even the so-called believers shouldn't base their faith on any historic pretentions. The stories behind the church are fishy at their best. All that this book does is to highlight the fishiness and build a fiction on top of that. As a fiction, the trail that Langden and Sophie follow to solve the puzzle is lame, non-convincing and a drag. There are very few portions in the whole book that qualify as interesting reading. But, the dust kicked up by the controversy kind of pushes you through the end of the book. I was hoping that there would be something in the end that would really expose the religious establishment, but there is nothing that bold from the author. He plays so safe that I don't even understand what the dust was all about.<br /><br />Anyway, the best accomplishment by the book is that it has managed to wake up the common man (who has been gradually losing the ability to think). That is what makes this book interesting... not anything inside it.
B000F48CD8|3.0|pay attention to the lead in paragraph on the literature with respect \\"..four lousy thieves..\\". A bit of a pre-cursor to the music and vocals you will hear on this album. <br /> <br />The steal from several bands over the years to put this one together, but they do it well. Talented group of guys, would love hear more but on an orginal music level. <br /> <br />Best two tracks \\"Steady as she goes\\" and \\"Together\\". \\"Together\\" comes off as the most original, I think it's the lyrics, but still feels familiar somehow.  <br /> <br />
089898890X|5.0|This rather thin-in-size book packs a tremendous amount of practical instruction.  It is intended as a thorough course in bop drumming for serious students, and will realistically take  many months simply to work through at a basic level (and, as with any high-level skill, many years to actually master).  It is suitable for beginning drummers who at least know the rudiments and basic technique (and who have familiarity with jazz in general), but would also be appropriate for experienced drummers wanting to learn the specifics of bop drumming.  The book begins with basic time-keeping on the ride cymbal and progresses through comping and tailoring accompaniments.  There is a detailed section on brushwork.  While the focus naturally is on rhythm, there are also many useful pointers on tone, dynamics, composition and such.  The accompanying CD is well put together and, in addition to including examples, also includes \\"music minus one\\" type tracks to play along with.  The writing style is lucid and the explanations are clear.  The author understands that playing drums is a lot of fun, and he seems to aim to provide a highly disciplined approach that manages to avoid taking the fun out of things -- no mean feat.  This book is the next best thing to actual lessons with a great teacher.
B00005JOYA|4.0|For someone that hadn't even heard of Silent Hill (GASP!) until after the movie, I found it to be very impressive; both in its setup and in the execution.   <br /> <br />Since this review is based off just seeing the movie and not knowing which characters, lines, plot points, et al were part of the original game or the sequels; fanboys and gamers alike-please bear with me. <br /> <br />The story starts off as most horror movies of today start..a strange raven haired child scares the bejeezus out of their parents as they wonder just what is going on.  Mumbling about \\"Silent Hill\\" near a very treacherous waterfall certainly is enough to bring Radha Mitchell and an extremely miscast (and underused) Sean Bean at ends with each other in how their adopted daughter is to be treated.   <br />After a few internet searches (does anyone still use Yahoo! or MSN for their internet scouring anymore?) Radha comes to a story describing the tragedy in Silent Hill, WV.  Going there, she hopes, will bring her daughter out of the \\"New Millenium Creepy Child character trait\\" funk.  <br />It doesn't.  We start, then further treading down the same \\"New Millenium Creepy Child character\\" path...chasing a girl that doesn't talk, but darts in and out of dilapidated, rundown rooms and condemned buildings.  All the while, the exasperated parent vainly looks for them. <br />The female police officer is wearing the tightest leather outfit I've ever seen without having to pay a cover charge and listening to Emo or KMFDM all night.  My first thought?  Whoa..Joan Jett is in here!  :)   Alas, it wasn't.  Unfortunately, she's tied to a stake and made to feel like the other side of a human pig roast. <br />Silent Hill is creepy.  Intensely creepy.  The sirens are fantastically eerie...Definitely something you don't want to hear in real life. The monsters-especially Triangle Head-are straight out of a Lovecraft/Dali dream montage; or at least from a Wes Carpenter movie.  <br /> <br />**SPOILERS AHEAD**<br /> <br />By the time Alice Krige (the busiest plain jane in movies) hits the screen, the plot starts sliding to a videogame plot (memorize the floorplan, defeat the monster in his lair), which pretty much means all hell is going to break loose.  It had me until the time the cop was accused of being a witch.  After that, the reveal (done as a very effective set of flashbacks) is little more than a revenge story; which tends to lose it's credibility to some extent.  Again, as someone that wasn't familiar with the games, it was fun to know that a lot of the beasties and clues were taken directly from the games.   <br /> <br />Not many movies adapted from other media (books, videogames, Podcasts) are going to be as faithful as fanboys would like.  Think if George Lucas had published the Star Wars episodes as books prior to 1977.  Remember..Han Solo was supposed to be a cross between Greedo and Chewy, if I remember right. <br /> <br />\\"Silent Hill\\" certainly has my attention and I will definitely be placing the DVD on my Christma...er, sorry, Winter Solstice Holiday Wish List...  It's worth a money for a rental and perhaps a purchase as maybe (I hope) an audio reference disc.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|Unhealthy both as role model and performer, our limitedly talented Ms. Lopez, not content with her skilled acting chops in 1999, jumped on the Latin explosion bandwagon with the help of her label cronies and her indisputable celebrity factor. Only, the results were about as relevant to Latin music as a toadstool stoned on a bottle of Palo Viejo. Without an iota of a hint of vocal skill, she squeaked and heaved and shrilled her way through a spit-shine production of second-rate disco tunes even Andrea True laughed at. What made it so utterly joyless is/was its lowest common denominator: it's completely phony, resulting in the most head-scratchingly successful debut of that year, maybe decade [take that, Jewel]. Monetarily, it made sense - at platinum plus, she was able to seduce a million or so impressionable kids into buying into the web of deceit - but as art...well, I suggested, then, that she get on that 6 train and head home. Or at least toward Hollywood. Instead she sojourned her way back into the studio a few more ear-blood inducing times.  This was not only the worst CD of 1999; it was the insult of that year.  My grade:  D
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I went into this movie thinking that I would hate it, from all of the pop-culture movie critics, but as a movie goes, Brokeback Mountain is wholly englightening. Ang Lee's masterful craftmenship of the movie engage the viewers so much in the story that people are not aware that it was only from a short story. Overall, Brokeback Mountain proved to be a deep, and emotional movie that hollywood needs but lacks.
B000FA57RG|4.0|I bought this for the SOLE purpose of having the live CD. I saw the Documentary, months ago, on MTV and was not impressed. It was a bit too political and too BLAH for my taste. Does not show any live performances and it seems to be too philisophical. I probably will never watch it.<br /><br />So, my 4 stars is based on the LIVE CD alone!!!<br /><br />It's rare (if at all) that Madonna releases a live CD of one of her tours. So, this is a must have for any type of fan! She sounds SO great live and it's a whole new way to experience her music. Crank it up and you'll swear you are there. A great array of songs on the CD that will keep you dancing and singing.<br /><br />A must have!!!
B000FA57RG|3.0|Well I absolutely LOVE Madonna, and I was so excited when this cd/dvd was finally released today! <br /> <br />Although the sound quality is amazing, I am so dissapointed in the concert CD! <br /> <br />I saw Reinvention live in LA & SJ, and she omitted several songs from the CD.  <br /> <br />It's missing the following: <br />Frozen <br />Express Yourself <br />Burning Up <br />Material Girl <br />Hanky Panky <br />Deeper & Deeper <br />Bedtime Story <br />Nothing Fails <br />Don't Tell Me <br />Papa Don't Preach <br />Crazy for You <br /> <br />Honestly, the songs she left in for the CD were kind of weak-most of songs from \\"American Life\\", which was not her best album: <br /> <br />The Beast Within <br />Vogue <br />Nobody Knows Me <br />American Life <br />Hollywood <br />Die Another Day <br />Lament <br />Like A Prayer <br />Mother and Father <br />Imagine <br />Into the Groove <br />Music <br />Holiday
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Before you dismiss these guys as Fallout Boy theives - and I wouldn't blame you, looking at their bloody long song tittles - take a look into their music. They deserve it.  <br /> <br />\\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is, for the most part, a complex record, littered with enought catchy hooks and sharp instrumentation, spanning organs, piano, alaborate keyboards and synthesisers to make Iggi Pop jealous.  <br /> <br />Topped with a voice that's either delicious or screechingly annoying, depending on how you prefer your tunes delivered, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is a dance/pop record that's a best of all worlds. <br /> <br />They want to make you dance, these guys form LA. And they succeed, in SOME tunes. When the record isn't busy spinning annoying fillers, it actually does make you want to move ... with the help of catchy, cathcy hooks, ofcourse. <br /> <br />It borrows from eightees pop, mixes it with modern day garage, and adds a flavor that you won't find anywhere but LA. And, of course, they can write lyrics.  <br /> <br />\\"Just for the record, The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of:  <br />A. Indifference or  <br />B. Disinterest in what the critics say\\" <br /> <br />Yea, folks, those are lyrics to a song. However, they're layed on top of synthesisers and guitar riffs, and drive many of the songs forward.  <br /> <br />MANY, but not all. There are clear fillers in the disk, which I won't go into detail about. Definetly check this album out, if you want a mash up of tons of different genres in rock and roll. <br /> <br />Recomended: <br />The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage <br />Build God, Then We'll Talk <br />I Constantly Thank God For Esteban <br />But It's Better If You Do  Listen  Listen <br />I Write Sins Not Tragedies  <br />London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000002KB8|4.0|Black sabbath started heavy metal with this album. They combined blues with heay rock in a way which had never been done before, they made the blues scary and evil. Not even Led Zeppelin made music this scary.   This cd is the most bluesy sounding of black sabbath's cd which kindda give it a unique sound. For one thing Ozzy plays the harmonica on the wizard and the mouthharp on the last track.       The songs are about magic,death, war, being heatbroken and it shows the evils of santanism in Black Sabbath and the rewards of being a santanist in N.I.B. If you like old fashioned blues rock but with a dark edge then get this cd.
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you work in a cubicle, this is a must see.  I won't go into the plot, since other reviewers have already done so.

B000002U82|1.0|This cd is highly overrated. I guess that when it came out all stoners liked so ever since then it's popularity built up. The music is very slow and it makes you want to fall asleep and nothing else. The only good song is \\"Money\\" but beyond that song this cd is bad unless you want some easy listening music to fall asleep to.
B000FILW86|5.0|It's so great to hear new Cheap Trick. This CD sounds so tight, so loud, so good, that it reminds me of the early Cheap Trick.    Listen, every track is great! If you like pop/hard rock buy this CD. If you're even a little bit of a Cheap Trick fan, buy this CD. It's been the only CD that's been in my player since I picked up this CD last week. I dig ever song. I find myself singing out loud to the songs, just like I was sixteen again. LOL!!    Look, this CD is under 15 bucks.Just whip out your credit card, buy it, and as soon as it arrives in the mail put it in your CD player. You'll have a helluva time!!
B000002I25|2.0|The doors were an okay band from the late 60's with some good songs but a lot of them aren't here. Most of the songs here are mediocre at best and the rest are just bad, but hey this is their first album but they do get better later on. One thing about the doors is that their lyrics are very childish and laughable which no one can HONESTLY deny. The last song the end starts out good but as it goes on with it's silly lyrics it just seems to fall apart. Anyways you're probably better off getting a best of because it will include the only good songs from here on it, break on through and light my fire. Like I wrote earlier I do like the doors but this cd is pretty bland and forgettable
B00004XQ83|4.0|I'll give this another shot... I did write a review for \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" earlier but that review was not allowed. I suppose it was because I might have been a little unkind to other styles of \\"Country\\" Music that are on the charts today. I suppose it is also because that when I listen to this CD I am reminded of just how much \\"Country\\" music has changed. And in my opinion (my opinion is allowed is it not?) today's \\"Country\\" music is not the kind of music I think of when I think of \\"Country\\" music. I do realize that is perfectly fine with a lot of people, I just happen not to be one of those who are OK with the typical Nashville fare.<br /><br />Actually the kind of music on this \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" CD would be better described as \\"Roots\\" music.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|I was truely blown away by this DVD and HATE myself for not seeing this film in the theatres. THE REASON I didn't see it in the theatres, by the way, is that I hate Mr. Jack Black and, at the time, thought he deserved no place in this film. Boy was I wrong and sorry for being mislead also by my friends and family who said he was bad. Quiet the opposite he was amazing and Peter Jackson step up to the plate with bases loaded with his lord of the rings saga and hit a grand slam. AMAZING.  <br /> <br />The effects were true to Jackson form, not over done, but we couldn't live without them. Kong was spectacular. His eyes had life and he successfully captured the lead role in this film.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie a million time over to anyone. Please buy it.
B00005R2M3|1.0|Where do I start? This is awful. \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" sounds too much like Alanis Morrisette's \\"Head Over Feet.\\" \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" sounds much better in the Spanish-version \\"Suerte\\" and the video to that was alright. The rest of the songs sound like 1980's leftovers retrieved from the trash. Other than that, Shakira sounds absolutely dreadful. It's like hearing someone scratching their nails down a chalkboard. This chick doesn't know if she wants to emulate Jewel, Alanis Morrisette, or Britney Spears.  But I guess she was like, \\"F*** it! I'll sound like all three!\\" and all you get is chaos. You can't even tell what kind of emotion Shakira is trying to express in a song because her voice is so messed up. \\"Laundry Service\\" sucks and \\"Oral Fixation\\" Vol. 1 and 2 are even worse. Shakira's easy on the eyes but she's killer on the ears. She needs to dye her back to its original black color and take some singing lessons.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I consider myself a fan of the sci-fi genera and I was really looking forward to watching this show after hearing all the rave reviews. I have to say I don't think I have ever been as disappointed with any other sci-fi show as I was with this. The production value was fair at best, but the acting and character concepts were downright poor. I should have known being that this is a Joss Whedon product that it would come off quite cheesy and poorly written. I know that people have fallen in love with this show, but I just can't seem to figure out why. Rent it first before you waste your money on buying it.
B000FA57RG|3.0|They shouldn't have even bothered releasing the dvd, other than the few lame bonus scenes it's the same version that was on mtv/logo! The live cd is great, but the dvd is a total disappointment!
B000000OE7|5.0|That's clearly the only explanation for why this album is so perfect. When you know what Freddie and the band were going through at the time of making some of these songs, you will definetely feel this album alot more. I will go as far to say that Made in Heaven is a masterpiece.  <br /> It's a beautiful day- you will find yourself singing this on beautiful days. Doesn't get old. possibly the best non-hit opening to a Queen album. <br />Made in Heaven- One of the best songs on here, Perfection. <br />Let me live- Nice song, a must for a Queen fan to listen to because all 3 singing members sing in it. <br />Mother Love- Dark, passionate, Freddie's vocal farewell. <br />My life has been saved- nice song, again a must hear for a fan. <br />I was born to love you- One of Freddie's best solo songs, made even better for this album. <br />Heaven for everyone- A very good song, very passionate and a must hear. <br />Too much love will kill you- Awesome song. <br />You don't fool me- The most underappreciated song on here, The guitar solo makes this song as it is one of the best guitar solos I've ever heard it's brilliant, passionate, dark, and energetic <br />A winter's tale- Freddie's last written farewell. Very touching and inspirational. The guitar solo is the most passionate piece of music I've ever heard, you can feel this song. <br />Reprise- The song was so good you really won't mind hearing it again with more of a rock feel. <br />YYYEEAAAHHHH!- Freddie's favorite word to add on to a lyric <br />Last Track- A journey to heaven. <br /> <br />If you liked Innuendo, which many people do, you would have to like Made in Heaven. I find Innuendo is only slightly better.  If you want an album with great guitar and passion Made in Heaven is essential.
B000GDH9RI|5.0|The famous last show of Nightwish with singer Tarja Turunen, just before she was fired. And guys, what a show ! The whole band is on top of their skills, including native american singer John Two-Hawks (the one who featured on Creek Mary's Blood). <br />This is really a must-have DVD if you're a fan of the band.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris are outstanding. These are great songs. You can't get the melodies or beat out of your head once you hear them. I like this CD. Came across it by pure chance (from a friend of a friend) and I like it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'll try to make this short... <br /> <br />I could write all day about tool. they could very well be the last great american rock band. really in my opinion you're either over here with me in the aural sunshine or you simply aren't. <br /> <br />this must be what it was like to get the newest led zeppelin album in the seventies. blast it in your car on the way home and treat the world to the best damn music the world is ever likely to hear. <br /> <br />great lyrics, great musicianship, no punches pulled, great album art concept. <br /> <br />it mystifies, possesses, and abandons you cold. the only complaint i have is it should've been a double CD. but don't fret kids, just put the whole album on repeat. there's stuff hiding in the thickness of this album that might jump out to subversively jar your brain. <br /> <br />and if you're on the other side of the fence; when you douted this album and said it was bad, or too short, or some silly thing, really what the heck were you thinking?
B000FILW86|5.0|Living in Australia occasionally means waiting for the `less commercial' new releases. I guess Cheap Trick falls (unfairly) into this category now, so I had to order my copy of Rockford from this site in May - then wait. It was hell reading everyone's reviews and feeling more than a little jealous about what I was missing out on. At the same time I was worried that I was letting other peoples opinions build up my expectations. Can't be helped though with 9/10 people giving it 5/5 - my excitement levels couldn't have been higher. Now I have it and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.    Was it co-incidence that Cheap Trick (97), which came as the bands self imposed rebirth, matched the raw rock intensity of their original self titled debut effort from 77? Was it co-incidence that their next effort (6 years after the rebirth), Special One matched the poppier sound of their original debut follow up, In Color? Surely it's not co-incidence that the new album, Rockford, like their third album, Heaven Tonight, is the perfect gel of both previous styles? That would be too freaky.  Co-incidence that like Heaven Tonight, Rockford rocks, is gentle, is pop, is full of hooks and fun and basically is everything a Cheap Trick album should be?  Lyrically it's nothing special, but since Heaven Tonight when have they been? And who cares? Not everyone needs to be Bob Dylan. Cheap Trick are good at writing catchy, instantly likeable songs and here, they perform to that strength with as much gusto and power as they did in 77/78.    Whenever an artist releases a new CD, they usually claim it to be their best release to date - for the long term guys, their best in `years'. Tom Petersson claimed this before Rockford's release and of course was met with some skepticism. We all hoped he was being honest and not just trying to sell albums, but by golly, he was telling the truth!!!  Many reviewers have claimed that this album is CT's best since the 70's and it may well be. On first listens it certainly sounds that way but whether it will age well or not, who can tell? Give it some years, THEN, it can be reasonably compared to previous efforts. The signs are good though and it's certainly set a new standard to base any future (hopefully many) releases on.    1. The opener, Welcome To The World is a short, straight to the point rocker. Perhaps their best opener since My Gang from Woke Up With A Monster.  2. Perfect Stranger is a great first up single, something Special One lacked. Let's hope it's a hit, though we all know it won't be.   3. If It Takes A Lifetime has good harmonies and is a nice catchy tune. Like most tracks here, the chorus is brilliant.  4. Come On Come On Come On is a straight up power rocker where Robin shrieks for his little baby to get on the floor and get down, down, down with him. The screaming `harmonies' are growing on me - slowly.....  5. O Claire I loved from second listen. It took the first listen to get used to Robin's vocal, then the melody hit me and I love it. My only gripe is that it probably has one chorus too many. It's a simple song and should be shorter. Very John Lennon / ELO - as stated by many before me.  6. This Time You Got It has a nice catchy pop sound to follow O Claire, but enough rock for it to fit in nicely with the rest of the album. The second `Yeah' is awesome. Catchy and fun. An early favorite.  7. Give It Away rocks. The guitar sounds like it's straight from the 70's - the way it should. Status Quo would be proud.  8. One More has a different sound. The chorus is very Def Leppard in a way. Lots of flavors to this song.  9. Every Night And Every Day returns CT back to the power-pop sound. Are they saying s*$t or ship in the background?  10. Dream The Night Away is also power-pop. Good track, nice chorus.   11. All Those Years is a highlight for me. I heard a `bootlegged' version of this several months before Rockford's release, supposedly from 1977 demos. That version sounds very similar to this version, if not a little better.  12. Decaf is a nice closer - much better than their last closer - Hummer. Borrows the whoa-o-o from I Can't Understand It - from Busted.     Once it all finishes all you'll want to do it start it all again and again. No filler. No bad tracks.    Is it better than In Color? Nothing they do ever will be nor should they try - having said that, they've apparently re-recorded and `rocked up' In Color recently to perhaps be released. Is it better than Cheap Trick (77) and Heaven Tonight? Possibly not and who would compare it to any album from that period anyway?   It's instantly likeable, where Cheap Trick (97) and Special One perhaps weren't, and I love those albums. Can't say yet whether I like it more than Woke Up With A Monster which is my second favorite CT album.   As mentioned, time will tell where it sits in their album rankings. At this early stage, it beats any of their 80's efforts. Even (it appears) the wonderful Next Position Please - having said that, NPP still sounds great after 23 years - will Rockford?  Hopefully this album will bring CT back onto the radio and into the charts where they deserve to be.   I don't agree with many that Robin's voice sounds as strong as ever. It's certainly more diverse here but the power aspect of his voice seems less natural than on previous efforts. That said, he's still the best around and sounds amazing, as do all the elements here. Tom's bass sounds wonderful, Rick's licks and Bun E's beat all work as well together as ever. The harmonies are spot on. Even the keyboards work.    Rockford rocks!! It has flavors from all CT's eras. 70's, 80's, 90's - they're all here. I can't wipe the smile off my face. Thanks CT.  Now, if only they'd tour Australia again, perhaps I could see them live!!!
0805066691|3.0|I read this book, translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil. This book has many informations, about genocidal pratices by USA's government and people in XIX Century. <br />The main problem of this book is, that it's biased.For 100% of american continent, indians were making inter-tribal wars, slavery, canibalism, human sacrifice,etc.If you are a \\"green\\" I must tell you that animals, such as the mamouth, were wiped out from the earth's face by indians. <br />Hernan Cortez took the Mexico not with about 200 men and some dozens of horses.Cortez took the Mexico with the help of many thousand of indians, who saw him as his liberator.They freely choose catholicism instead of human sacrifice's gods, created by indians minds. <br />Before Columbus there was about 3 millions of indians here in Brazil.Today we have about 175,000,000 of brazilians with indian's DNA, here in Brazil.And we don't have human sacrifice, canibalism or slavery; all normal life in brazilian (and american) tribes, before Columbus. <br />In USA and (english speaking)Canada really there was a terrible genocide and blood-bath.\\"Good indian is a killed indian\\", was the american and canadian politic in XVII,XVIII and XIX centuries.The luckiest of americans tribes, the Navajos, lost about 95% of is people in XIX Century.Remembering a forgotten genocide, this book his value.Having a clear bias, this book, does't tell you the fact, that there's no good savages. <br />Also there's no free launch.To produce this big power supporting the freedom in the world, many facts described in this book were needed to be did.To free Europe from nazism, it was needed to produce many bad things.To produce this super-power called USA, it was needed to put all indians in small reserves or exterminate indians, who didn't want to live there.There's no free launch and there's no good savages.

B000056JYB|5.0|This is the only way to hear Blind Faith.  The much finer seperation of vocals and instruments renders these discs indispensible to any respectable collection of psychedelic rock. Anyone who has enjoyed this classic collection of rock and roll's finest over the decades will instantly recognize new aural sensations on virtually every track.  Let me offer a couple observations as examples: 1) On 'Well, Alright' the lyrics are much more discernible, and the piano runs seem to feature twice the notes than could be distinguished on the previous releases; 2) During the sound FX segment at the end of 'Do What You Like', what sounds like an impression of Edward G. Robinson saying, \\"Yeah... Yeah...\\" in his distinctive tongue becomes readily listenable.  It's experiences like this that make the disc seem almost new again. <br /> <br />In addition to the tangible sound quality gains, we have bonus tracks and a bonus disc.  There is nothing invaluable here, but there is nothing you wouldn't want to hear, at least once.  Among the bonus tracks, the highlight would have to be the electric version of 'Can't Find My Way Home'.  Although the more delicate acoustic version remains superior, as an alternate take this version is like acquiring an addition to the original vinyl... it's that different.  While the other bonus tracks are interesting, they really don't fit in with the psychedelic-rock feel of the original 'Blind Faith'.  Two versions of the Sam Myers blues track, 'Sleeping In the Ground' bookend the bonus selections.  I prefer the first, but the second, \\"slow blues version\\" features some inspired pickin' from the blues man himself, Eric Clapton.  'Time Winds' is a pop instrumental, featuring fine iterplay between Clapton's lead guitar and Steve Winwood's organ.  'Acoustic Jam', all 15:50 of it, is the only jam track to feature the full Blind Faith line-up.  It's slow-paced jazz-fusion featuring acoustic guitar and piano leads.  As with all the jam tracks, there is nothing extrordinary here except who the performers are, and when they were performing.   <br /> <br />The bonus disc offers four expendable jam tracks, reminicent of the jam disc George Harrison offered in the 'All Things Must Pass' box set. Although the first jam is titled 'Very Long and Good Jam', there is only one jam that is shorter.  It is probably the most coherant of the jams, starting out tame but gradually building intensity.  'Slow Jam #1 is next.  It opens with about four minutes of fine guitar from Clapton, then goes through a couple breakdowns and rebuilds of the basic theme.  'Change of Address Jam' brings Winwood's organ to the fore, while Clapton plays the same riff over and over for what seems like an eternity.  'Slow Jam #2' is the longest and weakest jam, returning to the semi-jazz formula of 'Acoustic Jam', and featuring an undistinguished one-minute drum solo from Ginger Baker.  Blind Faith bassist Rich Grech is not featured on the bonus disc. <br /> <br />This Deluxe Edition of Blind Faith comes nicely packaged and illustrated.  There are numerous photographs from the sessions offered, along with detailed information on the tracks themselves, and informative liner notes courtesy of John McDermott.  The digipak syling is enveloped in a plastic slipcase, which seems to address the controversial cover image of the nude girl with a strategically placed white 'veil'!  I guess we're not as liberal as we use to be!  All in all, a worthy purchase, most notably for the improved, remastered sound.  Anything and everything else was bound to be icing on the cake, and it is.

B00005JOVH|2.0|Never before have I waited with so much breathless anticipation for a film to be so utterly disappointed.  The premise of \\"X-3\\" held so much promise and yet failed to deliver anything of substance beyond some impressive looking, yet still somehow bland, battle sequences.  Without giving away details, the death of certain important characters pass by producing a lack of emotional response from an audience that should more properly be devastated, not merely thinking \\"Gee . . . what a bummer.\\"   <br /> <br />The manner in which the Dark Phoenix was presented was mind numbingly bad.  Astonishingly bad.  Bad, bad, bad.  (Did I mention it was bad?)  Instead of the soul tortured Jean returning and unleashing her demonic powers, we have Famke Jannsen with contact lensed googly eyes while it looks like she's being poked from behind with a cattle prod.  Yeah, there's some intense drama for you.   <br /> <br />The only real \\"fun\\" in the movie (if it can be called that) is watching the increasingly insane behavior of Magneto.  Ian McKellen almost realizes there's no way to play this but waaaaay over the top . . . and thank God, for him.   <br /> <br />As Beast, Kelsey Grammer makes a brilliant debut to the X-series, however not even he can charm his way through some of the most inane dialogue written - even for a comic book movie.  Still, Grammer's Beast is wicked cool!   <br /> <br />The dialogue throughout seems to have been written by high school fans and shows remarkably little respect for the intelligence of either the films characters, or the audience cajoled into watching this mess.  One perfect example of this occurs when, as preparing to battle Magneto and his enormous forces, Iceman tells Wolverine something like \\"But there's only a handful of us against all of them\\" to which Wolverine responds \\"I'm not going to lie to you. We are outnumbered.\\"  Oh, really?   <br /> <br />Jackman is always fun and his Wolverine remains probably the coolest character to make the transition from comic book to screen, but he figures too prominently here - and even he can't save this mess. <br /> <br />Its runtime of just over 90 minutes doesn't help either - everything blurs together too quickly with little time for development, which means little empathy from the audience.  See it if you have to, but be forewarned, X-III falls flat like a badly, took-quick cooked soufflé.   <br /> <br />
0670874817|4.0|I really liked reading this book.<br /><br />But I skipped over the majority of the<br /><br />boring war stuff that she tends to ramble<br /><br />on and on about. The beginning of the book<br /><br />would probably be the best part.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Many other reviewers have pointed out, ad nauseam, that this film is confusing, challenging, and difficult. True. But this is intentional. While the viewer is struggling to figure out what the hell is going on, the characters are likewise scratching their heads, trying to figure out what the hell is goin on---with one exception: <br /> <br />The oil executives. <br /> <br />As the film makes clear above all else, the entire world is sinking into the quagmire that the oil companies have built for us.  <br /> <br />It's like those bumper stickers: \\"If you're not completely outraged, you haven't been paying attention.\\" SYRIANA asks you, begs you, to pay attention, to become outraged, to run to your window and scream, \\"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this any more!\\"  <br /> <br />Those who approach this film with apathy probably, with the same apathy, fill up their Hummers with $3 a gallon gas. It's their right, sure, but for those of us who DO care, who ARE paying attention---it's time to get outraged. Watch SYRIANA for starters.    <br />   <br /> <br />

B00005ATQD|4.0|With Kubrick, in most cases, either you're \\"in\\" or you're \\"out\\" if you know what I mean.  His films are traditionally a little more tense and slower paced that the typical \\"Blow something up every 3 minutes\\" movie.  That's 100% good with me so right away I was expecting a Kubrick-esque film. <br /> <br />Man did I ever get it!  This was a very intricate look at how relationships work and what each of our expectations can be like.  We clearly assume WAY too much and this film really highlights that fact well.  You can feel the frustration of Tom Cruise's character as his wife reveals her inner-most fantasies and secrets.  How could this be he thinks?  Well, that's what \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" means!  He sees everything around him but doesn't actually \\"see it\\".  His classic view of how Men think and how Women think is all but blown to shreds by his wifes revelations.  Nearly every situation he gets in he is tempted or at least has to deal with a sexual gratification offer and has a hard time escaping.  Its almost as if he is being tested by the marriage gods or something.  Great concept, very cool. <br /> <br />The mansion orgy/sex costume party scene was very dreamy and erotic... it could even be a little frightening only because this is very over the top stuff for the \\"Joneses\\" in the world and you really had no freegin idea what the hell Stanley was up to.  I mean what the frick were these people thinking?  Either way, like a train wreck,you can't possibly look away!  I had no idea what to expect with this scene and as usual, Stanley shot it just perfectly with that artsy touch combined with palpable tension.  There was a lot of nudity but it was never \\"dirty\\", at least in principle so I had no problem with it.  The Euro version has even more skin.  <br /> <br />I will say that the end was rather abrupt and a few loose ends remained but overall I liked this movie a lot and will probably purchase it.  <br /> <br />I will warn you though... it is classic Kubrick style withlonger scenes, slower pacing, and plenty of build up before much happens.  It is beautifully filmed though and it was easy to feel immersed in the story.  Just don't expect a slam, bam action flick. <br /> <br />HIGHLY Recommended!
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|If you didn't know this album was recorded in 2006 you'd think you were having a flashback to the golden age of classic rock.  My favorite bands were kicking a#@ at that time and now Wolfmother are here to carry the mantle...About freakin' time too!  Listening to this album, every track, is a breath of fresh (yet familiar) air.  Listening to this album the first time in my car I nearly ruined the seat!  Why?  Because I heard all my favorites once again.  Here are the bands I heard being channeled by Wolfmother on this album.  There are more I'm sure because every time I listen I hear someone else: <br />-Black Sabbath: (several songs, esp. Dimension, Joker and the Thief, and Pyramid.) <br />-White Stripes: (several songs, esp. Dimension and Apple Tree.) <br />-Led Zeppelin: (Woman and Mind's Eye.) <br />-Grand Funk Railroad: (White Unicorn) <br />-Yes: (White Unicorn) <br />-The Who: (Colossal and Mind's Eye.) <br />-Jethro Tull: (Flute solo on Witchcraft.) <br /> <br />And I caught them playing live on Jimmy Kimmel.  The lead singer looks like Marc Bolan and plays like Angus Young.   <br /> <br />With this combination, they can do no wrong... at least for now. <br />
B000FBGBPC|3.0|One-X was kinda what i expected, their first CD was much better, however im not saying that this album is bad but they could have done better. i kinda expected more from their new guitarist, the one thing they have always lacked is axeman ship. not that their new guitarist is bad but you could expect more then just a few well placed bar chords. never the less, its worth hearing if your a fan of the band.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Austin Powers, back again for Goldmember.  As usual, with half the characters played by Mike Myers, nothing is really out of the ordinary. Dr. Evil and his clone, Mini Me go back to 1975 to find Goldmember, a lover of gold trying to take over the world.  When Austin goes back, he find sexy Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles)and they work together to find Dr. Evil and Goldmember.  In the meanwhile, Austin's father, Nigel Powers gets kidnapped by Goldmember and Austin saves him. <br /> <br />The biggest problem of the movie is that Beyonce can't act.  Her punchline is \\"Shazzam\\".  The movie is extremely funny, but no serious people would want to see it.  If you came for a James Bond movie, you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for a few good laughs, Goldmember is for you.
B000FA57RG|5.0|I saw the Re-Invention Tour and have been wanting to relive the event for the past two years.  The cd thrilled me.  Yeah it is lip synched on Beast Within because she wasn't on stage for that track and the same with Hollywood.  Regardless this gives a good glimpse into Re-Invention which may be all we ever get since the Tour looks like it will never be released on DVD.  I was upset that the American Life video wasn't included as was reported earlier on press releases.  The bonus footage is interesting and even fun with a closer look at Stuart.  It is so worth the money I spent and it put a smile on my face as I listened and relived the tour!!!!
B00006WUWN|3.0|I'm a big fan of the first 2, but this one just seemed unnecessary. Most of the jokes in this one are recycled from the 2nd one and other jokes were just stupid. The only funny moments came mostly with scenes that had dr evil in them and the \\"mole\\" scenes were pretty funny to. But, even some of the scenes with dr evil were kinda stupid. The opening credits thing was really stupid to, it just went too far with the cameos. I really only bought this one cause it was like 5 bucks at compusa. Overall: If you've seen the first two, just stick with those cause you won't be getting anything new from this one.

B000002LTU|4.0|A lot of fans prefer status quo. Miles said in an interview that he hated doing is old stuff, so essentially all of his music was experimental; some worked, some less so. That said, this is an excellent album, regardless of whether it was supposed to be hip-hop or country western. The great thing about Miles Davis was that he had no use for boundaries. When people think of jazz, the name \\"Miles\\" always comes up because he embodied the very soul of jazz. I have been a fan of what I consider his post-fusion days of the late 1970s, so my favorite albums by Miles aren't always considered his best: \\"Get up with It\\"; \\"Siesta\\"; \\"Directions\\"; and even his later \\"Tutu.\\" Bottom line for me is this: so-called purists won't like any Miles Davis music performed after the early 1960s. \\"Bitches Brew\\" thrust him into a whole new realm of non-categories. \\"Doo-Bop\\" may not be Miles Davis' best music, but it's sure better than most of the MOR crap that passes for jazz these days.
B00008WT5J|4.0|Not the greatest collection of AC/DC tunes, but not bad.  I saw the movie 'Maximum Overdrive' before I knew of this album.  The thing I remember most from the movie is how freakin' awesome the soundtrack was.  It made the movie great!  What's better than having an all AC/DC soundtrack? <br /> <br />The best track, in my opinion is 'Ride On' of course.  I also like the short instrumental 'D.T.'  The one thing that makes me keep watching the movie is that some of the licks that Angus Young uses in the movie didn't make it to this album (unfortunately), as they are great and bluesy. <br /> <br />All in all this is a great album (like most AC/DC albums) and worth purchasing if you are an AC/DC fan.  Actually you should already own it if you are a true fan.
B000ESSTL0|5.0|During my freshman year of high school, I started to go through a massive musical re-awakening. Before that period of time, I bounced around between hip hop and even metal, but during four years of high school my interests changed dramatically and set the stage for what ultimately became the types of music that I've been obsessed about for the past 15 years. Along with New Order, The Cure, R.E.M., and Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode was one of a core group of bands that really set the wheels in my head into motion regarding the different possibilities of sound itself.<br /><br />  It may sound like I'm being a little overdramatic in saying the above, but as a kid living in a small (800 people) town in the middle of the country (remember, this is pre-internet), all that I was aware of for the longest period of time was classic rock, metal, and whatever popular songs crept through the local radio market. During my freshman year, an \\"alternative\\" radio station set up shop and it seemed like every couple weeks I'd hear something that would blow my mind. \\"Personal Jesus\\" was one of those tracks, and when I got ahold of the entire Violator album, the group immediately shot to the top of my favorite artists pile.<br /><br />  As was the case with any group that I discovered, I went back and purchased a good portion of their back catalogue. Although the group was remarkably consistent during their heyday (which in my opinion would be between Some Great Reward and Songs Of Faith And Devotion), to this day I still feel like Violator is the pinnacle of their work. The singles on the release were so amazing that I'd venture to say that anyone who's owned the album could sing along with any of them (\\"Policy Of Truth,\\" \\"Enjoy The Silence,\\" Personal Jesus,\\" anyone?) to this day, while even the non-single tracks have such a great amount of depth that Violator is one of those albums that's truly so in the greatest sense of the word. Every song is essential, and the nine song, forty-seven minute running length almost feels brief once it's stopped playing.<br /><br />  In fact, some of the lesser-known songs on the release have always been my favorite. The dark \\"Sweetest Perfection\\" shows off some great production flourishes as minimal beat programming shuffles behind overlapping layers of swirling synths and a couple touches of guitar (and even a nice synth orchestra interlude) while subtle vocal harmonies glue the song together. On the perennially-underrated \\"Waiting For The Night,\\" they pull back into minimal, repetitive synth arpeggio's and more great vocal treatments to create a claustrophobic ballad that's quite stunning.<br /><br />  Considering the groundbreaking nature of the album (it sold something like 8 million copies worldwide), it comes as no surprise that it's gotten the remaster treatment. In all honesty, this remastered version of Violator doesn't sound a whole lot different than the original, which is actually a good thing in my mind. The DVD bonus material is the stuff that will really appeal to fans, as all the original tracks are featured in 5.1 mixes, along with some great b-sides (including one of DM's best ever in \\"Dangerous\\"). In addition, the DVD portion contains a short but informative and highly interesting documentary about the making of the album and the post-release hoopla surrounding it (including a near-riot at an L.A. record store where 17,000 people showed up to get autographs from the group).<br /><br />  With Violator, the group for the first time ditched their self-imposed rule about not using any guitars, and through a series of events that included hiring young and upcoming producer Flood, Depeche Mode created what is easily a classic in the genre. It's dance pop with a touch of rock, and because it blurs so many lines (including where synths end and guitars begin), it manages to hold up just fine sixteen years after it originally came out. If you're a huge fan, you'll probably want this version, but if youdon't own Violator at all, you probably should.<br /><br />(from almost cool music reviews)this version, but if you don't own Violator at all, you probably should. <br /> <br />(from almost cool music reviews)

B00005O438|2.0|After four notable and largely successful adaptations; \\"Carrie\\", \\"Salem's Lot\\", \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Creepshow\\" the bubble inevitably had to burst on Stephen King's translation to the screen. What is distinguishable about those previous four films is the impressive reputations of the four directors attached to them; Brian De Palma, Tobe Hooper, Stanley Kubrick and George A. Romero respectively. Sadly with \\"Cujo\\" Lewis Teague fails to make the high grade these directors had established with their films. Teague was no doubt utilised due to his 1980 revolt of nature B movie \\"Alligator\\". With \\"Cujo\\" he would be treading similar but less fantastical territory. It is unfair to entirely blame Teague for the shortcomings of the film. The novel itself places great weight on a child and a dog, and one gets the impression Teague was on a hiding to nothing (creatively rather than commercially.). Even so the film is quite charming in the sequences prior to the titular St. Bernard's encounter with an angry rabies infested bat. But Teague fails to make convincing the tale of adultery and familial breakdown that is really at the heart of the story. The novel seeks to punish adultery, and the film still contains these echoes, but Teague is very much aware that this is a film about a killer dog. The result is a poorly scripted and poorly acted (Dee Wallace aside) film that seems slow and laboured. Nevertheless by the standards of the decade, \\"Cujo\\" has to be considered a reasonable effort, but Teague ultimately is unable to overcome the complexities and texture of the novel, which would have been more suited to the TV movie format.

B0002F6AZC|1.0|The portmanteau or anthology film whilst having the potential to be utilised by all cinematic genres, has found its place in modern cinema within the horror genre. Perhaps it is the genres success within the realm of short stories, or perhaps less positively the fact the horror relies less on character development and more on spectacle. Early examples include Paul Leni's expressionistic \\"Waxworks\\" from 1924, but possibly the most successful still remains Ealing Studio's \\"Dead of Night,\\" which when released in 1945 addressed post-war anxiety and themes of time and memory. For many years British cinema was most associated with the form thanks to the efforts of Amicus Studios, who churned out several such films between 1964 and 1974. However these simplistic morality tales, whilst based on the exaggerations of E.C. Comics lacked the visual punch to support the black humour.<br /><br />Inevitably American cinema was to get in on the act when the bottom fell out of the British film industry. The first \\"Creepshow\\" film was a beautifully and highly stylised effort which placed major emphasis on recreating the visual dynamics of E.C. Comics. Romero and his team succeeded so well in fact that only recent adaptations of Frank Miller's graphic novels comes anywhere near to \\"Creepshow.\\" The use of colours, economical direction and histrionic performances by engaging veteran actors papered over the obvious shortcomings of the dialogue.<br /><br />Unfortunately \\"Creepshow 2\\", which is directed by Michael Gornick in a state of what can only be described as catatonia fails on almost every level where the first succeeded. The first two stories are miserable and moody and lack humour, which means that the poetic justice meted out at the finale of each, is curiously flat. However the second story, entitled \\"The Raft\\" and the only one directly based on a Stephen King short story does have an exciting climax, but one has to wade through dire acting and irritating characters to get there. The third story \\"The Hitchhiker\\" is the most ridiculous and absurd of the three, but works the best. It is the only one that comes anywhere near to the E.C. Comics mentality and the original \\"Creepshow\\" in terms of excess and exaggeration. The bridging narrative is crudely animated and dull like the rest of the film. The film is not entirely devoid of interest though, but the flat and dreary television film look ultimately undoes any lasting interest.ry \\"The Hitchhiker\\" is the most ridiculous and absurd of the three, but works the best.

B00005QGAX|5.0|This album is the best peace of music ever put together since the music instruments have been invented. I've always been the greatest fan of Michael Jackson and I bought all of his first original CD editions. The quality of sound is quite the same on this Remastered edition as on the regular Bad Audio CD. But now there are extra songs made for the album that were never released. The CD Booklet is filled with more pictures and the CD label looks much better than on the first Bad edition. This is a must-have for any Michael Jackson fan. Don't think, Just buy it.
0679422714|4.0|A very deep study of Mao's every move for decades, with each questionable decision and hidden agenda explained in great detail, using documents from around the world as evidence...but as dry as that sounds, it's actually quite a page-turner. I started reading this at the same time as a Gao Xingjian novel and found this book even more compelling than the fiction. <br /> <br />After reading this compendium of selfish atrocities, it is very hard to see people my age (college- to post-college) wearing this man's image as little more than a fashion statement. Were this required reading, the man would be as reviled as Hitler. <br /> <br />But along those lines, my only criticism is that this book is so virulently anti-Mao that it clearly delves into pure opinion periodically, and the personal tone of it makes me suspect its objectivity a lot. Surely SOMETHING that Mao did over the course of his ENTIRE lifetime had pure intent?

B000F7CMRM|4.0|\\"Syriana\\" allows writer/director to create a rich quartet of stories built around the need, desire and acquision of oil. A complex political drama Stephen Gaghan examines the complex wheeling and dealing in the world of oil and how it effects both the personal and political. \\"Syriana\\" isn't for everyone; some people will find this interwoven tale to be boring. If you enjoyed \\"Traffic\\" you'll enjoy \\"Syriana\\". Also, if you're not in tune with the film's politics you probably won't find it fair balanced or enjoy the film quite as much. Regardless of the politics its clear that Gaghan has tried to make a film that deals with a complex subject that isn't easily rectified.<br /><br />George Clooney (who won an Oscar for his role) plays Bob Barnes a CIA operative working undercover as an arms smuggler in the Middle East trying to uncover plots against our government, taking out the bad guys all without drawing too much suspicion to himself. Barnes is conflicted and literally coming apart at the seams much like a John Le Carre character--he's not the spy who came out of the cold but one that has been locked out and invited in only long enough to prevent emotional frostbite from destroying his mind. He's coasting though as he's jaded and burned out. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) represents a potential Emir (Alexander Siddig, \\"Deep Space Nine\\" and \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\") who is jostling for political power within his kingdom and trying to cut the right deal for oil rights that might save his land and enrich his family at the same time. Corporate lawyer Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) represents the interests of an oil company trying to navigate the shark infested waters of a merger while dealing with his drug addled brother. There's a forth part of the story that ties into Clooney's involving Muslim youths training to be terrorists but it isn't given as much screen time as the other trio of stories and as such can be seen as part of Clooney's as his fate is ultimately and tragically tied into that of the terrorists.<br /><br />This DVD looks marvelous. The washed out look of the film is intentional. Cinemattographer Robert Elswit uses his jumpy handheld camera work to sell the quasi-documentary feel of the film. The colors are solid as are the blacks and fit into the color scheme of the film. I didn't detect any digital blemishes that are worthwhile noting. Contrast is terrific whether it be in the blinding white desert or the dark streets of Washington D.C. and detail is crisp throughout the film. Gaghan doesn't overwhelm the audience with activity in the 5.1 soundtrack reserving the format for dramatic effect such as an unexpected bomb blast or torture scene (and there is a quite graphic one involving Clooney).<br /><br />The extras are a bit of a let down unless you get the Best Buy edition of the film. We don't get a commentary track (perhaps Gaghan felt it would be explaining too much) but we do get a 10 minute interview with George Clooney, three deleted scenes playable together, a political charge featurette \\"Make A Change, Make A Difference\\" that sells the political agenda of the film far more explicitly than the film itself  and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />I have the feeling that a double dip will be down the line only because retailer Best Buy is offering a second exclusive disc with content that includes a discussion with a real CIA operative discussing the film. To be fair to Warner usually this studio isn't well known for doing double dips as often or thoughtlessly as other studios so don't know any of this for a fact. Usually these bonus discs end up as part of material for later more elaborate sets. I can't confirm this at this film but it feels right particularly after Lion's Gate's \\"Crash\\" re-release. The \\"Best Buy\\" extra disc has a 30 minute documentary with the writer/director discussing the making of the film and how he researched it as well as how he worked with the author of the book to do his research by visting the places and people that he portrayed. There's also a 20 minute interview with Matt Damon included as well.<br /><br />This is a dense, elaborate political thriller \\"Syriana\\" doesn't exactly paint stereotypical pictures of bad guys and good guys. Instead we have a world of grays where oil and the pursuit of political power are more the villains (along with the things that people are willing to do to achieve their ends). Tense and filled with marvelous performances \\"Syriana\\" isn't for everyone but it's still a powerful drama filled with the dark political overtones of our time. \\"Syriana\\" packs quite a lot of story into its 128 minute running time. You'll either walk away unsettled, feeling vindicated given the current state of our own oil crisis or mad at the political point-of-view of the film. You won't coming away feeling indifferent. Perplexed at the multiple storylines that seem to randomly zigzag without a possible intersection point but definitely impressed with some element of the film whether it be the technical aspect or the drama.he portrayed.

074322454X|5.0|This was the first book that I read from Mr. Ambrose, after I saw the HBO series. And the book blew me away, even there was not much the book brought forth, because the series was quite a truthfull adaption of the book. My grandpa, who died in the early 80`s, was also a paratrooper, unfortunately on the side of the Germans. All I knew about the war was, that he and his comrades had to endure a very hard training (they were kicked out of the plane, if they didn`t want to jump etc.). So it was very interesting to read what it was like to jump fro a plane sometimes into hell itself. Unfortunately Mr. Ambrose isn`t still with us , so that I could thank him personally for the information which I couldn`t get from my grandpa, because of his early death. A must read for everybody who`s interested in WWII.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|The movie was awful. Not only did the plot not make any sense, the audience really does not sympathize with either of the two main characters. It also was violent for violent's sake. It was all shot in a very unlovable and gritty lighting. The CGIs were unrealistic and distracting. <br /> <br />I didn't like the main female character's husky voice. She delivered a poor acting performance. As for the angel, why? why? why? Why the ridiculously cut hair? The characters seemed to be thrown in, all with their slightly different accents or speaking styles. It's a big mess, all glued together at the end, without having thought everything through. <br /> <br />Oh, and the cab driver boy was annoying. <br /> <br />Ugh! what a junk of a movie. How can rate this less than one star?

I WOULD LIKE IT A LOT BETTER IF IT WAS LESS CLEANED UP AND POLISHED. KURT COBAIN ALSO HAD THE SAME THOUGHTS ABOUT IT. I THINK THEY SHOULD COME OUT WITH A REMIX, SOUNDING MORE LIKE NIRVANA MADE IT SOUND LIVE. <br /> <br />1. SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT - MY LEAST FAVORITE NIRVANA SONG. VERY MAINSTREAM. <br />2.

TERRITORIAL PISSINGS - GREAT SONG, ONE OF THE FEW POLITICAL NIRVANA SONGS. <br />8. DRAIN YOU - AN OK SONG <br />9. LOUNGE ACT - ONE OF THE STANDOUT SONGS ON THE ALBUM, A LITTLE DIFFERENT. <br />1O. STAY AWAY - PRETTY GOOD SONG, KIND OF REMINDS ME OF BREED FOR SOME REASON. <br />11. ON A PLAIN - I REALLY LIKE THE LYRICS TO THIS SONG. <br />12.

1400079179|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read. The idea behind the book was so original and unique. I tend to read the same type of books and this book was different and I really liked that quality. The first few chapters drag a bit, but once you get past those it is a non-stop roller-coaster of emotions.I think Dan Brown did an excellent job of making complicated issues easy to understand and read. If you are looking for a unique type of book that will make you think, but at the same time entertain your imagination I would reccomend this book to you!
074322454X|5.0|I got this book after watching the DVD series of the HBO miniseries for about the 3rd time. <br /> <br />The book is wonderful if you feel like you can't get enough of the story of these remarkable men. <br /> <br />It is books like this that have turned me off to fiction, entirely.  The things in this book are too great to seem real, yet they happened. <br /> <br />If you loved the miniseries and/or are fascinated by military history you will love the book.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Ok, aside from the random ignorant reviewer who gives this album a poor review for reasons i still cant understand, I think we can all agree that they have done something very special here, and if I trust my foresight, I think in ten years this album will be alot like one such as BSSM in that it will still be thoroughly and often listened to, and a sentiment at that. The only component missing in this album being a classic is time and sentimentality, and in ten years those of us who already get it will have our opinions solidified and others who don't get it probably will with some time. <br /> <br />After much listening, I'll comment on my top ten favorite moments on this album... <br /> <br />1) The last chorus in She's Only 18. The storm sirens in the background make this the most urgent and pounding 20 seconds on the album. <br /> <br />2) The beginning of Readymade, climaxing with the introduction of the first sound of the drums and the WOAHHHHHHHH. Pure liquid energy at its best when played at a very high volume. Oh, and the rest of this song too. <br /> <br />3) 3:16-3:40 on Wet Sand. A total explosion beginning with the final chorus. <br /> <br />4) The verse in the middle of She Looks to Me starting with \\"Down in the South Seas\\". <br /> <br />5) Dirty baby time you're gonna take some <br />Pretty baby love you're make some <br />Little lady hearts you're gonna break some <br />Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some <br /> <br />6) The chorus of Especially in Michigan, particularly the chanting in unison. <br /> <br />7) The short but sweet guitar solo in Stadium Arcadium. <br /> <br />8) \\"There's a reason for the 21st century, not too sure but I know its meant to be\\". Not sure why but i think this is my favorite single line on the album for being so well sung. <br /> <br />9) The verse in Tell Me Baby starting with \\"Chitty chitty baby <br />When your nose is in the nitty gritty\\"-- just because it takes me right back to BSSM every time I hear it. <br /> <br />10) Death of a Martian as the best closer of any Chili Peppers album. \\"The nova..

B000FA57RG|5.0|I last saw Madonna live on June 15th at Chicago's United Center on her latest trek titled \\"Confessions Tour\\".  This cd makes me relive those memories all over again.  I also had the privilege of seeing Madonna on the Re-Invention Tour in Atlanta Ga.  I think the sound quality on the cd in this package rivels that of the concert itself.  Trully wonderful mastering.  They managed to keep the integrity of the tour's sound and the essence that made the tour so special.  Yes, the visuals and special effects were great on Re-Invention, and they are just as good if not better on the Confessions Tour, but what it all comes down too is the music.  After all it wouldn't be a tour without music, right?  The music on this disc in incredible, and yes there are a few songs missing, but I'm not here to speak about what isn't there...that would be a waste of a good review.  And as for the documentary, that get's 5 out of 5 stars as well.  I am also a student of Kabbalah, and this documentary manages to capture the very essence of the changes one goes through as a true student.  The method of application is pure genius, the message--pure love, and the quality is second to none.  Thank you Madonna, for sharing with us another great addition to your already extensive catalog of pure entertainment.  Madonna knows how to keep her fans trully entertained, and this set makes me proud to say to everyone--I AM A MADONNA FAN!!!
0802130208|1.0|I have just finished reading Confederacy of Dunces.  At 41 years old, I have no heistation - not a moment's - in shouting as loudly as possible that this is, quite simply, the worst piece of utter cr*p I have ever read. <br /> <br />I am open-mouthed in complete astonishment that anyone can say this is anywhere near approaching `good' or even `readable'.  It is just cr*p.  There is no alternative but to resort to the vernacular.  So, the author committed suicide because no-one would publish it?  Really, you don't say?  If I'd have been around, I would have shot him and saved him the bother.  God in Heaven, I was ready to commit suicide within 50 pages!  There is not an ounce of skill in this; no rhyme nor reason.  What is the point of this book?  It starts nowhere, it goes nowhere, it ends nowhere.  The lead character, Ignatius J Reilly, is as unlikeable and unbelievable as he is fat.  Other characters just drift in and out like ... I don't know what.  I am lost for words to describe how turgid this waste of paper is. <br /> <br />The dialogue is just ridiculous.  It doesn't make sense.  At the start, Ignatius and his mother have the most nonsensical conversation that alternates, line by line, between togetherness, hatred, stupidity...  And then much later in the book, Ignatius has some seemingly drug-induced psycho-babble between himself and an effete Dorian Greene.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to even follow this dialogue, let alone make sense of it.  It is the sort of stuff you'd expect a 12-year-old to write, it really is. <br /> <br />One reviewer on Amazon says he farted he laughed so much.  I sat frowning at how such rubbish ever made it into print. <br /> <br />I had the Penguin version with the striped box of popcorn on the front.  If you have yet to buy this book (declare bankruptcy to avoid the prospect), flick to page 271 and read from the top to the end of the chapter on page 283, or as far as you can get before the bookshop staff get restless.  If you haven't been put off by these pages, then, OK, this book is for you.  God help you. <br /> <br />I admit that I raised my personal rating from one-out-of-ten to two, purely because I thought: there must be a point to this, there must be something at the end that will make me think this was worth my time.  But no.  Nothing. <br /> <br />Clearly the author John Kennedy Toole was a closet gay, but he conveys his baggage (understandable for the era) in the Ignatius character in the most revolting ways. <br /> <br />Don't ever, ever, ever waste time or money on this piece of cr*p. <br />
0743490304|3.0|This book holds very few surprises.  The plot is interesting and has a lot of potential, but Brown doesn't do enough to build characters, motivation, plot, or most disappointingly the clues.  Brown's hallmark is the mystery walkthrough... A leads to B... B leads to C... etc.  And its a formula that works well for his writing style and readership.  The largest disappointment in this novel was the ending.  Without spoiling it suffice it to say the final \\"clue\\" can be determined by the second puzzle piece near the end of the book... Then we are forced to read about 50 pages of the characters figuring out clues that were already obvious to the reader.  While determining the LIKELY truth early can happen, to be absolutely sure of the answer well before the so-called climax is disheartening to say the least.  Overall the read was fair, I would probably buy it again, but I'd suggest you not go into it with the same hopes you may have had for the Code or Angels and Demons... To sum it up this felt like it was written for a younger readership than the other books by Brown... and his readership is already fairly \\"young\\" in my opinion so it was a little frustrating...
B000FA57RG|3.0|ALL THIS DID WAS MAKE ME WANT A RE-INVENTION TOUR DVD ALL THE MORE.  THE MUSIC SEQUENCES WERENT FULL AS PROMISED AND WHERE IS THE AMERICAN LIFE VIDEO THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BONUS????
B000002PCS|5.0|I honestly can't think of one negative regarding this movie. I grew up with it and after all of these years it's still my favorite love story. The music is absolutely beautiful, the actors phenomenal, and the whole setting on the movie as a whole is perfect. I've been a Christopher Reeve fan for as long as I can remember and he seemed to fit the part so well.     To go a little off track from the subject here...    It's almost erie (a good erie) that after Mr. Reeve died, his wife followed him about 2 years later and they're together again in their own happy ending love story. JMHO :)
B000EXZI0A|4.0|If I rate this with 4 stars and not 5 is for one simple reason: C'mon man, lets get serious for a sec, here: I am THE biggest \\"pinhead\\" ever (and by that, I mean, the biggest Ramones fan...), but I will always be the first to admit the truth: The Ramones NEVER had any \\"hits\\" to speak of. Cult following, over a dozen albums, over 20 years of career... yeah, all of that, but \\"hits\\"... I don't think so!<br /><br />Mainstream success eluded the Ramones during all their career. That's not to say that they didn't have great songs, it simply means that their commercial success was very limited. Few bands have had (and will have) the impact and the influence of the Ramones, but the \\"Greatest Hits\\" label really doesn't apply here. Of course, record companies wouldn't know the first thing about common sense, so... clearly in this case they should have used the \\"Best Of\\" tag, but...anyway, who cares about semantics?<br /><br />We're talking punk rock, here, and the Ramones were trailblazers. All the songs here are punk rock classics. As we all know, everyone has their own personal favorites, so everyone has the right to moan and complain about the omission of this song or that song but... the bottom line: if you are a pinhead, you don't need this. If you are looking for a first taste of the Ramones, then this could be the right place to start.<br /><br />But personally, I would recommend either \\"Ramonesmania\\" or \\"Ramones: Loud and Fast\\" over this new compilation, simply because they have more songs... it's a little more dough, but it's well worth it. And obviously, \\"Anthology\\" is the superior choice...(not to mention the Box Set...)
B000F7CMRM|1.0|I have rarely been as bored and confused as I was while watching Syriana. Don't give me that stuff about the non-linear approach of this movie and Çrash. What it all boils down to is seeing good actors giving solid performances within a context of nothing.
0385504209|4.0|Ok...after reading the book, and reading these reviews, I really don't understand all of you who are BENT up about this book not being truthful...what part of FICTION don't you understand? Next time you purchase a book look up and see what section you are in (fiction or nonfiction) and then maybe you will understand from the start what you are getting! SILLY SILLY!!!

B000060OFT|4.0|This version of Romeo and Juliet is certainly more applicable to a younger audience, but that is not to say older ones won't appreciate this version as well. For one thing, there are many visuals that do transcend into the modern era of time, one of which is simply the raucous manner of the two families towards each other, which we see in the opening scene. The Shakespearean sword is changed into a gun, the cars are used as a means of getaway, and Prince Escalus has a helicopter to track the recent brawl between the two families. Another aspect that keeps its roots is the tale of two young, immature lovers who stop at nothing to see each other despite their family's feud. I felt like both Leonardo DeCaprio and Claire Danes did decent jobs as Romeo and Juliet, but at times, they get a bit overdramatic. But, alas, it is Shakespeare, so I suppose we can forgive them for this.  <br /> <br />Since almost everyone knows this story through and through and are especially familiar with its two main stars, I would like to focus on some of the other minor characters within the film. I felt like Mercutio's character came off as being a little too over-the-top; one of such instances is him dancing while dressed in drag on top of a car before the Capulet ball. Still, the \\"Queen Mab\\" scene was quite effective, and I thought that they did a good job of underlying the importance of Mercutio's feelings of Romeo's dreams. On the other side,  Tybalt's character, played by comedic actor John Leguizamo, did a superb job pulling off this character's motives and lines. You could almost suspend belief into realizing that this is guy was actually a goofy guy in The Pest, and the fact that he makes you forget this seems to indicate that he was \\"into\\" this character. Benvolio's character also was well performed, as he seemed to fit the role as confidant and peacemaker to a tee.  <br /> <br />Overall, this version is a bit like Romeo and Juliet on steroids in the 90s. However, the fascinating aspect of reading and viewing Shakespeare-based plays is that there is a rich diversity of where and when you can place the setting--it is not limited to just what the Bard intended. For instance, it is not impossible to transcend Romeo and Juliet to many other places, such as a Western version of the play, or a play that is set in Victorian England. In this way, I think it is refreshing to see this version in a modern-Verona beach type setting in the mid 90s because not only does it appeal to today's audience, but I believe Shakespeare would love the idea of attempting something new and creative. The conflicts, the love, the themes still all have a way of translating well to this modern setting.  <br /> <br />As many mention, this is a version that most either love or hate because of its modern attributes or its failing to compare to the older version. There are certain reasons why this film creates such a strong reaction, but I think this is an effort that should be commended on certain merits, simply because of the effort to make it different than most Shakespearean films or remakes of films.  <br /> <br />It's a hunch, but I think Shakespeare would have loved the effort of this film. It's not the 1968 version, but it still very worthy of praise.
0446677450|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it challenged my traditional thoughts on wealth creation and financial independence.  It reveals a fresh way of thinking of assets and liabilities and really encouraged me to think outside of the square.   <br />In my opinion it takes guts to write such a controversial book (as it was when first launched) as it is definately not how the majority live and some will strongly disagree because of that fact.   <br />My hat goes off to Robert and the Rich Dad Poor Dad Company as this book, along with the array of other titles in the collection have created a substantial 'cashflow asset' for him, proving his theory correct.   <br />I recommend reading this book if you are open to investigating an unconventional, yet seemingly attainable way of wealth enhancement.
0679422714|3.0|I applaud the authors' efforts in producing a sweeping study of Mao and attempting to uncover many hitherto unknown aspects of his fascinating life. `Facts' surrounding the Long March, such as the famous Luding Bridge heroics, are exposed as being untrue. And claims about the engineered killings of more than 70 million Chinese and the often gruesome nature of their deaths take us to a whole new level of understanding about Mao's megalomania and inhumanity. These chilling revelations are all the more absorbing in an age where we're being made increasingly aware of state-engineered brutality both past and present. Reading this book (and accepting its claims wholesale) will revolutionise the way you think about Mao and such events as the Long March and the `Great Leap Forward'. <br /> <br />Yet the main problem with this book lies precisely in how far we can accept its claims. Most of the reviews here have already highlighted the book's many factual inconsistencies, exaggerations and generally speculative assertions. The book's sources, for one, have been criticised for being either unreliable or unverifiable. The emphasis on Mao has also obscured the role played by the Communist party in perpetrating the said atrocities.  <br /> <br />No specialist of Chinese history myself, I nonetheless found the claims a little too sensational and the writing too overwrought in places. Mao the man comes across as an utterly self-absorbed, power-crazed, pitiless beast whose one-dimensionality seems too much like a caricature at times. As with other similar books I've read, the authors' profound emotional engagement with the subject (ten years of research, interviewing hundreds of eyewitnesses etc.) seems to have gotten in the way of sober analysis. <br /> <br />At over 800 pages long this is not a short book by any measure. But it is written for a general audience and so should be accessible enough to most readers. If the writing doesn't capture you attention, the gripping narrativemost certainly will. Just bear in mind the scepticism that book's claims have received from academic circles. Checking these claims against the work of other experts in the field will probably be a good idea; and will most certainly be my next port-of-call. <br />
B000F3AAUW|1.0|Perhaps I'm just a moron, but after hearing a few tracks of Gnarls Barkley on the radio, I was gung-ho about buying the album. <br />Let's just say, after hearing just a sample of each song, I was disapointed and bought stock in I-Tunes.  <br /> <br />Anyone want a Gnarls Barkley CD?
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This movie comes with its up's and down's, the storyline is realistic and twisted, in the sense of a good scary horror it hit's the spot. The cast is full of fresh new faces, but it lacks something that could had made it a truly brilliant movie. Some scenes are just pointless and stupid, and while the other scenes in which you are supposed to shock you, lets just say the climax only goes half way. The characters in which you are supposed to feel sorry for, it just happens to soon, which makes you not really give a crap.  <br /> <br />Still I do love the idea, I can't say it was a poor attempt at this movie idea in which two backpackers traveling through Europe find themselves as victims in the under world where anything has its price. <br /> <br /> <br />
0385507755|5.0|As a college student, I am quite the reader. I come from a family that deals with drug and alcohol addiction, and I feel that it is necessary to see books in bookstores that not only give people inspiration that they can be sober and be successful, but I also feel that there should be stories behind them. A Million Little Pieces was one of these stories despite the fact that people want to negate Frey's accounts of his recovery. So to protest the media and all of the neysayers-read what the book says and hear what Frey says-it is a memoir. Not everyone remembers incidents they may have shared with others the same way and in Frey's account this may be the case. Recovery is a difficult thing, and for him to have the nerve to actually share his experience is something that may help other people in recovery. Frey has changed his life around for the better and for people to try to disprove him is morally wrong. These are his experiences and no one can change them. <br /> <br />As for the book itself, it is very simplistic, almost poetic. It is written in laymen terms so it shouldn't be difficult for anyone to read. Last Thanksgiving I bought both A Million Little Pieces and My Friend Leonard and read them within a week. They are both amazing books and easy reads.
0307277674|5.0|Great read, definately worth it, a bit of fiction, or is it?  The question of what is fact and what is fiction keeps this book interesting - I couldn't put it down.  (I accidentally left it on a plane in Bangkok when I only had two chapter to go - needless to say when I realised I promptly purchased it again!  It is actually as good as the hype has created it to be, although I don't want to see the movie as I have a great picture in my head of who the characters are and I don't want Tom Hanks destroying that for me.  (No offense Tom!).
B000EULJLU|2.0|As a lover of music and a Tool fan in particular I was fairly excited when 10,000 Days hit the shelf.  But then I listened to it and I found myself crying in despair.<br /><br />From start to finish this album sounds like a sad rehash of Lateralus.  That there's so much similarity between this album and Tool's 2001 endeavor is probably because this album is composed of \\"canned\\" material from earlier sessions.  The riffs are fairly standard and the vocal imagery is sorely lacking when compared to Tool's previous efforts.<br /><br />Besides Danny's masterful drumming and Justin's amazing bass efforts, the album leaves much to be desired.  It would seem that Maynard and Adam aren't even trying anymore.  Can Tool survive as a power-duo if their singer and guitarist should suddenly die of ennui while on stage?  Would anyone really notice?  Would the music world care?<br /><br />If you're a rock solid Tool fan, buy the album.  If you're just getting into Tool and looking for an album to introduce you to their sound try Ænima or better yet Undertow.  10,000 Days is proving to be the biggest let down of the year in terms of what good music could be.
B000002WYT|4.0|I am a fan of the Dave Matthews Band, but not of Dave Matthews. Personally, I think Dave is lacking in guitar and vocal talent.  However, Boyd Tinsley, the violinist, is superb, the drummer can lay down some great beats, and the LeRoi Moore, the saxophonist, is  great, and would make a successful jazz musician. Tim Reynolds, who makes a major guest appearance on this and every other DMB album, is one of the best guitarists around.  All of these guys are amazing, and Dave writes some great songs for them to play.  Two Step is one of the best songs I have ever heard, and Tripping Billies, Lie in Our Graves, Too Much, and So Much to Say are definitely not lacking in any respect.  I love the energy displayed on Tripping Billies and So Much to Say.  Lie in Our Graves displays great jamming, and Too Much has some very funky saxophone and violin pyrotechnics.  Compared to the majority of mainstream music, this is pure genius, but if you compare it to some more serious jam bands, prog bands, and jazz bands it is still excellent but no better than the others.  One of the things this band definitely accomplishes is, through their brilliant openers, such as Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Galactic, Robert  Randolph, Umphrey's Mcgee, Gov't Mule, Widespread Panic, Keller Williams, Trey Anastasio, and moe. they introduce mainstream music fans to truly impressive music.  While I do not like their teenie bopper/frat boy fanbase, I would reccomend this album (However, if you want less \\"mainstream\\" music, check out the said openers as well as Drums and Tuba, the Grateful Dead, Soulive, the Disco Biscuits, Karl Denson, New Monsoon, Jake Shimabukuro, Railroad Earth, and Jethro Tull).  All in all a great album(with Two Step as one of the best songs ever), and the only mainstream band I truly enjoy.    Be sure to check this out, along with The Central Park Concert, Weekend on the Rocks, and Under the Table and Dreaming.
B00063MBU8|3.0|Aw, Simple Plan. A very great band indeed. But, I would have thought their new cd would sound completely different from the first and I was wrong. They sound exactly the same! It's basically, to me, a total waste. I love Simple Plan and I always have but for christs sake you'd think that they'd sound a LITTLE different.
B00004Y6NU|1.0|LOVE OVER GOLD IS CERTAINLY THE WORST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD.IT IS EVEN MORE WORSE THAN AMERICAN IDIOT AND WARNING BY GREEN DAY.ALL THESE RUBBISH ALBUMS DESERVE NO STARS.TELEGRAPH ROAD IS THE LOUSIEST SONG EVER WRITTEN.HEED MY ADVISE AND AVOID THIS LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.GET ANY ALBUM FROM BLUE CHEER OR IRON BUTTERFLY INSTEAD.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|As Tony Bennett said \\"Buble' has IT\\".  <br />I love his style and sound and the way he makes even old songs sound brand new.  <br />Being a long time Bennett fan I was thrilled to learn that Buble' was going to record with Bennett on his soon to be released album and I'm looking forward to that to.
B000FA57RG|5.0|Are you a fan? Don't think twice, go ahead and buy it!  The CD is wonderful and the documentary is out of this world.  She has changed and what a change! :)
B000EULJLU|5.0|I love to read reviews. It amazes me how everyone's perception of the same thing can be so very different. That said, I'd like to say that I love Tool. I think they are amazing and I admire the way they challenge my ears on a level that very few other groups of musicians do.  <br /> <br />Some people say this album is slow and Tool has lost its grit, others say 'screw you, it's Tool' and it's fabulous by default. I tend to not agree with either. While Tool has indeed become progressivly more melodic, I do not find this album 'slow' or 'boring'. And while Tool is fabulous in my book, I did not do backflips over every track upon first listen. Nevertheless, it is worthy of listening to on many different levels and is first and foremost enjoyably good music. Anyone that has a true appreciation for excellent musicians and well put together, thought out and meaningful music will enjoy this album.
B0002Y4TM4|4.0|Short and sweet - Sounds similar to Afraid of Sunlight with a touch of Coldplay thrown in.
B000FA57RG|4.0|I agree with another reviewer that this was a missed opportunity.  Madonna has never released a live recording and if ever there was a concert of her's to release a live cd of, it is Reinvention.  I actually thought so as I was leaving the show two years ago.  This was essentially a greatest hits tour that spanned her entire career and she sounded AMAZING!!!  It seems that it would have been an inexpensive and easy way to feed a hungry audience.  And put more cash in Madonna's pockets!  They already put the effort into creating this cd, why not a double cd of the entire concert?!  There wasn't a bad song in the show but to include the interludes over songs like Burning Up was a mistake.  Plus, The Beast Within is already on the Justify My Love cd single from years ago.  It's essentially the same recording.  BTW-  she is totally lip synching Vogue and Nobody Knows Me.  She re-recorded the vocals for the tour, which sounded great, but that is so not her live voice on those songs.  She never sounded better live, though, as she did singing Lament.  Incredible!!!  Anyway, love her, have loved all her shows, but very disappointed that we didn't see a release of this enitre show on DVD and CD.  She should have done what Coldplay did a couple years ago with their tour.
6305558167|5.0|I saw this movie at school last week, and I thought it would be the same old boring King Arthur sroty, but it turned out to be a very entertaining movie, with lots of action and dramatic scenes, and it really sticks to the reality!<br /><br />That new King Arthur movie released last year (or 2004, I don't remember) is just fiction! But this is a great movie. It doesn't have the coolest special effects, but the story, the cast and the film in general is very good.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This is the best movie ever made! Based on a Great broadway musical and book, it  has great acting and music! It puts you in suspense! I give it a 10/10! The best movie ever!!
B000CBSHK2|5.0|how do you rate a cd that makes you feel like you have gone home again?  Since i purchased beth orton's central reservation, i have been a loyal fan.  I have never been disappointed with anything she produces.  Comfort of Strangers only affirmed my feelings - after an exceptionally hard day at work, i come home and slip on the cd - usually by the end of the first two tracks i am at peace again and all is well with the universe......  -- her music is extremely mellow and easy to follow - if your a hard rock head banger, this music is not for you - or is it?  i am sure by the end of your first listening you will be a true convert.......  buy the cd - its money well spent.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Unimaginative supernatural horror thriller that rather treat the audience like idiots than to give them a story with any meaning. Keanu Reeves lacks the acting chops to pull off his character's moral dilemma and the screenplay lacks credibility with its juvenile dialog and halfhearted views on the subject that it's trying to cover. It's more and less a big budget version of the television show \\"Angel\\" but with out it's cleaver writing or it's interesting look at the war between Good versus Evil. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks coherency and certain scenes don't jell in terms of narrative. The only actors in the movie who manages to transient the bad script and misdirection of the director is Rachel Weisz, who does give the movie's only compelling performance and the great Peter Stourmare whose five minute cameo as the devil has more meat than the main character himself. Weisz and Stormare are about the only positive things that come out of this supernatural debacle and if the studio wanted to make good movie, they could have just focus their energies at Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare and have the movie revolved around their characters instead of the uninspired character of John Constantine and could have made a real and scary supernatural thriller. <br /> <br />Too bad that it's the audience who have a better imagination that the people who made this film
B000002P6R|3.0|<br />After Keith Moon's death there was some question of what The Who would be like with out him. FACE DANCES gives us a sound that seems closer to a Townsend solo project, if Daltrey was to sing lead. There is less energy here and more introspection. This is not necessarily a bad thing; it's just different. Kenny Jones does a good job and gets to show off a bit on \\"The Quiet One\\" and \\"Daily Records,\\" and there some good numbers here. One stand out is \\"How Can You Do It Alone,\\" another embarrassingly close look at man's flaws via Townsend; a song helped a great deal by Daltrey's  great vocal on it.  Not quite a classic, but very listenable. <br />
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Many people rail on this movie because it's not a typical \\"hero\\" war story. It's a \\"reality\\" war story. This movie focuses on what life in the desert after 120 of doing nothing can do to a soldier who has been amped up to be...you know... a soldier.<br /><br />Don't think this is The Longest Day or Saving Private Ryan. This is a real story about a real guy and real effects of military life.<br /><br />And it's a great movie all around.
156224003X|3.0|After reading the other reviews I will revisit the book and see if it helps me more this time. <br /> <br />When I first read it the first 2/3 of the book is basically selling the concept. Lots of anecdotes and stories about people who achieved great things by letting go and relaxing. The practical techniques are tacked onto the end of the book almost as an after thought. <br /> <br />I think it may apply better to the competent musician who is aiming for the next level. As an aspiring pianist I found the advice to forget about wrong notes and progress at my own pace pointless. I really really need to be able to play the right notes at the right time and I care very much about the time taken to progress.
0671004107|5.0|No, that's not an afterlife recommendation. It is what the paperback I read in 1987 and the hardback that I just finished reading say on the spines when they are laying horizontally on the bookshelf. I still have a perfect picture of the gold on letters black, same size, same font, lying on a bookshelf in Foster City, CA. I just laid the newer one on a shelf that I can see from my desk chair. <br /> <br />I enjoyed it as much this time, I think, as I did the first time. I was reminded pleasurably of how Carl dealt with the subject of religion, which was a very big part of the book. He depicted the preachers-for-money as the buffoons they still are. The subject of religion itself is treated with respect, as are many of the religious people involved. It is about as evenhanded a treatment as can be expected from an atheist. <br /> <br />Even more, I remembered the clarity of his words and his vision, shining through the words of his characters and his description. Carl Sagan knew many things, factual things, that made him a very impressive figure. But his ability to put the facts together and discuss the combinations, to weave a story out of them, to educate the reader, was magnificent. There are too few people who are able to present complex facts and issues with the clarity he could. <br /> <br />I miss him. <br />
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Okay... <br />So I have read every single article on this album.  I have been a die hard John Frusciante fan for several years now and an even longer pepper fan.  I have every album since the self titled one.  The people that say if Blood Sugar is your favorite album you wont like this album are wrong.  Blood Sugar is my fav. and I love this album.  You have a mix of everything they have ever down.  If you knew anything about frusciante, he has been through alot and what he has been through changed him musically.  So if your expecting the same as blood sugar its not.  It is different, which is to be expected.  I think frusciate did an awesome job of mixing hendrix with floyd with Zep on \\"If\\" and with downright funk.  He is amazing in every single way and is an inspiration to everyone.  The album is to be recommended to everyone whether you like mothers milk or by the way, because if your a true pepper fan you will appreciate everything they make because they love it and they out heart and soul into it.  If they think it is the best they can do than it is and i think it is wonderful in all aspects.  Dont just buy it and glaze thorugh it...appreciate the art of the guitar in it and understand that there has not been a single album made buy anyone in the past ten years with the same dedication as the chili peppers and especially john frusciante.  This album is a 10/10 on every level.   <br />if you are going to review a band...be a fan.
0446577383|1.0|In addition to an idiotic plot, insipid characters, leaden dialog, and ill-informed opinion, the grammar was so poor that I wondered if an native English speaker even wrote (or edited) the manuscript.   <br />  <br />If you like moronic entertainment written on about a third-grade reading level; are in dire need of a doorstop; or require a real method of torture (referring to the audio book, which I understand is equally bad) this one's for you!   Otherwise, avoid this turkey at all costs.
0375831002|5.0|There are some books that clutch your heart from the beginning and then twist it until you have spilled tears and laughter and pain all over their pages.  The Book Thief is one of these books.  As Zusak leads you through four years of Liesel Meminger's life, it is impossible not to be moved- deeply moved- by the people and the events that touch her.  It is just as impossible not to be awed by the absolutely beautiful writing that Zusak employs to tell his story.  He chooses words and descriptions that are savored by the reader.  He creates characters that step out of the novel and become your friends and family and that leave you bereft when you reach the last page and realize that you no longer have any time left to be with them.  This book is nothing short of amazing, and I will highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.  It will make you laugh, and cry, and cheer.  And, like Death who narrates the story, you will be haunted by the humans that reside within its pages.
B000001ELF|4.0|Review no. 77. Out of the four Kiss solo albums that hit the market back in 1978, Ace Frehley's effort is, without a doubt the best. See my reviews of the Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons solo lp's. I haven't heard this CD in ages. I'd forgotten all about the opener \\"Rip It Out\\" that later went onto be a Frehley's Comet staple. Other notable cuts are \\"Speeding Back To My Baby\\", \\"Ozone\\", \\"New York Groove\\" (loved hearing this tune performed on past Kiss tours, like their 'Dynasty' trek I believe it was and their '96 reunion) and \\"Wipe Out\\". Recommended.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|What Brick brings to the table is perhaps the most refreshing look at the genre of Film Noir in years. Rian Johnson is able to take the critical elements of the genre and transpose them on a fresh new locale. The use of a Southern California highschool as the backdrop is beautifully done. Most of all, Johnson is able to appreciate and use the genre without falling back on the 1940s. <br /> <br />The screenplay is exquisite. The developed slang is not just perfect for a film noir but truly perfect for the culture being shown. What is most amazing is how surprisingly real the film seems, despite the fact that yes - it is a bunch of teenagers who are caught up in a world so devoid of reality that its hard to believe. Yet somehow Johnson brings in elements of real-life high school drug culture, real-life Southern California, and most of all real-life fantasies about how to act when you are part of these cultures. <br /> <br />This was the best film I've seen in years, to be honest. I'm disapointed it has basically been predetermined for this to remain a \\"cult classic.\\" It could have marked a re-emergence of Film Noir, arguably one of the most interesting and conflicted genres of film (in my opinion). However, I am glad it has been made because at least I will be able to take pleasure in viewing it. A must-see.
B000B6OD1U|5.0|This cd is sooo amazing.  It has a very unique sound that only 30 Seconds To Mars can attain.  \\"The Kill\\" has some of the most strong and amazing vocal stylings by lead singer Jared Leto, yet he can soften the tone with such depth in \\"The Story\\".  The title song \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" flows wonderfully. You can hear how passionate Jared, Shannon, Tomo and Matt are about their music from the first song to the last one.  Every song on this cd could be a #1 hit.  Its not only a must have for their fans, but for every music lover.  One listen and you'll be hooked on 30 Seconds to Mars from here on out.  Be prepared to be immersed in what I feel is the best cd around from now to eternity.  It will leave you in total awe and wanting more!!
B00005JOSS|5.0|Dr. Kate Forester is a warm but lonely young woman who has just moved to Chicago to work at one of the city hospitals.  She has been living for the past two years in a beautiful lake house outside of the city.  Alex Wyler has just moved to this lake house; he is an architect and is passionate about his work, but is not entirely fulfilled by the box-like condoes he is currently contracted to build.   <br /> <br />The two of them meet via the lake house mail box when Kate leaves a letter to the subsequent tenant requesting that he forward her mail.  After a few exchanges, always via the magical lake house mail box, they come to accept the fact that they are separated by exactly two years.  Kate is living in 2006 and Alex is back in 2004.  Immediately, they strike up an excited correspondance, sharing their pasts, likes, dislikes and hobbies.  In a wonderful scene, Alex takes Kate on a tour of Chicago's most beautiful architectural works by sending her a guided map and visiting the sites himself that same afternoon, two years before.  As their feelings for one develop however, Kate becomes more and more troubled by the two year barrier between them. <br /> <br />The two year barrier that separates them is handled extremely nicely.  There aren't any complicated, mind-boggling overlaps/complications, as in The Butterfly Effect or Back To The Future.  Alex in fact does see Kate a few times, and even talks with her in one scene, back in his time, although of course she doesn't know him yet.  Naturally, this movie's main theme is that of waiting, and of picking the \\"right time\\" to meet.  I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the end is just spectacular. <br /> <br />This is a great movie for just about everyone, except maybe those people who can't stand love stories as a rule.  There aren't any stupid, incredibly sappy moments.  It's funny, touching and suspenseful, and the charactes are extremely likable and well-developed.  Alex's relationship with his father, a world famous architect who has always been emotionally distant, was a very poignant side plot.  Similarly, Alex's relationship with his younger brother, also an aspiring architect, is warm and very real.  Kate is similarly compelling; having just recently lost her father, her loneliness and sense of isolation are almost immediately apparent.  Even so, she's often funny and quirky; in one scene, she confesses to Alex how desperate she sometimes feels because she's so isolated from everyone else, and we're shown her in her apartment, trying to play chess with her dog. <br /> <br />Again--a really lovely, magical movie.  I can't wait to buy it for myself.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|There is a quote by Martin Luther King Jr. about an \\"eye for an eye\\", and I'm not going to transcribe it on here as part of my review.  But if you do come across the quote, it completely cancels out the entire premise of what the film \\"Munich\\" is all about.  Not knowing much about the events of the Munich Olympic massacre, I wanted to see a drama that depicted the horrible tragedy and inform me of the reason it happened and what led up to it and thereafter.  It seems to me this movie made somewhat of a revenge spectacle of the tragedy.  The actors appeared \\"James Bond-esqe\\" and went about thier keystone cop theatrics with avengance.  Thier bloodlusting glory came easy with with no abandon and it made me feel like they were just as bad as the assasins that killed the Isreali athletes.  My oppinions are not to trivialize what happened.  I don't think the filmmakers intended to portray the \\"heroes\\" in this kind of light but the film ended up coming across like 007 meets Moses.  In my oppinion, I would have actors with a little more subtance and weight under thier belt.  Daniel Craig did not belong in this movie by the way.  He's not that great of an actor and I'm sure he did not resemble in the slightest what really happened, but then again what do I know?    NOT that great of a movie is what I know.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This girl is PURE TALENT! I LOVED THE WHOLE THING!!!  This CD is great for if you feel like just chilling, if you wanna play it with the top down in the convertible, or even if you are having a cook out. Her VOICE....some may not like it...it's not the strongest, but it's JUST RIGHT with her music. It just clicks where as someone with a more poppy voice...a la Christina Aguilera just wouldn't cut it. The girl can sing and her music is beautiful. I SPOTTED THIS CD AT STARBUCKS AND BOUGHT IT AS SOON AS I SAW IT.

B000083C49|5.0|With three successful movies (only 2 really worth mentioning), the `Star Trek' franchise was ready to branch out and try to expand its fan base beyond the hardcore Trekkies.  With that thought in mind, Paramount Pictures commissioned Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer (director of \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\") to begin writing the next installment.  Also back for the sequel would be the director of \\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\", Leonard Nimoy who just so happened to be the actor who has portrayed Spock since the original TV series.  Along with Nimoy and the writers, Paramount Pictures was smart enough to realize that this franchise would be nothing if they didn't get the entire cast and crew back together again, and this time enticing them to return would prove much easier especially with the promise of this film being totally different from what has been done before.  Thus, \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" was born.    After defeating Khan and finding their once dead, now resurrected friend Spock, Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and the rest of the starship Enterprise are finally approaching Earth and spacedock so that the Enterprise may be decommissioned once and for all.  However, before they can reach their final destination an alien entity is threatening Earth by evaporating the oceans and destroying the atmosphere.  In a desperate attempt to stop this threat and save mankind, Kirk and his crew must travel back in time, to the year 1986, in order to find the solution that will cause the entity to be satisfied in whatever its search entails, and move on to another planet or star system.  But time is running out, and the solution is proving difficult to come by, especially since the Enterprise has still not been fully repaired from its recent battles (as depicted in the previous two films), so will Earth in the 23rd Century be saved, or will the time-displaced heroes learn to cope with their new surroundings.    \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" served as an excellent example of exactly what to do to make sure a franchise does not become stagnate in its storytelling capabilities.  The writers, along with director and star Leonard Nimoy, were very crafty in terms of infusing the story with deeply emotional beats throughout the overall story, and infusing more humor than there has ever been in a `Star Trek' movie to date.  Many times placing too much humor in a franchise that had previously only had very little can prove to be detrimental to the series' longevity and success (\\"Superman 3\\" and \\"Batman & Robin\\" are two prime examples), however the creators of this film were careful not to get too carried away with the humor and risk losing touch with their core audience of Trekkies.  Sure there were some Trekkies that were somewhat disappointed with the film's storyline, even some of the actors were skeptical, mostly because time travel is such a touchy subject for movies, and generally feels like a cheap ploy for the writer to use to get him or herself out of a corner that they've painted themselves into.  But this was not the case here, and regardless of what some fans say, \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" is one of the more popular, and profitable films in the franchise, as it accomplished what previous installments and even some of the subsequent installments failed to do, expand upon the core audience and make the movie appeal to almost everybody.    The acting was still very well done, all of the cast did an excellent job with handling the fish-out-of-water aspects that the storyline required, and it was clear that they were all loving every minute of it.  Of course, that was probably aided by the fact that their director was also their close friend and colleague, Leonard Nimoy, who shows that he was not merely a flash in the pan after his first directorial effort in the `Star Trek' universe with \\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\", and with this film he showed that he not only had the knack for drama and sci-fi action/adventure, but also knew how to bring broad strokes of humor into the story without it feeling heavy-handed or out of place.  The special effects were all relatively well done, especially for the time, and most hold up well to this day, of course this was another area where Nimoy chose to change things up in the franchise, by not making the movie be overly loaded with special effects but instead be more character driven.  A choice that I'm confident assisted in the mass appeal of the film, and allowed the franchise to continue to flourish for years to come.    Overall, \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" stands out as one of the better sequels in the franchise, and possibly one of the best examples of branching out in terms of any sci-fi franchise.  If you are a fan of the series in any way, or merely looking for a good blend of sci-fi, action, humor, and drama then look no further, and the beautiful thing is you really don't need much of the backstory that had been setup in the previous films, although it would help in some areas, but even without it you could still enjoy the movie.  This is one `Star Trek' film the entire family can enjoy, yes even the ladies will enjoy this one.    \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" is rated PG for language.
B000002H33|5.0|WHIRLIGIG,  YOUR OPINION OF THIS GREAT BAND IS NOT REQUIRED.  I have always loved metallica who I feel are the finest band to have emerged from the west coast.They have produced fine albums like RIDE THE LIGHTNING,AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and this album whom several people reckon as their best.This is one album you should possess.Five stars.  METALLICA ROCKS,METALLICA ROCKS,METALLICA ROCKS,METALLICA ROCKS,METALLICA ROCKS AS HARD AS LED ZEPPELIN,THE WHO AND THE STONES.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWERS FOR METALLICA AND AVOID ALL ALBUMS FROM DIRTY BANDS LIKE DIRE STRAITS WHO SUCK TILL THE HIGH HEAVENS.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|I hate the Beatles!!! They are one of the worst bands period. They have only made 2 decent songs in Hey Jude, and Ballad Of John And Yoko. Other than that, THEIR MUSIC IS JUST A VERY BAD <br />JOKE WITH 25 OF THEIR WORST SONGS EVER!!!!!! THIS IS NEVER worth <br />buying so stay away. I see this in every store. Don't listen to <br />the morons who love Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Beatles, and Led <br />Zeppelin who suck!!! Dire Straits are really great. And get any <br />Guns N' Roses CD insted of The Beatles. They are supermuch better. GARBAGE, TRASH, THROW IT AWAY........LET THE GARBAGEMAN <br />COME DESTROY IT!!!!!!  BEATLES SUCK! BEATLES SUCK!
B000AWYOGE|2.0|A million different water references popped up when I first thought of writing this review.  From the standard \\"all wet\\" cliche to \\"drizzly drips,\\" I thought of them all.  \\"Dark Water\\" is, like a thousand other mediocre flicks these last few years, based on a mediocre Japanese horror flick by overrated Japanese writers about a creepy ghostchild that uses the \\"boo!\\" factor to a tiring degree in an attempt to scare the audience.  I'll admit that \\"The Grudge\\" actually had a couple of these moments, so did \\"The Ring,\\" but \\"Dark Water\\" has none of this.<br /><br />It drips along at a snails pace with only slight hints as to what is exactly going on.  We're thrown off the trail by Jennifer Connelly's character a couple of times when she seems to be losing her mind.  In this film, she's fighting through a really nasty custody case with her ex, and as part of her struggle, she moves into a bleak apartment complex occupied by a wasted Pete Postlethwaite and John C. Reilly.  Both of these actors are ten times better than this film allows them to be, though Reilly manages to toss a little humor into his character.  Dougray Scott is pretty good as the ex, and Tim Roth turns in the top performance as Connelly's caring and daring lawyer.<br /><br />As the story puddles from dull moment to dull moment, Connelly and her daughter begin to have \\"experiences.\\"  The daughter has the most contact with \\"something\\" in the beginning of the flick, but as it continues, the story centers its focus on Connelly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film ends with a literal splash, but not a great splashdown.  Connelly and company were wasted in this boring and uneventful flick.  I'm sure that if you're a fan of the other snoozer \\"horror\\" from Japan as of late, you'll probably drink this wet dog right up.  With that in mind, be prepared for more of the same Japanese scares.  If that's your bag, pick this up.  If you prefer your horror with more of an actual story, \\"Dark Water\\" will leave you feeling all wet.eeling all wet.
B000003TA4|5.0|I love how that kid named himself 'Sultans of Swing'. That's one <br />of my favorite songs by Dire Straits. But he needs to stop being <br />such a picky music lover. This album is terrific and has some <br />great songs, In Bloom, Come As You Are, and Smells Like Teen Spirit. Get it, but avoid all albums from crappy bands like Metallica who suck really hard. <br /> <br />Whirligig.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Previously to buying this album, the only thing I ever heard by Gorillaz was Clint Eastwood way back in the day. So I basically bought this album without any preconceived notions, and damn, it blew me away. This cd eclipses everything else I heard in 2005, although Don't Believe The Truth by Oasis was one hell of a listen too.  <br /> <br />With this album, Damon Albarn does something with his musical talent that he hasn't done in a very long time: sum up life in the present tense. Where Damon focused on the working class in Britain on \\"Parklife\\" and the white collar upper class on \\"The Great Escape\\", this cd reflects the general post-9/11 anxiety of the years just following 2001. It's greatly reflected in the day-for-night tone of the album, and the album title itself.  <br /> <br />This is also the most consistant cd that Damon has put out in a long long time. Every track stands out and every songs flows smoothly into the next. These 15 songs fly by, while at the same time, every song grabs your attention. Like the work of Radiohead, these songs will reveal more and more to you about them with each repeated listen. So you'll no doubt find yourself coming back to this cd again and again. Even the simpler songs have moments of sheer depth to them. Halfway through \\"All Alone\\" comes one of the most psychedelic and dreamy moments to be heard in modern pop music for a long time. This is just one example of the hidden gems on this disc. <br /> <br />The main recurring and unifying theme of this cd is anxiety and confusion brought on by life in the aftermath of something big (symbolized on this cd in the song \\"Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head\\"). Through the noirish darkness of this album, comes hope for a better future and new beginning in the psychedelic title track.  <br /> <br />If you don't want deep meaning though and you're looking for just something to listen to, this album is one hell of a ride. Damon Albarn has said that this may be the last Gorillaz album, saying that they can't get much better than this. If so, it is an extremely good note to end on.  <br />
B00004Y6NX|4.0|I feel that this album is good. Some of their best songs are Tunnel of Love,and Expresso Love which are just as lovely as <br />FOREIGNER WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU. Solid Rock is another tune <br />to listen to. But I like Love Over Gold better. Get them both and AVOID ALL ALBUMS FROM DIRTY BANDS LIKE METALLICA WHO SUCK.
B000002UB3|5.0|Este es, en mi opinión, el mejor disco de la historia y no sólo por las imágenes y recuerdos que tengo asociados a él. Este disco culmina la mágica transición de los Beatles del \\"yeah yeah\\" a los MÚSICOS (con mayúsculas) en que se convirtieron. Lo compré por primera vez en el año 1973 (conocí a los Beatles el año anterior) y al día siguiente ya tenía el vinilo rayado de la cantidad de veces que había escuchado la cara segunda. Lo he recomprado cinco veces más y cuando inicié el paso de los vinilos a los CDs, fue el primero que adquirí.  <br /> <br />         No soy capaz de imaginar, en caso de que JPG&R no se hubieran separado, si hubieran podido superar un tabajo como éste. Y esto es parte de su leyenda: se despidieron haciendo algo que, en mi opinión, es insuperable.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Floyd Fan, <br /> <br />Your opinion about this great album is not needed. Green Day <br />are worse....Dire Straits rule and they are talented with great <br />musicians. All the songs are good, it may not be as good as a <br />Guns N' Roses CD. But you need to have a better taste in music, the bands you hate are really good and the bands you love such as <br />Pink Floyd and Metallica SUCK!!!! Don't rate my favorite bands <br />1 star you big moron idiot!!!!!! or else F******CK YOU YOU LAME <br />B*TCH. <br />Whirligig
B0006GAOBI|5.0|There's nothing better than beginning a cinematic journey and knowing absolutely nothing about the film.  Such was the case for me with DONNIE DARKO--I only knew it had received critical raves and starred Jake Gyllenhaal.  Man, was I glad to be totally unspoiled! If you can, approach this edgy, supernatural film in just that way.<br /><br />The movie begins subtly, making the viewer increasingly uncomfortable and subconsciously terrified.  If you like David Lynch, for instance, especially MULHOLLAND DRIVE, you'd love this.  It also has a sort of Alan Ball feeling to the visual narrative.<br /><br />Donnie is a troubled teen who wakes at movie's beginning along the side of an abandoned road.  How he got there and why he knows nothing about his journey is the stuff of the movie itself.  A film that teases with time travel, personal responsibility, and the worst of teen society, it's definitely darkly humorous.  Think HEATHERS.  Only add in a lot of other inspirations, even a video of SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT.<br /><br />It's been a while since a movie surprised and disturbed me quite so much.
B000002H97|3.0|I was just listening to Master of Puppets and thought, I didn't like it. It had just a bad word and wasn't hardly any decent songs on it. Anyway, I loved the Black Album and it always had <br />1 of my favorite songs of all time, Enter Sandman which rocks! <br />So in my opinion, the only good Metallica album. Stick with this <br />one insted. This one is great with any Dire Straits, Guns N' Roses, Foreigner, Nirvana, or Aerosmith....Metallica's other albums suck, these guys are too metal for me. and THRASH!!!!!! James Hetfield can't sing....HAHA....
0375414053|5.0|I have to say, if you're a working mother,  you'll see shades of your life in this book.  While Kate's life is out of balance, and that's a big part of the book's message, even those of us who possess a more stable mom/work ethic will definitely relate!<br /><br />Hiding things from the nanny? Check, done that.  The panic over holiday parties and events amidst business travel.  Achingly familiar.  At the book's core, however, is truly the quest for all mothers, whether they work or not: How to balance the demands of the frenetic pace of modern life with nurturing children and being there for the right moments.<br /><br />The book is rich with humor, emotion, and strong characterization--and I mean even the secondary characters and story threads are incredibly moving.  I read this book several years ago and can still recall a particular description of one character's eyes.<br /><br />As another said, I'd give this book six stars if I could, if only for providing a wonderful catharsis at a time of personal stress, if not for the tremendous, well-written tale that it is.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Capote tells the story of how Truman Capote went about gathering research for his groundbreaking \\"nonfiction novel\\" In Cold Blood. The portrayal of Capote is well balanced, not romanticizing the author's often sneaky, calculating and even deceitful methods of extracting information from all the available sources. The film also presents a good picture of how well-connected the author was, the elite circles in which he moved and the qualities in him that made him so appealing. Without being too sympathetic, the film does an excellent job of explaining why Truman Capote was such a monumental author, and what about him endures.<br /><br />Capote gives good background information on the Clutter family murders , which inspired Capote to write his book. There are a few scenes of graphic violence, which warrant the R rating, but the gruesome killings are not the focus of the film. Rather, the creative process of the driven author, as well as his own struggles with his conscience, provide the basis for the plot.<br /><br />It isn't necessary to have read In Cold Blood to appreciate this film. The appeal of the film is more the glimpse it provides into how a creative individual goes about getting to the real stories behind sensationalized events. In the process we may question to what lengths we all would go to \\"get the story,\\" what value we put on human decency, and when it becomes wrong to use power and influence in pursuit of personal glory.
B000EULJLU|4.0|That was my dilemma. I really liked Undertow, Aenima, and Opiate but wasn't so hot about Lateralus. Reviews on amazon and elsewhere were very mixed.  In truth, the album really only has 7 songs on it. Of these Pot is excellent (smacks of Undertow days), Vicarius and Jambi are great and are remnant of Aenima. Right-in-two is a cross of lateralus and aenima. The other half of the album is slow and moody - it lays the scene for these biting, tool masterpieces. It almost seems like a concept album in places. <br /> <br />If you like tool then the dilemma is simply financial. How much to pay for it? Amazon's current price is a bargin, at over 20 bucks it may be questionable. However, if you can't stop listening to your old tool albums then this is the CD for you. It has never left my CD player since I got it. Sorry folks, reckon this album is better than Lateralus. <br />
B000000WCA|5.0|Okay, the Spice Girls quickly turned into the joke of the decade. But why? What was so bad about them? Their decent pop music? Entertaining antics? Inspiration to young females accross the globe? I just don't see it.<br /><br />But this review shouldn't go there. This is about their album and it's a very solid pop album at that! Forget the over-sexed, over-produced pop of Britney Spears and the like. The Spice Girls had and still own their own pop sound. It was unique and strong!<br /><br />Lyricly, the songs weren't any great achievements. But they were quite catchy lyrics which didn't really admit to much nor really got too preachy. As for the music itself, pure pop magic! Every song was oozing with sound. And their voices, while not being anything amazing, worked together and each had it's own charm and individuality.<br /><br />Songs to look for on this album include the unforgetable \\"Wannabe\\", \\"Say You'll Be There\\", the ballad \\"2 Become 1\\", and the always fun club hit, \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\"!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I Never Write A Review This Is My First, However I Was Compelled To After Sitting Here Reading What Some Of These Idiots Have Written. Also Its Tool Were Talking About.  First And Foremost People Need To Get Over The Whole APC-Tool Thing.  Two Entirely Different Bands Oh Yeah Sure Maynard Sings For Both Of Them But The Musicians In Tool Are Way Better Than Those In APC, Sorry Its True And I Like APC.  Next Thing Is If Ya Gonna Write A Review Quit Comparing An Album That Came Out This Year To One That Came Out Over Ten Years Ago,  In Ten Years We All Change So Quit Bitching About It Not Being As Heavy As Undertow And Etc.. Also If Ya Going To Play The Role Of A Critic Which I Think Is Almost As Bad As A Politician, Get A Clue, OK I'll Give It To Ya What Have You Done With Your Life That Could Even Compare To What These Guys Have Done, What Was Your Number 1 Album,  I Dont Remember Hearing Your Music Evolve Over The Past 15 Years Or So In Fact I've Never Even Heard Of Your Band.  So If Your Gotta Do It Do It With An Open Mind, Which Is Exactly How Ya Have To Experience Tool Anyways,  I'm Not Even Gonna Review This Album Or Any Other Album By Tool Cause They All Speak For Themselves. I Just Wanted To Let All You Naysayers In On The Truth. Anyways If Your Looking To Experience Music Unlike Any Other Then Tool Is One Of The Many Places To Start They Dont Write Music They Create Art In The Form Of Music, So If Your Not Willing To Sit Down And Pay Attention To Whats Being Done Then Music Probably Isnt Your Thing Anyways So Ya Best Just Turn The Radio On And Listen To Whatever It Is That Keeps Getting Overplayed I Assure You It Isnt Tool And If Ya Know Anything About This Band Ya Already Know Thats How The Like It, Anyways Great Work Tool Keep It Up Cant Wait For The Next One No Matter How Long It Takes, Anybody That Has A Clue Knows Itll Be Worth The Wait
B00005AXEL|5.0|While some fans may have disregarded any recordings past \\"Rock a Little\\" those in the know, realize what a great work \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" truly is.<br /><br />Forget the rumours about Stevie's declining voice or that she's lost her way. Her voice is just as beautiful(and strong) as ever and her music, like a fine wine, has only gotten better with age.<br /><br />While some of her other releases may leave fans doubting her ability, \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" prooves that just because someone has a slight fall doesn't mean that they're crippled for life. Stevie has recovered and is back, stronger and more amazing than ever before.<br /><br />Some highlights of this album include: \\"Everyday\\"(simple yet addicting!), \\"Sorcerer\\"(A catchy lil' diddy that non-fans will even love!), \\"Fall From Grace\\"(A speedy track perfect for car rides!), and \\"Love Is\\"(A beautifuly simple track that any fan will hold close to their heart).

0061122416|4.0|More parable than novel, \\"The Alchemist\\" uses the story of young shepherd Santiago's search for his Personal Legend as an allegory for everyman's struggle to break from the comfortable confines of conformity and pursue his life dreams.  Along the way, of course, our young everyman is beset by all manner of setbacks, testing his resolve and forcing him to become attuned to the Soul of the World in order to survive.  By paying attention to the details in the world around him, which serve as omens guiding him towards his goal, young Santiago becomes an alchemist in his own right, spinning unfavorable circumstances into riches.<br /><br />Aside from the ubiquitous theme about the power of perseverance, my favorite part of the book was its glorification of simplicity.  Like the pared-down manner in which the story is presented, Santiago's rare ability to get in touch with the Soul of the World comes not from the procedures described in arcane tomes pursued by traditional alchemists, but rather from a simple honesty and observance of the workings of the world.  While the lack of character or plot complexity precludes this minimalist work from being considered a great novel, it will be a satisfying read for those seeking inspiration of the purest sort.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\"
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Director:  Stephen Gaghan <br />Cast:  George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Chris Cooper, William Hurt, Alexander Siddig, Amanda Peet, Christopher Plummer, Tim Blake Nelson, Mark Strong. <br />Running Time:  127 minutes <br />Rated R for violence and language. <br /> <br />\\"Syriana\\" is an inflammatory, confusing, intelligent, emotional, and ultimately important work by the writer of \\"Traffic\\". That film wove together four story lines with four different protagonists on different sides of America's \\"War on Drugs\\". This film acts similarly, weaving together the lives of four men as they navigate the consequences that come about as Western interests stake their claims on the world's ever-dwindling supply of Oil in the Middle East. \\"Traffic\\" negotiated its complicated story (which took place in the U.S. and Mexico) by walking clear and understandable moral lines to American audiences: drugs are a terrible evil, but family and loyalty are the ultimate good, and the two poles are not necessarily mutually exclusive. \\"Syriana\\" is morally hazier than \\"Traffic\\", and plays sort of like the next class up in Big Idea screen writing - \\"Traffic\\" is the prerequisite, and if you could follow it no problem, you're probably smart enough for \\"Syriana\\".  Bob Barnes (George Clooney), a world-worn CIA agent adept at getting his hands dirty in fun locations like Tehran and Beirut, is the first of the four (for lack of a better word) protagonists. Thought to be a liability by his superiors, he's given one last assignment, to arrange the assassination of Prince Nasr (Alexander Siddig), a royal from an unnamed Arab Emirate who awarded an oil contract to the Chinese after they outbid an American company. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst who becomes the economic adviser to Nasr following the tragic death of Woodman's son at the Prince's estate. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), an attorney for Connex Oil, investigates his superiors in order toget a merger with another company, Killen Oil, approved by the Department of Justice. And, back in the Emirate, a young Pakistani man named Wasim Khan (Mazhar Munir) loses his job at the Connex plant when the Chinese take over, and from his economic hardship becomes seduced into radical Islamic fundamentalism. All of these stories intersect each other as each of these men must make decisions to do the Right thing, or do the most Advantageous thing, in what one character calls \\"a fight to the death.\\" Ultimately, though, the film has a dark and upsetting message: that it is in the West's business interests not to ignore the hardship and chaos in the Middle East, but to encourage it. <br /> <br />Ensemble films often come with their own trouble: not having one single character provides the danger of painting everything with a broad brush. Gaghan twists this by providing all the characters with a moral ambiguity that is at the heart of this film's politics. The scenes between Woodman and his wife Julie (Amanda Peet), as she is horrified at how he is profiting off of the death of their son, are painful and glorious at the same time. The quiet way that Holiday is taken into one-on-one conversations and back rooms and corners by members of the Connex and Killen corporations, each trying to shape the quiet man, complicates what ultimately happens with the merger. Barnes seems to constantly be at war within himself, about whether he's weary of feeling bad for the things he's doing, or just weary of doing the only thing he knows how. The film is also helped by a theme of the disconnect between fathers and sons, reminding me that the best films about business are those in which the young go-getter seeks out another paterfamilias in a world of money when the one at home wasn't sufficient (think \\"Wall Street\\").  The performances are all very strong. Clooney put on 35 lbs for the film, and hiding behind the weight and the beard allows him to almost hide inside himself, a man whohad to literally build a thick skin as he realized how few people could understand the world he lives in. Damon is also strong, playing a character with enough seething energy that, in the hands of another actor, might have come off like a bland everyman or an overplayed twit. Wright and Munir allow themselves a quiet, smart observation--you believe their transformations not because the people around them are charismatic (which they are), but because you can see them being filled up by the new worlds they are entering. There is also fine supporting work, possibly the best coming from Siddig as Prince Nasr, a charismatic leader and tragic hero of the film, and Chris Cooper, the head of Killen Oil, who tears around a Board of Directors meeting reminding everyone why he's the only one in the room who doesn't have to wear an uncomfortable-looking suit. <br /> <br />The real central performance, however, is the politics, ideas, and information in the film. At times, the plot points can be a bit confusing as we discover the intricacies of what is going on. This is a good idea, however, because it forces the audience to pay attention to what is going on, allowing them to better absorb the complexities of Oil policy. This film provides an interesting template for films that want to take on complex subjects that affect the whole world. It doesn't just tell interesting stories but opens the audience up to the idea that the world doesn't work in black and white (as it often does in the movies), people do bad things in the \\"Real World\\", but not always for bad reasons, and people do good things, and the world can be left off in worse shape. With this moral ambiguity and the specificity of the politics and situations, \\"Syriana\\" is one of the smartest films to hit the big screen in years. Hollywood should be making more films like this.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This may be the weirdest and most disconcerting film I've ever seen, and I mean that as a compliment. Several days later, scenes are still charging into my head at odd moments and I find myself mulling over images and meanings... A truly strange and original take on the angstiness of adolescence--it capture the doom-laden, dazed, and desperated phase that so many teens go through at one time or another. (At least I did and most of my cohorts did; we were the pre-Goth kids who dressed in black velvet and sported Death sickles and white makeup long after Halloween.) Jake Gyllenhaal manages to be both creepy and cute--I wanna just scoop him up an' give him a big noogie! A great soundtrack, too, which was an unexpected bonus.
B000FA57RG|5.0|I SWEAR THIS IS THE BEST DOCUMENTARY THERE IS... TRUTH OR DARE IS A CLASSIC MADONNA FILM  BUT THIS IS THE BEST OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM!! VERY CANDID & VERY TRUE TO HEART FROM MADONNA!!  IT LETS YOU INTO HER WORLD & BEYOND!!! OPEN YOUR HEART, BE TRUE BLUE & VOGUE!! PEACE
B000002B7U|2.0|If Ozzy were playing golf here, he'd take a mulligan.   <br /> <br />Never have i been so disappointed with an Ozzy release.  I am a huge fan and have to say that when i hear tracks from this album, I cringe.  This album bombed in my mind, and i think it has to do with the bass.  This was Ozzy's first release without Bob Daisley.  Bob was very prominent in writing songs with ozzy and is also a very talented bassist.  He plays a strong rhythm and kicks in some nice fills to give Ozzy some groove.  That was absent here.  Not only did he lose the talent of Bob, Ozzy somehow got stuck with Phil Soussan.  He just wasnt right for Ozzy.  Seeing him live and listening to recordings, its almost as if Phil isnt even part of the process here.  Jake is a good guitar player but he never took off after a pretty solid release of Bark at the Moon.  Killer of Giants had a good sound to it, but that is relative the rest of the album.  I dont think Jake ever felt comfortable in Ozzy's band, and it showed here.   <br /> <br />I only gave it a 2 because i couldnt give Ozzy a 1!
B000001FC0|5.0|This review pertains to the original 1990 release, not to the remastered 2001 version with the extra tracks.<br /><br />\\"Songs from The Big Chair\\" is Tears for Fears' (TFF) sophomore release and exhibits some of the group's best music.  This CD gets deep into the matter that makes up TFF.  From angst to love to a deep understanding of life and the things that make up life, \\"Big Chair\\" is a testament to the feelings we as human beings experience throughout our lives.  Several different musical styles are exhibited, from pop synth to jazz, to rock, to ambient, and even pop/synth/classical with a little tint of operatic counterpoint in \\"Listen.\\"<br /><br />While many listeners concentrate on TFF's hit songs, listening to the music \\"within\\" the music brings to the surface many tonal colors and nuances that are clearly not evident in the radio-edit versions of these works.  This extra music adds to the flavor of the moment and colors the songs in various shades of light and dark that serve to enhance the emotions stimulated therein.  This is especially evident in the songs \\"Shout,\\" \\"The Working Hour,\\" \\"I Believe,\\" \\"Head Over Heels\\" and \\"Listen.\\"<br /><br />\\"Songs from The Big Chair\\" is considered by many to be the album that most defines TFF's music.  It is both open and expressive, exhibitionist and extroverted, while at the same time personal and introspective.  While other artists have successfully exploited these feelings in their music, Tears for Fears does it in a way that uniquely defines them.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|Very few people remember Sandra Bullock starring on the short-lived CBS sitcom Working Girl which was based on the 1988 20th Century Fox film of the same title starring Harrison Ford,Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver. Very few remember Bullock's appearance in the 1991 film LOVE POTION #9. This film catapulted her to superstardom. She stars opposite Keanu Reeves and all hell breaks loose with both of them recklessly driving commercial buses. In the twelve years since this film debuted on the big screen,Bullock relentlessly made films to this very day. Also back in 1994,Hollywood had another megastar,Jim Carrey whose starring debut ACE VENTURA-PET DETECTIVE grossed over $5 million at the box office. Unfortunately,SPEED 2,released in 1997,never acuumulated audiences as large as the ones who saw the first film.
B0000027F3|5.0|<br />  One thing is for sure, this is one of the best albums in the early 90's and of the best of all time in the Judas catalog. This is heavy metal in the simplest and pure form. The guitar complexity here is the main point on the album, Tipton and K.K. Downing never stops to impress me, both are great musicians and Rob Halford great as always improves why is the best metal vocalist of all time along with Bruce Dickinson and James Hetfield. This album is essential!!!
0449227421|5.0|Ken Follett has been one of my favorite authors for a good reason: whatever subject and period he chooses for his novel, he always succeeds. That's because he really knows how to flesh out his characters and make you care about them. <br /> <br />The Third Twin introduces likeable protagonists who uncover a sinister military experiment involving human cloning. Although the technology is fascinating, the focus, as always, is on the people and their personalities. <br /> <br />This books offers enjoyable reading and a well-researched plot. If you like Follett, you won't regret reading this one.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|This was the first Criterion Collection DVD I bought, back around Y2K, and it was followed by many others with the hope that they would be as good as that original purchase (like a junkie).<br /><br />Here's release that's even better, guaranteed.<br /><br />Back in 2000 I was caught off gaurd by the sheer quality of this sweeping yet quirky and subversive film (3 hours, not a boring moment), the digitally enhanced cinematography and the lucid and entertaining audio commentary.<br /><br />In short, I was hooked. On Kurosawa. On Criterion. Again and again, Criterion has done Kurosawa justice. For example, his late masterwork \\"Ran\\" is almost unwatchable in other editions, but haunting, meditative and devastating on the Criterion version.<br /><br />So, to cut to the chase, the highly anticipated news that Criterion is revisiting Seven Samurai with a lavish 3-disc set has me jumping for joy.<br /><br />New digital transfer and subtitles, a new Rashomon-style audio commentary track, rare documentary features. Awesome.<br /><br />Mini-ploto synopsis: A peasant vilage finds itself besieged by a merauding gang of warrior thieves. Contemplating their fate, the vilagers hatch a plan to recruit a handful of \\"ronin,\\" or masterless samurai, as protectors.<br /><br />The only payment: Rice (many Samurai were hungry at the time).<br /><br />At first the villagers find little help. But then a charasmatic group begins to form consisting of six samurai, with Toshiro Mifune as the blundering clod who refuses to leave the group and thus becomes the seventh \\"samurai.\\" What follows is an epic battle sequence and a masterful synthesis of issues and limits faced by the poor in feudal Japan.<br /><br />The Criterion Collection is the best \\"film school in a box\\" I know of. I'd call this new 3-disc set \\"Criterion 101.\\"<br /><br />Now bring back \\"Drunken Angel\\" on DVD, please, Criterion.
B000EGCITG|5.0|thank you Pink !  You will love this cd! In your face ... Mr. President .. this is the best song  on the cd and almost brought me to tears! Thanks also Indigo Girls!  AND she rocks and harmonises and sings her heart out!  Love Love Love it ! Don't miss the fabulous song with her father  .. Oh the whole thing is destined to be a classic album !  Worth the wait !
B00007BKVC|5.0|thelma and louise is a truley great film. both susan sarandon and geena davis bring the characters to life and both deserved there well earned oscar nods. keitel also gives a nice performance and brad pitt also brings his own charisma to the film, its no wonder he became a star overnight. the film tells of two women, thelma and louise, who decide to go on a road trip but after a incident lands them in trouble, they decide to jet to mexico and all the while adding even more felonys from there escape. from begining to end, the film is great fun but truley the best part of the film is the end. though i wont give it away to anyone who hasent seen the film, all i can say is it is probally the best ending in cinamatic history in my opinion. so if you want to see a film that promots female power, great acting, great story, and two memerable characters then this is the film for you.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|This band must be marketing geniuses and/or appeal to an ignorant audience, because they have been nothing but a supreme disappointment for years now. This latest offering is just terrible. I'm embarrassed for them when I hear one of their songs on the radio. My 4-year-old son tells me what a bore they are. And it's true. The songs are inept, lack any substance and Anthony's voice is weak and pathetic.    At least their very early music (backed up with exciting stage shows at the Rainbow Room, Whiskey, Madam Wong's, etc.) had some teeth and excitement to it.
0743454537|3.0|I read this book because it was a top seller in the bookstore I work at, and because it sounded so interesting; a child created specifically to help her other sister live. It sounded so unique.<br /><br />In a way, it was. The topic is definately a good premise, and at the end there were some surprises I didn't see coming, but the book overall wasn't thrilling.<br /><br />Normally I love that a book switches views between characters. But not here. For one, they switched among way too many characters. I couldn't care less what the lawyer and his girlfriend are thinking. Also, all of the characters sounded the same, had the same personality. It was so monotone.<br /><br />It was also frustrating to never know what the main character, Anna, was thinking. Sometimes I was as irritated as the lawyer. \\"Just make up your mind already!\\"<br /><br />Overall, this book wasn't great. I wouldn't spend my money on it.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I will buy PULSE when it comes out of course, being a lover of all things Floyd, but I WANT TDSOT ON DVD TOO!!!  <br /> <br />I went to both concerts (they were at the now defunct Cleveland Stadium) and God bless Gilmour & company for realizing that 90% of the people attending the show were going to be too far away to see anything and staging the show to be seen from a distance (in my case upper deck center). TDSOT was my first Pink Floyd concert and as such holds a special place in my heart, in addition to just being a better film technically. I WANT THE DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER ON DVD!!!
B000FA57RG|5.0|I was fortunate enough to get to see Madonna's Re-Invention show live in Chicago back in 2004. It was my first time to see her live and this tour will always have a soft spot in my heart for that reason. I was VERY fortunate enough to have a front row seat to her Confessions Tour and it reflects alot of Re-Invention in methods of styling and delivery. The documentary does convery a very special message once you get past all of the tour hype and such and actually get into the \\"meat\\" of the film. I remember watching it on MTV with my brother and once the final credit had rolled, we were left in silence... nothing to say... it actually makes you THINK.  The main I reason I wanted this though was for the cd portion of the package. This was her best sounding show even if she did have help with pre-recorded vocals and electronic voice augmentation.. it's the digital era.. get used to it people... The backing vocals were there only as a safeguard for when she has to catch her breath between dance moves and incase a mic fails.. smart thinking if you ask me... the sound quality of the cd is EXCELLENT... expecially if you play it on a high end car system or home theater system.  I REALLY hope Confessions gets a proper DVD release as well as hopefully the full Re-Invention...  I found my copy of \\"Secret\\" at best buy for 17.99 :)
B000005RYQ|5.0|There have been three collections of the \\"best\\" of The Police.  The first, EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE: THE SINGLES, was released in 1986.  More recently, we were given the U.S. release EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE: THE CLASSICS, which contains the biggest Police titles as well as \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me '86\\" and a remixed version of \\"Message in a Bottle\\".  What most people don't know about is this lovely little set, titled simply GREATEST HITS.      It contains all your basic Police tracks - \\"Roxanne\\", \\"Message in a Bottle\\", \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\", \\"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic\\", \\"Every Breath You Take\\", etc.  But it also adds some - the essential \\"So Lonely\\" from OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR, \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" from REGGATTA DE BLANC, and \\"Synchronicity II\\" and the essential \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" from SYNCHRONICITY.  Though The Police only released five albums (not including 1995's LIVE!), they were such a magnificent band that they had many outstanding songs - so many that it would be impossible to collect them all on a single-disc set.  If you could, however, make a set of The Police's greatest songs with only a disc to spare, GREATEST HITS does it.  Every song here is brilliant, even if the set doesn't contain every great song The Police ever recorded.    When compared to the other two compilations - THE SINGLES and THE CLASSICS - GREATEST HITS is far superior.  If you're looking for a good introduction to The Police or to get a taste of what their music was like, I would highly recommend GREATEST HITS.      TRACK HIGHLIGHTS: \\"Roxanne\\", \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", \\"So Lonely\\", \\"Message in a Bottle\\", \\"Walking on the Moon\\", \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\", \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\", \\"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\\", \\"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic\\", \\"Invisible Sun\\", \\"Spirits in the Material World\\", \\"Synchronicity II\\", \\"Every Breath You Take\\", \\"King of Pain\\", \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\", \\"Tea in the Sahara\\"
B0002OERI0|3.0|What happened? You have your punk-rock albums (1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours-Nimrod), put out Warning, going in a different direction, and then release American Idiot, totally different than an album that came out two CD's before? Huh? This isn't much \\"punk,\\" but more mainstream rock. Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, but I'm severly disappointed in them. What would've happened if AI wasn't so popular? Would they go back to their punk roots, like they should right f*cking now? They play stuff like the entire Dookie album, Nimrod album, Insomniac album, and most of Kerplunk!, and 1039 better, but instead, they make songs like \\"Whatsername\\", \\"Give Me Novacaine\\", \\"Extraordinary Girl\\", and the like. I really, really wish that they'd put out a Nimrod-esque album next, not the same as AI.    Key tracks:  American Idiot  She's a Rebel  Give Me Novacaine  Extraordinary Girl
B000002IP1|5.0|Let's face it, Phil Collins ruled in the '80s.  Both with his solo career and with Genesis, Phil was a HUGE commercial force, and it's a case where the commercial success was truly deserved--throughout the decade, this guy gave us a godlike amount of deeply moving and intoxicatingly catchy music that had a wide-ranging appeal.  How could you resist the guy?    Released in November of 1989, \\"...But Seriously\\" is a somewhat transitional effort for Phil.  With the possible exception of the album-opening \\"Hang In Long Enough\\", Phil completely abandons the synthesized dance-rock sound of \\"No Jacket Required\\"--drum machines are still very much present, but they're used much more moderately, with Phil's real live drumming in full force on all of the non-ballad numbers this time around.  And, as the title suggests, Phil gets more capital 'S' \\"serious\\" with the lyrics, tackling such issues as apartheid, ghetto violence, and homelessness, in addition to his usual introspective and romance-themed material.  Phil had begun to really put his money where his mouth was in the late '80s/ early '90s regarding the homelessness issue, a theme which can actually be traced all the way back to \\"Man On The Corner\\" from Genesis' 1981 \\"Abacab\\" album, but Phil makes it much more explicit here, particularly on the huge hit \\"Another Day In Paradise\\".    Phil's move away from 'just-plain-fun' a la \\"Sussudio\\" and toward more political writing seems to have been partly an attempt to silence his detractors; this backfired somewhat, as his attempts at social commentary were accused of being overly simplistic, and I'll admit there is some merit in this accusation.  There's a visible formula that Phil established here and would continue to use on his next couple albums--use a series of scene-setting verses, then alternate it with a chorus that features a 'one-line summation' of it all, such as \\"it's just another day for you and me in paradise\\" or \\"that's just the way it is\\".  Phil himself admitted ina promo interview around the time of \\"...But Seriously\\"'s release that he's \\"not a very well read person\\" and that he lives his life \\"by common sense\\".  All that said, Phil's attempts at social commentary here are undeniably earnest, well-intentioned, and generally quite thoughtful.  Two of them feature striking harmony vocals from David Crosby--the moody \\"Another Day In Paradise\\", with its creepy intro, arpegiatted guitars and pensive guitar harmonics (from Dominic Miller), and swooping bass line (from Leland Sklar), is heart-wrenchingly beautiful; and the Northern Ireland-themed \\"That's Just The Way It Is\\" is also really moving and typically atmospheric.  The 8 & 1/2+ minute \\"Colours\\", about South Africa, is a musical tour-de-force, starting off with a gorgeous ballad section, then featuring a percussion-drenched segue which eventually gives way to a rousing, uptempo, horn-laden pop-rocker, and the quasi-coda really brings closure to this epic track.  \\"Heat On The Street\\", which Phil originally wrote for The Four Tops, swings along with an irresistible catchiness, punctuated by great wordless background vocals.    \\"Hang In Long Enough\\" is kind of an ironic album-opener.  People had already accused \\"Sussudio\\", the opening song on \\"No Jacket Required\\", for sounding like a rip-off of Prince's \\"1999\\", but \\"Hang In Long Enough\\" takes this a step further, with the main riff being an almost direct clone, but it's an incredibly fun, rousing song in its own right, with Phil going all-out vocally.    As for the rest of the big hits... \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\", co-written by Daryl Stuermer and originally written for the movie \\"The War Of The Roses\\", is uncharacterically weak, with the lyrics being a virtual cliche-a-thon.  But there are a couple of terrific lost-love ballads including \\"Do You Remember\\", with a soaring middle-eight and Phil's close friend Stephen Bishop singing all of the song's background vocals; and the majestic, gospel-ish \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\" which features Eric Clapton on lead guitar.    \\"All Of My Life\\" is a tender ballad that feels a little generic for Phil, plus it blatantly derives from the Tootsie theme \\"It Might Be You\\" which, not so coincidentally, was performed by Stephen Bishop, but it's still affecting, and enhanced by some tasteful Hammond organ playing from Steve Winwood.    The album's penultimate track is the heart-wrenching ballad \\"Father To Son\\", written for Phil's then pre-teen son Simon.  And the closer \\"Find A Way To My Heart\\" is a joyful uptempo feel-good tune with great spirited vocals from Phil.    So, despite the minor gripes, \\"...But Seriously\\" is still a masterpiece by any realistic measure.  The weakest tracks are hardly bad, and even if you ignore them, you're left with so much prime Phil Collins material, no one in the right mind could possibly go wrong.    (P.S.  There are a load of non-album b-sides from this era, including an intriguing 3/4 time demo of \\"Another Day In Paradise\\" entitled \\"Homeless\\"; the super fun, riffy pop-rocker \\"That's How I Feel\\"; and another quality pop-rocker with \\"You've Been In Love (That Little Bit Too Long)\\".)
B000EULJLU|5.0|***I pressed 'play'..... <br /> <br />In a world where gas prices are immensely to high and finding a regular job comes as close as getting a date with Jennifer Anniston, we have a new Tool record. Granted, the new listener might have some trouble at first listen appreciating the sound. Then of course there's the,\\"oh I just don't like it\\" opinion. It's a c.d., your either going to like it or your not, it's really that simple. However--when you write a review( and most of us can see right through the common writer ), some would at least make an honest effort that they just didn't come on here and wanted to get it off there chest that this record did not quite fulfill there expectations.  <br /> <br />Now--that's okay--last time I checked everyone had an expectation for the new Tool c.d. right? .....Well am I right? <br /> <br />Bringing to your attention that yes I do think sarcasm is the greatest thing in the world and yes, I do not have an Enlgish major from school, I can honestly tell you that nothing I type out here is going to motivate a certain someone to get off of there couch and purchase this c.d.( unless you are a Dallas Maverick fan and are that heartbroken ) No--the object of this review is to open some eyes.  <br /> <br />This is not the \\"Undertow\\" record.  <br /> <br />This is not the \\"Aenima\\" record. <br /> <br />This is not the \\"Lateralus\\" record.  <br /> <br />I just don't know where to start--really I mean that( no I don't ) <br /> <br />If you really had no expectation, what's the problem here? If you are not a new listener, what's the problem here? We all know( at least I hope ) that Tool records are never going to sound a certain way. I always say that Tool is the Led Zeppelin of yester-year. They may not sell as many records--this does not influence my opinion--they play there instruments. Musicianship at it's finest can be heard on any Tool record. How many artists today sound like Tool or put near as much energy/effort into a c.d.? It certainly is not Three Days Grace. People respect Tool for their 'changes', and when I say changes, I do NOT mean playing the same repetitious chords over--and over--again and again. So this review is for the veteran listener, the rookie is excused.  <br /> <br />A question in my Headline may strike a question mark--who is Newmann?  <br /> <br />Newmann is the rookie in the Tool world. The new listener is not going to accept this sound right away if at all. If you are the Newmann--may I suggest--not starting with \\"10,000 Days\\" rather start with \\"Undertow\\" or \\"Opiate\\", your opinion of this c.d. may dramatically change. I am not going to express that certain songs on this c.d. have absolutely( insert big word and or analogies here ) riffs. The best advice I can give the reader is just listen. You may not like it but repsect it. Effort should count for something.  <br /> <br />But hey--everyone has a right to there ridiculous opinion.  <br /> <br />My favorite song on this compact disc: <br /> <br />Lost Keys( Blame Hofmann ) <br /> <br />( insert intelligent review ending here ) <br /> <br />                   .....And 20 years later I pressed 'stop'*** <br />This my friends is what makes Tool special--twenty years from today you will look back and say,\\" That was a good record \\". In other words, it will STILL sound good.
B000002I6V|4.0|In all honesty, I used to be skeptical about Graham Nash. I figured the guy was just too reliant on lightweight sugariness; seriously, I used to think that \\"Our House\\" was from Herman's Hermits or something. But Nash really proved me wrong, and it pretty much all started with 1971's \\"Songs For Beginners\\", his first solo album.     The running time is quite short to begin with, and a few tunes don't make much of an impact, but otherwise \\"Songs For Beginners\\" gives you pretty much everything you could want from a singer-songwriter album--intimate arrangements, really thoughtful and poignant lyrics, supreme tunefulness on song after song, and even a sly diversity to the proceedings. The bouncy, swinging \\"Military Madness\\" is a soaringly melodic anti-war song, with passionately gutsy singing from Graham. \\"Better Days\\" is a brilliant song that beats John Lennon at his own game--really powerful lyrics and echoing double-tracked vocals from Graham on the haunting mid-section, plus a hair-raising high note from him on the closing verse (man, he really had to REACH to hit that one!). The country-flavored lost-love ballad \\"I Used To Be A King\\" is incredibly emotional and moving, with a triumphant, soulful vocal performance from Graham. \\"Be Yourself\\" (the one song Graham doesn't have sole writing credit for) and \\"There's Only One\\" have wonderfully thoughtful and gracefully poetic lyrics. I don't agree at all with those who have mocked Nash's rhyming scheme on \\"There's Only One\\", and his earnest vocal rendering just makes the song all the more effective.  \\"Chicago\\", written about the 1968 Democratic Convention, finds Nash working a soulful, organ-laced R&B groove to rousing effect. The acoustic folk song \\"Wounded Bird\\" is an entirely solo performance from Nash, with a simple 3-chord strum as the basis for another wonderful melody and a really witty lyric about what it takes to win a woman's heart.     Admittedly, the album does fall a little short of a masterpiece.  There are afew songs that, though by no means embarassing, don't have much impact.   \\"Man In The Mirror\\" has a great bit of descending melodicism on the quasi-chorus, but the verse melody is tossed-off.  The fittingly-titled \\"Sleep Song\\", written while Nash was still with the Hollies but reportedly rejected by the rest of the band, is a tender, lightly-orchestrated acoustic ballad, but it's on the dull, and indeed sleepy side, and the same goes for the James Taylor-esque \\"Simple Man\\", the latter of which was written just after Nash's breakup with Joni Mitchell in June of 1970.     But for the most part, I've been blown away by \\"Songs For Beginners\\"--I never suspected to discover such a strong album here. If you lean more towards the ROCK & ROLL end of things, you might find your attention wandering--the album absolutely never goes beyond mid-tempo, and with the possible exception of \\"Chicago\\"/\\"We Can Change The World\\", nothing can even remotely qualify as a 'rocker'. However, if you have any kind of appreciation for a fine singer-songwriter effort, \\"Songs For Beginners\\" is really worth picking up.
B000FA57RG|1.0|We need a real concert release on DVD of this Tour. What a waste of resources and time getting this released Sure the Documentary is nice and all but We want the full concert I don't have over 200.00 to see her live so it would be nice to get the next best thing - so to speak - and get to see it all the way thru unitterupted ... I was dying to see Burning Up - It is such a real let down to fans. I doubt we will ever see it on DVD at this point. I was hoping she would have made a deal with Best Buy Corp to release a DVD set feauring Tours such as Blond Ambition esp the Japan show that was released on Laserdisc in Japan only (which I own) - in the same respect to releases they did for Elton John, Rolling Stones... but looks likes this years pick is Mariah Carey! haha great news for fans although this may be considered a leak since it hasn't been officialy announced. Maybe someday we will get the reinvention tour on DVD I was hoping for a nice 2 disc set with dts audio with nice cover art - Madonna and her team did such a gret promotional job with that tour and posters etc .. it is s shame there isn't much to remember it by.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|...is all I hear from the purists who complain about the scene in the cantina being altered in the special editon of \\"A New Hope\\".  In all honesty though, it would be a great tie-in slogan for this year's \\"limited edition\\" release.  I really should be in marketing.  Anyway, brace yourselves folks, because you're finally gonna get to relieve this classic moment over and over to your hearts delight...in all it's 2.0 Dolby Surround and Full Screen glory!?!?       I have absolutely no intentions on buying these when they are released.  I bought the 2004 boxset when it came out, and I'm VERY pleased with it.  However, just when I thought that was it, he re-released it last year, WITHOUT extras.  The only thing that was better about last year's version was the vintage artwork on the boxset.         That brings us to this year's version.  Why would George Lucas FINALLY decide to release the originals to those hardcore fans that've been clamoring for them, only to do it with subpar quality? Is it laziness?  Is he on a power trip?  I'm sorry, but without Dolby 5.1 and Widescreen format, I would'nt purchase these versions from the $5 bargain bin at Wal-Mart.  The fans, especially those who've waited for these versions for so long, deserve better...and should wait even longer.  I'll give you 2 reasons why.       HD-DVD and Blu-Ray.  Which technology will succeed?  The answer, my fellow consumers and SW fans alike, will ultimately be determined by us.  Once the smoke clears, and the true next-gen format has been determined, there's not a doubt in my mind that George will once again re-release an original trilogy boxset w/both the original and special editons intact.  Only, and I mean ABSOLUTELY ONLY after this version is released will I \\"consider\\" buying this boxset yet again.       For the fans who feel that they must absolutely own these movies now, my words are falling on deaf ears.  For those who have patience, I'm sure you agree with my sentiments whole-heartedly.  Remember, Han's STILL going to shoot first.  When he does however, I'd prefer to view and hear it in the best format possible.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|What a fantastic concert video. Usually, 2 DVDs full of music is ample for any live event. However, in this case it barely skims the surface. After all, there were a number of noteworthy guitarists at the concert who weren't even featured (Jeff Beck for one. Why is he listed in the Amazon credits?). <br />One other problem: Booker T & the MGs (with Steve Cropper on guitar) were featured as Joe Walsh's backing band, but nowhere on the DVD credits were they mentioned. Considering the legendary status of these musicians, they should have been given equal credit with the other players. What's up with that?
