B007B6VOG0|3.0|This is a great album. There's a lot of songs that I love on it. A few of my favorites are we are young, some nights, and carry on. The songs are fun and catchy.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is not a standard reading topic for me but I'm glad I took a chance.  The book introduces the reader to a new world of creatures, witches and vampires.  A historical love story with a twist.  Enlightening, entertaining, and enjoyable.  PERFECT FUN READ!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked the 3rd book because it had more story to it--not so much sex.  There was more development of the characters--especially Mr. Grey.  The kinky sex was tamer and more real.
B008BM9L72|4.0|They are very easy to read books and truth behold the story sometimes feels like it was written by a 15 year old.<br />However the scenes that we are all interested in are not too bad and I can I certainly understand why women all over the world love this book.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading them and found them quite easy to complete within one weekend.<br /><br />I hope that all other people out there enjoy these, but also keep in mind that not every woman in the world is an `Anastasia Steele'
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Really great documentary a really must see if you like bob marley you will love this a lot of stuff you didn't know about bob
B007HIEBV2|5.0|No reason not to buy it if you love Electro Swing, and a really great place to start listening if you're thinking about giving it a shot.
0553386794|5.0|I loved this book and I can't wait to read A Clash of Kings.<br /><br />It was confusing at first due to the large number of characters, but once you get used to them this book is hard to put down. Although it has over 800 pages, A Game of Thrones is fast-paced so it won't take that much time to be read.<br /><br />The characters were very interesting, some of them not very likable, but all of them had many-layers and were very believable. Few are totally good or evil, most of them being in the \\"gray area\\" making some choices which weren't that moral or honorable but you could understand why they had to do what they did. The characterizations were done very well and the author doesn't care if a character is bad or good...they all have the same chance to die in some tragic and horrible way.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of eight main characters and each of them have also their separate storyline. There was something which I didn't like that much: Daenerys's chapters. I just think that her role wasn't that important in this first book (although I'm sure she will become a very important character in the next installments) and I felt that her story didn't fully connect to the main plot.<br /><br />The writing was good and it wasn't pretentious which made the book easy to read. There are a lot of descriptions (places, people) but I think they were necessary.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone, but mostly to the fantasy fans.<br />PS: It contains a lot of sex scenes and violence.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|This was an interesting season, with very good developments to the characters.  The storyline was not the best of all the seasons, but it was still good and the character development may have been the most interesting of them all.  I also thought the two actors playing the villains did an excellent job, and it is always good to see Mos Def!
034580404X|5.0|Very good purchase for the price paid.  The story is so engaging that I actually read all three books in 2 1/2 weeks.  I would reccommend not only purchasing this trilogy from Amazon.com for the price but for the story line itself.  E L James is dynamic.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Teriffic book that gives insight into some of the secret working of the elite Navy SEALs. From the intense training, to recounting live warfare, this book is exciting and a must read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|was a little slow to start but now i love it. play it all the time on my fire. not many friends thouhg
B002PJN59M|4.0|I put on the DVD of Excalibur for the first time with my HD TV and was surprised at the poor transfer, I had watched before, I knew it wasn't good, on a large HD TV it's unacceptable. The Blu-Ray is not perfect but the transfer is much improved. For $10 it's a buy.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I am about 2/3 of the way thru this book, and so far, I have found it to be very entertaining. Each story sequence, leaves one wanting more, (until the first few sentences of the following chapter).<br />Then, one is soon hooked onto another interesting cycle of the next fascinating tale.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FC0ZAI The Cloud Atlas]]This book is imaginative and very well written. I have the Kindle version, and I find myself using the Kindle Android App every spare moment. I rate this five stars.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing this game! I just sit back and relax and play FF! U really enjoy the challenge. Amazing fun!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The story was slowing down much in book 4 and now in book 5 ist  finally seems not to move at all. Martin has not lost his abilities. The main characters still develope in an interesting and credible way. Yet somehow without time moving around them.<br /><br />The more I think about it the more I come to the sad conclusion that the story cannot go on. Winter will not come because it can't.<br /><br />The flaw lays in the very beginning of the first book. What I nice idea to create a world were summers and winters are not bound to their proper places within one year. A place with summer children who never see winter during their childhood. It  was the implication of cruel winter of equal length which made the Others what they are: a looming menance, something you cannot avoid or hide from for a view chilly month in order to survive. You want to survive such a winter - you have to face and overcome the Others.<br /><br />But if you try to go into details of that winters you soon realize that it needs no Others to ruin Westron. This world is so closely related to our middle age that it never had any chance surviving such winters. The agriculture , the society, the towns, farms inns everything seems somehow familiar. But such a world has no ability to survive some years of snow covered frost. It has no need of a five king war or even Others to go extinct in any of such winters.<br /><br />Martin in not Tolkien. He invested all his creativity in interesting, fascinating characters. I love him for that. But he did not put equal consequence in creating a society that has the ability to survice 5 years without a harvest and without means of transportation in the blasting winter storms. Such a world simply could not be organised and look like our middle ages.<br /><br />And now he feels it. Winter simply cannot start, the story cannot progress. Winter will not come.<br /><br />Wolfgang
0765357151|4.0|It's important to realize this is a collection of short stories with \\"I am Legend\\" just being the longest- a novella.  The other stories are great, too.  \\"Dance of the Dead\\" is one of the most haunting stories I've ever read.  It has stuck with me for years as a statement on what happens when we lose our humanity, and what it feels like to know you are a single appauled voice in a crowd of inappropriate cheers.  The animated dead performing as entertainment is only part of the horror of the story.  The fact that people perceive it as entertainment is even worse.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|I heard about this book in CIO magazine, and was intrigued because in essence I have been saying the same thing for the past few years now. That is, that<br />  a) technology, by its nature, replaces people<br />  b) the historically accurate reply to the Luddites of \\"don't worry, in 10 years, there will be jobs we cannot imagine today\\" has held true - until now, because<br />  c) the jobs \\"we cannot imagine today\\" surely will come, but those will require very high levels of education and intelligence which the vast majority of people will not have, even while low-skill jobs are obviated by technological progress (think iRobot making a Roomba that picks strawberries).<br /><br />The authors point out these things, so naturally I am satisfied about that. They do, however, have a more optimistic view of the future than I. Their listing of 15 things we can do to address these issues are certainly well thought out, but I think their optimism comes from thinking that these things will come to pass, whereas I am not so sure.<br /><br />It's a quick read, though, and I think worth a perusal by anyone thinking about the \\"big picture\\" of the future
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|best game ever. I can play it all day. I love this game. You should totally buy it!!!!!!!!! By the whey its free.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|A good film about an honest vet who gets setup as a patsy by the arrogant shadow govt and somehow survives.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the first book several times and was looking forward to seeing the movie. The movie was not a disappointment. Sometimes the movie is so different from the book that you wonder how it could have changed so much, but in this case the changes were so minor that the essence of the book remained intact. Anyone who read the book will be pleased with the movie and will look forward to seeing the next two.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This album is simply excellent.  I purchased it a couple of weeks ago because of the recommendation of a friend.  Today as I was rating each song either a 4/5 or 5/5 in my music library I was struck by the fact that I've never ranked any album so highly and thus felt compelled to write this review.  Maybe it's just where I'm at right now, but I simple love their sound.  It's the best album I've bought on Amazon thus far.  I'll definitely be purchasing their next album whenever it comes out.
B0044WSF5M|5.0|Very nostalgic, reminds us of a more innocent time when kids had fun and were happy. Good for a trip down memory lane but don't think anyone under 30 could relate to it.
B002EXMYBY|4.0|This is one of my favorites.  My son and I love to watch the Bourne series when we have the opportunity.  Have not seen Legacy.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My 2 year old loves watching this \\"pincess movie\\" and asks for it at least once a day.  We love the convenience of the instant video app on my ipad so she can watch a movie when we drive to visit her grandparents 3 hours away.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Actually, this is the first Stephen King novel I've *ever* read.  It came on the recommendation of a friend and I chose it because I remember, as a schoolchild, 11/22/63.<br /><br />This is a *huge* book, 900+ pages in Kindle form, and worth the read.  If you like historical fiction, with a large dollop of science fiction thrown in, with almost no horror or gore, the genres that Stephen King uses to pay the bills, you will treasure every page.  He's a master storyteller and you know he's pulling you in, but you're delighted to go along for the ride.  Enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed exploring this book! Many people I know didn't like it! But I thought it was a very interesting read!!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES File Explorer is the android version (sort of) Windows Explorer on your PC.  It gives you access to the files on your phone or Kindle Fire so that you can manipulate them directly (carefully). This comes in handy for deleting, copying, or moving files, but you do need to make sure you know what you are doing because on a phone or Kindle it is not always as straightforward as it can be on a PC. This is a very useful utility.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was absolutely captivated by this book for the first 95% of it.  It had extremely interesting characters, unexpected and creative twists and turns while being well written.  Then all of a sudden, SCREECH>>> the ending was easily one of the stupidest resolutions I've ever read. Seriously pathetic.  It seemed like the author completely ran out of ideas or just hit the required amount of pages promised to the publisher and just abruptly ended it.  There is absolutely no way the characters described so well throughout the book would have ever accepted or participated in the trite ending.  What a complete letdown.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Excellent read. A memorable journey with rich experiences of a man on a newfound mission later in life giving him new passion and understanding.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I haven't read fiction for years due to lack of time and ebook reader. This one the first fiction I bought for my kindle. I should say I really enjoyed reading. Little bit scared to seen it happening. Will recommend to a friend!
B003DS9ECQ|5.0|Growing up in the 90's and 00's I've experienced a lot of Space Jam in my life.  It was one of my favorite movies as a kid and still is.  The all star lineup or 90's NBA greats and Legendary looney tunes is tremendously awesome.<br /><br />I honestly feel that Space Jam should have the title of \\"Greatest movie of all time\\".<br /><br />P.s.  I still feel the big red hairy guy should've been on the Tunesquad.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I have watched this movie three time this week and each time I see something different, I love the movie so much I got all three books, the book is always better then the movie. What I love about the book you are inside her head the whole time, knowing what she is thinking. The only way you can come close is her face when something is happening or about to happen. This movie came as close to the book as I have seen in a long time. I don't want to give away one minute of the movie, all I can tell you she is sixteen years old and has to play the hunger game in place of her younger sister. Any food her family eats she hunts,she is not suppose to hunt on Capitol land she could be killed for it. Each year there are a drawing to pick a boy and girl from twelve to eighteen to play the game to the death she is in district twelve there are twelve districts in all, a boy girl from each, only one player can win the game The first half sets you up for the game.  Buy the dvd set back with some pop corn and enjoy the ride of your life. Then read the book.
B008EQIEWS|2.0|Not as fun as the first one, many \\"why did they do that?\\" moments.  While the effects are mostly great (kind of iffy on the cyclops), the acting is not there, a talented cast is wasted, teams are just thrown together, and what could be mindless popcorn entertainment just seems a waste.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|It was really awesome.  Very inspiring to see how Jiro continually strives to push the boundaries and raise the bar on the art of sushi making.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This DVD and CD set is terrific. An assembling of some of the greatest Chicago blues legends. The joy and love these guys have for both each other, and the music is evident. An authentic, spontaneous blues experience!
B007HJ84ZK|2.0|Previews on tv led me to beleive this was a midevil story of intrigue with lots of sword play. I paid too much for the one episode I watched. Sorry, but since I didn't enjoy the first viewing experience I will not be watching any more of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is one of the best apps on my tablet and I think it id grate for all ages so get temple run and it is free
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I hated this book! I wished I didn't buy it. It was so boring and has no substantial plot! I couldn't even finish it. It has been so over publicised by the media, really it is not worth a dime! If I can give a zero star rating, then that would be it. So unfortunately, this book is not one that I would ever recommend anyone to read! For Amazon lowest rating that I could give - a one star. Do not buy this book! Disappointing...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of three books I will never forget.. The other two are: Sarah's Key\\", and \\"Angela's Ashes\\".  You have a desire to love, hold, and protect this sweet and clever adolescent as she and her family cope with a Germany approaching and then falling into chaos.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Relaxing game.  Not too difficult but hints are available as well as the option to buy the solution with coins you earn during the game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very slow start but ok read. Hard to figure out in the beginning. I finished it because i paid for it..probably wouldnt have otherwise.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The story is unique; the characters are all victims of circumstance, personal choices, and/or the lack of inner strength; the locations informative, but the technique of telling what has already happened, and then reliving those events as they happen was so slow moving and so often repetitive, the desire to skip pages won out. It can be compared to an autopsy of a cadaver to discover how it died when said cadaver has a hatchet embedded in its skull. This reader felt robbed of the satisfaction that one victim survived reasonably intact, denied that emotion quite possibly because of  Ford\\"s writing style.<br />Madelyn Lorber, Author of THE EYES HAVE IT
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|from Oregon so its awsome. Its like reliving what my ancestors went through. I really don't know what else to say.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|What can I say? It's a great recording that every true rock fan should have. I had it on cassette when it came out. Someone recorded it for me, and I listened to it til I grew tired of it. Fast forward 15 years and it was forgotten about since my current listening is more Blues, but I have children who love the Blues, but when they hear some Van Halen, Ozzy, Tool, and Pumpkins, they lose their minds. Amazon offered this recording for $5.00. No brainer for me. I should have always owned it, but now I truly do. I'm happy and my boys are too. Who says, \\"If it's too loud, you're too old\\"?
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Have always heard about this film and its memorable character \\"Robbie the Robot\\" but had never seen it. It was a great sci-fi film from the late 50's or 60's. Not like the ones we see today with all of the computer generated effects but a great film. Starring many actors you will recognize even though they are much younger than we remember them. Really worth seeing and encourage you to see it.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, after watching on Amazon I had to have it.. Russell goes from being a \\"little bit\\" of an unscrupulous broker to getting back to enjoying life and allowing himself to love..Albert Finney is great as Russells' excentric uncle but I won't give any spoilers about his love life.... You Gotta see it!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Love this CD. For such a young lead singer, she brings as much soul as Aretha. Everyone should check this out!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book definitely deserves 5 stars.  Blake Crouch as now become one of my favorite authors and have been ordering on my kindle all his books.  Have been a huge fan of Deen Koontz and Stephen King for years but Blake has definitely surpassed them by far.
B005C6HGSG|4.0|If you like the series, go ahead and get it.  One of the firsts few books I read on my kindle fire.
B007ZAI2C6|5.0|Castle and Beckett in an entertaining episode that keeps you guessing and laughing. One of the best shows of the season.
B008KL2ITW|1.0|I read this book after reading 50 Shades,  it was suggested on some website as what I could read next, to come down off the fifty shades high....<br />I found the book ok to read and seen it through to the end, It was a very destructive love story with a happy ending for the main characters. If your into possessiveness. I didn't get anything out of it at all. Certainly not the book a grown up wants to read. I wouldn't recommend it to the over 25's
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A great book about the strength of love, the human character, and what it means to be a friend. I highly recommend this book as well as Looking for Alaska.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I find this series entertaining, complex but light.  The character development is quick and continues to deepen with each book.  This series is the perfect way to relax after a stressful day.
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie!  Now I want to read the books because I hate waiting for the next movie to be released.  I was expecting a very different presentation and was pleasantly surprised.
B008ETOSYI|4.0|I might be partial to love stories but then again what women is not.  Loved the movie and watched it many times over.  If you want a simple love story about a guy who finds his place in the world after coming back from war this is your movie.  I will be purchasing the movie to add to my collection of love stories.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I read a lot on my kindle when i'm rocking my child to sleep, and this one is actually not a book i recommend for that because i literally laugh out loud.  She is SO funny and you can hear her saying these things as you read it.  If you like her and you like funny stories, this is a home run purchase.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I think that maybe I should have read the books first.  I could really not get into the movie that much.  Really out there even for me and I watch some really weird things at times.  Maybe the next movie will be better and get more of my attention.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Insightful, riveting, terrifying, well written. Makes me question whether you can really know anyone else. Loved the insight about human nature, manipulation, society and technology. Hope beyond hope there is a sequel and he wins!!
B0081X40HW|3.0|I love Haley's raspy voice but the richness of the songs were not there for me.  I actually forgot that I bought the album until I received a reminder to review the album.  It was not memorable on the first go around.  I will give it a second chance.  Maybe that's why the title is Listen Up because you may get distracted ...
B005RUUUAI|5.0|i was very happy to get it fast it took 2 days wear did it come from what state  did it come from
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a fan of Stephen King except for the true horror genre.  I love his stories that have just a \\"touch\\" of supernatural in them, like \\"The Green Mile\\".  I was born in the late 50's, so I know something about the era.  This is a great tale and King's character development is realistic.  This book kept me hooked and I read in three days.  An excellent read, highly recommended.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|If the author had left out all of the liquid soap, the fingers running through wet hair, the product names & the \\"laters, babe\\"s, the book would've been only half as long. However, as the sexual content was so explicit & obviously meant to shock, and the book was talked about so much, you just had to read it to know what people were talking about. Reading about sex can become very tedious. I am glad I read it, but at the same time I felt it was a waste of time.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the book Hunger Games before I watched the movie, I still enjoyed the move and was surprised at how close it followed the movie.  My husband did not read the book and wanted to see the movie again as he felt he had missed parts of it.  We both enjoyed watching it again in the comfort of our home.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Graphics are great. Gameplay is smooth. Game becomes welcomingly harder with each level and has excellent guiding. The music is not annoying but can be turned off if you want. Not buggy. Game can be turned navigated from any screen and even your back or home button gets you out of it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really like this book.  I've read book 1 so I figured to read book 2. Almost finished and will definitely read book 3.  Looking forward to more from this author.
B007MQSR6O|5.0|I never got to read this book as a child,and now, at the age of 73, I'm enjoying it tremendously.  I've seen 2 movie versions but the book is so much more in depth.  The characters are well-drawn, there is humor and pathos. I have laughed and cried reading it. I am not finished yet, but I am so happy to be reading it.  This book was first published in 1868 and wears it's age better than I do.  The mother's handling of her daughters should be required reading for all mothers.  I wish I had read it while I was struggling with my own adolescent/teen-age daughters.  I might have been a happier time for all of us.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I found the book addictive even though I initially thought it to be shallow reading.  The creative writing gets better, even though repetitive.  Now I just have to read the next one!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved reading this trilogy. I was mad and in awe of it at the same time. Just amazing and highly recommended for those who want an interesting love story
B007IXWKUK|4.0|overall a good read..can be a little long during certain parts..will keep your attention with the introduction/development of new characters and (of course) all the hot and steamy scenes between Ana and Christian..looking forward to finishing the trilogy and reading book three!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really like the main characters, and the baseline for the story,but this story just dragged on and on.  It got very boring and confusing near the end.  Also, it seemed like the author was as sick of writing the book as I was sick of reading it.  It ended so abruptly....the worst part is that I really got no satisfaction with the end of the book.  I think this could be turned into a great movie by chopping 70% of the book off, sort of like the first movie did.  This is the first series where I like the movie much more than the book.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Lets see, I bought these in May and now its September and guess what....no just guess...ok I give you 3 guesses.<br /><br />1) they work superb - no wrong<br /><br />2) they work average - no wrong<br /><br />3) they suck<br /><br />hahahahha yesss they suck. They already stopped working. The sound breaks up real bad and I have to keep turning the knob around to hear 'cept when Im running it not so convenient. Well what do you expect anyway. Want my money back imo. Bro!
B000W1V7K4|1.0|it came with empty case, there is no disk inside. very disappointed.<br />please be careful when you order... waste time.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is very appropriate for little kids.  Very very funny! We watch it with our 2- and 3-year-old boys. Repeatedly!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It is a true fairytale and very nicely written. I liked it so much better than the first book in the series and have not read the third, but find it hard to believe it could be better. Awesome read!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book is fun and naughty to read. Love it. Sure it's not the most intellectually stimulating material but hey that isn't the point of the book so enjoy it for what it is. :0)
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love it I mean of course I want mine craft READ THIS POST NOTCH!!! but I really like it as a rpg but do the people hurt you gather stuff near them? oh yeah spiders under water anooiny
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Just about the best movie EVER.  It is even great for kids who need reaffirmation of their value.  How a simple young lad learns all about bullying and that the response is not always to fight back but to stand your ground and continue on the righteous path.
B007SGM084|3.0|Do I really need to read what might be going on in the lives of the rich and famous, (all though the characters here are fictional) in their bedrooms?  I don't think so but the story and characters are entertaining.  Is it a great read, no.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|This was not Philipa Gregory's best book. I think that there was not enough material on her subjects to write a historical fiction about them. She did a lot of repeating the same information.
B007704HO6|5.0|If you love animals you will love this book. I was in tears of laughter and sadness.<br />They both needed each other in their lives to make it better and its such a lovely book, that cat is a star!<br />A must read for animal lovers!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really am enjoying this series. It took the movie to get me started, but now I'm hooked.  Great read!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I was a little upset, not mad or angry long. You see I wanted The kindle fire tablet for mostly Bible study. The main book I wanted was not an off line book for the kindle but on and off line for the apple ipad. But I wanted the kindle. I was able to read the youversion on line. But to take it to Lake Erie, watch the sky& the waves & the sunset. Reading the word is the beauty of GOD HANDY WORK WAS GOING TO BE THE JOY. I DO USE YOUVERSION BIBLE ON MY CELLPHONE IT HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT BIBLE. YOU CHOSE THE ONE YOU WANT TO READ. I LIKE THE KJV,NKJV,&THE AMP. YOUVERSION HAS IT FOR YOUR KINDLE FIRE ONLY ON LINE. THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON I SENT MY KINDLE FIRE BACK. I GUESS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. BUT TRY IT FOR YOUR SELF. IT'S THE BEST BOOK TO READ.SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE CHANGE FROM THEM TO US. BUT THAT CAN BE GOOD FOR US TO SEE OURSELF IN THE BOOK WHERE GOS IS THW AUTHOR.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, they did as much of the book as possible without making it 5 hours long...CGI is rough early on but good after the entrance to the arena.
B000YBU8JI|5.0|this movie play excellent,dont have any grainy or spot,is great deal.their special features is great.their cover is very nice and modern is like 3 d cover.
B008CP93S0|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for this film because it had been generally panned, as far as I could see.  But I love Paul Rudd, so I figured it couldn't be too bad.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was ridiculously funny.  It contains one of the funniest scenes I have ever come across.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was given this book as a gift Tuesday afternoon and finished it late Tuesday evening,then read it again Wed.Awesome book! Since i'm a Libertarian i dont really care about the politics of this book and there is miniscule amount of politics found inside.A politician claiming credit for other peoples work, nothing new there.What was disconcerting though was the policies the SEAL's and others were forced to obey later in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.It is no wonder so many of our bravest and best Americans are coming home crippled and in body bags.Our soldiers are not policeman and should not be held to a disadvantage in war where their enemies get the upper hand.Sheer stupidity on the policy makers whom are safe here in America and not facing a well trained enemy.This book is not an autobiography in a real sense it mostly concentrates on  \\"Marks' and his fellow SEAL's training and engagements.As always, i am stunned about how brave these soldiers truly are.The staff of power story had me rolling with laughter.Brave men indeed but with a bit of Beevis and Butthead inside.I love it! Mark has joined the long list of men and women who have told their stories of their personal and fellow soldiers efforts and we should be thankful for them.If telling the truth about the events that brought Osama Bin Laden to Justice is Unethical to you,i think you may need to reassess your own ethics.History does not write itself! Highly recommended!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Read it in 24 hours because I just couldn't put it down. The best of the Series!  Wish there was more.
0345529057|4.0|I love the HBO show , but so much more detail was in the books. Your imagination can truly run free. The character development and writing were superb. Highly recommend these books!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fabulous! But buy the third at the same time. There is a cliff hanger and you won't want to be without the third book after finishing this one.
B007SGM084|5.0|Really good and cheaper than buy one by one.<br />In portuguese existe only the first one translated yet.<br />Recommended, but not for children
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|After reading the books, the movie was def what I expected the casting of the actors was superb and they followed the story line so well that I felt that I could read their mind and knew what they were thinking. Can't wait for the rest of the movies
B00181JGI2|4.0|I don't watch many movies anymore. Rarely does anything look interesting enough to me that I can be persuaded into the effort, minimal as it may be, to devote a couple of hours and my attention to a much hyped feature.<br /><br />For years I have been hearing references to \\"The Big Lebowski\\" in various forms without even realizing it. The John Goodman line about \\"proper nomenclature\\" struck me right between the eyes as I knew I had innocently been subjected to that reference more than a handful of times.<br /><br />I really never had any interest in the film when it was released. It sounded fairly idiotic and wasn't heralded as a masterpiece by those that get paid to steer me away from making the tremendous effort required to enjoy a movie.<br /><br />It wasn't until years after the fact that I began to hear more and more people chastise me subsequent to a period of shock and disbelief when I informed them that I had never seen the film. I didn't want to. The same people that seemed to be enfatuated with \\"Lebowski\\" were those same people that reveled in using their pinky finger to mimic Mike Meyers' character in that dreadful \\"shagalicious\\" detective bore. Flavor-of-the-month-hipster films with trendy catch phrases and temporarily memorable characters spawned from stereotypes or outlandishness get top billing on my list of \\"Must Avoid At All Cost\\" films.<br /><br />\\"Lebowski\\" jumps right into what I feared most and I nearly regretted allocating effort for this endeavor as we meet Goodman's character, an amalgamation of hypocrisy as defined primarily by his apparent \\"neo-con\\" delivery. The bizzare pedophilic latino as portrayed by Turturro. The heartless \\"fat cat\\" that shares his name with the title character - a man that is diametrically opposite as a fully functioning, but decidedly and intentionally sub-functional, ambitionless, cashless, borderline bum (not proper nomenclature, I know). Other than sitting, walking, taking a bath, drinking, or smoking a joint - Lebowski is rarely seen doing anything himself at any point - he doesn't even bowl in a movie that is set predominately in a bowling alley and is by all accounts, Lebowski's only actual social activity.<br /><br />Within fifteen minutes, I am already thinking- \\"Oh grand, another pointless movie posing as satire with a bunch of cartoonish characters that will inevitably leave you trying to figure out what the point of the movie is\\".<br /><br />So, every time something happens, a word is spoken, I'm putting meaning to it.<br /><br />Goodman tells his buddy Donny to \\"shut the **** up\\" every time he even tries to simply join the conversation, yet Goodman creates a monumental scene in the cafe about fighting in a war to protect the freedoms of expression and speech and how he won't be stifled. He lectures on \\"proper nomenclature\\" for asians, yet can't help but slip into improper nomenclature when his guard is down. He's a jew by marriage, practicing out of convenience, but goes to great lengths to let everyone know how devout his faith is - even if its fundamental tenets take a back seat to bowling.<br /><br />Lebowski speaks with other characters employing dialogue that he picks up from others in completely different contexts (ala Bush's speech on agression early in the film while viewing TV). His interactions with nearly every character of authority paints him as the ultimate pacifist, a throwback hippy fighting the fascists, yet his whole life-altering debacle that is the substance of the film is born out of a conflict that he chooses to escalate - and does so with misguided direction in search of retribution.<br /><br />On and on it goes - nuanced interactions that I've already decided must mean something more than what is spoken or what happens, so I had better pay attention if I want to make this effort worth anything at all.<br /><br />Of course, buried in it all, the depth of stereotypes and embellishments bestowed upon Goodman's character in particular, I miss onecrucial component of the character - the eternal search for meaning in everything. He's on the right track, but he's always off-the-mark. Meanwhile, Lebowski seeks to find almost no meaning in anything - he simply wants to exist - preferrably, happily so.<br /><br />\\"Once in a while you get shown the light, in the strangest of places if you look at it right.\\"<br /><br />Lebowski is making no effort to understand his predicament, much less resolve it, while Goodman is in overdrive with theories that lead to more chaos. Ultimately, not only is the meaning of his predicament not what it seems, it is debatable if there is any meaning whatsoever. And when the credits rolled, following Sam Elliot's departing monologue, I had felt that I had in some ways been duped into playing the part of Jonh Goodman - one that we all play as mostly good natured studies in hypocrisy and illusions that seek to make ourselves understand things that aren't \\"learnable\\" per se - while the solution, the understanding, can be found in the dissimilarly flawed character of Lebowski - there isn't necessarily understanding through defined, sustained effort, simply moments of clarity in life that help you get through it.<br /><br />Of course, I'm sure that nearly everyone that has watched this film takes away something completely different. When you throw down the gauntlet early and let the audience know that the plot is more or less a set-up to provide the characters room enough to promote subtle messages, you risk losing the war when the audience misses the point or objects to it. When there are either an incalculable number of points, or depending on the perspective, no point at all - and that's the point - well, you're at least trying to make my effort worthwhile.
B003Y5T0X6|5.0|The movie was amazing as always, but the HD upgrade was just so real! I loved the drive-in scene originally, but in HD it just jumped out at you. I know 3-D is all the rage, but frankly it gives me a headache, and I don't enjoy it, but a good HD movie, well I think it's better!
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Great movie, really puts into reality what these great men go through for our freedoms and what they are willing to do for each other.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|At the end of Fifty Shades of Grey, I was intrigued to know how it would continue.  I wasn't dissappointed. It was a very good middle to the trilogy and as soon as my husband has finished with the book he is reading of OUR kindle, I will try the last one.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|The story was boring and badly written.  The characters were not memorable.  The story was not memorable. Don't waste your time on this book!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book rambled alot. Didn't like the ending. Expected the wife to pay for her sins. The only good thing about the book is that it teaches you that you could be living with a sociopath.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I purchased this based on the other reviews, and am very happy with it.  Its simple to use, and works great. Its a great motivation tool also. The ability to set a timer, and then another timer to do a different sound on a per minute interval is nice. Also, it tracks and charts all meditation sessions, and gives motivational messages as you hit milestones. The insight connect feature is also nice to let you see who else is meditating around the world, and connect with them if you wish.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|Great movie to watch with grandkids.  A little intense in parts, but overall suitable for kids 6 and over.  We thought the humor was good and the fast paced action kept both adults and kids engaged.  I ordered the HD version for viewing, but not sure if I could tell it was HD.  Anyway, great \\"movie night\\" fare.
B00846REIS|3.0|\\"Bared to You\\" is an exact replica to \\"Fifty Shades\\"--except worse.  The author must have decided to jump on the \\"Fifty Shades\\" bandwagon seeing as there was interest in this type of a series, but she should have mixed it up a little!  Same issues between the couple, except the girl is stronger than in \\"Fifty\\", and the guy is much weaker than Christian Grey.  I did \\"prebuy\\" the next book, cuz I need to find out what happens between them!  I love modern day love stories, so I guess I will rate this book 3 stars.  Hopefully the next book will be more original!
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this series! Best young adult series since Harry Potter. I couldn't put these books down. Suzanne Collins pulls you right into the world of Panem through the perspective of it's 16 year old heroine. I highly recommend these books. They are a great read.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Being male I'm not normally into chick books but I have to say I found this a compelling, enjoyable read. No it wan't all the erotica that made me think that way. Basically it is a very well written love story - with a few twists. Half way through the second in the series and will likely read the third too.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|As I finished reading the 1st volume of the Clifton Chronicles - Only Time will Tell - , I immediately ordered the second book - Sins of the father.  The story reads as a page turner - kept me up late in the night - as there is never a good place to stop.  Now am desperately awaiting for the 3rd of the 5 books detailing the life and times of Tom Bradshaw.  The twists and turns in the saga, the detail of the times, the changes of location and the details of the various characters who come in and out of the different plots makes it a difficult book about which to relate the story.  But it is a great read about the subsequent generations of the Clifton family.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Besides the obvious sexual excitement that a woman will get, it was interesting to see their relationship develop and I would be interested in sequals.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This messenger is very straight forward and easy to use. It is also fun and instead of just a black and white color scheme, the text \\"bubbles\\" can be changed and customized color wise. I also like the ability to attach a picture to your name that shows up when you text someone and thiers shows up when they text you. Much easier to know who is sending you a message.
B00351YF52|4.0|Enjoyed this book since it is some time since I read a book by John Grisham.  Enjoyed the theme of the book.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is well written, entertaining and thought provoking. I recognized the value of this information based on my own personal experience so I am sure if it is applicable to me then it may help others as well. For many years I have recognized the connection between eating wheat products and skin rashes. When I eat without regard to wheat and include pizza, bagels, crackers, croutons, cupcakes and cookies in my diet then my hands are raw and sometimes bleeding. I notice eczema type areas on my arms and legs. No wheat, no skin problems. I do not have the knowledge to evaluate his scientific argument related to the modified wheat but if someone goes without wheat for a month or two (and do we really NEED pizza, bagels, crackers, croutons, cupcakes and cookies?) and notices a health improvement then this is all that person probably needs to know.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|As a child, I had never read this but grew up hearing many references to Tom Sawyer & Huck Finn. I decided to read it. It was very enjoyable.
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|I have always wondered why Testament was never part of the Big Four? Nevermind...that's a whole another conversation.  You will not be disappointed with their latest release.  In my top five metal/thrash albums of 2012.
B001XV1X6A|5.0|Fun movie for everyone, which is not easy to find. Funny without too much cheesiness. Full of action without being gory.
B0028INIWE|5.0|What is not to love and at a great price. Easy to download to my Fire. First mp3 I have bought.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|as most movies made from book,the book is always better. because in a book you can feel what writer is saying,if you had not read books would have been a 5 star, once the games started hard to get up and get ur popcorn,didnt want to miss anything,do think it is to bad when the movie makers find the need to change parts of very good books,but i would recomend this movie,good enough to watch again,now gotta wait for next one by then will have forgotted what book was about.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I had seen the movie prior to reading the book, so I knew what the ending would be.  Most readers would be surprised at the ending if they haven't seen the screen adaptation.  It was still a great read and a page turner even with the knowledge I had.  I only wish I had read it first!!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Book was a very interesting look at the roles presidents and ex presidents play in government.  Well written and insightful.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Awesome book...I recomend it to anyone. Read this one before the Maze runner....=0)I had the time of my life reading the first trilogy, now this amazing book. Couldnt put it down.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is a pretty true adaptation of the book. If you read and liked the book, then you should love seeing the story come alive. If you didn't read the book, it is an action packed movie that has a fresh storyline instead of the constantly recreated Hollywood action movies.
B008602KQI|5.0|One of my favorite movies! I saw this in theatre four times and have watched it half a dozen times since i bought it. Now with that said, I believe this movie is very different, but at the same time similar to the book. Of course you have your similar plots, characters and events. The book though is epic. The way the author writes, it grips you. Let me just say the part in the story with the \\"beasts\\" coming back with the players' faces!!! Wow! If you loved this movie, make sure you pick up the book and read it. I promise you will read the book within a day or two. You can't put it down.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next movie!! (And to see what Finnick will look like. HA)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was a little sad when I finished this book that this is the end of the line.  This was a great story with a great final book! :o)
B000FBJHT4|3.0|This book was somewhat of a different read for me but I'm glad I read it. I think the Rosewell incident will continue to be a mystery until you read this book. It provides excellent insight on why information from this 1947 occurrance was managed the way it was.
B008IYOEZM|5.0|this series provides a fabulous caste...and i love each of them as they are  so very unique. i never thought i would cheer for a character such as dexter...but alas, he is easy to love.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|My grandson and i watched it and we all enjoyed it very much. Could watch again just for the joy of it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I bought this way back when it first launched on the google market but got it again when it was free app of the day for amazon. It's a fun game that anyone from kids to adults will enjoy playing. Sure it isn't a push over simple game the more you progress but it is fun and love the sounds. Makes me want to go out and get an angry bird plushie with a sound chip. =)<br /><br />It's like a classic that you play for a while and then stop and later return and it's still just as fun as you remember it.
0451169514|5.0|I was encouraged to read this book by a friend and I have to admit the size alone scared me. Having never been into reading horror novels, I was completely unprepared for the impressive story told within. The fact that Mr. King told the story from several point of views over many years gave the novel a fresh feeling from beginning to end. His characters were rich and easy to either love or hate, and the setting itself was a strong character.  This book has several chapters where I felt I was actually pulled inside and standing next to the children in Derry, living those moments of terror.<br /><br />Don't pass up the chance to read this book. And it's even better when read a second or third time.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|From the first song/intro through the end this is a great funky album with some alt rock, hip hop, and all around feel good music sprinkled throughout.  I love it for running, working or just chilling.  Favorite songs: All I need, Kill your heroes and People.  What no \\"Sail\\"?  It's good, but it's hardly the best song on the album.  Take a listen and I think you'll agree.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|As a reader, I felt like I really got to know Chris personally through his story, which to me is the sign of a good autobiography. While the stories in the book seem disjointed at times, this is easily overlooked by the content of them. I recommend this to anyone looking to gain more insight into the mind and life of a Navy SEAL. Thank you Chris for your service!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I truly believe if the author was a man, women would have a completely different opinion about Christian Grey. It almost reminds me of the old porno books of the early 1970's.  Also, how many abused women, in reality, believe they can change their man from abusive to truly caring and loving.  Unfortunately, the reality of women in this position is usually a life abuse and demoralizing.<br />I find the story line not being able to hold my interest into the third book.  My intention was not to read these books for lack of sex drive but only due to the interest of the gossip and media press. Overall, it's ok. Not something I would tell someone to rush and get.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game.Easy to navigate.Would recommend for any one who wants a quick easy to play game to add to there kindle.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just finished reading the third book to the trilogy.  Once I was done I was sad to know their was not another one.  This book was better than the first two.  These books are ones that you either love them or hate them.  I LOVED them!  I would recommend them to anyone.  The first two have been passed around to a few people already who also enjoyed them.  I will be reading them again.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I really enjoy playing the game Solitaire that I purchased from Amazon.  I especially like the option of being dealt a random hand or a winning hand.  Quick, easy and fun game!!!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|A quick read , pretty good and follows the TV story's like this is Castle's writings, and ties in a lot of the story's...
B007IXWKUK|4.0|If you had read the first book on this series, and like it, the second one will just hold your attention until you turn the last page. When you think things can't get any worse among the main characters their relationship gets deeper, and Ana has to relay in her gut feelings to find out where her limits are.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a great trilogy for women!  I couldn't put it down and have the read the books over and over.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As the second book in The Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire skips over all of the introductions into the world of Panem and gets right to the action of the growing revolt against the Capitol. Our hero, Katniss, has returned from the games victorious alongside her sorta/kinda boyfriend Peeta. But the way in which she won the Hunger Games, by openly defying the Capitol, has her in the crosshairs of President Snow, the squirmy, creepy bad guy. In the same way that people binge-watch shows like Breaking Bad because the suspense is just too much and keeps you up at night, the cliffhangers at the end of each chapter of Catching Fire keep you reading until the very last page. It's not that Suzanne Collins has written beautiful prose, it's just that her story is so captivating that finding out exactly what happens feels urgent. Some of the series most compelling characters, Finnick Odair, Joanna Mason (an oddly normal name for a character in this series but, whatev), Plutarch Honesybee, all take center stage here and infuse some humor and depth to the novel. It's all fun, or as much fun as a book about kids killing each other for some sadistic, overgrown children can be.
0307887960|5.0|This book was very easy to understand.  I bought this book a year ago.  My husband and I started the diet Aug. 2011 My husband lost 70lbs in about 4-5 months and has kept it off.  I lost 20 in about 3-4 months. I have gained 10lbs back but I have NOT been following the basic concept.  Will be getting back to following the basic concepts soon.  So many people in our family have started this diet after seeing the results my husband and I got by following this diet.  My husband is the poster child for this diet.  Dr. Dukan has sold many books because of my husband.  He looks GREAT! This diet has a super easy concept to follow.  My husband and I found it easier to follow having each other to lean on.  Recommend you start with a buddy.  Makes the first part of the diet easier to get through.  The diet gets easier as you go through the steps.  Definitely a good purchase!  Good luck to you!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you grew up in the 50's and early 60's as I did, you will feel transported back to a much simpler way of life in this masterful time travel. King makes the reader feel the mood of those days and you can relive a nostalgic time.That alone was worth the read.<br />  The well researched story imagines what would happen if the unlikely hero were persuaded to return to the late 50's to surveil Lee Harvey Oswald in an effort to derail the Kennedy murder.In doing so, a far greater purpose may be served because the butterfly effect of history may very well prevent the Vietnam War,as well as the Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy assassinations.<br />  But changing the past is not only difficult, it may also lead to unintended consequences of even graver significance if it is achieved. That is ultimately the conflict faced by the time traveler who may have to sacrifice the love of his life to attain his goal.Ultimately he may find that the obdurate past has too many obstacles to hurdle to a story book ending.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Variety of versions 10++, accuracy unknown but expect good, wish it had New American Standard, love the voice reading esp.  in the car, struggling with features, can't figure out bookmarks.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written tale that drops you in the middle of a story and slowly explains what is going on. I had a hard time putting it down!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Another Bosch that keeps on giving.  Always excited to find out whats on the next page.  If you don't want suspense, or want to kick Harry occasionally in the butt, don't buy this book.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|This is a very good movie. My son will watch it over and over. He stay quite I can do my house.  Chores While he is watching and when I finish is sit and watch with him. We have movie night and this movie is the first one he picks
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie follows the book very well.  Some movies do not do that well.  I have read all 3 books and I can not wait until the next movie in the series!
B0078XHAB4|5.0|This book struck such an amazing chord within my life just at the right time and gave me a huge amount of comfort whilst reading it.  IVF and failed pregnancies is going on our family right now, our wonderful much loved father was in the last days of  his life and we are all from Scotland.  To have so many similarities in this book was just amazing and to read it at that particularly difficult moment at my fathers bedside seemed more than just fate.<br />The love of the Scottish countryside, its people and traditions.. i could totally resonate with the lead character and the comfort going home brought her.  The premise of the story that those we love are watching over us, made me feel not so afraid of losing a loved one and the beautiful way it was written made it a very enjoyable story.<br />The lead characters mother and sister also reminded me of quite a few people i know and made me smile at their self interested ways.<br />For a reader of mainly thrillers all my life i very rarely dabble in this type of genre but i am so glad that this one was the one that i picked... its a beauty.
B008ASLNN2|1.0|We were really looking forward to watching this. But, then, we realized that there was no way to get subtitles or captions for my hearing-impaired wife. Finally simply deleted it and wasted my money - no refund from Amazon, of course. I suggest that Amazon specifically list whether a video is for the hearing impaired. We'll not make that mistake again.
B000WOXQDM|5.0|Sounds just how I remembered it..Awesome! I can't even remember how many No Doubt concerts I went to, it was so numerous, they loved playing live and it was always a good show. This album reminds me of the good ol' times of music.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|HUNGER GAMES is an outstanding movie - worthy of Academy Awards - and staying true to the book.<br />The supplemental features are as good as the movie itself.  This is  a BLURAY DVD that should<br />NOT be missed.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I had a handful of books on my list and headed out the door when I saw this. I'd heard of huger games but not The Maze Runner.  I've now read both and Ill say this blows Hunger games away.  I need to grab the second book in the series as fast as possible.  With my new kindle, that will be a breeze.  Five stars and I'llsuggest to everyone I know who has an imagination.
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie followed the book rather well with only a few variations.  Really enjoyed watching this movie with the whole family.
B008602KQI|4.0|I loved the cinematography,costumes,and settings. I loved the actors and actresses. I was happily surprised that Lenny Kravitz did such an excellent job. Two thumbs up for Woody Harrelson, he was perfect. Given the book takes place so much in Katniss's mind, I think it was very well done. The book, of course, gives a more complete understanding of the story.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I was, and am, a huge fan of the first Footloose w/Kevin Bacon and loved the music. However, with the exception of Dennis<br />Quaid, all the players in the new one are far superior in acting skill and particularly dancing. What a thrill!!!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have wanted a tank of my own and under my control for a very long time.  I have all the enjoyment and none of the stress or mess.  The graphics are beautiful and the music is soothing.  All this and a three of a kind game too which is fun for all ages.  Please create another game similar to this one.  Thank you for hours of enjoyment and creativety.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read!  Engrossing mystery that puts a new spin on husband-on-wife murder.  Would have given it 5 stars, but I'm not much for the \\"f\\" word being so prominent in dialogue when it's really not necessary.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series is a real mind grabber, the characters and the action keeps you wanting more. A real page turner.
B008XG1X18|4.0|*** not sure how I found the time to write this review, with all the pinning I've been doing :-)
B008602KQI|2.0|just another female boasting masculine abilities. not realistic in its dealing with conflict, to much \\"agonizing\\". so-so acting grade. hope no sequel.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Let this book manipulate you. Excellent writing, twisted plot, take-no-prisoners characters.<br />A thesis on deception, your spouse will never look the same again.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|I absolutely love this album. She is amazing and her voice is very soulful.  I am so glad I downloaded it!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Hitchcock and Grant at their best. Perfection in storyline and dialogue. One of my all-time favorite movies. Love it so very much!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My stepdaughter and I loved the books and love sitting and watching the movie Over and over againg we can not wait for the sequel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good reading. Near the end, though, you already know how everything is gooing to finish, but you keep on readin 'cause the author has timing and wit.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is easier than pinteresting on the computer...love it!  Easy to download and very easy to use.  I highly recommend
B008602KQI|4.0|I was only hoping for a few out takes and some of the scenes that are on the internet but not in the  movie.  Enjoyed the 2nd disc with the Making of the Movie on it.  It's interesting just how much of  it had to be done infront of  a green screen.
B001MSMULG|1.0|This book was a true disappointment.  The first chapter held some promise that an exciting, unpredictable storyline would be woven throughout the other chapters.  But, that did not happen.  There was little interest generated in the almost one dimensional characters and it was obvious throughout what would happen next.  There was no subtle presentation of the two complicated sides of the Palestinian-Jewish conflict.  The book was a series of predictable and over simplified events.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie did a good job of capturing the book. The book was amazing, and it is always difficult to turn a book like this into a movie. We really enjoyed watching the moving in the theatre and at home. If you are looking for a great movie to buy, this one is a great one to watch over and over.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Concept albums can be hit or miss, but we're in good hands with Rush. Clockwork Angels is a masterpiece from start to finish!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good movie.  It was different.  It took me a minute to good used of the concept. I enjoy action movies and I felt the hunger games delivered.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book of the series was wonderful! Very engaging; it held my interest from the beginning until the end. I m a 53 year old male and think this is a book for a wide age group.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved it.  Wish the book was lendable though as I wanted to lend to my daughter.  If I bought a hard cover or paperback, I would be able to lend it.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Top album I have purchased this year. Great, feel good music. He's come a long way from Bawitdaba, and for the better.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love this app but wish it had more features such as exponents.  Its tedious trying to use the app for homework without exponents.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|The game was not what I thought I was getting. Maybe O.K. for someone else, just not my preference. The description led me to believe the games in it were not what you get. I also thought you could pick the games you wanted to play.Not the case. You have to score a certain amount to play the next one.
B008KL2ITW|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait for the next book to be released !!!! It is addictive and u won't be able to put it Down
B008XG1X18|4.0|Don't use it much, so I can only rate what little I have used Pinterest. I say little but I do scroll through at least 3 times a day,  just to look like during a commercial at home or waiting in line while shopping. I have had no troubles with logging in but it is on the slower side with photos. For my use,  it 's a 4 out of 5.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Copy/pasted Goodreads review:This was a quick read that kept me wondering what was really happening throughout the story. The let down was the ending. There was no valid reason or explanation for why they were demanding that the people in this town act the way they did and why the people complied. The answer for what was going on, was just plain silly...
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It is fun the first time you play, but looses its appeal after you've done it more then once. just like angry birds its over hyped.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome. (I'm doing this because I have to -.-) But its a great app. Pinky promise. You should really get this app. its awesome guys.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|I was so excited to see this film finally...what a disappointment. No where near as good as the books. No emotional attachment. Terrible.
B004KAB5PU|5.0|I am very pleased with the product I purchased.  I love Donna Dewberry's work!I could not wait to try it. I will be ordering more products!
B00846TTDG|4.0|True to life action. Very graffic, yet war is. Definately Got each others Backs....dedicated....closer than most brothers it seems. Not a film for children, or Vets with P.T.S.D.
B0085776BG|4.0|Over all the effects were fairly good. I thought the story was a littlt weak. Cuby Gooding Jr. had a very small part. He should have had little more active part. The over all directing was also weak. Many scenes were poorly acted. I thought it was more the directers fault than the actors. I would give it a B-.<br />As far as the picture and sound quality, on bul-ray it is really good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great twists, turns and \\"didn't see that coming\\"! One of those books you hate to put down and are mad when it's over! I would recommend this book over and over again!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Overall, I like this program.  Mixing the sounds is a neat feature.  I only wish the sounds would stay on while I was reading from my Kindle. I haven't figured out a way to do both at the same time.

B003DFLZB2|5.0|JNH and Hanz Zimmer complement each other's writing style perfect whether they get along or not. The dark Knight rises didn't get close to this or the second because it lacked good chemistry. This is definitely one of my favorite scores.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|Sparked my interest in wanting to know more about her life. Did some research and found that her life had a very rough start. Very sad! She was so alone even with ppl surrounding her. She just wanted love.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|This score was a full loop. The first 10 seconds were the same as the last few. JNH made here the most eclecticly creative score he has ever made. And it's definitely tops for Hanz Zimmer. The classic Zimmer sound instruments were utilized perfectly amazingly sharing the story telling style of JNH. If you listen closely you will hear the story perfectly.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|You don't have to be an artist to play this game, you can give clues that help. It is so much fun!
B007SGM084|2.0|Storyline was enjoyable independent of graphic sex descriptions. This series would be more accurately described as a comedy.  This book is not appropriate for younger readers
B008602KQI|5.0|I read and thoroughly enjoyed all three books. The movie was faithful within practical limits yet a work of art on its own. I will be watching this over and over and looking forward to the sequels.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|The Cousin wars' series is amazing and this book is no different! Captures you, makes you feel as if you have lived in the time, but also allows you to see another aspect of the war that may have been protrayed differently from anothers view. I have recommened this book to my friends and others & encourage anyone to lget captured in this series as I have for so many years!
B007ZD17XO|1.0|Treasures of Montezuma is basically a timed high-speed match-3 game with different power-ups, which you can select (buy) rather than just progressing into the next one of.  The idea is good.  The implementation...<br /><br />The Droid 4 is currently one of the more powerful cell phones.  Treasures does not work well on the Droid 4; it looks good, and is smooth when not too much is going on, but when the going gets tough (which it will... that's the whole point of timed sessions), the lag destroys the experience.<br /><br />Two things happen.  It doesn't register the swipes or registers them quite a bit later (at the wrong place then, since tiles have exploded by then), and it simply freezes for a few seconds sometimes.  Which is distracting when you've only got 30 seconds or so total available.<br /><br />Other match-3 games (4 Elements, Bejeweled, Jewelust) don't do this.<br /><br />I have uploaded a \\"Not Responding\\" Android alert into the image gallery.  Just imagine having to close that (it happens frequently) while also dealing with the frustration that the game is not responding to your swipes... and then gives \\"hints\\" as to where to swipe (though still not processing them) as the clock ticks down.<br /><br />I regret having paid for this game.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Other than some terrible special effects, the movie was ok.  Nothing I would watch again but not a complete waste of time.  Full of BS situations though.
B005IQZB14|3.0|This book was reoommended to me by my daughter, Dr. Gilbert, who had just recently completed the very difficult hike called the Kalalau Trail in Kauai, Hawaii and thus I agreed to order it and read it.<br />The character was quite well developed and at times she really practiced poor judgement.  My daughter trained for 4 month carrying 75 pounds on her back prior to her hike.  This woman sort of did it on a whim, totally unprepared for what lay ahead. And, of course, this is what made for the intersting reading. The jams she got herself into and the ability to get herself out of trouble and continue.<br />I liked it that it showed her weaknesses as well as her whimsical persona, her short addiction to heroin, her numerous and empty lovers, lots of poor judgement and choices there but she rose above them all. I do question the ease with which she got off the heroin however and thought perhaps there was another totally different story there.  It is a book of self awareness, challenges and setting goals and hurdling obstacles and it often took dirty, dangerous,  and grundgy efforts to accomplish what she set out to do. I admire her. I liked her book.  If you are an experienced hiker, you will love this book. I give it but three stars because I felt it bogged down at times and I sort of had to push myself to get beyond the slow spotsl but all-in-all, I enjoyed it.
0345803485|1.0|That this Jeffrey Dahmer grade pile of excrement should never have made it off the the writer's computer.  Unfortunately, it went a whole lot further than that.  Yes, we live in the free world.  You can buy anything you want, and you can enjoy anything you want.  But that doesn't mean that what you like has value.  This \\"literary\\" travesty?  No value whatsoever.  If you thought Twilight was bad, get a load of this radioactive turd.  I mean, \\"jeez,\\" people, where do I start?<br /><br />1)  The godawful writing.  Teenaged doggerel from a grown woman.  Meyer's writing was bad while still compelling.  But this?  Absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />2)  THE GAWD. AWFUL. WRITING.  This is supposed to have been a book.  I could not get over how horrific the writing was.<br /><br />3)  The total absence of anything genuine in the content of what I managed to make it through.<br /><br />Really, that's all I needed to cause me to stop reading it.  Even if it wasn't so flagrantly shallow and ludicrous, the qualities I listed were enough to make me stop reading it.  But the transgressions against civilized society continue.  For supposedly being erotica, there was zero passion.  Totally contrived, which is not surprising as this is not an original work.  It's a Twilight rip-off through and through, but soooo much worse.  Some people say that the Twilight series was contrived, but I disagree.  I felt that the writing was absolutely sincere, and that's what made it so hilarious.<br /><br />But there was nothing remotely funny about trivializing attempted rape.  There's nothing remotely funny about getting involved with an obsessive psycho, no matter how hot he is.  If you enjoyed this book, if it got you off, then there is something psychologically wrong with you.  Deeply wrong.  I wish I had the stomach to get to the kink, but the sex scenes I made it through were so utterly offensive, I just couldn't.  The fact that the heroine is more asinine, more immature, and more self-loathing than Bella Swan totally blew my mind.  I didn't realize there could be a more loathsome, dangerous character, but here she is, as empty as she is pasty.<br /><br />And the guy.  OMFG, the guy.  He makes me want to throw furniture, he is so repulsive.  And no, not because of his sexual fetishes, but because he is an obsessive psycho.  This is probably just due to the deficiency of the writer's skill, but that whole thing of not engaging emotionally yet being compelled toward the heroine made me expect him to morph into some kind of Ed Gein serial killer.  If only he had tried to kill her and the rest of the book was about how a bumbling moron found the guts to escape her violent, blood-thirsty boyfriend.  I could read that book.<br /><br />But no.  Instead you have a horrendously written, wannabe BDSM sack of rabid dog s*!# moonlighting as a love story.  I get that it's not the writer's fault that so many people found \\"inspiration\\" in this book.  But I absolutely blame her for not doing her research.  It is wildly apparent that she did not do a single stitch of research into the things she wrote about, from geography, to language, to the culture of the sexual practices that this book is centered on.  And that last part is not only irresponsible, it is dangerous.  I don't care if she never expected it to leave whatever fanfic board she tossed it on.  Any writer worth their salt does their research.  Unlike Twilight, which was so bad it was enjoyable, this... crap... is so bad it's offensive.  I despair at it's popularity.

B008O69SZ0|4.0|Hunter's last two CDs have been mostly populated with rootsy, mid-tempo rockers and ballads. That's not a bad thing when Mr. Hunter is writing the songs. This time out, he rocks more than usual and comes up with another winner. Hunter is in Dylan-like late career form and has no signs of abating. The songs touch on themes that he has been writing about all his career - self-deprecating humor, love relationships, and the state of affairs. In the 70s, he wrote of rock and roll's state of affairs. Now he's widened his scope a bit to include current events. There is a reason that he titled one of his previous albums \\"Rant\\" and that his band is called the \\"Rant Band.\\" On the title track, Hunter bemoans how Capitol Hill corrupts the best intentions, while he promises to \\"lean on the 1% when I'm president.\\"<br /><br />Some of the songs here would fit nicely on his previous efforts, Shrunken Heads and Man Overboard. Saint features an acoustic band arrangement reminiscent of anything on those two albums. But yes, Mr. Hunter can rock too, and he reminds us of that right from the start on Comfortable, which suffers only from an awkward chorus, and What For. The most stunning track appears mid-way through, Black Tears, that features the kind of turn of a phrase that Hunter is so famous for - \\"Tiny accusations trickling down your face.\\" Then Mark Bosch channels Mick Ronson and delivers a guitar solo that would make Ronno proud. Black Tears is more than enough proof that this old dog has more than a few new tricks.<br /><br />An Ian Hunter album would not be complete without one of his trademark ballads. While it would be hard to top Read 'Em And Weep, the closer to Shrunken Heads (and name-checked on What For), Hunter gives us Life, written as a message to his fans (another Hunter trademark) from the grizzled old rocker who's learned a few things along the way.<br /><br />Hunter does stretch his legs with Ta Shunka Witco (Crazy Horse), somewhat of a follow-up to River Of Tears that appeared on Man Overboard. The arrangement and subject matter remind me of Robbie Robertson's Music for Native Americans soundtrack, incorporating Native American rhythms into a rock and roll song. Hunter has taken a few chances in the past with bluegrass and country waltz, and Ta Shunka Witco is another well-executed experiment by one of rock's premier songwriters.<br /><br />Hunter has now released an incredible string of successes reaching back to 2001's Rant. It took him a while to right himself after the death of his best collaborator and best friend Mick Ronson in 1993. I'm thankful he found his groove.hat appeared on Man Overboard.

B001NLKT60|4.0|Great book that held me captive.  I love a bad ass woman heroine. I can't wait to start the 3rd book
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book! Cheryl really draws you in to her story and you feel like you are right there with her. How she starts her trip so unsure of herself and so strong mentally and emotionally when she finishes her hike on the PCT. She learned an awful lot out there in the wilderness about herself, where her life had been, and where she now must go.  I really wanted her to succeed. When she did finish the trail I was just thrilled for her.  It was a good ending to a great book.  Lots of emotion! Wonderful descriptions of the trail itself.  A must read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had not read this author before so really had no idea what to expect. From the moment I started reading I was hooked. As the story progressed I thought I had it all figured out and then suddenly it would lob another firecracker into the fire.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I had trouble right at first getting my phone to sync, but after tweaking the settings, it was silky-smooth. I have multiple email accounts synced to my phone now (personal and work) with no problems. In addition, I recently downloaded the Skydrive app, which should, in theory, complete my WindowsLive experience via my android phone. I know email doesn't always sync seamlessly on android devices because my wife periodically receives old emails as \\"new\\" on her tablet, and when she deletes from the tablet, they do not delete from the full web version. Note: she is not using Hotmail.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|wonderful movie to watch. visual treat for MI fans like me. the picture quality is great, the streaming is wonderful and without any hassle. waiting for next MI
B008P1EWIM|3.0|No great shakes, but a servicable weather app.  I will stick with Weather Channel app, however.  It has more features and weather views.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book was enjoyable.  I was alway wondering what Reacher would come up with.  He is a character that I want to learn more about.  The whole idea was a bit far out but fun.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|I had the same problem others had and had to try multiple times just to buy the game.<br />After I purchased it and played it for a few days it wouldn't load.  I had to uninstall and try again.<br />Of course, all of the progress made was lost.  For the price they are charging for this, you would think it would work.
B0084RSYEK|3.0|The movie was ok...I liked parts of it. I watched with my older kids...awkward at times to say the least. The movie's premise was good - but I found it lacking in story depth. They could have taken this to so many levels and still combined Murpy's ability for comedic and serious acting talents. \\"Daddy Day Care\\" combined the silly and serious so much better than this film. It is too bad because the message of the movie was such a good one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It is hard to write this review without giving away some twists to this novel.  The reason I enjoyed the book is due to the twists and turns. I like a book that can surpise you, and this one threw me for a loop in the middle.  The characters are interesting and have real-life personas.  I can't say that I liked either of the main characters very much, but I think they held my attention for that reason. I was not real happy with the ending, but after I finished the book I realized that it was an appropriate ending for these characters.<br />Overall it was a good book and I would recommend it!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I love this movie!  I bought it to watch it, because they just don't show it on TV.  I have watched it over 20 times the past month!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|see above as that is my real reccomendation for this game.  GO W/ THE FLOW!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />it can get frustrating to start, but is fun when you get that ah-ha moment.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy equally- Found it was creative, well written and I was 'involved' with the characters. I hope the author will continue with this and give us more to read!
0345472322|5.0|Carol Dweck published Mindset in 2006. As I write this review in 2012, my local library and its affiliates have 19 copies of the book, and all of them are checked out, with 1 person on a waiting list that sometimes has as many as 3 people. The paperback edition here on Amazon ranks right now at 344 in sales of books. For a book that is six years old, that is impressive.<br /><br />All for good reason. Carol Dweck, a psychology professor at Columbia when she wrote Mindset who has since moved to Stanford, writes about her cutting-edge research in a way that most people can relate to. Though written in the self-help genre, Mindset's author can draw on her own research, and more importantly, her own theories and thinking, to describe how people see and react to what happens to them. In other words, their mindset.<br /><br />Here is how Carol Dweck describes her research (on her Stanford faculty page):<br /><br />Research Summary:<br />My work bridges developmental psychology, social psychology, and personality psychology, and examines the self-conceptions (or mindsets) people use to structure the self and guide their behavior. My research looks at the origins of these mindsets, their role in motivation and self-regulation, and their impact on achievement and interpersonal processes.<br /><br />With its &#34;academese,&#34; that kind of description sounds too abstract to be much help in real life. Indeed, many academics have a tough time translating academic writing from the ivory tower into something that a normal person will actually want to read. Often they try too hard, and we get things like Dan Ariely's too light and airy The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone---Especially Ourselves or an autohagiography like Martin Seligman's Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being. These authors try to compete, in a TED-like world, with books by young, photogenic, brilliant writers whose power comes from the way they tell stories and who come to the topics they write about as amateurs, not as academics. People like Susan Cain (Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking), like Charles Duhigg (The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business), and like the (now-disgraced) Jonah Lehrer (Imagine: How Creativity Works).<br /><br />I don't like that approach, either by the academics or by the bright young things they try to emulate. So I like Carol Dweck's approach. Her basic message is simple: people tend toward either a fixed mindset (which limits them) or a growth mindset. That simple message is too simple, so she expands on that theme to make a complete book. She does include stories and anecdotes, but her book is more than that. She also explains her ideas. And that makes all the difference.<br /><br />Mindset is not a perfect book. Carol Dweck's tone was often grating to my ear -- there is a note of condescension in it I just didn't like. Like when she praises Tiger Woods and condemns John McEnroe. Both men have been very successful. Both men have had their problems. The contrast between them is more cloudy than clear-cut, more shades of gray than black and white.<br /><br />And I think she pushes too far her basic of idea of the power of a growth mindset. She becomes almost like Pollyanna, sounding like all you need to do for a great life is abandon a fixed mindset for a growth one. Making things simple is good, to a point. But you can make them too simple. Carol Dweck flirts with the &#34;too simple&#34; end of the spectrum.<br /><br />Still, I can see why Mindset gets so much attention, even now six years later. The book deserves attention -- it can change lives. It changed mine. It may change yours.who come to the topics they write about as amateurs, not as academics.

B008602KQI|5.0|One of the best book adaptations I have seen! I knew it couldn't follow the book to the letter, but the movie did not disappoint!! I saw it in the theater on opening night and again the next day.  I don't buy many DVDs but I had to own The Hunger Games. Looking forward to the next movie in 2013!
B008602KQI|5.0|It's great to see the Hunger Games characters brought to life on screen.  Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding as Katniss.  Woody Harrelson doesn't quite fit the image of Haymitch from the book, but he's convincing in the role.  Elizabeth Banks is unidentifable as Effie, and Lenny Kravitz is a perfect Cinna.  Lots of special features giving background info on the cast and production.  Now we have to wait over a year for Catching Fire - plenty of time to read the book again to be ready!

B006LSZECO|2.0|I really did not like this book.  The characters were  stereotypical and unlikable.  The ending made me want to throw my Kindle across the room.  I did give the book two stars because it was the author is a decent writer.  My biggest problem with the book was that I disliked the characters so much that I did not care what happened to them.  If it was not my book club book, I would never have finished it.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|This trillogy is a horrible example of a relationship. Not only is it completely off base with depiction of the BDSM lifestyle, it puts a romantic spin on control, abuse, and stalking. There is absolutely nothing good about a sociopathic/self centered/egotistical man that will beat you and degrade you in bed, hand you a \\"contract\\" stating that he pretty much OWNS you, and then be so obsessed that they put location trackers in your vehicles and have people watch your every move. Please don't let your daughters read these books! They glamorize all the warning signs of domestic violence! On top of that, the story was soooo predictable that you pretty much can figure out how the trillogy ends by the close of the first book.  Don't read.  Waste of time. Not even remotely erotic (how could being beaten and degraded really be?). Wish I could get my $ and the time I wasted reading it back!

Its a whole different vibe and feel than anything that I have ever heard. Lots of cool early seventies influences, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, even a riff directly borrowed from Yes-(anyone notice that??)<br /><br />Overall a pleasant listening experience but not exactly blown away. The remark from Geddy Lee is fascinating to me which leads me to think that I might be missing something that I will discover on further listens.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|It's all been said, very disappointed with the 3rd book. It took me ages to read, unlike the first two which I couldn't put down as I just lost interest. Still, I really wanted to know how it ended, but now wish I hadn't bothered.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I bought this as I enjoyed this Authors most recent novel, but this is flat out depressing and left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

B0034DGPEU|3.0|This is an interesting book if you haven't read a lot of Oprah books or books about women in slavery. I find so many of them to be repetitive with just different names.
1455502758|5.0|We know this book doesn't have a happy ending. Christopher Hitchens, the author of 20 books including the bestselling God is Not Great, died in Houston last December.<br />This slim memoir ends abruptly and I think the decision to include Hitch's fragmentary jottings unfinished at the time of his death was a bad one. This most consummate of writers would not have approved, I'm sure. That aside, it's a remarkable conversation with death - and death always has the last word.<br />The celebrated atheist was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer midway through a book tour in 2010, flogging his highly successful memoir, Hitch-22. His lifestyle put him at risk, as did a family history of the disease, but that didn't stop nutters braying that he had been punished for his godless ways.<br />The introduction to Mortality by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter describes his friend Hitch as a wit, a charmer, a troublemaker; a man of insatiable appetites for cigarettes, for scotch and for conversation.<br />In the pages that follow, it is sad to find him bedridden, in pain and losing his voice, that singular, mellifluous instrument that flayed so many and praised the poets and philosophers.<br />Robbed of his voice, tube fed, in pain, the pounds falling away, Hitch strived to be among the 5 to 20 percent who beat this type of cancer.<br />\\"The absorbing fact about being mortally sick,\\" Hitch writes, \\" is that you spend a good deal of time preparing yourself to die with some modicum of stoicism (and provision for loved ones), while being simultaneously interested in the business of survival.\\"<br />Hitch likened his illness as a journey from the world of Wellville to Tumortown, eventually becoming leery of death lurking in the hallway like some lethal old bore, hoping for the chance to have a word.<br />He fought the good fight and says only two things rescued him from fatalism and resignation; his wife, (Carol Blue) and his friends. Oh, and the regular painkiller and its idiotic bliss he would happily look forward to.<br />He took the scenic route home and gave us a guided tour.<br />Highly recommended.he would happily look forward to.<br />He took the scenic route home and gave us a guided tour.<br />Highly recommended.

B006MPKD54|4.0|I'm reading Connelly's books chronologically,(as i read some of his later ones and loved them) and really enjoyed this one.  I think the character development is excellent, his main characters have heart and soul and the plots are challenging and engaging.  I gave it 4 stars because for me Blood Work is still the best Connelly i've read and i needed somewhere to go.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I've always enjoyed the original Quell so, when I saw Quell Reflect was today's free app of the day, I didn't hesitate to download it.<br /><br />When you first start the game, you'll be in an area that looks quite aged in time. You're in, what appears to me as, a darkened brick laid basement with, several vintage items neatly stacked against the walls, On the level select screen, you'll notice that each group of puzzles is assigned a year in the past placed in photo frames on a shelf. There are also 4 secret levels included. You can access these levels by tapping the FAN on the opening screen of the app. You'll immediately be forwarded to the secret 4 levels but if you tap the back button you can then access the larger group of levels. (Each labeled from the year 1962 to 1975)<br /><br />Your goal is to collect all of the pearls in the least number of moves possible. The game gives you an idea of what that number is in each level in the top-left corner of the screen.  Be careful though! Unlike the original Quell, Quell Reflect has multiple droplets with more & different obstacles like Red Drops & Gold Blocks. And, they still can only move in one direction. You'll need to plan a few moves ahead in order to avoid getting stuck in  a corner with no way out! You can earn coins by completing levels with perfect moves. If you complete a level in that number of moves, you're awarded a hint token. Coins can be used for hints & it takes 4 coins to receive one hint. Once you've reached the next level, if you need a hint, tap the Pause button    in the upper Left hand corner then, tap \\"Hint\\". You'll need to use coins if you have accumulated enough points to earn any.<br /><br />This is an amazing puzzle app with a very serene feel to it as you play. I attribute the calm earthy tones that were used in the apps graphics as a partial reason for why I felt a warm, safe ambiance & a calm serenity during game play. However, the most likely reason must be blamed upon the haunting yet strangely soothing audio that was chosen. The soundtrack, combined with the app's colors, creates a relaxing zen-like environment unlike any other puzzle app I've ever played. Or any other app genre, for that matter. Although, I don't know just how long I will personally remain this calm & serene once I become frustrated with the puzzles that will undoubtedly become increasingly more difficult to solve! ;-)<br /><br />Zero Permissions Required & NO In App Purchasing! Thank you Fallen Tree Games! :-)<br /><br />Size of app before download 20.2MB<br />App size Unpacked after download on Kindle Fire 21.43MB<br /><br />As the free app of the day today, I most definitely HIGHLY recommend that you check this one out!<br />And for those of you that might have missed the FAOTD?

1594745692|5.0|Just got my deck!! I LOVE it. This is by the same fine folks that designed the tongue-in-cheek Housewives tarot.<br /><br />Initial impressions: First of all, what can I say about the box! It is quite the presentation in itself. With faux printed bullets lining the paper rim, there is your ammunition for the Zombie Apocalypse. The box is meant to be an ammunition box so you have bullets to \\"kill\\" the zombies. ;) Very clever!<br /><br />Inside, tucked away and surrounded by black velvet-like material, is the deck. The cards are somewhat stiff, with a nice cardstock that will last for awhile. The cardstock has a matte finish.<br /><br />The 96-page instruction booklet lies on top of the deck. Each page is chock full of zombie apocolyptic goodness. Not a LWB and is not too big a book that you can't -- pardon the pun -- digest it. It's just right!<br /><br />I did a 4-card deck introductory reading. It was very revealing and fun at the same time; an interesting spin on the tarot!<br /><br />The imagery is extremely witty and clever. Anyone who enjoys zombies or horror should enjoy this deck. :) Anyway ... the imagery is loads of fun. When I first received my deck, I didn't even look through all of the cards ... I just started shuffling the deck because I wanted to be surprised by my first reading! Which was a blast!<br /><br />The cardstock is nice: expect thick, unbending, and matte. The black backs have a bit of a retro vibe. The imagery, cardstock and packaging combined gives a sort of 50s/60s feel to this tarot.<br /><br />Recommended for zombie fans, those with a sense of humor about horror, expecting a fifties/early sixties touch.
B007AB5KF2|5.0|This season was my favorite. The characters have grown in their rolls and the plots have thickened. It was definately worth the money I spent and I am looking forward to next season. If you like vampires, werewolves and witches then this is the show for you!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved it and could have read another 1000 pages of this story. King is an amazing story teller and in this book it felt like he did not rush the ending like in his previous book the Dome. I also enjoyed the fact that he took a position regarding the outcomes of changing history. Highly recommended!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the book.  They did a great job! I can hardly wait for the next one. I want more of this amazing story.
B002RUA524|5.0|This is a wonderfully funny book that also includes family dynamics and natural history.<br />Would recommend this book to anyone.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am usually skeptical when books turn into movies and usually for good reason. There have been many a failed attempt at turning a hit book into a hit movie. Surprisingly enough this movie comes out of left field and absolutely blows away my mind and if I didn't know better, would change my opinion on books turned movie. I'm going to give 5 quick reasons why this movie/book series has creeped into my most favorite entertainment of all time, but most importantly why this movie is getting 5/5 stars:<br /><br />5. The length of the movie is just long enough to do justice to the entirety of the book without leaving too many gaping holes that need outside knowledge to fill.<br />4. There were no drastic changes that would take away from the motives and the driving principles the book created thus making it necessary to read the books to truly understand what happens.<br />3. The actors fit their roles and truly represented their roles masterfully making me actually believe they were the same people I read in the books.<br />2. The movie itself captures all of the pure moments, the emotions, the ups and downs, and the essence of what made the books great has been transformed into digital media form.<br />1. From the perspective of someone never hearing of 'The Hunger Games' you will absolutely fall in love with the series.<br /><br />5 Victorious Stars out of 5!
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|I found this book to be not only interesting but exciting.  I could not but it down, I wanted to know what her next problem would be.

B009329Y30|4.0|The only thing I'd change about this story is the ending of Keith and the tree fort. It wasn't realistic or necessary to the plot. It would have made more sense for Keith to have just let go of some of his demons after his confrontation with Logan at the farm market. The story would have been perfect with that one change.

B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I have always enjoyed reading Stephen King and this book is no different. His ability to \\"strike a chord\\" with the reader fascinates me. King has the knack of drawing you in, keeping you guessing, whilst all along ensuring you aren't left out of the story. This is one of those \\"cant put down\\" novels.

B000002V07|3.0|That is as close a descriptive as I can come up with for this music. Of course the popular hit \\"Fade Into You\\" with its melancholy cheer is not acid. But the rest of these songs are. The lead singer, Hope Sandoval sings as if from beneath still water; her voice is s bit muffled and strangely soothing. Imagine a ghost beckoning you from another dimension, calling out sorrowfully against a backdrop of warp-speed acid rock.<br /><br />This is particularly true of \\"Into Dust\\", a spectacularly surreal and relentlessly nihilistic paean to dying. I bought the cd on the strength of this song because I could not release it from my brain after I first heard it: at the end of an episode of \\"House\\", an unlikeable man lies dying in his hospital bed, friendless and alone. The camera slowly zooms up and away from him as Sandoval sings \\"...and I can feel myself growing colder...I can feel my eyes turn into dust...I am turning into dust...\\". The effect was devastating, disturbing, haunting. I had no idea who sang it and spent hours googling \\"House\\" episodes looking for the title and artist and I did not even have the title right; I thought it was \\"Growing Colder\\" or something like that. I had to give up until, 6 months later, I saw an advertisement on TV for a video game and this song was used in the background. I ran to the computer again and looked up the name of the game - one thing led to another and I found what I needed. Forgive my digression. That's just how important it was for me to have that song.<br /><br />Sandoval's voice is reminiscent of Harriet Wheeler's. Wheeler once sang with a band called The Sundays in early '90's, and I loved their rendition of the Stones' \\"Wild Horses\\" on the album \\"Blind\\".<br /><br />The rest of this particular cd, however, was a disappointment. Not offensive in any way, just rather bland to my ears. \\"Into Dust\\" is singularly brilliant. I suppose if one is prone to black depressions (as I am) it is more significant to ponder dying and turning to dust, thus being drawn into the otherworld of this song. That is too personal, I am aware. But it is a heads up that this song may not be for everyone.to dust, thus being drawn into the otherworld of this song. That is too personal, I am aware. But it is a heads up that this song may not be for everyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of my favorite all times books.  Read them all through again twice.  Really a fast read.  I know that I will read them again in the future.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was definitely a book worth reading.  I enjoy Flynn's style of telling the story through the eyes of the characters.  Just when you think you've figured things out, you see things from the perspective of another character and you realize you didn't understand what happened at all.  I did find the read rather depressing.  These characters' lives were so hopeless.  Their lives seemed doomed from the beginning and there wasn't any sign of hope for their future.  There didn't seem to be a bright spot anywhere until....(I don't want to give anything away).
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a great read and I really loved the treatment of the theology. It is not often you will find a warrior monk who says \\"gods are a lie\\".<br /><br />courageous of the author to choose to be so bold with his humaninsing of his characters.<br /><br />I devoured this book in a couple of days. Heartly recomend you read this book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. It does not have a standard cookie-cutter fantasy fiction story line. The story is detailed and yet easy to follow.  Very well written and just a pleasure to read.  I can't wait for the next book in the series. Well done!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I must admit that I purchased this game because it was free and I have always liked playing it. But I found it to be addicting. I play it in bed, in waiting rooms, even in the bathroom. I think you will love it. No learning curve. If you know the game you will be playing immediately.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|well, what can i say except that i love this movie! peter pan is filled with adventure action and comedy. my 5 yr old loves this movie as well. there is a part in the movie that shows john and micheal's bum and i thought that could have been left out, however all in all a very good movie and worth buying.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|I bought this book from a concern on how easy it was to lie to myself. The book definitely covers the subject, and does it very well. Its title is a good, even modest, indication of its insides.<br /><br />First I want to emphasise the pleasant and relaxed style of the author, amusing and enjoyable. It really makes reading a pleasure.<br /><br />I did not know the author, and I was pleasantly surprised to find out it is a scientific book (being a social scientist myself). The book takes you on an exciting experimental journey. Although not detailed, the epistemology of the experiments is sound.<br /><br />In summary, it is a pleasant and amusing scientific book that enriches its reader, interesting science diguised in fun reading.<br /><br />Thank you Dan!

B002PEP4SC|5.0|I enjoyed this reading for many reasons. One, I love the characters. Two, you can find the same witty spirit that Richard Castle manifest in the serie. Three, I love to link what I see in there with the serie. Overall, it is a good story, it's like one episode that you enjoy reading (do not except the characters having the same background than in the serie though).
B0009WFFS6|2.0|Although I am the biggest Cream fan in the world I have to say in all honesty that this is very disappointing. Even the sound of Clapton's guitar and Baker's drumkit is all wrong. Apart from 'Crossroads' and 'I'm So Glad' (as long as the bass is loud and clear) and to some extent 'Spoonful', it hasn't got any real contrapuntal energy, the tension is static (as it is with your average blues-rock band). In the end its just not involving enough. But on the tracks I've mentioned Clapton plays well and the only thing I can complain about is the bloated sound of the drums, especially on 'Glad', and to a lesser extent the SOUND of the other two. If only they had all stuck to the sound they were using on the old live recordings it would have gone some way to making this work. But ultimately it is the playing (and singing) that disappoints.  And certainly having this in video doesn't help either as they don't look at all exciting in their middle-aged incarnations.  'Politician' is only fairly successful despite being Bruce's best vocal performance, because the new bass sound doesn't work for it, and Clapton is uninspired.  'Sunshine' is a disaster because it's rhythmically dead, with Baker sounding terribly tired (although this was the end of the concert and we know he has also had health problems), except for the free-form coda where they really get stuck in and sound like the old Cream. There hasn't been a good performance of this number since 1968 despite it being included in all Jack's concerts and most of Clapton's - at least not on the available evidence from numerous recordings. But with the original line-up together again I was really hoping this time.  The other 'bonus' version of 'Sunshine' on the DVD is no better.  'Sweet Wine' is a mess with Clapton floundering about and Bruce doing his best in the hope that Clapton will decide to go somewhere.  'NSU' is not bad but nothing like what they used to be capable of.  But the concert is still 'Cream' of sorts, and I'dstill rather listen to this than almost anything else in rock apart from Hendrix, some Led Zeppelin, or the Dead, because there are points of interest in the playing which make it worthwhile exploring for the Cream connoisseur - in particular the continuing connection with Indian classical music.  But be warned that the new sound of Bruce's bass, which is one of the most interesting thing about these concerts, does not register clearly on most hi-fi's and it's worth experimenting with hi-fi equipment. His new sound has a plosive or pneumatic quality quite unlike the sound he used in the old days.  Clapton's singing is coarse and strident on his solo numbers like 'Badge'and 'Outside Woman Blues', while Bruce though still retaining the authority has lost much of its old excitement and vigour, not surprisingly considering his liver transplant not long before the reunion. But his singing is good except for the occasional word that is delivered no better than a rough bark.    On no account buy this until you have all the original LIVE recordings, and of course that includes the DVD of the 1968 Farewell Concert. Most of the authorised live recordings can be heard on wolfgangsvault free of charge and there are also some performances that are not available elsewhere such as another Crossroads and another Sunshine.    I have discovered that if the two disc CD set of this is played on a rather hard sounding stereo system it gains tremendously in the way it grabs the listener. It sounds more like the old Cream this way, much more exciting.  In a way it's obvious that this could happen from my comments about the sound above, but it's only just been now possible for me to hear it on such a hard-on-the-ears-system (or at least it would be hard on the ears with a normal sounding CD especially something 'classical'). Heard this way the best tracks mentioned work better and some marginal ones like NSU begin to work quite well. In particular the drums, guitar and Bruce's voice soundmuch more as if they mean business.  Heard like this it could be regarded as a useful supplement to the scanty material available from the old Cream.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is the best Star Trek movie EVER and it's good enough to run with the big boys; if u like action/adventure you'll like this movie.  FINALLY someone got an excellent script.  AND whoever did this casting deserves an Academy Award because if you're familiar with the original Star Trek crew these guys seem like they were BORN to play these roles.  I heard a new one is coming out and if you haven't seen this one yet, PLEASE check it out.  Great movie, excellent script, outstanding acting and all around a great time.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This product is all that it is described as and more especially when you buy it as part of a bundled HD Blu-Ray, DVD, and a Digital Copy.  The extras are fantastic!  This is a must buy for any and all fans of the Hunger Games (movies and the book series).  Jennifer Lawrence performs amazingly as Katniss, and the world-building will not disappoint even the most avid book series lover.  This is a great deal for all the enjoyment and flexibility that you will get out of this purchase.
B0086DBE62|3.0|Aside from the slightly jarring modern speech used in the film, Mirror, Mirror was rather a lot of fun.  I don't know if I completely believe Julia Roberts as a villain, but it was fairly enjoyable watching her give it a go.  As long as you don't go in expecting a moving film or one with a powerful message, you'll be able to enjoy it just fine.

B00571F26Y|4.0|\\"Wheat Belly\\" is an informative look at how gluten (contained in all grains) affects health.There are specific interactions discussed in cluding Celiac Disease,Diabetes,Hyperthyroidism to mention a few. A must read for those afflicted.I have Celiac and the book has been a motivation to continue the road to health.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I was recommended this by a friend and all I can say is: THANKS! This was an incredibly clever, suspenseful page-turner and I urge any fans of thrillers to read it right now - you won't regret it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|In my opinion, the book was poorly written, amateurish, and cliche.  I am amazed-and a little appalled-that it has become such a worldwide sensation as I would have expected more out of something so tremendously successful, but I suppose it goes to show that sex sells.  Despite my dismay, I did read the entire book from start to finish, so it did keep me interested enough to keep the pages turning.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Im saying thanks to Riordan for not letting percy jackson go to a complete halt adding new characters give it a new perspective
034580404X|2.0|I only read this book not the finally 2 and I have to say that I dont think young adults should read this book as they are to impressionable. I think there should be an age limit of 21 or older, this is actually worse then porn and to think that there is an arthur who would publish something like this for all audiences, scares me....wonder if she would want her young daughter at an impressionable age to read this or think that a relationship like this is acceptable.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Loved this book - so well written and amusing too.  I envy those who can run like this - since I have two hip replacements fast running is no longer for me.  Wish I had read a book like this ten years ago.  Maybe I wouldn't have needed the hip replacements!!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I bought this novel following all the hype it has received in the media. Having reached chapter 11, I doubt if I will bother to finish the whole thing. To me, it is boring, not well written and depends on graphic descriptions of sex for its popularity.<br /><br />Certainly would not bother with the sequels.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played Spider on my computer and have found it to be fun and relaxing to play.  I was pleased to see I could get it via my Kindle and now play it every day.  Good game!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is a well written sci-fi book.It has interesting placement of the people that are being protrayed. Good action and keeps you guessing at times as to what will happen next.
B008GJVEZ2|5.0|you have to watch this movie a few times before you can catch every nuance in every word and deed. i loved gabriel byrne as tom regan, albert finney as leo, and john turturro as bernie bernbaum. great cast!
B0074D3CAQ|1.0|Not nearly as good as Major Pettigrews Last Stand. I found the book boring me. Too much of the same thing.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Worth the money you pay for it. And it's easier/cheaper than buying all the individual songs. If you have doubts, listen to them on youtube or something first.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Really hard to first get in to the book, but if you keep reading the book gets really good. In the end you learn a really good life lesson
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I'll keep this short.  For anyone, like me, who keeps wondering if/when MadMen is going to jump the shark, you don't need to worry about season 5.  Just like every other season so far, it kept me so riveted that I couldn't engage in my normal tv-watching activity, namely surfing the web.
B004GBFF5Y|3.0|Honestly, I hate Zach Galifianakis.  I hate him as an actor, and from the interviews I have heard, I hate him as a person. He is gross, crash, and just not my type of humorist at all.<br /><br />But playing a mentally deranged person, he was pretty good. Not his usually gross self.<br /><br />Typically teenage angst movie.  Kid lets pressures of every day life get too him, his family is no good, above average intelligence, jocks start beating him up, blah blah, same stuff they feed them on TV.  Decides to commit suicide, but checks himself into rehab.<br /><br />It was a enjoyable not too boring ride.  No great moments, no ups and downs, just plain, a little too long in the middle.<br /><br />Hope a lot of teenagers saw the ending.  It did make a great point, and that all life is work living.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I took the longest reading this book only cause I didn't want it to end ;( but have to say this one was my least favorite of the three. The story was good it was suspenseful but the ending felt a little rushed. This is good bye for now Mr. Grey, can't wait until I see you on the silver screen! Lol ;)
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I thought this book was enjoyable.  I liked learning how it all began.  I wish though that the author would have elaborate more on how they came about with developing the maze and the science behind it.
034580404X|5.0|book 1 of three was very intense. I could not put this book down and even held off on buying the other two books until I finished a few other books I bought. Recommended to all my friends, even the ones who refuse due to its popularity!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved it! I want the next book in the series NOW. Or, the next two would be even better.
0345803493|4.0|although I loved this book, I still favor the first. Just enough action and drama to keep m interest. That Mr. Grey is really something.....lol
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Amazing- buy it if you want to be captivated- every lunch break and spare moment captivated by katniss and her unbreakable spirit!
1439170916|5.0|This epic biography of cancer is a masterpiece. As an oncology nurse I found it fascinating to find out the history of cancer treatments and have a more human, personal face to the soldiers of the war on cancer (Halsted, Farber, Lasker, and many others). However I believe this book would be thoroughly enjoyable to any person with an interest in learning more about this disease. For such an incredibly vast subject matter it was organized in a highly readable fashion. SM shows himself to be a masterful writer, balancing out science, history and human stories. For a subject matter that could be potentially laborious and dry, it could not have been further from that.. We got to know the \\"characters\\" of the history of cancer - the patients, the doctors, the researchers, the activists. When I first picked up the book I was intrigued but I admit the size of it was daunting, I wondered if I could get through it. But it is so highly readable that you want to keep finding out what happens next. I had learned about proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in my chemo and oncology classes but now I have learned the stories and the people behind these truly miraculous discoveries and I can appreciate the dedication and relentlessness it has taken to make these life-saving therapies like Gleevec, Herceptin, Tamoxifen and others a reality. I am disappointed that the book is over, I am left wondering what happens next. Only time will tell I guess. Read this book, I guarantee it will be unlike any you have ever read and definitely worth the time. I would give this book 10 stars if I could.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There aren't enough words I could use to describe how much I enjoy this site.  I have tried making a craft or two...not real successful, but I don't blame the site or directions.  I love all the wonderful ideas made easy for folks on a low budget.  Keep up the great work....
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I succumbed to the media hype and purchased this book.  It was absolute rubbish.  Beyond the writing style which is bad enough, it appears to perpetuate all the old theories of \\"if you really love me anything I do is acceptable\\".
B008S4YZCO|2.0|I thought my grandson and I could play this game together on my kindle...not!  I'm unable to figure out the game.  I think my grandson would love it...if his grandmother could figure out how to make the Monster grow.  Wouldn't recommed.
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed it at the theater and happy to have it in my collection. I've read the complete trilogy and the movie holds true to the book.
B008602KQI|2.0|Not nearly as good as the book! I would tell others to read the book and forget the movie.  Just my thoughts!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the 2nd book in this trilogy as much as the first.  I read it in just a couple days because I couldn't put it down.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book reminded me so much of 50 Shades of Grey,  Sylvia Day just change the character's name and occupation
B0073EP7G8|5.0|I love this CD. For those of you thinking about this purchase,  please worry no longer and buy the disk.  It has many of his older songs and some newer ones too. Almost every song has a memory that floods back each time I hear it. I am very glad I made this purchase.
B002DD67XG|5.0|James Taylor's music is classic... to have a greatest hits album just puts all his awesomeness on one Cd for hours of great listening, no matter what your age!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This was the best of the three as it actually had some plot to it rather than page after page after page of sexual descriptions.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was great, as are Gillian Flynn's other novels.  I couldn't put it down, and I must say, keeping me interested in a book is tough! Very well written and engrossing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  Finished it in 2 days.  I am an avid reader so it was refreshing and fun to read a book that is so original.  Twists and Turns that I never expected.  I have never read this author before but I am ordering anything else she has written.  What a good job!
0307341577|5.0|This book kept me guessing until the very end.  So well written and incredibly detailed.  Things I thought were included in passing turned out to be very important in the end -  Gillian Flynn is a master - I don't know how she does it. Can't wait to read her third book!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I've recommended this book to women and men, young and old. This is a captivating read, easy to get swept up in the crazy imagery.
B000A0GYD2|4.0|The HBO series \\"From The Earth to the Moon\\" reflects the quality that HBO used to produce before becoming obsessed with political slant and programming aimed at the lowest common denominator.  The mini-series contains everything that outstanding entertainment should have.  The subject matter can be riveting at times and the life that the actors and actresses breath into their characters make you come to care about them like personal friends.  I will always be grateful to Tom Hanks for bringing this to the small screen.  The only flaw in the DVD box set is that it is incomplete.  The original airing on HBO had eight additional episodes that started with the Mercury astronauts and took the viewer through the Gemini program.  The omission of these episodes leaves the experience incomplete because the Mercury and Gemini missions were integral to the eventual moon landing and gave further insight into the drive of the astronauts involved.
B0086DBE62|1.0|Other than the bright colors there's not much to this film. It's an interesting attempt to make the snow white story fun and new but it fails. julia roberts accent is somewhere between annoying and insulting. apparently the director is known for his music videos, maybe he should stick to that and bollywood films as the number at the end wasn't bad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book one was very enjoyable and exciting.  However I felt it was aimed at a younger age group (I'm 80). Also I thought the author could have written it all into a single book.  But, that's just an old man's thinking.  Overal I'd say it was fun and escape reading.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful book and story something for the 20th century!  Every woman AND man should take a look at this one - we may all learn something!
B004IF8TLU|4.0|Its always a fun one to watch. My teenage girls had a good laugh.  Thor - what a guy ;)
B007HJ98XC|4.0|Really like the mini series way better than the books. Got tired after book 3. He says the books write themselves, well maybe he needs to step in and edit them. Jeez, no conclusions and way too much verbosity. Oye!!!
0547569653|5.0|I picked up this book as after two friends, serious runners, recommended it. I have run three open marathons and three Ironman races and I have gone from being a poor runner to average at best. The thought of running more than 26.2 miles has never crossed my mind... until reading this book. Now I am planning to run a 50k in March and a 50 mile ultra in the fall. The running stories in the book are captivating; the running tips alone are worth the cost of the book; the life stories connect; and the diet references along with the great recipes provided are tremendous for anyone who wants to live a healthier lifestyle where \\"what we eat\\" plays a critical role. Anyway, I bought the first copy of Eat & Run on my Kindle, and before finishing it, I ordered the hardback to have an easier reference for the running tips and recipes. After Born to Run, I had heard some less than flattering things about Scott Jurek, but after reading his story, I have great respect for him. I'd travel to hear him speak and I hope he puts out a recipe book... Thanks Scott!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app. It disband definite must have! The best part is that it is FREE!  I find myself checkingbit often to find out how much battery life I have left for whatever task I am doing. Highly RECOMMENDED!!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I love Woody Allen.  He painted such beautiful scenes, in warm hues to tell a story about romance.  He hits the notion directly that<br />the romantic life always seems to have been in another era, not the one we live in.  From the colorful characters of the past to the music of Cole Porter, Paris comes alive at midnight.  The great part of this story is that it doesn't celebrate the French - it celebrates Americans in Paris ... from Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein ... it is our storytellers, our songwriters who make this movie what it is!  Bravo, Woody Allen - you made me thankful for THIS day to be the most romantic because I can watch your movie on demand, on a DVD, on a DVR, on an iPod, iPad or iPhone anytime I want!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|A friend read this book and said she couldn't put it down. I then rented the movie and was enthralled with the story. As always the book is better than the movie. This is a good read.<br />What that generation went through is astounding.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|The video kept skipping even though audio continued and made it frustrating to watch, so I didn't finish the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is better than I thought it would be.  It is hard to put down once you get started.  You keep telling yourself, &quot;Just one more&quot;.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The second book is just more of the first.  They're having sex again? Yawn. Is there anything more to their lives? Shallow and gets old.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A very good book. Keeps you interested in how the main character developed into the enigmatic figure he is. In you are interested in fantasy books with more than superficial story lines, this is one for you. I highly recommend this book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is an entertaining puzzle solving application, you can spend hours playing it. It's fun for all ages and makes you think.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Excellent work.  I was pulled in from the beginning. Had to pay close attention to the story because it jumped back and forth.  The story of course makes complete sense in the end.  Well worth the read.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|EXCITING, A PAGE TUNER! SHOCKING TURN OF EVENTS! YOU CANT PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN OR WHO WILL DIE !AWESOME! GREAT STORY TELLING!
1416955070|3.0|I've been meaning to start reading this series since... umm... 2010. But I didn't feel it when I did pick it up for the first time, and I had to put the book back down. Then finally, two years later, I got the chance to sit still and finish the entire book without falling asleep.<br /><br />There is a lot of hype about this series and yes, my expectations were pretty high the first time I picked it up. But the second time around, I was passive about it. I didn't really know what I would like about the book. At the moment, I still feel pretty emotionless and neutral to the entire storyline and characters.<br /><br />Let's start with the beginning. As much as I'd say it was a good start to the book, I felt indifferent to it. It was something I've read in Urban Fantasies or Adult Paranormal Books. In adult paranormal books, they seem to all start with a club scene. I guessed Clare mixed things up to be unique.<br /><br />When the characters came in, the only thought I had was that Simon is sweet, and Jace is hot, I disliked Isabelle and Clary. Clary because she tends to use Simon ALOT. And Isabelle because her mood swings are intolerable. I'm waiting for the part in the series when I start liking and falling in love with each good character in the story. At the moment, my favorites are Luke and Simon. Jace is just an idiot towards the end.<br /><br />Now, lets talk about the storyline/plot. As much as I'd like to say that it was awesome, it wasn't to me. I don't know why this book has driven me to be utterly emotionless about it. The storyline kept me turning pages thats for sure. It was like a mixture of predictability and originality. But then it's sometimes not original at all. I guess, Clare put in a WHOLE mixture of everything to confuse us, so we'll just settle on calling the series unique.<br /><br />Aside from that confusion, the book had a collection of the usual paranormal creatures like, warlocks, shadowhunters (demon hunters), feys, vampires, werewolves, witches, nixies and a whole lot more of creatures of the night that I have yet to understand and read about.<br /><br />Finally, the ending of the book was disturbing, irritating and it makes me feel so happy that I have the rest of the series waiting to be read on my shelf, so all my doubts and fears can be written out.<br /><br />Overall, the book was good, page-turning but not as awesome as I thought it would be. I'm not disappointed but simply, apathetic to the whole thing. I'm curious on how the movie will be like. And curious if the rest of the series will manage to make me fall in love with it.tches, nixies and a whole lot more of creatures of the night that I have yet to understand and read about.<br /><br />Finally, the ending of the book was disturbing, irritating and it makes me feel so happy that I have the rest of the series waiting to be read on my shelf, so all my doubts and fears can be written out.<br /><br />Overall, the book was good, page-turning but not as awesome as I thought it would be.

B0064YKWEA|5.0|I have watched all the Sons of Anarchy seasons and they are awesome. The actors and actresses are perfect for their parts in this show.  Can't wait for Season 5 to start, Sept. 11th.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was full of ups and downs with a surprise at every corner.<br />It made me mad and sad and so confused.<br />I really loved it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've been re-reading books I read when I was in middle school. I'm 30 now so they all seem very different. Ender's Game is a great story; I thought so as a 6th grader and even more now.<br /><br />Read it before the movie comes out. I'm sure you'll love it.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|For readers growing jaded by the paucity of good, innovative fiction, Murakami is an oasis. A recommendation from my son, \\"1Q84\\" brings together the stories of the two central characters in a novel which does not need to rely on a plot full of twists and turns.<br /><br />Indeed, there is an inevitability that the characters are drawn towards. The narrative style is powerful, yet related with a remarkable tenderness.  Murakami's novel is one which I would recommend to readers of almost any age and reading habits. I will now plunge happily into his other works.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|This is a very readable book, maybe Lewis' best. I've read several other books on the financial crisis, most of them much longer and more detiled, but Lewis has a knack for explaining complicated things. If you want to understand the financial crisis, this is the book to start with.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|The only reason I would ever consider giving it less than 5 stars would be because it didn't last forever..it had to end at one point!:(<br /><br />The book kept me guessing the whole time and I could not put it down.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its really good. I love it. just that it isn't at its full potential without you paying money. why not free. really really really really great
B0014D6PCO|5.0|It was a great movie, I've been seen the 3 movies in a maraton and it was amazing!<br />I hope to see more movies with all villains..
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love Pinterest. It is so fun to use, when it works. This app definitely needs to be updated. At times it works very well but other times I try to repin something and an error message pops up saying 'The Pinterest server is having trouble'. This works perfectly fine on my home computer, but on the Kindle app it has issues. Sometimes, also, the app doesn't stop loading. I have just deleted then reinstalled it so I will have to see how it goes from there.
B004M5HUXE|1.0|I started reading this book and was not enjoying it at all.  It may have been the old english that bothered me or the fact that it just wasn't encouraging me to continue reading with the story that made no sense to me.  So I deleted it off of my Kindle and won't bother again.
B008602KQI|5.0|THis movie was what I was hoping, since I read the series.  It mostly follows the book with a few deviations. Most of it is exactly what I pictured while reading the book and that is rare to find.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I've been longing for a long form horror story and this TV show goes dark and doesn't let you go. It's an experience and a fun, creepy ride and I can't wait for season 2
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Always enjoyed Michael Connelley's character-Harry Bosch-feel like I really know why he is who he is.  Waiting for the next release!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have used my Kindle for a lot of things but I never thought to use it for getting to sleep. I suffer from a debilitating disease that includes trouble sleeping and if I am too sore it is difficult to fall asleep. This tool has really helped me during these last few weeks and I know Iwill be using it for a long long time.
B000I8ES5C|1.0|By far one of the greatest martial arts movies of all time, but having the only viewing option as \\"streaming\\" , rather than being able to download and watch without pixelation from streaming, has convinced me to NEVER buy a movie through amazon again.
B005IQZB14|5.0|My friend read the book first then told me I HAD to read it and soon. Bought it right away and couldn't put it down. Now we want to start long distance backpacking. Parts of the book was so graphic it had me laughing hard. I could just picture her with the backpack so heavy she couldn't stand straight. Don't believe I would do it by myself but would love to do it with our group that gets together once or twice a year. The book is a must read.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a very good book but for younger readers.  Fast and easy read with an ending that took me for surprise
B005PK4ZHY|5.0|Loved this show but wish it didn't end.<br />I will miss this show and the characters on it.<br />There needs to be another show like it not these reality shows.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I love that I can make quick updates about anything!  I can retweet easily about my friends tweets. Twitter is better than Facebook.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Another great for the series I couldn't put it down. The complexity of the writing and the way he puts you in the story is unbelievable.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Great show about human emotion and human interaction under dire circumstances.  Some of the best writing in a TV series to date.  Great show if lots of gore doesn't upset you.  If you are faint on violence you can cover your eyes and still enjoy the show.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought it started out a little slow but as the story got going I couldn't put it down!  I am now anxiously awaiting the second book!  I will definately be rereading this book!
B004EBZX6W|1.0|I was recently out of town and could only tap into Wi Fi one day out of five even though the hotel we were staying at had Wi Fi as well as aanother hotel and restaurant across the street.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The whole series of the Outlander is very intriguing. You get caught up in the story and the characters. Yes some of it is a little over the top but that is what makes so enjoyable to read. Its is a long book that you don't want to end.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Great Series - Great Streaming Quality.  Story line and all charachters are top notch.  I watched all the previous seasons and now can't wait for the series to start up again.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This is a the first book of a trilogy and is essentially a modern day love story and a fairy tale where the hero is a wealthy handsome prince and the heroine is a beautiful princess.<br />But don't let that put you the reader off. Christian, the hero had many issues to come to terms with in his life and he thought he would solve them in involving himself in expressing his sexuality in a way that may be different from the usual.  He meets his heroine Ana and together they work through the issues that Christian has until the end result is a beautiful manifestation of love.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I am an old recalcitrant trekie. First Contact is the Star Trek universe's version of the future. Regrettably, it tells us that we have one more world war to go through before the universe deems us fit to talk to.
B00633W614|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is such a brilliant story teller.  His stories and characters touch me and move me.  I am not in love with the trilogy format, I always would prefer a book to stand on its own and that is not the case here.  That is my only negative.  Having said that, bring on book 3.  I can't wait.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this trilogy. Great love story with steamy sexy scenes. Has done wonders for our sex life!!! Hope she writes more stories like this.
B001V5CIHQ|4.0|Good movie for the family. Good remake of a classic story and showed Victorian times quite accurately. A \\"watch it once\\" movie though.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed the book although at moments felt like I should be looking over my shoulder to make sure no one could see what I was reading! lol... It's a refreshing way to look at relationships in a way, just very different.  Loving it, can't wait to get to the 3rd book.
B008MEM24S|4.0|A bit different and a step up from Where's My Water. Really makes you think. Entertaining and a bit addictive. Great game for all ages.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 5 year old granddaughter got me hooked. On this game. Love it. Love it. Shows you we are still all kids at heart!
B005LAIGRS|4.0|CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) discretely guards a safe-house in South Africa that has less activity than a morgue.  His average shift at work involves tossing a ball against a wall roughly 8043 times, becoming a Sudoku master, some alone time on the porcelain throne, and more Angry Birds than you care to imagine.  Everything changes when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a rogue agent forced to either turn himself in to the US Consulate or die at the hands of criminals, enters the fold.  Frost's presence creates an opportunity for Weston to prove himself, but Frost may be too much to handle physically and/or psychologically.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that the pair must go on the run and endure car chases during the shoot-outs and battles with enemies, the film felt like it could have easily been a sequel to Assault on Precinct 13 or The Contract.  (Oddly enough, each of those films has a younger white actor guarding/protecting an older black actor, and in each case the older actor is the superior in most conceivable ways.  I digress.)<br /><br />Much like his relationship with Denzel in terms of acting, Ryan Reynolds is initially over his head.  Ultimately, however, a case could be made that he just about holds his own in this pulse-pounding, action thriller.  Nonetheless, both captivate.  Having said that, the action is the real star.  One particularly awesome shootout takes place in what must be the slums of Capetown, where bullets and bodies fly through corrugated roofs and paper-thin walls.  The film feels like it's about 45 minutes long because there really isn't a second to breathe.<br /><br />Derivative but enjoyable.
B008602KQI|3.0|I heard so much about how good this movie was, but I didn't find it to be exceptionally spectacular. I like action movies with lots of suspense and this did have some of that, but I guess overall, the movie just seemed to be lacking something to me. I'm sure it had good ratings because it appealed to others.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Show is amazing! Picture quality is really good online & sound quality was good too... I will definitely be ordering other shows
B008602KQI|4.0|It is a good movie, produced well. I must say the book was alot better though. Just felt the movie was lacking some content the book had.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Excellent book, worth every minute of reading because you can't put it down. Well researched as all his books are, which adds informative history.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game challenging all the way thru!! You go thru the 5x5 boards quickly, and by the time you knOw it your already  halfway thru the 9x9! Will recomend
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Having seen a great number of London and Broadway musical hits, this show simply is The Superlative in every way. Kudos to Cameron McIntosh the producer and a cast in which every voice heard, and every facial and body expression is yet another building block of an incredibly enjoyable several hours. It is certain to greatly please anyone with an appreciation for musical theater and after watching several times, still look forward to the performance in our home theater with entranced friends. A six-star performance!
B008ENNXQI|3.0|It was just ok.  Julia Robert is excellent, funny in this movie.  I think she made the movie worth watching.
B003PDQEBS|2.0|I rented the movie because I believe that Colin Firth is an amazing actor. Well, the movie probably had great acting but found the content or subject matter disturbing
B008602KQI|5.0|Kept hearing about this book from my grandchildren and when the movie came out decided to get it. Would hate to have to live like that. Very interesting movie. Even tho my grandchildren say the book is much better, I enjoyed the movie. I think I will get the book and read it tho. If you like adventure, get this movie. I'm looking forward to the sequels.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Every Ice Age movie I see gets better and better.  I love how comical all the characters are.  My family also loved the movie and we recommend it to everyone we know!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Entralling, highly entertaining.  Believeable characters.  Looking forward to her next book.  would recommend these books to anyone.  loved the setting
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book had twists all the way until the end. I have been recommending it to others and am now on Ms. Flynn's third book. I think I have found a new favorite author.
B001QJUX24|5.0|THE SEARCHERS is a great film--arguably John Ford's and John Wayne's best--and a great story, even though hardly politically correct. And yes, it's Hollywood through and through: Why, for example, does Ford have a good-looking German actor play the villainous Comanche leader Scar (with limited screen time and almost no lines) rather than one of the Navajo extras used in the film? Is Scar intended to be a more \\"savage\\" mirror image of the part-Indian \\"searcher\\" Martin Pawley, played by Jeffrey Archer (also with Hollywood good looks)? Does Debbie Edwards, the object of the search (played by the seriously hot Natalie Wood) really want to be rescued or not? Why is Ethan Edwards (John Wayne's character), an often coarse, completely unbowed ex-Confederate soldier living in some gray space outside the law (a desert metaphor?), so darkly heroic? Parse it as you like: THE SEARCHERS is indeed a classic--really, the first of its kind--as John Ford creates a sense of vast distances and desolation gotten from few other films, Westerns or otherwise. It's an absolute must-see for anyone who fancies him- or herself a film buff.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|I love the way this book keeps me reading - at the moment there are quite a few books that have been too boring for me to finish so it is a real pleasure to be drawn along by this one.
B008602KQI|3.0|The Hunger Games movie left me feeling hungry---for the book! I thought that so much was left out or glossed over that I was disappointed with the final product. See the movie, but read the trilogy. It is far better.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|I was so happy to let my kids watch a fun  movie with a great message! I ordered a digital version, so no more \\"things\\" to store. Downloaded onto my iPad for a long trip...and when the kids wanted to watch it again, set it up on the computer directly from Amazon worked perfect; although I have to say the download to the iPad took a long time. [[ASIN:B008K3HRF0 Dr. Seuss' The Lorax]]
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|After reading the book I shouldn't be surprised by weak movie.  Donald Sutherland was completely unexplained, and poorly worked into script.  The movie has a feel of the 80s movie Brazil which was cool, but sadly unlike Brazil this movie did not deliver.  Will not watch sequels.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Very Enjoyable. Watched on Direct TV. bought a copy to send as a gift to mom. Good romance type movie
0385363125|5.0|This is the best trilogy ever. I can't wait for the next book. Looking for my Christian Grey. Wow wow & wow again.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|great read complex characters and it's all about the throne who's on it who wants it who's entitled to it
B00846REIS|4.0|It was fun, somewhat exciting but since i have read 50 shades, i cant help but compare. That said, i am still looking forward to reading the next two books!
B0084AYLK8|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was a good mystery.  The characters were \\"round\\" rather than 'flat' which generated an interest in what happened to them.  Like most of Hardy's books, the main character was on a downward spiral from which he never recovered.  This is a downer but it did hold my interest throughout.  I am a fan of The Classics.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Season 6 is awesome.  Disappointing that I cannot watch it through a Wii system. We tried to stream it thru an HDMI cable and our internet speed just doesn't handle it as well.
B004LX0D36|5.0|I love Jane Austen and this version read perfectly. It was fun to have the addition of the illustrations as well. They added to the book for me.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I have not read the book, but the movie was fantastic.  The acting was good, the story was very interesting, and it left you wondering what is going to happen next.
B00881VLCE|5.0|It was the best puzzle ever I really love this app it's great awesome and cool so get it today!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I think it's fun and challenging.  There are various levels so everyone should find a level of play they enjoy. There are no tricky or complicated rules to deal with and it seems to play well on my Kindle Fire.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great. I have no problems with it. Luv it so freaking much. It tells me everything I need to know.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Acemoglu and Robinson have given us a creative, powerful and  comprenhensive explanation, that is to say a truly general theory,  of  economic development.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't know why it's priced so low but it's truly an amazing read! I made at least 3 of my coworkers read it with me so I had someone to talk about the book with.
B008M34INW|4.0|Get the Gringo is Mel's best movie in many years.  It has action and humor that are well proportioned I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B008CP92ZO|4.0|easy going & funny! not the best or funniest movie but still i didn't feel like i wasted my time after watching it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books were awesome! Story line kept your attention and kept you wanting more. I am hoping that the story will continue. I have recommended this book to everyone and I hope some men will take the time to read it. Every relationship needs some spice & romance but it is usually the women who take this part. In fifty shades, Gray did a lot of that & it was great to see it continue after the marriage. With Anna's love and support she was able to help him with his past nightmares. The love & challenges these two faced & overcame was touching.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a simple concept but can be very challenging in the later stages.  at first it seems too easy, but hang in there as it will toughen up.
B004JOCU2O|5.0|Bought this for my grandson who is \\"Train\\" crazy. Action and Speed are the main attraction for him. It is worth having something an adult can watch too.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is fantatic.  Can't wait for the next book/movie to come out.  Best part was Amazon, because I pre-ordered and the movie would not be delivered before video released to public, I was able to watch via Amazon video for free until the movie arrived.  Can't ask for better service than that, and it wasn't Amazon's vault for delay before release and movie arrival.  Video released on Saturday, movie arrived Monday
B005EHILV4|5.0|is an exceptionally functional device for music production with Cubase for example works perfectly well on Windows is very fast and easy installation Proper construction<br /><br />es un aparato excepcionalmente funcional para la produccion musical con cubase por ejemplo funciona perfectamente bien en windows es de facil instalacion muy rapida y esta bien construido
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'd been interested in purchasing this book for a while but for some reason never picke it up- finally I did and I was blown away!!!!!!<br />Remarkable book that kept me wanting more. One of those books that kept me whispering to myself \\"just one more chapter and then I'm going to bed\\" but never really able to put it down. Bravo!!
B0042GIRYE|5.0|I actually only bought this album for \\"Knee Deep\\" and \\"As She's Walking Away\\", but I had greatly underestimated the abilities of the Zac Brown Band.  Every song was at the very least enjoyable to listen to a few times, but most of them (\\"Colder Weather\\", \\"Settle Me Down\\") were just so... re-playable. They were fun, catchy and they had just enough fiddle to keep me coming back for more.
B008RKPC9E|5.0|I'm hooked on PLL (as on many other shows as a show junkie;pp) And I love Amazon for having most of the new ones out there so I can watch them on the go (KINDLE FIRE)<br />Pretty Little Liars season 3 is as good as 1&2. The Amazon quality is great as well:)
B001OGWY1W|1.0|Wasnt able to watch the movie. It kept freezing. And eventually it just said something like \\"unable to watch at this time\\"
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved these books. Took me a few chapters to get into the first book but by the time I had finished book one I had to buy book 2 and 3 right away! My husband loved them too!! ;)
B004QMW1NM|5.0|\\"Passive Me, Aggressive You\\" is the story of an unstable, heart-wrenching, and ecstasy-producing relationship. The ambient sound featured in \\"Punching In A Dream\\" and \\"Young Blood\\" put a smile on my face- it was difficult to feel sad while listening to these songs. \\"All Of This\\" and \\" But the album isn't solely upbeat- \\"The Sun\\" and \\"Jilted Lovers\\" showcase the passive and downhearted reference in the album title. \\"Frayed\\" and \\"Jitled Lovers\\" express the frustration of a constantly confusing and exhausting relationship that ties the album together. It ends with the ironic \\"Girls Like You\\", the chorus focusing on: \\"Don't you know people write songs about girls like you?\\" The album's journey could be predictable, but The Naked and Famous don't stick to a linear progression, instead scattering the effects of the relationship all over the album, keeping it fresh and leaving me wanting more.
B00138H4FW|4.0|Good album.  I've loved Toys in the Attic and Rocks since I was a kid but had never heard this one in it's entirety.  It's interesting to hear them at this point in their career - great raunchy blues/rock songs, good grooves, and Tyler's voice sounds thicker and deeper than it does now.  There are definitely elements of their future greatness evident here.  Walkin' the Dog and of course Mama Kin are favorites.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places: A Novel begins with a lightly intriguing air that pulls the reader deeper into the story with each chapter. At first I was interested in who Libby the main character was and how she survived the horrific events that visited her family but as I read further, other characters began to emerge that interested me more. I began to see that another character, Diondra, was really the glue in this little tale. I would have liked to read one more chapter covering a reunion with the character Crystal and her family but hopefully, a novel will be written around her psychic which should be interesting after living with Diondra all her life! Yikes!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It took me a few chapters to really get into this book, but then I didn't want to put it down. I love that the story is narrated by Death. You might assume that this perspective would cause the story to be gruesome (considering the time period), but it's beautifully written. With his tongue-in-cheek outlook, Death comes across as compassionate and funny, with a bit of sarcasm thrown in.  Parts of the book are a little drawn out, but overall the book keeps a good pace and offers a good look at life inside Germany during WWII. The main character is Liesel, who (with her family) is hiding a Jew in her basement. The focus is on her street and all the neighbors that make up her daily life - some are fervent followers of Hitler while others just want to make it through the war alive. The ending is heartbreaking and beautiful, and was the best part of the whole book. As others have said, The Book Thief will keep you thinking about how humans treat each other long after you've finished reading.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I heard about this show for years and never watched it. I recently purchased season 1 for my kindle, and I am now hooked. I finished the first season and have just downloaded season2. Very addictive
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved this movie! As with all movies taken from a novel, the book has alot more detail, but the movie followed the book well and the casting was perfect!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|This is a beautiful DVD, just full of the incredible performances of the Bee Gees.  They were really perfection and the reaction from the audience, especially once Robin starts singing, is so touching. Definitely a great purchase!
B000YIGNKE|4.0|The 1995 BBC version sticks much, much closer to the book than this version does.  This version has the text of the novel all out of order and has some parts of the novel spoken to an entirely different person at an entirely different time/location.  Some of the charaters were totally wrong (or completely missing), but if I hadn't read the book, I would not have realize it.<br /><br />With all it's faults, I still think it flowed well.  I loved the acting and the emotion displayed by both Anne and Wentworth.  You could see and feel the pain and the heartache from both of them.  I dismissed this version for a long time but I am glad I finally watched it.
B000H2R71G|5.0|He's done it again. Saved the world... Sorta. If you want to call this the world. Anyway, good movie. Excellant acting all around especially the feral kid.
B001JAFYFG|5.0|Received this DVD very quickly. Brand new. Logan's Run. First saw this movie way back when! The blu Ray quality was fine.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|I enjoyed this book which, in Gregory's usual easy-to-read style, recounts the life of Anne Neville, youngest daughter of the powerful Earl of Warwick, the Kingmaker as he was known,  for the men he'd helped to the throne of England (or tried to). Not too much is known about this woman who fades a little into history as she's cast into the shadows by much brighter figures such as her much-maligned husband, Richard, her sister-in-law, the beautiful and quite cunning Elixabeth Woodville the Queen of England as well as her husband's brothers, King Edward and George. In an attempt to insert Anne more into this complex and dramatic story, Gregory gives her agency in many of the terrible events that led to her husband being crowned and beyond. Having just read another extensively researched book on the era, I found Gregory's portrait of Anne interesting but not engaging. In fact, at times I found Anne quite petty and tiresome which didn't accord with what I'd read elsewhere. Like Gregory herself, I prefer the richer more desperate character of Elizabeth and her mother, Jacquetta and, as a consequence, enjoyed Gregory's books on these women more as well. I also preferred scenes which included them and/or explored the politics and allegiances of the time, all of which Gregory does so well. Nonetheless, I did like this very much and would recommend it to anyone who loves the turbulent period known as the War of the Roses and is curious about alternative ways of viewing Richard III, arguably one of the most misrepresented monarchs in British history.
B008MEM24S|4.0|my 6 yr old says \\" I like it a lot\\" he says it's a hard game and he likes hard core :)
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Never read it in school, appreciate it now as a seasoned reader.  I felt as if I was on the island and Hispaniola myself!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Great movie to start Nolan's trilogy. Highly recommended. DVD arrived fast and I have no complaints about its condition.Included the amazon instant video also for those who can not wait until the dvd arrives.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read \\"The girl with the dragon tatoo\\" for my book Club (Van Horn Book Club of KCMO).  It was so interesting (after chapter 3)that I immediately downloaded book two, \\"The girl who played with fire\\". Reading it was more exciting and as soon as I completed it, I downloaded \\"The girl who kicked the hornet's nest\\".  I was depressed after completing it knowing that there will not be any more books in the series because of Mr. Larson's demise.  The books kept my attention(in fact I did more consistent reading in the past month than I have in years)with the intrigues of mystery, romance and sex.<br /><br />Lynda Moore Walker<br />Kansas City, MO
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Excellent ending. Wish the book would continue.  This book had me reading so much in a short time.  I really love the different types of love and bonds I experienced when I read this book.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan since a teenager. The Duo of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is priceless. The chemistry is just there. I can not wait for further installments. Keep them coming, and I will keep buying them.
B000I3P3EM|5.0|ST VI: The Undiscovered Country is, in this reviewer's opinion - the best of all the Star Trek films; both \\"Original Series\\" and \\"The Next Generation\\". It's great to see Sulu come into his own as a starship captain... great movie!
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I was looking for a sleep aid with ambient noise to replace a room fan I use every night. The selection in this app is great. However, I found myself staying awake to see when the app would shut off. Maybe it'd work better for me if I used it regularly.
0525953728|5.0|I was reading all the BS about this book giving away National Security secrets, and classified information. I have to say, the stories im reading are general, but very interesting, very well written to protect him and his comrades. But Owen puts you there, and finally the REAL STORY on what went down!! Fantastic job SEAL! God Bless!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good read.  Kept attention throughout book.  The ending seemed as though the writer just got tired - i thought there could be more to it.  Otherwise, I recommend it as a good beach/vacation read
B008602KQI|4.0|I really liked this movie. I read the books and they were really good the book is better than the movie they had to leave some out that's why 4 stars
B008602KQI|1.0|Let me start by saying that the movie was fabulous- no problem there. However, the movie/disc got \\"stuck\\" when Katniss was in the tree and we had to go back to the main menu and start again at the next chapter.  I returned my copy frustrated because I felt like we had missed something important. The copy I later bought at Wal-mart did the same thing. (And yes, I tried the discs in multiple DVD players.) my second copy went back too. You would think that with a movie this big someone would have checked to make sure the discs worked.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Great entertainment! The picture and sound are super.  I would recommend this to everyone, well worth the money to have it.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I like Sherlock movies. I like the actor Robert Downey Jr. This movie was like the first one. Full of his \\"what if\\" moments. Where Holmes thinks every option on the situation. At first it was ok but after a while I would want to fast forward or take a motion sickness pill. They did a lot of special effects almost like the Matrix. That turned me off from giving this a better rating. It is a good watch but not a great watch. I wish it was better just because of the Moriaty situation. But the most memoral scene in the movie was Holmes killing (and reviving) Dr. Watson's dog. Again. Will the dog make it threw another movie? Who knows. But it is worth a watch just not a top ten movie of the year.
B006ATJXQW|1.0|I did not enjoy this book at all. I thought once again Dashner created more questions than answers. I obviously knew that there would not be a happy ending given the Maze Runner series but I had hoped there would be a nice ending for the characters in this book but I guess Dashner never had a problem getting rid of a few beloved characters. If you enjoyed Maze Runner then I recommend this book but I read this out of curiosity and that was my first mistake.
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie. I'm not as picky as some people are though, so of course form your own opinion :) but I didn't mind the changes they did from the book, and of course there's a lot you just can't show as it is explained in the book, which sadly leaves the viewer with less of an impact in some parts and overall. But if you've read the book you know what I'm talking about, if you haven't it is still a very good movie!
B007SGM084|5.0|I had an idea about the story line of these books, so I wasn't shocked with the very graphic details involving sex. The back story is what really kept me reading, I wanted to know more about Grey and why he was the way he was. The way Ana and Christian developed their relationship was fun to read, so many moods, issues with control, making compromises with one another. Kinda like most relationships!!<br />I really liked the books and would reccomend them. Not going to lie the parts about sex were great also!!<br />Can't wait for the movie!!
B007SGM084|1.0|Didnt care for story at all! Didnt find it interesting read.  I don't like the content, very boring, wish I didnt order it!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I love this app. It makes it really easy to keep up with all the blogs I follow. It loads quickly, has a clean layout, and in general just works well.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Quite a story. Borders on pornography but makes for a fascinating read. I(t's quite a story but I enjoyed it. The ending is obvious there is a sequal (actually two)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I threw several problems at this calculator. I tested all math problems against my trusty TI-86 to make sure they were correct.<br />2+2=4....correct<br />2+6=8.... correct<br />10+4=14....correct<br />11+5=16 ... correct<br />5-2=3 ... correct<br />Now the real test.<br />123456+654321=7777777 .... correct<br /><br />Everything seems to check out. 5 stars.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Another great Baldacci read.  No huge explosive surprises, but a fast paced, interesting read.  The lead character could easily become a classic character and fodder for sequels.  All in all I really enjoyed it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved each second of this book!  I am currently reading the series for a second time because I loved it so much!!
B008MBXFEM|5.0|I didn't think I would get over The Dark Knight soundtrack.  I would listen to it almost everyday.  (I had a long commute and it was my go-to disc whenever I needed to hear some quality music or the radio wasn't cooperating.)<br /><br />Then this came along.<br /><br />A different score, to be sure, but there are some elements that sing through from both Batman Begins and Dark Knight.  Notably missing is James Newton Howard, though the score still has some of the softer elements of his style.  With The Dark Knight Rises, there is more of a gritty, bombastic quality permeating most of the tracks, especially \\"Gotham's Reckoning\\" (Bane's plane escape), \\"The Fire Rises\\", and \\"Rise\\" (which is when Batman hauls the bomb away from Gotham City.)<br /><br />What attracted me immediately to this score, before even seeing the movie, was \\"Despair.\\"  The slow burn and buildup to Batman's theme was enough for me to want to buy the whole album.  After I saw the film, I bought it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of scores, Batman, Zimmer, etc., pick this up.  You'll be playing the movie in your head as you do.<br /><br />(Plus, the aforementioned tracks make for some good workout music.)
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I started reading the books because I wanted to know what all the hype was about. After you get past all of the sexual hype, the storyline is pretty boring.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is an excellent read! It is quite suspenseful and you will never predict the ending, but not for a lack of trying. I searched for more novels/books from this author it was so good. Definitely a can't-put-it-down read! I highly recommend this novel.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was kind of disappointed with the ending, it was predictable, but on the other hand I am hoping for more of the story. I did like the books and would recommend them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|From the beginning, it has you guessing and wondering what is really going on and who is really behind it and why.  You will read well into the night - night after night. You will be drawn in and will identify with first one character and then the next, and then another.  An excellent read for murder-mystery fans.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie I think it should have had Katnis narrate it. There would have been move insight in her thought like the book.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Nothing to do the other night , rented Sherlock Holmes from amazon , enjoyed the movie and the streaming was flawless in hd quality.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Love all of the books I've read from Neil Gaiman so far. :)<br />Deffinatly worth buying. Great short read!  Can't wait to start reading another one of his books!
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I had been looking for this album awhile...when I finally purchased it, it was well worth the wait. Ferguson has a deep,rich and soulful voice that draws you into this album. I have listened to it dozens of times.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|A good Hornby. Maybe not at his best, but this is a good short story that will keep you hungrily absorbed for an afternoon.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so glad pinterest has an ap. I'm quite an avid user and I am very pleased with how it turned out. I defiantly recommend this ap!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Normally if you read the book first the movie disappoints.  The film could not contain all that was in the book without becoming 5 hours long.  What they did pack in the film gave the essence of the book minus some of the character and background building that the book provides.  And as always the character in your head while you are reading the book seldom match up with the actor selected.  A few of the lessor characters they got right. Most of the others won me over .  strongly recommend reading the book series to help you anticipate the films in the series.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|Have enjoyed everything that Rutherfurd has written.  His detailed research and ability to put it into fiction form makes for very good reading or listening.
B00122LXTM|5.0|A best of album is just that the best of nuff said. When music truly mattered and something that you can listen to and just sing along.
B008JAG2AA|4.0|This film was obviously written for those who graduated high school back in '99 and not for high schoolers of today. So much so, that I don't think a teenager would even appreciate this film. I found myself recalling not only the casts long journey, but my own as well. For whatever it's worth, American Pie and it's sequels are like the John Hughes films for my generation. Raunchier, sure; but so is my generation. It was a fun watch. I wouldn't mind if they did a few more of these. Every ten years maybe?
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Great documentary about Bob. A lot of information but at the same time a very enlightening, spiritual movie. Miss him more everyday
B0088TG252|5.0|Loved the movie.  Lots of action and the acting was great.  We were so into it that we hated to see it end.  I hope this is the start of many sequels.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|This was not what i expected, interesting movie. well done, i wanted to see this in the theaters but couldnt find a theater nearby
B009178OQA|5.0|The most fascinating documentary I have seen in a very long time, and so beautifully done. An absolute must watch.
0525953728|3.0|I finished this book in couple of hours, it was gripping from start to end..but after reading the book i got the answers to my questions related to the raid,but i ended up with more questions on the motives of the author..<br /><br />I didn't understand when the author said he wants to set the record straight and wants to give credit to the people who deserve it..make no mistake, we all knew who took part in the raid its seal team 6, and we gave all the credit to seal team 6...No doubt they deserve all the credit for this flawless operation..So does he really need to write this book for that purpose, especially by putting himself and his buddies at risk and literally ruining all the relationships he built with his seal brothers all along...<br /><br />Also, when you are serving this country means you serve the president regardless of u like him or not..i understand seals are normal people and they have their opinions.. but i don't see any reason why he had put out the conversations that happened near a fire, which are more like casual chats between colleagues & friends...You did the best you could do for the country by killing the most wanted man, and by disclosing all these off the record comments about the president and vice president he undermined this whole operation..I don't know what point he was trying to make by saying \\"even though we don't like our president we participated in this operation and killed bin laden\\"..I don't like to hear from an elite warriors like seal team 6 guys, this kind of political rhetoric...even if these kind of conversations took place he could have kept them under the wraps...<br /><br />Seal team 6 is one of the most secretive units of the US military, by writing this book especially without even informing the government, i got doubts about the motives of this author.<br /><br />The author says, president talked about it, so i can talk about it..i strongly disagree with this argument..president can talk about it because he is the president, by signing up to serve in seal team 6, this guy basically agreed to be a quiet warrior without worrying about he said she said kind of things..<br /><br />No doubt this guy is a great guy, served this country, did so many things which none of us could ever do, but by writing this book recklessly without regard to the safety/security of himself and his buddies, i think he undermined his own legacy...Its unfortunate that we had to talk about the motives of a seal team 6 member..
B003R1B9MW|5.0|Greatest movie ever. Was great all the,way through and the actors were all great. Also a true story,wich is cool.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This is a great movie for the entire family!<br /><br />We cover the entire range from >40 y/o to <5 y/o, and all of us loved the movie :-)<br /><br />The little minions are just hilarious, they're golden :-)<br /><br />Enjoy!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Talk about great and imaginative writing! Liked the way the author shifted the narrative perspectives from the \\"hero\\" to \\"heroine\\", and wrote good character descriptions.  I guessed midway through the book some of the things that happened but that did not deter me from reading;  very fun book!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book. So many twists and turns just in the first few pages. It was a very sweet and touching romance.
B000002AGM|5.0|The combination of Miles Davis and Gil Evans is unequaled. The music they and gifted sidemen created is timeless and brilliant. And it swings, rocks, grooves, and kills even after over 50 years.
B007SK8WJ6|5.0|The only thing upsetting about this show is that I now have to wait for them to make more episodes!  I've seen them all.  Extraordinary writing, acting and directing.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app all of the time to decide when to open the windows at night during the summer months.  It is great!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read all three books twice and still want more.  Can't wait for the authors next book.  I'm on my third time around.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|I like this movie.  They make the story believeable, like it actually could happen, but at the same time, its a bit superfluous.<br /><br />Epic scale, michael bay style.  Honestly, its worth a watch.  I thought it was worth owning as well.<br /><br />I also suggest checking out \\"The Day After Tommorrow\\" if you like this movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it so much, I'm sad that it is over. Thinking about reading them all again!  Darker was my favorite!
B004GGTAQE|5.0|If you only read one book on the war in the east this should be it. Nothing short of outstanding
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Really interesting book, the way it lays out data about weight loss and historic information about weight loss is really eye opening. It's not a diet book, but it can help you decide how you want to adjust what you eat if you are interested in being leaner and healthier.<br /><br />I have always attempted the reduced calorie types of diets. They worked, but very slowly, and i never kept them up. This book gave me the resolve to cut down carbs dramatically (I am rarely going above 30-50g of carbs a day) and I have dropped 20 pounds in a fairly short amount of time just by focusing on that.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I love Daft Punk so it was a no brainer to purchase this CD and it did not disappoint.  VERY COOL.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci strikes again. A new hero, Puller, and a narrative that flows smoothly and builds with each chapter. I recommend it to all fans of previous heroes and heroines like the Camel Club and Sean King and Michelle Maxwell.
B0088XXCZ6|2.0|This album was a bit disappointing after the long wait since \\"Extraordinary Machine\\". Compared to Fiona's previous albums, this seems hastily written with low quality recording. At one point in the album it sounds like someone is literally playing \\"Velcro\\", and she herself has little control over her voice.<br /><br />I am a big Fiona Apple fan, and enjoy all of her previous work. Though not horrible, this is definitely my least favorite music from Fiona. I think this one could have used a little more work.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I haven't cried so much while reading a book since I don't know when. I loved it, charming with lovely twists and turns. A journey of reconnecting with what is it to be human after trauma and life challenges have meant we disconnected.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is highly imaginative and there's so many metaphors as to how it relates to current society and how it's structured.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As my title indicates, I was hooked by the prologue. I download the kindle preview, since My brother suggested it. 10 minutes later, I owned my own copy. 20 hours later, I was done. I had to sleep and work, but it was a fitful sleep due to my desire to read, which doesnt happen often.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've seen movies made from books before and always have been disappointed. With Hunger Games it's not the case. The movie followed the book's story almost completely, there were only a few differences and some minor omissions, otherwise I felt the book was coming to life on the screen.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I will buy others like this one. The author is fasinating and colorful, while keeping me on my toes.  I will look for others in the Camel Club and from this author.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A totally different King novel.  You will be taking an amazing journey with Jake as he takes you to places and events in the past.  An easy and fast read that is truly entertaining that will make you wonder if the past can really be changed.  Also makes one wonder if changing the past is worth it.<br /><br />A Stephen King most read.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Very interesting book, kept my interest, especially since I am normally not a reader. Appreciated the sample I was able to read before purchasing this book.<br />An amazing, unbelievable true story.
B000RLHDUM|4.0|The original was an excellent movie, and was definately better acted, but this was a good remake. If you like Pierce Brosnan you will like this movie!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is amazing. Adam brown has left a legacy that only few men can follow. What a blessing to read how the Lord blessed in his darkest times and arose a warrior. Im striving to behalf the man Adam Brown. Truly God has a plan for all of us. Despite our rough beginning, with Jesus , we will always have a great end. God bless all who read it.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I expected more before watching this movie. It has a lot of loose ends and leaves you hanging. I would definitely suggest reading the book(although I have not) just because friends of mine have told me it helps tie things in when watching the movie. I also like many people do not like the concept of children killing children and I understand it is just a movie but just not my kind of movie.
B008EL4YX6|3.0|Game was challenging at first but quickly became boring. Luckily  I downloaded the game for free as the Amazon download of the day.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I enjoy being able to tell how much battery life I have based on what I am using. The temperature reading is really cool and lets me know when I should turn off my phone or put into a cooler place.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Good book but I am happy I got it on kindle rather than taking up space on my bookshelf. It's not something I would read a second time and as with the entire set, it is a romance novel for today's time. I read it out of interest and b/c of others' recommendations. It is entertaining but the first book was the best out of the trilogy. I would say to go ahead and read it but try to buy it used from amazon and/or download for kindle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you loved Gillian Flynn's other novels, \\"Sharp Objects\\" and \\"Dark Places\\", this one will not disappoint.  I would have preferred to give this book 4.5 stars, I liked it that much.  I don't want to spoil so I will keep this brief, but the plot twists and character development kept me going until the final page.  I hated to see it end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good book but would not read it again. Buy it used or get it on kindle. It did have good parts and is basically a modern day romance novel.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I started and could not stop. but apps that pester me to review them upset me and this was one such app.
B008602KQI|5.0|Quite a ride into fantastical imagination.  Quite creative.  Held me until the end.  Hope there will be more to come!
B000I3PERS|5.0|I had heard from many friends that I needed to see this movie, I only wish I had listened to them sooner. Excellent movie, one of my favorites I have ever seen.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was good and am looking forward to next one.  I do think if the viewer had not read the books, the first time watching would be hard to follow.  All in all very enoyable and exciting.
B00650SSDU|3.0|Before watching this movie I was aware that it was a romantic comedy about two people who try to have a no strings attached, purely physical relationship. that being said it's pretty easy to figure out the story line, what's going to happen to the characters in the movie and how the movie will end. Over all this was a good movie, however there was more emphasis on the romantic aspect than there was on laughs.  I expected this to be more of a comedy with a romantic undertone but I found it to be the opposite.  Still the acting was good and the characters are likeable.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The book was a great read.It was touching,sad, and thought provoking. The main character certainly knew what she wanted to do and  she did it. Ireally enjoyed this book.The book was purchased through Amazon.
B000S5AH8W|3.0|It's a good album, with some decent songs (the first two are standouts).  But the middle part (like many National albums) drags a bit.  Overall still a decent buy.
B0010Z32OA|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie with a very fun plot. The visuals are pretty good too and the acting by Robert De Niro was excellent.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I watched this movie with my wife and we laughed out loud and loved every minute.  I can't wait for our children to enjoy the film as well.  This is one you can watch over and over again!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I didnt read but my wife did and said she really liked it and it had a very interesting story
B0083GPDBO|5.0|Loved it watched it at the theater with my nephew and was so glad I could purchase it on amazon the day it came out on DVD so my nephew can press play whenever he wants
B008602KQI|1.0|I wasn't happy with the product I received. I believed I was to receive a two-disc DVD and the digital copy which, I didn't really care about. All I received was the digital copy so I had to go out and purchase the DVD. Your advertisment was misleading. It would be nice if I received credit for my purchase since I can't use it. As far as the movie itself, once I got the purchased DVD home and watched it I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I have purchased other items such as \\"The West Wing, the complete series and \\"I Lve Lucy,\\" the complete series along with other videos and some books and have always been satisfied but this purchase did not.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I loved this book, it is so easy to read and something we should all follow every day of our lives.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|Well, as I turned it off after about 20 minutes or so, it would appear, definitely, that it was just not my kind of movie.  A movie, must really grab me in the beginning or off it goes.  This one did not.
B008EQIK90|5.0|The movie was very funny. Online quality of HD was awesome. Very easy to order and very quick to load.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read Stephen King.  I forgot how much I enjoy how he can masterfully weave a story.  I wish my daughter could read it, but the language is a bit heavy at times.  Picking up another King book soon!
B005EJNAK4|5.0|While this movie was amazing, I can't help but think I've seen a movie with this idea before.  I just can't remember what it was.  However, after watching this movie I can't help but think that society as a whole today is almost living like this to a certain extent in their online lives.  Especially those that can't tear themselves away from online video games and \\"avatar\\"-based chat programs.<br /><br />If technology this advanced ever becomes available, I can imagine most of society embracing it unfortunately.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I have bought this book a total of 4 times. Kept lending it out and they never brought it back and so I'd buy it again. Love the characters, they are people we know. Anyway I now have a hard copy and just recently bought it for my Kindle to make sure I have it, cause every now and then I like to read it to just laugh. Highly recommend it. Linda
B008A1NSTG|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and also educational.  We thoroughly enjoyed it and believe is great for the entire family.
B007UXSKMU|5.0|Action packed and engaging.  The preview was very exciting and the special effects were amazing.  It really made me want to see the movie.
B000IKQK7E|3.0|In my head, this was a fast paced hysterical tribute to an earlier time with loads of laughs and many bright new stars. I recently re-watched it and it's almost painfully slow and all the funny bits are the ones I remember. There were no surprises and I wouldn't bother seeing it again.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a good app for androids to be used for a break. It also is something that most everyone can play.
1451629192|5.0|It was difficult at times, to realize this was a real story.  Not fiction, like I usually read.  Real.  This all happened to this sweet woman.  She survived it all and had the courage to share her remarkable journey with us.  I love that she wrote it herself.  No ghost writer or co-writer.  Just Jaycee pouring out the pain, confusion, and sometimes, the joy.  Giving us, her readers, the true story of Phillip and Nancy and the twisted world they lived in and forced her to live in, too.  I loved how she told a part of her story then gave us \\"Reflection\\" on that particular time.  I would imagine it was good therapy for her to tell her story then to tell us her observation of that time now that she has been away from it for awhile.  The lists she shared from her journals of her affirmations, what makes her happy, show a woman with determination, hopes, and dreams.  And they really aren't that different from what most of us feel.  It's a difficult book to read, but so worth it.  Jaycee is a remarkable woman.  I wish nothing but the best for her and her daughters.  Bravo, Jaycee.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The film Hunger Games is about a culture that condemns part of its population to poverty and forces that part to offer some of its youth into a homicidal contest (the Hunger Games) where only one individual can survive. The popularity of this film is surprising, considering the pictured varieties of mayhem visited upon the kids. Although I felt that the acting was excellent and the heroine survived, the movie left me feeling sad.
B007PYEY9M|3.0|It was watchable but I was expecting more from these guys.  Kids would still probably like it just fine though.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I could hardly put this book down.  Good character development.  Lots of twists and turns.  I was sad to have finished it!
B0088RQ4TI|2.0|The effects were cool, some interesting characters...  But what a catastrophic waste of a ton of money to make that film!  I sat there confused most of the movie, and the ending was a huge let down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Is not Shakespear, nor Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Marquez, but if you enjoyed the movie, and you know what to expect from the book you will be delighted, it was a turn pager, now I'm at work reading the third... vicious
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I really like this band to get pumped up to.  This album is likely their best yet.  Only fault I can find is that all the songs are written like rock anthem's.  It would be nice to see them add some melodic stuff to the mix or an acoustic piece to prove their chops.  Still fantastic though.
B0088WFZQG|4.0|Good show,, the weapons were awesome as were the seals...acting not so much...worth the money though. I would say rent it!
B008602KQI|5.0|Received the movie timely. We really enjoyed the movie. Just the right amount of excitement. The emotions of the movie feels very real. It's a must see!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I heard a lot about this show.  I was at Best Buy, about to buy it.  Then I checked Amazon Instant Streaming and found that they had it.  Not only was it streaming, which saves the hassle of keeping track of the DVD, but it was $10 cheaper.  Best decision if you want your own copy of GofT
B008602KQI|4.0|This was quite the movie, not as great as the novel but kept you in your seat and held ones interest.  I do not think  that I would care to live in such a society were young adults are pitted against one another.
B001VFEKOK|4.0|As much as I dislike the books & the movies, the sound tracks are great! Lol they choose great songs that I really enjoy.
0312641893|4.0|Ink and Page's Quick & Dirty Review<br /><br />Rating: 4<br /><br />The Low Down: In this take on the classic story, Cinder is an \\"adopted\\" cyborg (part human, part machine) who lives with her unhappy stepmother. Yes, there are stepsisters (one sweet, one not so much). Stepfather died from a plague called Letumosis when he was picking up Cinder in Europe. This plague has started to infect the world, and because they are not completely human, there has been a draft created to find cyborgs to test with the cures as they are developed. When Cinder's younger stepsister, Peony, is infected, her stepmother cruelly hands Cinder over to the testing team. Prince Kai's father, the Emperor, has the disease as well. After a chance meeting with Cinder, Kai invites her to accompany him to the ball that celebrates 126 years of peace in the world. But he doesn't know Cinder is a cyborg, and there are things about Cinder that she doesn't even know herself. And now the evil Lunar Queen is assembling troops to beat the Earthen while they're down...and marry Kai in the process.<br /><br />Best Thang `Bout It: I guess I am going to have to stop saying \\"I am not a huge fan of SciFi\\" as it seems that I like it more than I thought (plus I had a very narrow view of it). While this is a pretty faithful retelling of the tale, it adds in a couple of new things to the plot to keep up reader interest. After all, you don't want to already know everything that's going to happen, right? It takes place in the future, but in Japan. The mystery about Cinder's early childhood is compelling, too.<br /><br />I'm Cranky Because: So is the reason we don't know how far in the future this takes place is because it doesn't matter? I guess I will have to get used to that. Is that  SciFi thang? I was about to get ticked off at the end, but some things were explained (before the pages ran out) that needed to be said. Thank goodness. I mean, I'm all for a cliffhanger, but sometimes a gal wants a bow on it. This worked well, as this is going to be a trilogy.<br /><br />Should You?: C3PO says \\"Rather!\\" (That's a big yes).<br /><br />Cinder by Marissa Meyer was published on January 3, 2012 by Feiwell and Friends.<br /><br />Genre: Young Adult Science Fiction Romance<br />Ages: 12 and uporked well, as this is going to be a trilogy.<br /><br />Should You?: C3PO says \\"Rather!\\" (That's a big yes).<br /><br />Cinder by Marissa Meyer was published on January 3, 2012 by Feiwell and Friends.<br /><br />Genre: Young Adult Science Fiction Romance<br />Ages: 12 and up
1402238843|5.0|This is one of my favorite Georgette Heyer books, and I reread it every year or two. I love the interactions between the leading couple, and the people around them. It's witty and fun.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was a very different surprise. Held my attention and hated to put it down. Found the lawyer backround info interesting. Main character very strong and very human. Story could be disturbing to some but for most a really good read.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|The movie was a solid follow up to the original Sherlock Holmes. But it lacked spontaneity. The end of the movie (which I won't spoil) was a fun little twist. The movie's style was very very similar to the first. The writing was good and the action sequences were more explosive and spectacular. I just felt the first movie showed more depth to Sherlock Holmes than this one did and Dr. Watson was less of a factor than he should have been. Overall if you like the first one, you'll like this one as well; just not as much.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I never read the first book in the triology and still wanted to buy this one after watching the movie, it instantly caught my attention, it was well written and kept the reader's attention at all times.<br />As for the story, I felt I really wanted to buy the first book because I can see there are some details not mentioned in the movie like one character, Madge the governor's daughter who is a friend of Katnis and helps her in this second adventure and she supposedly has given Katnis her pin (in the movie she she finds it at an old woman's shop in the market)<br />Also I love how the story puts the reader in an imaginary world that is not so distant from our real world with the same kind of problems we see everywhere but sometimes ignore...the story of the tributes help to put in evidence how stupid people is and how blind ...the imposibility that sometimes we have to think about stablished rules and what surrounds us...not to see how harmfull it is to all of us.<br />It made me think about how lucky I am to be able to be reading that book comfortably from my bed and to be more conscious of what I have and what others suffer, we take all we have for granted and never pay attention to a reality...if you have something big or small it is a blessing and we should think about it as that and remember all the rest of the people who live extreme situations of hunger and suffering.<br />The book is a paralelism of what happens in the capitol (the big city where rich people live) and the other districts (which are of course like in real life way larger and more populous) where people is in deep need and the contrast, I think again, this is not far from reality...only a few more years for our reality to turn into something like the hunger games if we dont open our eyes.<br />Overall I think it is worth reading it and if you have the chance, reflect about it and debate with your children (12+)
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I think what this movie really lacked was action. The fight scenes were so-so. Didn't live up to the hype, but perhaps without the hype I would have had less expectation.<br /><br />Also the movie left a lot unexplained. I never read the book, but watched with someone who had, they were able to explain much that wasn't.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was so sad to finish the series! I loved the three books and even though the books are long, they were quick reads! I love love these books and they are most definitely a must read!
B001QFZADA|5.0|This was a wonderful book!!! I have recommended this book to several of my friends. It has been very helpful to me understanding how different people express love.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|This is one sorry movie. With all the hype you would think it would at least have a story line. No good.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Product was clear. Played with no delays or issues. Wish there was an automatic play where it could just go to the next episode without you going back to the main screen. (if there is this option, I apologize for missing it)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This was a good introduction for the other books.  Now, reading the second book it is much better.  Could be because you now know more about the series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was a romantic love story, while holding one's attention with passion and wild sexual fantasies fulfilled! An easy read, and definitely a page turner!
0525953728|5.0|Your catalog lists 21 copies of this book in stock, I am a Prime member, and you have had the order for three days, and still have not filled it. Why the delay. Every other item I have ever ordered from you has shipped and been received in two days. Why are you dragging your feet?
B00766ZW8G|5.0|I always knew that I should read this novel and at 54 years young I finally did! Not only am I amazed at Mary Shelly's imagination but those who took her novel and turned it into a play then movie. A true horror classic!
B003WJ9DYA|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it and my opinion has not changed.  It isn't just a classic good versus evil or dark versus light tale.  It's well told, filled with amazingly rich scenery and Tim Curry's creature is about the most perfect tortured, evil monster one could ask for.  It's good for kids except little kids might be frightened and it's just plain fun for the most part with great moments of humor and an uplifting ending.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. I am sorry that I am at the end of the 3 books. Great story line.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The last book in the series I think was better then book two. But not as good as book one.  I thought it could have been better.
B001RZC4VA|5.0|Not much to say.  Bought this to replace my missing CD after watching the Sandman documentary of the same name.  Holds up incredibly well, timeless really.  This is, hands down, my favorite Morphine album (the others are all tied for second).  Just an amazing and original sound.  Simply genius.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|My granddaughter received this movie along with the set of six beanie characters for her third birthday and she couldn't have been happier.  She sets up Alvin and the gang on the couch next to her and watches the movie with them.  The movie holds her attention more than most, and besides, its pretty darn cute!
B0026977EK|4.0|Woody Allen's film of two American women coming to terms with love and sex in Barcelona was fun to watch, as it teased and played with our stereotypes about Latin lovers and jealousy. Woody's done this kind of story before, and breaks no new ground here. The Catalan scenery is scrumptious, and the acting superb. I think he downplayed the amount of pain these characters actually suffered, something he has not done in other films. It's as if he wanted to walk to the cliff, but decided to pull back and go light, while enjoying the scenery.<br /><br />My only real problem was that the film had numerous interruptions while streaming it on Amazon's Prime Video. We had to stop watching and pick it up again a day later. This isn't my normal experience with Amazon Prime streaming, but it did occur this time.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Grant it, it's geared toward a younger audience but overall, I found it to be yet another way to tell the same dark story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am about half way through with this book,  but so far it is just as alluring as the first book.  I was a bit taken off guard with the ending of the first, so of course my curiousity forced me to buy the second.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The Song of Fire and Ice series is one of the best things I've read in a long time.  Book III continues with the great character and plot development of the first two volumes.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great Movie, very true to the book.  Minor changes, but doesn't distract from the story.  Great special effects. Behind the scenes is very interesting, recommend.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like the Amazon MP3 app. Its so simple and quick to get music I like. Great bargains too.I'm a happy camper.
0670022411|1.0|Sorry but this is sooo boring  so far about 80 pages in and nothing has happened I thought this was going to be an exciting fantasy but it is a dull romance.
B0073XV2W2|2.0|Read a favorable review on the book in the Wall Street Journal.  Found the book a slog to get through, disappointing in the action, a bit contrived, a relief to finish.
B008SA21N8|5.0|Suits is the very best Drama on TV. Period.  Best acting, Best writing.  Best story lines. If you are not watching Suits you are missing out.  Being able to watch past episodes through Amazon is amazing.  One Click is easy, fast and reliable.  Way to go AMAZON!
B00571F26Y|5.0|We purchased Wheat Belly a few weeks ago.  We wanted it NOW so we got the Kindle edition.  Wheat Belly really gets to the heart or should I say stomach of the matter.  It was shocking at what the government has done to the wheat.  And also shocking at how much of our food has wheat in it.  This is a must read for everyone no matter what your age.  Wheat Belly exposes the truth of our food and what we can do to change the destructive path we are all on.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Reads the books, and the movie did not disappoint. I was extremely skeptical at first, not wanting to get sucked into a fad, but the books and movie(s) are genuinely good, with great actors and superb visual effects. Definitely recommend.
B007SNFTAI|2.0|Felt the book was overrated. Dragged a lot. Was expecting a lot more. The story line took a long time to develop and there was little to anticipate. I found the book a struggle to read.
B008602KQI|3.0|Started out really slow and was hard to follow at first. I should have went to the theatre, it was cheaper than buying the dvd.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Fun but only work 1/2 the time. I spend more time trying to login and getting set up to play then I do playing the game
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Excellent!  Moves well and challenges your skills. Love that it goes from one level to another quickly and makes you want to clear the level.
B004SBX112|1.0|I am sure that this version of Angry Birds Seasons is good but I was unable to download it to my Kindle Fire.  I tried to find information on how to do this online but found it too difficult to navigate to appropiate answer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The games aren't over... The games are just starting for Katniss. President Snow is hungry again. He wants revenge. katniss doesn't want to be President Snow's pawn anymore but, without knowing, she will become the pawn in other games!!!!<br />Amazing, breath-taking second part of the trilogy. Once you start reading you can't stop.
B008XG1X18|3.0|really glad to finally have this for the Kindle Fire. works great so far. I use Pintetest to organize recipes,  &amp; it's so easy to have the Kindle on the kitchen counter while I'm cooking. However,  the app's navigation cues could be better. I think in an attempt to look streamlined &amp; minimal, they made it difficult for newbies to learn.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I purchased \\"Pollyanna\\" for my Kindle in fond remembrance of my formative years.  This book had a profound effect on my youth and attitude, growing up in the 50's and 60's.  I highly recommend this book -- I truly believe anyone can reap blessings from \\"the glad game.\\"  God bless Pollyanna.
B000FC10MU|5.0|This is my favorite Neil Gaiman book after Neverwhere.  After you read American Gods read Anansi Boys. Gaiman is brilliant.  If I could I'd lock him up and force him to produce nothing but fascinating novels.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I realy didn't know a lot about hunger games but enjoy the movie and now i am a fan,heartfelt action pack,real could happen movie
B006BAEQB2|2.0|While I usually like her books, this book became tedious for me.  I almost needed a chart to keep track of who was in and who was out and I became anxious to finish the book even though I knew how it would end.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|i bought the book on August 26 when it came out on Kindle and managed to go through 75% of it in the next 24 hours.  Nothing spectacular but it kept me going as it was almsot as good as his other books.  Then I came to the part where Reacher was shot at and from there on it was an unbearable effort to make it to the end.  In fact it took me all of 8 days to go through the last 25% of the book.  What a huge disappointment!  I hope Lee Child's next effort will have more of an international flavor as people outside the US do not give a hoot  about the BS of FBI and CIA super agents.  Or perhaps he should kill this Reacher character and introduce us to a long-lost son who is even more macho than his father.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed both the book and the flick.  I thought the book was more entertaining and informative.  The author described the scenes vividly and included much more information about the characters.  However, if the flick included all the author portrayed it would have been much longer or would have necessitated two films for one book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book. An enjoyable read with interesting characters. The conclusion felt a little rushed, but I still thought it was a fun book and an engaging story
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books and then got to see the movie at the theater. Even thou the movie didn't give the same impact as the books it was still amazing. And you don't need to read the books to enjoy the movie. My husband never read any of the books and he really enjoyed the movie and he made sure I ordered it in Blue Ray so he would watch it again.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie was better than I expected.  Most of what I heard was that it was a girl's movie.  Not true at all.<br />I cannot wait for the next release in the series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I did not understand the bad reviews I got about these books. They are a wonderful love story and I was sad it had to end at book #3
B0082FPIY8|2.0|Found it very hard to relate to this writer & her journey. A 'different' read if that's what you are after but at times I found it boring, not a good sign when you skim read multiple pages at a time.
B002EDH0FE|5.0|Did you even see the title I wrote? Couldn't be more clear!  Multidimensional characters, amazing cinematography, and just enough action for everyone to enjoy.  It is not a film for the faint of heart.
B005ZC1R6O|5.0|Soundtrack still rocks after all these years!!!!  The story is a strong argument for 'eye for an eye' justice.  Very cool all the way around.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought this was excellent book!!! Loved it!!! A very good read!!! Keep you going all the way thru!! Will recmead it to everyone!!!
B008EQIK90|4.0|I thought this was a really funny movie. The two main characters worked really well together. If your're looking to laugh, check it out.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  It explained how Jaycee felt.  It was a very sad story.  Hopefully, we learn something from Jaycee's experience.  I enjoyed reading this book.
B004T5K3OK|1.0|The app won't save the images to be reviewed or edited.  Basically the app just doesn't work....  At all.  Save your self the head ache and get a different one.<br />BTW definitely not the phone as this was installed on the galaxy s3.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Great DVD! The music is magical. Sound and video quality are very good. Wish I could get the music on a CD though.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Engaging as usual<br />Gregory provides the best historical novels currently....At least in this genre.  Enough details to stimulate the mind to see the stage and plenty of historical information to lend a better grasp of political intrigue
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Very good movie and i recommend the movie. I received the movie pretty fast and in good condition. Sherlock homes had exciting actions and comedy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was hooked on this book as soon as I started reading it. The characters were very interesting and a lot of twists.  Definitely worth reading.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A highly unpredictable mystery. Great entertainment though at times harrowing! Good wriiting that keeps the pages turning.The main characters are a couple living the good life in New York. They seemingly have \\"The Perfect Marriage\\" until the economy catches up to them. A move to the South creates a perfect setting for the twist and turns to come. I dare you to figure out how this novel resolves!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Excellent book. I enjoyed it very much and learned a vast number of things I am using every day for myself and my family
B008602KQI|3.0|I watched the movie & I liked it because it was something different.  It was somewhat of a Sci-Fi type of movie. I think it appeals more to a less mature audience. Teenagers will love it, especially if they are fans of Josh Hutcherson & Jennifer Lawrence. The movie was well done & it had it's ups & downs. I'm sure if you watch it you will enjoy it.  I don't think it's Oscar worthy but all in all it was a pretty good, different kind of movie.  It was something like the Avatar movie but not nearly as good.  I gave it 3 stars but I'm sure kids between the ages of 10 - 15 will probably give it 5 stars.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|The content is well thought out, if not a little boring. A lot of pages go by with very little happening (of interest atleast). Further that, the author takes a very lazy circuitous route to conversations. He's tries to impart the tough, gritty atmosphere that he's brought about through swearing and implying to you that the characters are exceedingly tough. However, these character traits are rarely demonstrated, just repeatedly told to you. An ok read, but not a page turner.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Very disturbing characters, not one you could identify with (hopefully). May be a good read for those under 55, or from Missouri.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great! I can't stop playing it. Even my 2yr old son loves to play. I would definately recommend this to anyone!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Grand kids and wife love it.  Me not so much.  I am not a gamer and find some of this stuff boring.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I enjoyed my first Craig Johnson read.  After watching Longmire on A&E channel, I had to start reading the Longmire book series.  The series encompasses all that I enjoy about the West and Westerns.<br />After learning more about the characters, some history, and details of Wyoming... I found that viewing the TV series again was much more interesting, knowing much more background information.  Starting the second book of the series.  Looking so forward to getting into it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks weaves a great story with this one.  A great recipe of suspense and tugging at the heart strings keeps the reader engaged.  As always, I was expecting the sweet love story but there are times when one just can't put the book down because the anticipation just will not allow. Each scene and situation leaves you feeling as though you are standing in the room next to the characters. Kudos to Sparks again. Loved it. This is definitely one of his best works and one of the better endings. Buy this book for your collection and block off some time to devote to it. You will not want to put it down.
0345803485|5.0|I loved all three books very well written. I just wish there were more books in the series. I will probably read them again!
B008K8H9C6|5.0|Great and amazing game. I purchased this app six weeks ago, and kept playing till now! It's worth every penny!
B008FTAAG2|4.0|This is my first 'In This Moment' CD.  Heard the song 'whore' on the Jason Ellis show and loved this chicks voice and had to look up who it was.  I'm a big fan of Halestorm so was glad to find another female singer who can scream melodically as well.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This second Sherlock movie was heads above the first. Very enjoyable. A true entertainment vehicle. Well written. Story easy to follow. Superb special effects. As usual Robert Downey is a treat.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down, laughed out loud, cried, and then felt sad when I was done that the journey was over. I have read everything he has written besides the Dark Tower series, and although its a departure from what I am used to, it was probably my favorite book of all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was amazing, very easy to read and it really hooks you up. I finished the entire book in one week.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This trilogy is something you don't want to put down. It's a good read and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to add some spice in their life
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game, I Use to play the windows version, but this is much more fun! and it has the extra challenge of time, you keep on playing till you score a better time than before. Exelent!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have this app installed on my samsung phone and it is great! I can have access to all of my kindle books wherever I go, which is very convenient when I cannot bring my kindle. The menus are easy to navigate, I can swipe from page to page with no issues. The thing I love most about this app is that it syncs seamlessly with both my kindle and my kindle cloud reader so I don't have to remember where I left off. If I so choose I can purchase new kindle books from my phone using my amazon account, which is also handy when I am out and about and see a title that I would like to try.
B001EPYQO6|5.0|The movie well taken and emotional carry thru out the movie and fighting was shot very good.Good to know the Troy history
B00181JGI2|5.0|I bought this movie for my collection although I had seen it many years ago. This is an excellent movie and if you are a Coen brother's fan then it is a must for your collection. If you are simply a connoisseur of great movies then this should be one that you must watch. The storyline is very entertaining and the cast and acting are both superlative. Jeff Bridges really shines as the lead character. A must see movie if ever there was one. I just marvel at the genius of the creators.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|Boring.  I kept waiting for this movie to get interesting or for something to happen.  It never did. I did watch the whole movie and I was disappointed.  The sad thing is that I will probably watch Part 2 hoping it is better.
B008602KQI|5.0|After reading all the books multiple times I was excited to hear about the movie. When I came out in March I went to go see it and I was very happy, yes they did leave out some things from the book but the movie still kept some of my favorites, I would recommend the movie to everyon.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This book was a spellbinder.  Could not put it down.  When I finished, I had to go onto the next.  Alchemy is an interesting subject.  It sent me to the dictionary.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|A little bit like the hunger games, but a GREAT read so far. I can't wait to read the last book when it comes out.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I would have liked to seen product names that are the best to purchase rather than the receipes to make them.  They're always available on line.  But the different brands of pasta for example -- one one good, other was pastey.  So I would have liked brand recommendations.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I would recommend this one to anyone looking for something that does not sound like everything being put out today.  Very refreshing!  Every song is unique and sounds great!!!!
B00355L2TU|5.0|Love this DVD - if you stick to it, the results are pretty incredible.  Even after day 1, you feel healthier, stronger and better about yourself. I switch it up with her trouble zones DVD and have been using for about a month.  My husband says he sees a clear differnce.  Most importantly, I see a clear difference.
B00136S0NE|5.0|I usually don't buy soundtracks, but since this movie was about music it plays like a regular album. I got attached to this music instantly. It is full of beauty and soul and meaning. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of good, meaningful music as well as Glen Hansard (the guy) and The Swell Season (the name of their band for which the released an album after this movie came out).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is a must-have if you own a KF...it has a voice alarm to let you know when your battery is at 50%, 20% or whatever you choose...the information presented is helpful and tells exactly how much longer you have to surf, read, or whatever-great stuff!
B000FC11A6|5.0|My son introduced me to Neal Stephenson five months ago, and I have been immersed in his novels since then. I am a self-professed nerd. Stephenson's combination of high tech, quirky civilizations, and amazing characters resonate well with me. In Cryptonomicum we have two simultaneous novels linked by a bridge -- the grandchildren/ grandparent connection.  Using the science and art of cryptographics as the baseline for technology, the novel jumps back and forth between WWII and our contemporary world.  During the War, the science of code breaking evolved at break neck speeds and was applied on the battlefield. His characters are intimately involved with theory (Asperger-type geniuses) and applied by heroic Marines in battle. Suddenly we  are swept forward 60 years as the grandchildren of the geniuses and Marine hero are brought together applying six decades of technological developments to cryptographics in a global war of commerce. The novel oscillates between WWII and today which keeps it moving quickly and very fresh.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in this novel, because I grew up with codes from WWII. My father was a radio operator on aircraft flying the Pacific. I grew up with stories about secret codes used during his over the air broadcasts. More recently, I have been personally involved investing in Southeast Asia where the contemporary characters are doing business.  So I was naturally drawn into his novel, and I was well rewarded.<br /><br />Stephenson's novels may not be  for everyone. But for those tuned to his resonating frequency, you just can't get enough of him.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good battery app shows you how much time you have watching movies, listening to music and playing apps until you battery dies.  must have app !
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The parallel  story saga keeps you hooked on the main characters continue their fight to claim the throne.  Excellent adventure,
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I thought the book was interesting. You learn new things everyday when you read!!! I guess the pain parts bother me, other than that I like the story line.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I started reading the Fifty Shades trilogy I wasn't sure what to expect.  Book one was very \\"dirty\\" but I couldn't put it down!!  Book two was even better.  Book three....wow....I finished it within three days of starting and was completely satisfied to have the series end.  Yes, I would have read five more books about them and loved it, but I didn't feel as though I had any lingering questions.  EL James added the epilogue that, for me, wrapped the whole series up and answered so many questions.  I will definitely read other books by this author!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fifty Shades of Grey disappointed me. I was expecting more than descriptions of sado maso sex. I was expecting to read a story that would capture me and the sex piece would add to it. The characters do not have any special personality trait and they repeat themselves till exhaustion. I read the book until the end only because I have a problem with leaving a book half read.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|all three of the books were great, but this one was the one I read the quickest - I just couldn't put it down!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is fantastic! It's a perfect way for me to take a short break from my schoolwork. It's always a thrilling adventure.
B008602KQI|3.0|I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE MOVIE.  I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.  I AM HOPING THAT THE OTHER MOVIE I<br />GOT FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT WON'T BE A WASTE.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|I used this to watch my highres mp4's of persona 4 the animation, on my Kindle-fire. It works perfectly fine, and the sound nickers a tiny bit, but not enough to make watching media unenjoyable. It was the only player that ran my mp4's fine on my Kindle fire. Maybe everyone got it before some major update? I don't know, but it runs fine on my kindle.
B007Y36K46|3.0|I've seen better films of this genre but I've also seen A WHOLE LOT WORSE!!! This was entertaining albeit predictable.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|These are near perfect headphones.  I would like more bass, but the sound is flat meaning it is closer to what the sound engineers intended it to sound like.  Any music that depends on exaggerated or high bass will feel lacking with these headphones.<br /><br />These need more power then more portable media players can produce.  So a headphone amp or av receiver is highly recommended. Also low bitrate audio will sound terrible.  I would not listen to anything lower then 256 kbps.  With a good recording you'll hear details that you won't have with regular headphones.<br /><br />K702 are so light, but the pads are bit harder then I like.  I have K601 and those ear pads are nice, that I don't really notice them for hrs.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was very true to the book.  Obviously, they couldn't put everything from the book in the movie, but they had everything necessary to understand what was happening.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was an easy read with a great story line.  It makes you think about the human race and how really as much as we want to live in harmony there are always those who want to rule.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was the ending didn't satisfy me.  I think because of the strength of the characters I needed a bit more oomf to the conclusion.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a way to connect on a whole new level. Looking at other individuals personal choices of interesting pictures is a way of finding  your own personal likes you may have not realized before.
B008KPDYQY|2.0|Started great, but eventually lost the thread and the plot fell apart and there wasn't much to keep it going...surprised we finished the movie, hah.
B0026KX4HS|5.0|Richly packed with classic lines, looks, and characters. Brilliant. The mark by which all others ought be measured.<br />see it see it see it
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I've been watching since it first came out and have been hooked ever since. Each character is complex and each relationship teeters on destruction at every moment. Excellent! Can't wait for season 5!!!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gone Girl was an  excellent read. The first few diary entries I found a bit tedious and confusing, however, this is only a minor complaint. Written in the style of one chapter about Nick and the next about Amy, it made for very interesting reading, keeps you wanting to know what happens next to both characters.<br /><br />Throughtout the book your feelings for both characters change from dislike to like, back again to dislike, then feeling sorry for him or her, in the end you dont know who to dislike more, Nick or Amy!!!!  Very clever writing.<br /><br />An excellent read, keeps you wanting to read on, no matter what's happening around you, just to find out what happens in the next chapter and how the story ends.....but that's the worst thing about a good book.....the end.....then you have to find another good book to follow!!!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|So, its an app that makes noise. It has a good variety of sounds. You can adjust the volume of each sound. As well as having theta settings. (Basically white noise that pulses.) All and all I found it entertaining as well as useful. I could definitely use it for meditation, relaxation, or for sleep. It does what it says and it does it well.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|There is so much emotion in the voices of the characters and the animation is top notch.  I couldn't help but to sit in awe of such a great movie.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It is just a waste of time. I gave up reading somewhere after in the middle. Someone else's (possibly the author's) sexual fantasies, bad writing, a lot of repeating, no real plot line.
B008602KQI|5.0|The mail character have so much determination to survive, for their family's sake.  When katness volunteers to join in the hunger games she did it for her family.
B003YOASY2|5.0|Tenacious D is not only hilarious, but they are amazing musicians as well.  Always fun to listen to! I highly recommend it!
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|It is a lovely movie full of magic feelings, it's beautiful,but at the end I was expecting a little bit more than just look each other and the boy just conducting the band, but is really pretty, I just don't like Robie Williams part it's so repulsive, I have to admit that he really did a good job because he make me hate him, i Think that's the point.<br />Definetly lovely
B00846REIS|4.0|I read this after I read the 50 shades trilogy and it was great reading!!  Steamy without any \\"freaky\\" (for lack of a better word !! )
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this more than the first two. Main characters dropping like flies make it a very interesting tail to read. Who is going to die next?
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Although not my favourite of the Harry Bosch titles, it's an interesting and easy read.  I'm so sad that I've read almost all of the Harry Bosch novels - Connelly:  hurry up with the next one!
B002LAM7PI|5.0|This movie has always been a family favorite. In blu-ray, it is amazing! The 3D version is just an added bonus. Perfect addition to my blu-ray library.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|All 3 books kept talking about the flare and virus and how all of a sudden they were in a maze.  It was very enjoyable to read the facts before it all started.  I really enjoyed it.
B000Q79HTC|5.0|I am not really a Matt Damon fan but he does a great job in the Bourne Series. This movie is good stand alone but at times it does have that quality where it lays alot of ground work for the next 2 films. I enjoyed it, I bought it and I watch it every other month, hope you enjoy it too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put all 3 of these books down, I was wrapped up in their world, I was so sad when it ended. You MUST read these books!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Now we are getting somewhere! Although I am not a big fan of books with sex scene after sex scene because it usually takes everything away from the story, I absolutely love Fifty Shades! With these books the sex and the story go hand in hand. Without one the other just wouldn't be right. I crave the whole angst love thing that is going on in these books and will now be on the hunt for similar books once I finish the third book in this trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The twisted love story and the fantasy lifestyle draws you in and I could not stop reading! It was full of suspense as well, this was probably my favorite of the 3.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow. This book has rendered me speechless for the moment. Now for the next book, I need 'more' right now!
B0079XPUOW|3.0|OK, this is not a difficult or enlightening read.  It reads more like a slightly expanded TV script.  Snappy dialogue, little if any character development, zippy plot with lots of not-terribly-believable action. But it is fun and worth a few hours.  Enjoyed it.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|First three books = amazing!<br /><br />This book = boring<br /><br />Love this series and will continue reading, but this installment isn't the authors best work.
B008E374PO|1.0|You know, I never thought I'd be writing a bad review for an Owl City album. Sure he gets some hate here and there; but overall, people like him. I was certainly one of those people when I first heard \\"Hello Seattle\\" on the \\"Of June\\" Ep back in the mid 2000's, I was instantly hooked! There was this surreal lucidity about his music that I loved; it kinda' took me away while I was listening to it; there was romance, there was fun, and there was imagination...most of all; there were synthesizers!<br /><br />unfortunately; the synthesizers are about all that's left.<br /><br />this album loses all of the innocent creativity and abstract imagery, both lyrically and musically; what's left is a cookie cutter pop album...I mean: just compare the lyrics to his two big hits: \\"fireflies\\" and \\"Good Time\\"<br /><br />Fireflies: \\"I'd like to make myself believe/that planet earth turns slowly/it's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep/ 'cause everything is never as it seems\\"<br /><br />Good Time: \\"Wooaoh oh it's always a good time/ Wooaoh oh it's always a good time\\"<br /><br />I mean...yeah...<br /><br />Now I too read the interview where he said he wanted to change things up, and as a fellow musician I can respect that; I get bored with my music and I don't even tour...I cant imagine touring every day and having to play the same stuff all the time; I'm sure there's a desire to change, but don't throw out what's good... I also read the interview where he said he wanted to do a \\"catchy pop song\\" (or something to that effect). Again: I can be on board with that: *A* catchy pop song...not an album full of them (most of which aren't even catchy)<br /><br />Dementia has some of the Owl City I remember...the rest of the tracks don't. I'm afraid I cant recommend this album; all of his innocent surrealism is traded in for cheap hooks and unpoetic lyrics.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was my favorite of all three because it's where we received most of the information about all that happened in the past with Mr. Grey and because its where their love story began.  I loved it!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is amazing! These kids battled over food! It was when they started killing each other that I really got into the movie. I found it exciting to watch as they slaughtered each other for the thrill and glory. I am now looking into how this can be started in real life. I think people would pay to watch!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the triology!!! Every book kept me so hooked on it that I couldn't put it down but this one in particular was really good because it ended with a happy ending.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book is refreshing after living in a country where Twilight sets the bar :/.  Great writing.  Smart- mind thrilling plot (think along the lines of De Vinchi Code with magic). And a great new spin on Vampire knowledge ;).  I'm about half way and am struggling to remain productive in life- the temptation to put everything aside and finish the book is too much!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I thought the book was very interesting. The first two I couldn't put it down. The last one I didn't read as fast.
B0085776BG|5.0|Every child need to see this beautifully told Black history that is not in the history books.  So proud to be a Black American!
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I fell in love with the first book.  The Twilight.  Then New Moon, then Eclipse and Braking Dawn. Even though these bookswere meant for young people I could relate to it.  A young and simple girl falling totally in love with the guy that every girl wanted but couln't have.  The books brought those caracther come out of those books and made them real to us.  They could stand on their own.  The stories continue and I could not get enough of the.  All of tese books are very special.  The writter took her time to work her magic and it inspired all of us.  All of the books are very special in their own way.  I was full of wonder and joy every time I read one.  This is The most special because ultimatly their love won and they would be together forever.  The fact that she was getting married and was going to consumate her love with this beautiful man(vampire) and she loved him so muchthat she was not scare of dying just to be with him, was amazing.  That is the kind of love that as women we all want to find.  A love that is worth it all.  I am in love with the writer and the characters in this book. I have 2 sets of each of the books in the Saga, 2 DVD's all the audio books and all the movies in my computer to watch whenever I want. It is the best love story ever. Love conquers all. I learned that you could love 2 people at the same time in different ways but that there is one love that holds you fast to this earth and that love is worth fighting and dying for. Some people think it is a fairy tale but we all wish that we would be fortunate to find it.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The story starts off very slow.  Not much of a story to go along with all the juicy bits that are all so similar that they become boring. I will not be buying the other two books in the series
B0045XKJBI|5.0|The best book and movie I have ever read.  I am in love with the writer and the characters in this book. I have 2 sets of each of the books in the Saga, 2 DVD's all the audio books and all the movies in my computer to watch whenever I want.  It is the best love story ever. Love conquers all.  I learned that you could love 2 people at the same time in different ways but that there is one love that holds you fast to this earth and that love is worth fighting and dying for. Some people think it is a fairy tale but we all wish that we would be fortunate to find it.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|They just don't make them like they used to.  A classic Hitchcock movie worth watching many times.  The detail and color on the Blu Ray restored version couldn't be better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent book, good story.  I would have liked the ending to last longer, see how the house turned out. I would have wanted to know more about the birth and seeing the baby for the first time. It was interesting to read from Christian's side.  This trilogy was an overall excellent reading experience.
B0086DBE62|1.0|This movie was a waste of my time and money. There were so many failed attempts at humor that it was just painful to watch. This surely isn't one of Julia Robert's best roles. Snow White was not believable as a heroine at all. I suffered through the remainder of the movie only because I paid to watch it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is great! it fills the empty time while working the graveyard shift. loved the movies and love the free game
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|This is a great movie to watch. I did not read the comics, but I was still able to enjoy the storyline and all the characters.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|The whole family loved this animated comedy! I rented it through Amazon for a family movie night and it was a hit!
B00068TJM6|5.0|Excellent watch. Very smooth chronograph. The Lume glows very bright too. And the bracelet is well made. And its heavy. Not too heavy. But it feels solid. Like u are wearing a quality watch. Also its rated to 200m. Which is amazing in a flight watch. That depth is normally reserved for diver watches. It has so many features. It does it all. I can not believe this much value can be had under $1000. If u r considering it. Take my advice. This watch is the real deal.
B003A9SW4O|5.0|A beautiful continuation to the original Phantom story, Christine finds herself face to face with her \\"Angel of Music\\" after 10 years apart. This is a beautiful recording of the London show. Although the songs differ ever so slightly from the Australian production that was recently placed on DVD & BluRay, it is still beautiful to listen to.
B0053TMP24|5.0|You don't necessarily have to be a youngster to enjoy books with a good story and not a launching pad for a lot of gratuitus sex.
B008MEM24S|5.0|\\"Where's my Perry?\\" lives up to its description.  Both a 28 year-old and a 4 year-old play it until they have drained the battery on my Kindle Fire.  I enjoy helping the 4 year-old when he gets stuck, which is not very often.  I heartily recommend, \\"Where's my Perry.\\"
B007IXWKUK|5.0|the story  line is very good. they could have eliminated some the  the sex scenes. but you understand why the guy does what he does, and show us that abuse as a child can lead to  bad adult behavior.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I'm not sure how much everything makes sense for someone who hasn't read the book, but as someone who did read the book, I thought the writers/director did a great job of choosing which elements to leave in and which to cut out. The visualization of a lot of key moments and places like the capital and the violence in the arena are top-notch. I went into this movie expecting to be a little disappointed by it, but was actually very impressed. I will be watching it again soon.
B00005RG6B|3.0|My brother passed away over two years ago and I inherited a lot of his old VHS tapes, CD's DVD's etc. Mindcrime itself was one VHS tape so I watched it and was good. I have a few Queensryche albums and I think they are really a great band overall......at least very ambitious. All of the members are great with their instruments/voices.<br /><br />I happened to catch this on the VH1 channel I believe. They came out fast pace rocking. The drummer must sleep for days after one of their concerts. The songs were good and again musicianship stellar.<br /><br />But one question? Where are the girls?? All I saw was dudes which kind of made me think that this band must be promoting more in the way of a certain sexuality.........or something? Anyway, that is their thing and maybe all the dudes at this concert thought bringing a girl along might get in the way of their rocking out.<br /><br />Headbangers in mullets and young as you can get. I bet half of them were driven to the concert by mom.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I am absolutely obsessed with castle. I love Beckett and Castle's relationship, repertoire, delicious wit. They make a great team, however it's not just those two characters I can't get enough of. Espo and Ryan are awesome as well as Martha, Laney and Alexis. They all have spark and a quality of \\"realness'' I can't wait for season 5, but I'm worried I'm going to watch all of season 4 too fast and then it'll be a slow and painful killing when I have to wait a month to watch an episode a week. Poop!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a very enjoyable game. I love playing solitaire and this game is just like playing with regular cards.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love, love, love this movie.  I've watched it 3 times since I got it.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so excited that this app finally became available for the Kindle Fire! Previously, I had only been able to view Pinterest online from my Kindle. Trying to \\"pin\\" items was sketchy at best. This app is very user friendly. Pinning is easy and the layout, very similar to the online version, is easy to view. If you love Pinterest (and don't we all?) get this app!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It would b nice if I can download it on my android I have it for my ipod and it is awesome.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Dr Seuss stories take me back to my own childhood and that of my children now my Grand-kids - as always great heartfelt stories told in an entertaining way with a rich experience for the entire family.<br /><br />Here is a link to the Amazon Store the Lorax:<br /><br />&lt;a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=The%20Lorax&linkCode=ur2&tag=eart20-20&url=search-alias%3Daps\\">The Lorax&lt;/a>
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have many books about SEALs, special operations forces, and the military in general.  This book is easily among my favorites.  Unlike many of its contemporaries, this book focuses as much on the character's vices as it does on his strengths.  Adam Brown comes across as a flawed, but lovable protagonist.  His journey to overcome his drug addiction and to eventually join the ranks of the elite SEAL Team 6 is a compelling story and, in my opinion, should be read by anyone interested in the subject.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had a lot of potential but lacked oomph. The plot was actually quite different to your typical psych thriller but needed more of the thrill to keep you hooked. The ending was a huge letdown.
034580404X|5.0|A very good read if you like these kinds of books. Some people where calling them trash it is all in what you like to read. It is not a real story so dont try to live bye it. You will not be disaapointed if you buy the series.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Many say only guys can appreciate this movie...However, it is the funniest movie ever produced in the history of the world.<br />-Reviewed by a Guy
B008EQIK90|5.0|I knew Jonah Hill and Ice cube would bring in laughs.... It was unexpected, I thought it would be another cliché movie, cheesy, some laughs but not through out the whole movie. I wound up enjoying it all. I'm looking to purchase soon.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have never purchased a Kindle book for $9.99 until this one. After reading it I purchased an autographed 1st edition Hardcover; To have and to hold, Till death do us part.
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed this immensely, can not wait for sequel. xoxo xoxo xoxo xoxo xoxo xoxo xoxo xoxo xox xoxo xoxo xoxo
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Greatest Book that I read about the war in todays war.I would tell all my fiends to read the book
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I loved that I got to watch this before it came out on DVD.  The subject of Christianity surprised me, in a good way.  I thought Brother Sam was a great example of a Believer.  I was engrossed in watching Dexter deal with spiritual issues.  I thought the ending was TERRIFIC; this confrontation was inevitable, and leaves the show wide open for an interesting Season 7.  Michael C Hall never disappoints.  I enjoyed Jennifer Carpenter's performance more this season than any previous.  If you haven't been watching Dexter, get started right away!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Love this bag. Used it as a carry on also. Very rugged, and it fullfilled my<br />every expectation. Even used to carry my tablet and all other small electronics<br />I use. A Great buy, worth the cost and built strong. I recommend it.
B002M85TF4|5.0|When I saw this i just had to have it.When i was 9-10 yrs. old I watched it with my Father and I still enjoy watching musicals. I'm looking now to order my next musical from amazon.Thank You
B008602KQI|5.0|There were some minor \\"Hollywood\\" deviations from the storyline and characters in the Hunger Games novel. But the movie version faithfully reproduced the darkness of the original story.  Very much looking forward to the movie release of Catching Fire.
B002R88G5E|5.0|This book will stay with me forever and one I will probably read again at some time, not something I normally do.<br /><br />I was told to read this book for a book club and I have to admit I wasn't really looking forward to it. My preconceived ideas about not only what I thought the book would be about but also the Afghan people and its woman was so far off base. This story is essentially about two womam, about a friendship and about how that friendship gets them through some of the most unimaginable experiences. Things that no woman anywhere in this world should have to endure. Their story touched me greatly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the way the author didn't make this a political statement but at the same time I enjoyed learning a great deal about the history of Afghanastan and its wars.<br /><br />This is my first review and I think that says a lot about how much this book affected me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. There was a big reveal halfway through the book and I was wondering what the author was going to do with the rest of the story, but it certainly didn't disappoint.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This movie could have easily been a boring re-hash of the 80's TV show but allowing Jonah Hill some artistic license really saved it from the garbage heap of forgettable re-treads.  By not taking itself too seriously and poking fun at the very fact that it is a \\"re-imagining\\", it keeps younger audiences interested and laughing as well as the older crowd that actually remembers the show.  Hill and Tatum work well together comedically, I think Tatum should drop the relationship crap that he's been involved in in the past and focus more on comedies...his lunk head, entitled jock was spot on and even a sympathetic character to Hill's sarcastic witty poser.<br /><br />I go to more movies than most and plenty without redeeming value and this is still the funniest movie I've seen this year.  Yes, even ahead of Ted, the Dictator, 5 Year Engagement, The Campaign, et al.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|My favourite book, like, ever! What else to say? Just read. And then,read again. And again. And then,start from the top.
B0037QM8YA|4.0|I thought this movie was very well done.  I expected the movie to be a lot more raw.  I had read the book and some of the material in it was very hard to absorb.  But I felt that the mother was given more of a chance of redemption in the movie, or at least she was able to present her side.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this series was great, read it faster than any before. i wish there was more! i will miss christian and anastasia...
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I enjoyed \\"Matched\\" but found \\"Crossed\\" tedious by comparison.  It just did not hold my attention.  I doubt that I will buy the third in the trilogy.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I have not seen the TV programme, preferring to read the books first. I enjoyed the first book, and found it quite engaging although a bit long. I started on the second book but the start has not grabbed me at all, and I really couldn't care less who wins what throne nor how they do it. If you like fantasy worlds based on old worlds then you'll probably enjoy these books, but I don't think I'll read the other 3, I'll just maybe watch the TV shows instead.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have never been one to sit down and read a book, my cousin recommended i purchase Fifty Shades for my Kindle.  I figured it couldnt hurt to try to pick up a new hobby, from page on i couldnt put the book down.  I felt as if everyday i had to know more about the characters in the book. Amazed how much a book can bring you back to live.  Awesome book i love it.
B002NXOQF2|2.0|Interesting beginning -- not easy to read on a casual basis -- often I was sidetracked by the numerous \\"created\\" words for rabbit language -- Perhaps I will try once again later -- many other reviewers raved about this book -- I must be missing something ..
B008M34CSI|3.0|Dazzling special effects, mediocre acting, predictable plot -- what's not to like? I didn't expect very much more than a mindless distraction and that's what I got. I don't think anyone will be taking any awards for this production, but it was mildly entertaining.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|The movie was well done, as was the acting. There were a few moans and groans from those who loved the book, but that is to be expected from any movie adaptation. Looking forward to the sequel.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|We enjoy Mark as well as the rest of the cast.  The plot line is timely and the action if satisfying.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I found this book to be a fast, easy read but the writing was definitely much better than what I've seen of other \\"teen\\" books. If you're looking for a fun break from typical, heavy reads - like I was - then this is a great book to just enjoy.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The Hunger Games surprised me because I did not think I would like it.  I have read all three volumes of the book and I am usually disappointed by movies based on a book.  The movie The Hunger Games was an exception.  The first thing that impressed me was the casting.  It was extraordinary.  It was almost as thought the parts were written for the actors who were chosen.  The actress in the lead role is an exceptionally talented young lady who I have seen on only one other movie: \\"Winter Bone\\".  She is so talanted that I will watch for movies with her in them in the future.  If you liked the book you will like the movie.  If you didn't read the book you will love the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book's characters and plot are conniving!  As a frequent reader of suspense novels I was pleasantly shocked at a few thing throughout, most times I can guess a book's outcome but Gone Girl became a gripping page turner.  It was well-written and I enjoyed the layout, great book!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I found Downton Abbey very well done and entertaining.  I'm a not real big fan of some of the British dramas but this had enough speed and good acting to hold my interest.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The first book started a little slow and I kept looking for a story line. By the time I started the second book I was totally hooked looking forward to my time alone with Mr. Grey! Almost finished with the last book and I am already worried I won't find something else to top it:)
B005MLP71Y|5.0|I watched this once and liked it.  A year later, I watched it again with my kids.  It's clean and vibrant enough to entertain them, and has enough adult humor and themes to be enjoyable to parents as well.  Highly recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughter recommended this book to me and I love it!  The story line is very exciting and keeps me glue to the page.  Excellent Book!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|every time I get any new kind of device, this is always the first app I install. I love it. and need to get to twenty words.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The quality of the product is wonderful. The item arrived on time and in great shape. I have no complaints. I would recommend it to other shoppers.
B003O86FMW|4.0|When I was told the premise of the story, I didn't think I would read it.  But, what the heck -- I'd already bought it  & it was in my Kindle.  Well, it kept me rivited!  One of the most unusual storys I have ever read.  I agree with all the hype about it.  No, I didn't see the movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very intense .I never wanted to put it down.I can understand now all the fuss. I totally would recommend this to all women and men to read
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Saw it in the theatre when it came out.  Never read the books so could not say if it followed them or not.  Loved the movie enough to want to watch it again...that is why I ordered the bluray.  Worth getting.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I wish there was a 4 1/2 star rating, because I reserve 5 stars for truly outstanding movies, and, while The Hunger Games doesn't quite warrant that, it's better than a 4.  Also, I read the book after seeing the movie and found the movie was far better.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I received package in excellent condition and well  before stated delivery dates. The movie is fun and entertaining in 3D as well as in 2D. I ordered the 3D version which I think is worth paying more to have for my own entertainment at home.
B004BGH8ZO|5.0|After reading the book I thought I'd find out if Nikki Sixx could sing. OMG!!!!  Why does Motley Crue even need Vince Neil? I was surprised by how good Nikki's singing voice is, it's one of those voices that grabs you & doesn't let go! I've already bought ( yes, BOUGHT) any other albums Sixx A.M. have out & will be buying all future albums!!
B000V6583C|5.0|Appetite for Destruction is the epitome of the Hard Rock scene that faded in the mid-'90s. The songs don't always make sense, but they're really good and will get you moving. To hell with current music- I'll take Guns 'N Roses any and every day.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The hunger gamrs was a good read. It kept me turning the pages. It was a bit sad with deaths of children but it was a very intresting book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|love it! This game is so much fun. The puzzles are tricky, and take some problem solving to figure out.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Lots of fun and challenging.  You can earn hints in case you get stuck.  I got it as a free app, but would definitely be worth the 99 cents.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|The review title says it all!  With a good portion of mystery writers you can figure out what is really going on about 3/4 of the way through the book.  Not with Michael Connelly.  He weaves an amazing plot with great character development and multiple twists that keep you guessing.  Even when I think I've got it figured out he always throws that final curve, leaving me pleased and wanting to read the next book!
B00003CXB4|1.0|When I received this DVD it was missing the discs. I paid basically for an empty case, which is extremely disappointing.
B0016CS0IK|5.0|This is a great CD! M83 has been around for a while and every song on the album is unique which makes the music refreshing to hear. As my title suggests this CD is a 'Must Have' for any true audiofile who loves good music. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this was a very great read and would recommend to all. The author is great at keeping you in suspense.  Take the time to read it. Can't wait to read more of her books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was definitely my favorite of the three.  I feel like you really get to know the characters a lot better in this one and it's such a fun read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|THE BEST kindle calculator!!! im a calculator snob...and this one is IT!!! fo sho!  plus its free... couldn't ask for anything more.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Honestly, I am only about 1/2 way through, but Lee Child knows how to keep you you interested and turning the pages. What more can you ask for?
B008Y5QTRG|5.0|This is definitely a kick ass movie that was some kick ass fun. LOVE Chloë Grace Moretz in this movie, can't wait to see her kick ass career sky rocket like a jet pack.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This  book keeps the fires of your attention burning in a thrilling continuation of a game of thrones.  Winter is coming...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved all 3 books. I read them all within a week, then bought them for my Kindle and reread them while on a trip.
B0046B3QTG|3.0|A very cute movie - not too taxing. It's fun for kids, and not excruciating for parents. Nothing earth-shattering, but no real complaints either.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This starts fast and is a book you do not want to close until you have finished.  Good read.  All his books are<br />good and this is no excetion.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have enjoyed the series of the Hunger Games. Simple fast reader with a great story line. I would recommend it for teens and adults.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|Harold Fry receives a letter from an old friend and colleague that she is in hospice. Queenie, his old friend ,does not have long to live. Harold is so touched by the letter, that he sets off by foot, to visit her, without thinking clearly about the 100 mile walk he is embarking on. When Harold places a brief call to the hospice, a Sister there suggests to him that many dying people will hang on to life until seeing those dear to them. Thus Harold continues on his walk - or pilgrimage, to see his colleague.<br /><br />Our protagonist is a 65 year old man, retired and in a stale and somewhat cold marriage. Something has gone awry with their son, but we are not privy to what that is until very close to the end of the book. As Harold walks each day , he reflects back on his childhood, marriage, how he failed his son and many other events in his life. As he walks he is joined by people from all \\" walks\\" of life. Each person affects him in different ways and helps evoke certain memories from Harold's life. These people also give him him hope and appreciation for life as they share small portions of their varied lives. Harold's world grows much broader.<br /><br />I found myself underlining many passages of wisdom as I read the book . While I did not find the book to be sentimental, I challenge anyone who reads the book not to have tears in their eyes during the last pages in the book.<br /><br />Although The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is long - listed for the Booker, I suspect it will not make the short list. That said, I found this to both the most uplifting and also heartbreaking book that I have read in a long time. I have my copy on a kindle, and I plan to pick up a paper copy so as to underline all of the passages that I so enjoyed. I also think that The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry will find a very large audience. I plan to purchase several copies to give away as gifts.<br /><br />A thoughtful , insightful, wonderful read , widely recommended.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Overall it was a good movie although my 16 year old son thought it was an awesome movie. I would watch hunger games again but I would not pay to do it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Was better than Fifty Shades.  Better writing, howeve,  I am convinced it's the same writer with a lot of help.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time!! It kept you on your seat all of the time. The beginning is tough to follow but as you get into it you will understand. It is exceptionally done well worth having.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Lets face it, these books are not everyday life, but that's why we read them. If you are reading this you hopefully read the first two so you know there's more to the books than sex. I thought the underlying story to the books was really good!
B00448SE4S|5.0|It's the best movie of the last 7 or 8 years.  Hyperkinetic, innovative, hilarious, and entertaining.  The blu-ray is absolutely loaded with bonus features, including 4 commentary tracks that are all worth your time, a trivia track, deleted scenes, alternate scenes, a making of, an hour+ trip through the pre-production, music videos featuring full length versions of a few performances, bloopers, and the \\"tv safe\\" montage of lines.  It's totally bad owl.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|While the Game of Thrones series has been my all time favorite read this book is extremely slow and unnecessary to the series. It spends most of its time focused on Cersei losing her grasp on reality and the kingdom she so desperately wants to rule. Some of the series most important characters don't even show up in this book. Unfortunately if you are reading the entire series you have to sit and force.yourself to read this book. If you are not reading the entire series do not waste your money on it.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its a great game. My entire family loves it. I have to make my kids stop playing in order to eat or get anything done.Definitely a must have app to every one.
B003YUT1QM|5.0|\\"50 feet. At least!\\" The immortal Joe Morton and Alan Ruck headline an all-star ensemble of today's hottest young stars, including Jeff Daniels and Dennis Hopper. Your heartbeat won't be able to drop below 50 beats, at least!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its nice to know exactly how much time I have left on my battery with anything I may be doing whether its wifi or just reading a book. my 2 yr old likes the bubbles haha
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Wow, what a bleak time it must have been. But Bukowski's bitter prose keeps you reading through the violence and pain. A classic.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I absolutely love that I now have Pinterest on my Fire, my only complaint is iabout 35% of yhe time it doesn't load so I have to force close...Kind of annoying.
B0014E917Y|3.0|i am sure this was great product.  However Be careful to know what you order.  This itemdid not work in our DVD players.  We were disappointed to say the least.  It was also not an easily returned product.  It came from London.  The company gave a little money back.  I opted not to return.  This experience taught me to read fine print.  I will buy American next time.
B008ASLQZW|1.0|I wanted to give this movie zero stars but you must select at least one star to submit a review.  I love Nick Cage but there are many other movies to see him in and even the ones that are not so great are better than this one.  I am taking the time to write this in hopes of saving someone else the time, pick something else...anything else to watch.
B0058YPL66|3.0|\\"Once Upon a Time\\" is ABC's latest stunt to stay afloat in a post-LOST era of television and for the most part they manage to succeed. Like \\"30 Days of Night (2007)\\" was a return to the 'vicious vampire' before the genre crashed and burned in 2008 with the \\"Twilight\\" pandemic, the years 2011 and 2012 have been rather lucrative time for the homogeneously white revisionist fairy tales (\\"[[ASIN:0312641893 Cinder]]\\" being the only real exception to the rule, but only just). Cinderella, Snow White and fairy tales in general continue to be appealing icons to try and revise as a result of how they've been permeated into the public conscious by the Walt Disney Company and for simply being the fast-food snack for feminist critique, but does this show do anything to bring them into a \\"better light\\"?<br /><br />Well, kinda.<br /><br />The idea of stranding fairy tale characters in what is known as our miserable reality (the real world) is nothing new. If you've seen \\"[[ASIN:B0000648XE The 10th Kingdom]]\\", or heck, watched Linda Hamilton in \\"[[ASIN:B000K7UBX4 Beauty and the Beast]]\\", then you've seen the concept of \\"Once Upon a Time\\". It's a modern twist on the Disney Fairy Tale trope or what the fairy tale means to people because of the aforementioned commercialization of oral tradition. The biggest advantage this series has over the aforementioned shows is the passage of time and a slightly different mindset toward \\"Girl Power\\" and the working woman. The concept of romance, however, remains blissfully stilted as always despite their attempts to equalize gender roles with the \\"strong independent woman\\" trope immortalized in Emma Swan and Snow White.<br /><br />[The series' modus operandi is to get the audience to become emotionally connected to bland characters such as Snow White, Prince Ferdinand (forever exiled on island \\"Prince Charming\\" because no one does their research) and the Evil Queen of the Snow White fairy tale. Utilizing 21st century sensibilities as seen in suchfilms like \\"[[ASIN:B005LAIHSG Snow White and the Huntsman]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0086DBE62 Mirror Mirror]]\\", Snow White isn't the passive pushover Disney has immortalized her as. Instead she's a [former] princess turned highwayman with a cynical outlook on love (progressive). Prince \\"James\\" Charming is the poor estranged twin of a dead prince who gets roped into parading as his other half when he's killed via arrogance, and the Evil Queen is no longer an age obsessed woman, but an emotionally seared one looking to get even with the ever-present source of her unhappiness: Snow White. Whoopee.<br /><br />Together the three create the backbone for the story that begins with the \\"dead\\" Snow White and the Prince come to her aid. Once awakened from sleeping death, the plot wastes no time in introduce Queen Regina and her plans to make the Prince and Snow White pay for the misery they inflicted upon her. She goes to such lengths as to curse the entirety of the fairy tale land just to get back at them, effectively stranding herself and several other fairy tale characters in the real world without memories of their lives prior.<br /><br />However, the fairy tale heroes were not without a plan; just before the curse hits the land, Snow White gives birth to a daughter, later named Emma Swan (pause for \\"see what we did there?\\" effect), and send her through a portal of sorts to the real world, officially electing her their blonde haired and blue eyed messiah of the series who will take them to the promised land.<br /><br />28 years later, Emma is a bail-bonds-hunter with a particularly jaded outlook on life until she meets a rather pushy little boy named Henry Mills. He claims to be her biological son and requests that she return to Storybooke (pause for \\"see what we did there?\\" effect x2) in order to save the inhabitants of the town from the \\"Evil Queen Regina\\" who is the mayor of the affected town. Skeptical, Emma initially goes into town to simply return him to his mother, Regina, but ends up caught up in the events of the town, effectively playing the Scully to Henry's Mulder as the boy fights to free the fairy tale characters from his mother's possessive grasp.]<br /><br />As I stated before, for the most part, \\"Once Upon a Time\\" does manage to succeed with their mission statement; it blends the fantasy with the absurdist reality of Storybooke and the fairy tale world, constantly hammering home themes such as abandonment, \\"true love\\", family and \\"reality is the nightmare, fantasy is the real world\\". The show has something of a sense of humor about its concept, never taking itself too seriously until somewhere in the middle where it forgets its humor and becomes staunchly self-important and \\"deadly serious\\" that you gotta chuckle at it. With the blessing of the Walt Disney Corporation at their command, the writers fall back on those adaptations of fairy tales more and more as the series progresses, but putting their own spin on those tales at the same time.<br /><br />The truest example is the warping of the Disneyfied version of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". The Beast is ultimately removed from the tale and replaced with Rumpelstiltskin as the love interest, Belle is portrayed by an actress who couldn't mask her accent to save her life (if she was trying to) and Gaston is turned into a rose. You could hear the fandom cry foul before the episode even aired (delicious). However, somewhere in the middle, you can tell the series was waning from the attempts to maintain its audience's attention. The story is stretched thinner and thinner with clumsy pacing, dragged out subplots and truly never goes anywhere until the final three episodes. Take a hint from \\"[[ASIN:B007MDB6Y2 Scandal]]\\" and get the point of your story or de-serialize the show, writers.<br /><br />\\"Once Upon A time\\" goes about delivering its aforementioned themes in such a heavy-handed and clumsy ways that it's hard not to roll your eyes at the screen when characters spout ham-fisted lines that sound like clumsy prose from a bad paperback romance novel, complete with anger-inflected speeches about stolen happiness and love. Snow White and Prince Charming immortalize the romantic dialog, often sounding as though they were characters stolen out of a romantic comedy without the plain-Jane and average-Joe charm of Meg Ryan's cynicism and Tom Hank's monotone magnetism. They're almost always the characters bemoaning and mulling over \\"I'LL NEVER FIND THE ONE(tm)\\" and bad luck with romance. They even go as far as trying to vilify one female character just to hammer in how \\"meant for each other\\" Snow White and Prince Charming are.<br /><br />Emma, Regina and Henry are effectively the mascots for the family drama oriented dialog and thematic element. Emma is commitment-phobe when it comes to getting close to her son who continually pushes for a relationship with her at the same time he shuns Mayor Regina (his adoptive mother) who is rightfully suspicious of the flakey Emma's intentions. It's comparable to how Chris Columbus deliver familial messages in his films \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\", \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"Home Alone\\" --- all its missing is the whimsical hand of John Williams. It's apparent the writers got so caught up in their own idea that no one paused to double check their dialog.<br /><br />Most characters that aren't the central protagonists/antagonists lend the series the potential of being better than it what tends to present itself as --- as the stories of the minor characters, barring Cinderella, are far more compelling than the stories of the \\"Charmings\\" vs. Regina vs. Rumpelstiltskin. Dominated largely by character actors, you're never distracted by painfully obvious pretty faces and spotlight, the characters shine through as troubled people and tales of woe that lend them the strength to connect with the audience on an emotional level. Sometimes.<br /><br />Raphael Sbarge for instance, forever playing the character that gets short charged for whatever reason, is particularly compelling as Jiminy Cricket and Meghan Ory portrays Red Riding Hood in confines of the ever-popular trope of the \\"Promiscuous Girl\\" with a raging werewolf curse (progressive, the lady is a predator!). The problem is that the series never bothers to focus or flesh these characters out beyond one or two episodes and little face time.<br /><br />Another problem the series has is shamelessly tying Rumpelstiltskin to almost every major event that dominates the otherwise aimless storyline. For the better part of the series, nothing happened in an episode without the presence of Rumpelstiltskin being mentioned or being the direct cause of it. It gets to the point of caricature, especially once you find out the writers reasoning for this (i.e., how Rumpelstiltskin gets his abilities). I will say, however, Robert Carlyle's performance is what keeps this character's story from falling to pieces as it would in the hands of any other actor. He takes the material and holds it up just above domesticity, distracting you from what is effectively the series' Deus ex machina.<br /><br />Likewise, Lana Parrilla's performance and portrayal of Regina Mills is another highlight of the series. She is ultimately the character with a strong enough motivation and emotionally backing within the story; you feel for her, even in the face of the manipulative and rotten things she does to almost everyone in the name of vengeance and that is the mark of a strong actress. Everyone else does a mildly serviceable job, that's really all I can say. Ginnifer Goodwin gives the standard awkward performance as Snow White, but is otherwise inoffensive. Josh Dallas and Jennifer Morrison fall on the side of neither offensive nor fantastic, but hardly anything to write home about. The show, acting wise, is literally held up by Parrilla and Carlyle.<br /><br />The representation of race or non-white peoples in the form of major characters is criminally low; the best the show wants to offer you are the Genie (Giancarlo Esposito) and the Fairy Godmother (Catherine Lough Haggquist) --- both of whom are in servitude of white characters ---- and that's it. One doesn't even survive the beginning of an episode, the other one is barely a character in his own right. His biggest \\"character\\" trait amounts to nothing but sulking in the shadows of Queen Regina, pining after her in a perpetual state of unrequited love and playing the fall man. Way to go, writers.<br /><br />The arrival of Sinqua Walls (Sir Lancelot) and Jamie Chung (Mulan) in the second season hardly heralds good news as neither seem to be slated beyond ONE or two episodes and thus the series continues to be a major disappointment on this front. Special effects in the series is glaringly awful; green screened backgrounds rise up off the sets like something you'd see in early eighties or nineties produced shows (blur included) and the sets truly come off as just that. You're never once taken out of the \\"I'm looking at set right now\\", which was one of the problems with all of the shows under the herald of Joss Whedon. Mark Snow returns to major television (if he ever left) after the cancellation of \\"Ghost Whisperer\\" to spin a delightfully annoying score full of whimsy and single guitar string plucks; outside of the title themes he composes, his music is one step away from the generic hallmark TV movie score and I'll forever wonder why he continues to get a job.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Once Upon a Time\\" isn't a bad attempt to stick it to the archaism of the Disney Fairy Tale and the genre itself, but its execution leaves much to be desired. It's not a bad show, but it hardly rises above average and more often than not it's aggravating watch primarily because of the writing, pacing and the dialog. The best that I could say is that is fun, just plain fun and doesn't amount to much else. [a 3 out of 5].
B008VBYN80|5.0|its a good game and and yea so play it and what not cause its fun and such for reasons
B006LSZECO|5.0|\\"Gone girl: a Novel\\" was a great book.  The writer kept you on the edge throughout the book.  First taking the side of the husband,then the wife, and back again.  I thought it was very uniquely written.  Very easy to read and to follow.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Having served in the Special Forces community for over 25 years I found this movie to be spot on . If your seeing this movie for the acting then you might want to not rent or buy it , the main actors are real America Heros , active duty Navy Seals . The scenes of battle and heroism are actual fact based events . If you want to see what our service members do everyday for us then watch this move and then thank a solider when you see them !.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed 50 shades darker. I grew attached to the characters in  the first book. It was enjoyable reading more about them in fifty shades darker.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this app! im so thankful  it is available on the kindle now! :) i have not had any issues so far.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|Streamed this movie from Amazon using my GoogleTV.  Worked perfectly with no glitches.  Great nostalgia - Go Flash Go!  Woo hoo!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was good, very disturbing but I liked it.  It was different.  Well written.  I would read another book from this author.
B002KEZ96Y|1.0|Horrible?  I like Jeff Bridges and expected a mature comedy.  Unfortunately you would have to be between the ages of 15-23 to enjoy this movie.  I knew I was in trouble when Lebowski said he goes by the name \\"Dude\\".  I made it through about 2/3rds of the movie and then gave up and didn't finish it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've read all the books, so after I heard they were making a movie I wondered how they would translate all the violence for a young audience. However, they did a great job of it; the violence was downplayed without losing its impact to the story and all of the characters were portrayed extremely well. Loved it!
0525953728|5.0|Owen did a brilliant job telling his inspiring story. No Easy Day gives an intriguing glimpse of events through the eyes of one of our nation's most skilled fighters. It should not be passed up.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|More than a review what can I say, it is a great song and the ability of having it in seconds through Amazon is the perfect match. Enjoy it !
B007M45PMU|4.0|I've been listening to this album for a week straight, and I love it more with each additional listen.  It reminds me of Ray Lamontagne, Snow Patrol, and The  Head and the Heart.
B006ATJXQW|1.0|I am so disappointed after reading this book.  It was a complete waste of time.  It didn't answer any of the questions I had.  Don't waste your time reading it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Sexy, intense, an interesting character study.  I liked it very much!  The author has a unique way of revealing the characters to us.  Both male and female leads in the story are exciting, intense and very powerful characters.  The action of the story is gripping.....erotic, imaginative....
B006LSZECO|1.0|Gone Girl started out with real promise, in fact a page turner. However by the middle it became a chore to read and only got worse. Neither character could elicit sympathy and the story went from intrigue to stupid. Can't believe it is a # 1 best seller but then look at the totally poorly written trashy Sades of Grey books. Read Hitch 22 or State of Wonder.
B006M6NUBC|5.0|I sure liked this movie. Plenty of action and good funny spots to cap it off. Makes me look forward to Expendables 2
B008602KQI|5.0|One of my absolute FAVORITE movies. Wonderfully done with a full cast of amazing actors who so well captured the characters. LOVE this movie! I am anxiously awaiting the next movies in the series, and I for sure will pre order the movies from amazon as well!
B008K9UZY4|1.0|it is a crapy game because it sucks and sonic jumped out of the screen and stbbed my grandma it was scary.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My husband and I loved this book! It's an easy read. We both read it in a week and had fun doing the test together. We are both being very conscience of each others Love Language and guess what? It really works :) Our marriage has always been strong but this just gives it another layer of goodness! I highly recommend this book!
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Harry Hole's greatest appeal for me is that he has no patience with the bureaucrats who are his \\"superiors.\\" He just wants to get the bad guys, but the bosses are hung up on rank and regulations. That's why I'm rooting for Harry as he disrespects the rules and risks his life to put the crooks behind bars or take them off the board entirely.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|It's not for youngsters, but it was funny. Going back and reliving high school is something i would not want to do!
B000SZHH30|5.0|Very good album one of there finest to date its never been like that holds some of the best songs including long distance calls courtesy laughs rally and much more 5/5
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was very close to the book. They did a great job covering all her internal thoughts and explaining things. Looking forward to the next one.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|the story was just dumb....I like science fiction but also have somje common sense..... the economic cost of putting a prison i9n space is just to much....
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies, and one of Russel Crowe's best. It gets me amped everytime I watch it and its very inspiring.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The novelty of these steamy books has worn off, and we are stuck with an unrealistic cast and weak story line
B00735HGQ6|5.0|From the first page, Harold Fry's endearing character involved me so profoundly in his physical and emotional journey I gobbled the book in a single sitting, poised by proxy on his knife-edge between hope and despair.<br /><br />On the surface, this is a sweet and compelling tale about love, loss, isolation and reconnection.  I also identified deeper themes: the progress of life from the first stumbling steps to power and purpose to the inevitable decline and acceptance; as well as some fascinating parables on religion/spirituality.<br /><br />Regardless of whether the author intended to express those themes, the story stands on its own: a powerful and delightful read.  Don't miss it.
B008RNGCAO|5.0|Batman NightFall is the best comic I read so far...It hooks you in as soon as you read the first two comics
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This has become one of my most favorite games on my Kindle Fire.  The bold graphics are especially nice and easy to see.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved every book in the series. I would recommend them for reading to anyone who has a sophisticated thinking process :)
B000OIZUW6|4.0|\\"Jackdaws\\" is  a good read.  I like a book with strong women that are not victims.  The book is paced well and supplies surprises, suspense with a little romance thrown in.  I would definitely recommend \\"Jackdaws.\\"
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|You can take your charge everywhere without a power .just your book ,mouse ,and your charge. And you have another rechargeable batteries.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie with lots of action and suspense. For those who have read the books you'll find the movie enjoyable as well, even though there are slight deviations. Without giving away spoilers, let me just say that it's a great movie for those of all ages and is great for a date night movie, or staying in and watching it with the kids. Overall a mainstay that you'll watch again and again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|EASY READING, WITH ALL THE NECESSARY PLOTS TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED AND NOT WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN. DEFINITELY TWO THUMBS UP!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love viewing pictures, and trying out some of these ideas. Also like passing these ideas around to friends, and family.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is a well-crafted book.  Each chapter reveals another layer of the characters, and slightly changes the direction of the story.  Several times I thought I knew where the story was headed, only to be convinced by the end of the book that I would not get it right, and I did not!  The author really gets into the voices of the characters.
B004OC07F8|5.0|Great reading, excellent and practical tools for strategic analysis, with real cases that make it much easier to understand. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00846REIS|5.0|Could not  put the book down. It was a page turner. Can not  wait for next book to come out.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is entertaining, especially if you are in your twenties or thirties. Too much sex for me, but having said that, if being in your twenties it would make sense. Not enough supstence, not sure where all this is going, to much repeat.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Great movie. Loved the pacing and cinematography! Robert Downy Jr. and Jude Law are both fantastic in these roles. Hopefully a third will be released.
B008602KQI|3.0|First I must point out that the movie was a very good portrayal of the book. The video was excellent as well as the sound. The major problem I had was that it took almost 2 minutes to load the Blu-ray and then it just stopped running and I had to restart the disk and wait 2 minutes again. Once the movie started I did not have any more issues. This problem was repeatable; if you did not select play fast enough it would lock up. The Blu-ray also did not let me jump to the main menu. I had to wait for all the pre-view stuff to finish to just get to the main menu. This is unacceptable for a disk I purchased. Overall the movie was very good I only wish the Blu-ray authoring was better.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Having experienced military life as a significant other of a soldier in the 78:8th EOD, i appreciate that this amazing account of selflessness made it in to print for the world to iread.<br /><br />There will always be nay sayers. Good thing the Lord allows us thick skin.
B00846REIS|1.0|I am finding it hard to turn the pages - it is so boring. I'm going to try again but I feel like I'm reading something written by a Jr. high girl.  Sentences full of thesaurus words. Maybe I'll come back and re-review it but only IF I can manage to complete the assignment.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Love that there are still some steamy scenes but this one is much more of a love story!! Definitely more of a plot this time. Enjoyable and ready for the third!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Initially the premise if this story seems like it would be depressing but it's really not. I think this is due to how well John green develops his characters. I felt as if I knew them personally and had a hard time forgetting them once I finished the book. John greeb's writing is so spectacular that I've continued to read additional work of his.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well written book about the love of a father for his son who is accused of<br />murder.  The victim is a friend, young boy, facing bullying and a much bigger world than he can control.  To further muddy the waters, the father<br />is a law enforcement officer, well known and liked, in a job he loves, but<br />which conflicts dangerously with fair judgment regarding his son.  The reader is treated to inside reflections of the father toward his son and his wife, who sees only her young son in danger, and the job he finds hard<br />to seperate from the family he loves.
B001NZBZAA|4.0|Great blend of old school funck and new age beats. One of the better albums I've heard in a few years.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Over all this is probably one of the best love stories I've read in a while. It is funny, erotic, and touching. Of course don't start reading unless you plan to read all three. You are guaranteed to fall in love with fifty.<br />(this book may be hazardous to your marriage! lol)
B00122BEPA|5.0|This collection has it all..Great deal and would highly recommend to long time fans or for new VH fans. These songs are now in heavy rotation.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I like the way it was written, leading me on a seesaw journey through the lives of two people.  First I was in her corner, then in his.  Then I thought they were both nutty.  Read and enjoy this very well written book. It will keep your attention.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is exactly what you want if you're a fan of the original. It's not identical to the first, in a great way, and has an even better pace than the first. The soundtrack is amazing, but you should know than already since it's Hans Zimmerman.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have a LOT of study Bibles and this one is slowly, but surely, becoming my favorite. Easy navigation and study helps with the Kindle version.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|This album is simply amazing. Pentatonix is simply a talented and amazing group. I find this album to be spectacular. I can't stop listening to it. and to think this is all done without the use of instruments. I hope there will be more from them soon.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Love them even more in concert! (they had a short run on the 2012 Rockstar Uproar Fest) Blood was the first song I have ever heard from them, and the rest of the album is just as great. It's very well done, nice mix of hard rock/metal with a shot of techno and ballads. Blood, Comanche, Whore, Adrenalize, all will get your blood flowing and your head rocking.
B008YYCUES|5.0|I love this series. This show is brilliantly made. I got into it because smallville ended, i give props to the creaters of suits because it is beautifully written.
B001V58BUY|5.0|Our kids love this movie! It is a really fun and fanciful movie. It really brings the story to life and does a nice job of following the story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wonderful whodunit that kept me on the edge of my seat!  Couldn't put it down.  Extra exciting that it was set in MO not far from where I live and mentions towns I am quite familiar with.  Also uses current economic events that are easy to identify with.  Love all her books...
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|I rented this so my son could see it. He is only ten and thought it was awesome.  The torch has been passed on.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After a rough start, personally, with book one, I found myself unable to put this one down.  She continues to expand the character and strength of Anastasia, a woman who does not retreat from her beliefs, and Christian, a character too complex to describe here.  Suffice it to say, I highly recommend this trilogy to women.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I've always loved this movie. I have it on iTunes, but I wanted it on DVD just 2 have! I love the singing definitely can't get enough!
B0081XZL4S|5.0|One of the best of the season - even though it was just on as a repeat, it doesn't get old!  Can't wait to get the whole season.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games immediately 'hooks' the viewer and does not let go!  The movie holds attention, creates anticipation, allows the viewer the rare experience of actually becoming enveloped in the characters interpersonal connections.  This movie lived up to the hype and carried each viewer through a wide berth of emotions. Would recommend this movie to all my friends and anyone who wanted to be carried to a place out of the ordinary ---- or is it so out of the ordinary!?  Loved the story line, the development of the characters and the wide range of human emotions, as well as the terrific work of all the actors, and the ancillary staff and development support teams!  This worked!!!!!! Thank you!
B006WWPI5W|5.0|This had to be one of the funniest episodes of the entire season.  Honestly, any scene with Amy is just hysterical!  Love watching this one when they are replaying so many of them over and over.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great and easy read.  I wouldn't call it fabulous literature, but the story was compelling, with twists, turns, and surprises throughout.  I absolutely could not put it down!
B008602KQI|3.0|I loved the movie, but the DVD would freeze up at several points the first part of the movie!Very disappointed in the quality.I see no scratches or nicks on it, so I don't know why it does this. All my other DVDs do great.I didn't return it for another because my printer isn't working to print out the return label.
B008602KQI|5.0|Bought this for my  pre teen daughter, love it. strong \\"female\\" role, and great story combine to  make this one of the top 10 we will  own in blue ray<br />Paul
B008JH5FZ6|4.0|Fast Action and Entertaining---Not as good as BattleShip or Hunger Games<br />Story line could have been better with some romance thrown in.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The entire series was good. Not because of the sex, but it was well written and I'm supposing that goes on in every day life than we would imagine. Just as long as no one is hurt by it and it's personal choices, sobeit!!
B008602KQI|5.0|The Action was fast, inventive and story line was better than usual for<br />this type of movie with some romance throw in. There is also a planned sequel.<br />tho there is violence-- no bad language. Get this movie asap.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Deborah Harkness had me from the very first chapter.  Diana, the reluctant witch, is like many of us.  She is hesitant to show her talents.  Her struggle to deal with her powers make her believable and likeable.  When Matthew enters her life, the sparks fly, both literally and figuratively.  I found the characters and developing plot reminding me of both 50 Shades of Grey and Twilight. For both Diana and Matthew, this story revolves around  a journey of self-discovery  Harkness makes that work and draws in readers through the very last page.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|Keeps you on your toes from beging to end. Even though he has to work with a bigiot. It adds a lot to the movie and makes it funner than all he**
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this last book of the fifty shades trilogy. My favourite will always be the first book, but this book was great. It was the perfect ending to the trilogy.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I had no idea this show was on TV until a friend recommended it. Watched the first season online while working out. Just HAD to purchase season 2 as I couldn't wait for it to show up as reruns. Love this show. Can't wait for the next season to start. Having withdrawals!
B007XF4J66|5.0|If you have desired to have this movie, but don't then DO IT.  Nothing like popcorn, a rainy night, pajamas and a Romantic Black and White Flick from back in the days when life was more living up-close-and-personal, than inter-netting online.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter on E Book story related well to the history story of England. I wanted to keep on reading to find out what was in the next chapter even though I knew the end. Anne was well portrayed as a real person who was groomed for great things. The sister relationship was real and easily related to. The brothers was a different story and sometimes difficult to follow. I will porbably follow up with the next e book The White Princess
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is an amazing sequel to the first picking up exactly where it stopped! The realationship between Ana and Christian blossom to a hight I didn't see coming but always wished they would.
0434020362|5.0|Thr first third of the book deals with how habits form and what to do to change a habit. Great information. The mid third [I'm almost through this section]is about how corporations use your purchasing habits to predict what you will buy next! It's almost scarry. Can't wait to get into the next part. I'm retired and still loving this information.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I'm currently on the second book of this series, and have to say that this is one of the best set of fantasy novels that I have read in a long time.<br /><br />A few words of warning, however, about this series so far.  First, this is a dark series that takes quite a bit patience and leeway from the reader.  The world, and story is extremely dark, with a lot of horrific violence that may put some readers off.  More importantly I don't think this series is appropriate for young adults.  As another amazon reviewer noted, this series also takes quite a bit of patience - specifically in the area of plot.  While I am mid-way through the second book - what the books are about is just beginning to manifest itself.<br /><br />If you are looking for a straight forward novel with easy to discern plot lines then this is not the series for you.  Because you may read the first book and think there is no \\"plot\\" tying everything together.<br /><br />A lot of things happen in the first novel - and they are very interesting - but how they all tie together isn't clear in the least by the end of the first novel.  But, given events from the second, things are slowly starting to coalesce into a \\"bigger\\" picture.  That being said, these are still only threads of a bigger picture that is very slow to emerge from all of the events presented so far.<br /><br />As a result, this book isn't a particularly easy read either.  What does stand out from the outset, however, is the writing and world buidling.  There are dozens of a characters, and the author is excellent at making them all feel like living breathing beings.  Even if they only appear in a few scenes.  And, there are a lot of themes (in the form of questions about big ideas) that are incorporated into the novel and characters.<br /><br />So, if you are a patient reader who is willing to pay attention to the details - vs. speed reading on cruise control - there is an awful lot in this book to make it a worthwhile read.  Highly recommended.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I was a little bored the first 15 minutes and thought I was going to hate it, but once it got going, it was awesome. Has the action, drama, love story, and a little comic relief thrown in. I read the books and will really be looking forward to the second and especially the third.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|There's a reason this game rates so highly by gamers, it is quite simply one of the best games ever created.<br /><br />It's beauty lies in its simplicity. The graphics are perfect for the game and, as a result, should run fine on older devices.<br /><br />The music is mesmerizing and it sometimes play a level just to listen to the background soundtrack.<br /><br />The game itself is very easy to learn, but, as later levels show, a PITA to master - which is exactly what a good game should be like.<br /><br />I've had both this app and the original Quell for over a year and I still rave about them.<br /><br />If you haven't got this yet and love a good brainteaser then do yourself and brain a favor and grab this. It's most definitely worth 99c, and as free? My oh my, bargain of the month!
B00846REIS|2.0|I read reviews that compared this to 50 shades. I did not find it to be comparable.  I wouldn't waste my money if I was you.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|I think I have watched this movie at least 20 times! Both Pierce and Renee are amazing characters!!<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone that like intrigue, action, and suspense...
B008602KQI|5.0|Our world has become desensitized to violence.  People would rather help an animal than their fellow human beings.  As the divide deepens between the Have's and Have-Not's, we could potentially regress to the world of \\"The Hunger Games\\". That was the compelling aspect of this movie.  I can't wait for the sequel! Well done!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. First time I'd read a book from this author. And I ordered the next book in the series before I was half way through.
B008EQIK90|5.0|I really hadn't heard a lot of great things about this movie but it was actually very funny. I would watch it again.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Heart trooping story of a family facing a time that will either bring them closer or tear their lives apart.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good read and gets your attention quickly.  Interesting story concept re diary entries vs. real life.  Ending was a let down.
B002V092B0|5.0|I found this book wonderfully informative and readable in terms of the science behind what makes our left and right brains (and indeed our whole brain) work. It was also a fascinating and deeply moving insight into the author's own experience of losing the use of her left hemisphere. I highly recommend this book to teachers, creative writers and anyone even vaguely interested in learning more about what it means to have our wonderfully complex human brain, as well as to those who suffer from or have loved ones who suffer from, the effects of a stroke.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|My husband and I have the other three series and are looking forward to seeing the fourth.  This series is great
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Wow, I have never said this before, but I will now. Quell Reflect is currently the best puzzle game that I have played on the Android OS. It is a combination of flawless design, execution, and features plenty of extras that make it stand out.<br />All of this is made even better by the exclusion of permissions and any sort of bloatware! Download it now for free or buy it later, you won't be sorry.<br />After spending mere hours with Reflect, I bought the original Quell (which while good, is not as perfect as this sequel).<br /><br />If you want to take a look at the actual review, keep reading.<br /><br />The object of Quell Reflect is to navigate a drop of water through a maze (level) and collect all the pearls scattered there. This must be done in the least amount of moves possible and doing so yields precious coins (that buy hints), which in turn help you in the later stages. There are obstacles thrown in for good measure (spikes, one way walls, teleportation rings, etc) and the levels are so well designed that solving them is actually calming.<br /><br />Quell Reflect has simple yet elegant graphics. They look like something hand painted by an actual artist, and even the level backgrounds feature falling droplets of rain over hand painted canvas. The graphics are above and beyond what I would expect from a game like this, and add to the serene, picturesque qualities of this masterpiece.<br /><br />The sound is no slouch either. Consisting of mellow tones and excellent effects that really help you unwind. Combined with the graphics and gameplay, I really found myself relaxing and enjoying my time with the game.<br /><br />Good things don't end there. There are also achievements, multiple profiles, an excellent tutorial, an awesome \\"Making Of\\" feature, and absolutely NO bloatware of any kind.<br /><br />A few reviewers mention Amazon Game Circle and bring up some issues with it, this is a concearn for Kindle Fire users only, and they can always say \\"No\\". While AGCdoes allow for a few things that I don't appreciate (IAP), the fact that it is optional in Quell Reflect, and is only a problem for KF owners - shouldn't really matter much for the rest of us.<br /><br />To sum things up: Get this game. Free, or for the measly $.99 that Fallen Tree Games charges for it. It has tremendous value and will keep you entertained for many hours.<br />Developers should be praised and rewarded for making games with no permissions, bloatware, IAP, or other issues, and if they happen to actually be fun (as is the case here) - well even better!<br /><br />Good job Fallen Tree Games. I hope to see more excellent games from you in the (near) future.
B007SSDDWE|4.0|We watched this as a family movie and enjoyed it very much.  Nothing violent, I don't like blood and guts movies, but I liked this one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Keeps you in suspense. You go back and forth not Knowing what to believe. Buy it.  You won't be dissapointed
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a page turner, i really wanted to get to the end to know how it all unfolds, so flynn did a great job at that, didn't love the ending, but worth reading.
B008M34INW|4.0|I like most of the movies Mel did, not a super original movie, but will keep you entertained for one evening. It has good action scenes and not too much drama.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|Read this book and stop fighting your hair! I've gotten so many compliments on my curls now that I've actually let them be. I dropped 1 star b/c the videos in the e-book are only available on iOS devices. I have a Kindle reader on an Android tablet. If you have an iPad or iPhone, you should be able to see everything.
B006LSZECO|3.0|a mystery-thriller that started out good, but left something to be desired at the ending.  it seemed like the author couldn't quite figure out how to punish her bad girl!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love that I can view all my boards, pin to face book, and see all of the pages you would see online.
B004TP6O8O|5.0|Listened to a bunch of Wiz over my vacation break from a buddy of mine and decided to find more of his music and came to Rolling Papers.  Great mix of electronic beats and rap, can't wait to see what he does next.
B0086DBE62|5.0|This was a really good movie. I watched it twice I liked it so much. It is cute and funny. Not a classic, but enjoyable.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I liked the plot, it kept my interest until the \\"explaination\\". I didn't really like the ending but I would still recommend this book.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wow this book makes 50 shades look like child's play. I think that this book was better written and easier to read than the shades series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is really one to read. As others have said, the end may be a bit disappointing, but the book is a really good read. The twists and turns are incredible. The main characters are both incredibly bad persons, but you get to first like one, then the other, then probably decide that none of them are any good at all. The writing is also excellent. Would highly recommend.
B008602KQI|4.0|Never read the book but was familiar with the premise. Knowing there would be sequels took some of th edge off but still kept enough of the tension to keep you interested.  Looking forward to the next  one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is such a good book. It leaves you wanting more. Mr Gray and more book!<br />I could not wait to read this at lunch on the wat to work at home.<br />I would definitely recommend this book.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Another great RUSH album !!  Ready to see them in concert come September 22nd in St. Louis !!  The dudes abide !!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies! My friend can and will agree with me. I love this movie.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|As with other Judi Picoult's books she takes a revelant topic and spins it into a novel.  The characters are interesting and she does include a bit of s surprise outcome.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed the 1st and 2nd book in this series.  After reading the third book I think the author should have wrapped up the story in two books instead of three.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This story is not your usual sappy self help find yourself one. Cheryl sets out on a solo 3 month hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. She soon finds out that she has been broken physically by the difficulties of hiking the trail;so she doesn't have the time to dwell on all of her emotional turmoil. In the end this does help to make her a stronger person emotionally and physically. Cheryl is an exceptionally gifted writer and tells a good story.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|You know that it's cheezy going in, but can appreciate the concept of the movie and its entertaining moments. The picture quality was pretty good on my phone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this book was going to be about a bunch of hype.  I eventually gave in and read this book and it is one the best books I have ever read.  I am on the 3rd and last book in the series and when I am done, I am going to reread all of them.  This book is very well written and very easy to read. It is extremely sexually explicit and will keep you wanting more.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|It was cheap, it does the job, it's a little boring (no design), but it does the trick.  A little drawing on it with markers and it'll be good as new!
B008602KQI|5.0|Our family rates this six stars, it was very awesome, great movie and exciting to watch. We really enjoyed it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator, so I downloaded this app. I love the large numbers. I like that you can keep track of your previous entry, helps reduce miscalculations.
B00355L2TU|4.0|It is really hard! The first day I did it I was sore for about 3 days. I have only been doing this for about 3 weeks and I can feel my body getting stronger. If you want to get toned up its a good dvd to buy. I can knock out 20 minutes every day instead of spending hours and throwing away money at the gym if you're a busy on the go person.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So suspenseful and so fabulous! Love Christian and Ana!!! I read all three books and am dying for more. The chemistry between the two of them is captivating.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is the best show on television , Sutter's writing is remarkable, the actors are amazing and best of all Ron Perlman makes my day  Love SOA I have all four seasons in my video collection and can't wait for season five to begin on FX on 9-11-12... I would give it 10 stars if I could
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the movie.  Very good character representations, though Gale was a bit stiff.  Loved the book even more, but that's normal.  Can't wait til the next movie hits the theaters.
B008602KQI|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie it really did live up to the book can't wait to have the entire series in my video collection
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie has it all! I was excited, sad, then happy! This is an exciting film of heroism. What would you do for your family? This is a thrilling action/adventure film. If you like action with heroism, then buy \\"The Hunger Games\\"!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book captures the history and moods of the early 1900's and WWI, the downfall of Tsarist Russia, the Bolshevik revolution and the beginnings of communism and socialism throughout Europe.  There are also hints about the rise of Hitler in the 1920's, certainly a prelude of what is to come in Follett's next book.
B002RRN952|2.0|I had actually watched his forgot about it, rented it realized I had watched it and thought very little at it.<br />Basically the series lost all momentum, in this movie.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|i was hoping for more of her interactions with her sister Jen and if she had any dealings with the Bricker family. Then once i started to really read it I realized that would have been out of place, all in all it was good book. I hadn't realized that the world of gymnastics had such a short window. although i do feel sorry for her still as she has to live in ohio.
B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed the movie in theatre, and enjoyed it again watching it with my family. Of course, having read the books first I would be somewhat critical on certain aspects of the film, but overall that adaptation of the story to the screen was captivating. Yet, it wasn't until I viewed the special features that I truly appreciated Gary Ross's work. Not too often directors create a film that they genuinely care about. I can honestly say that I like the movie for what it is and not just because Im a fan of the books.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|One of the greatest movies had to watch over and over again theres no other way to explain it it was just a great movie
B006LSZECO|2.0|This is an uneven book with way too many impossible twists.  It is not a great mystery or page turner.  Nor is it a great character piece.  There are far better books to read... skip this one.
B008XFAT7S|4.0|It was a very good and surprising movie i loved it it has everything suspense action and a surprising twist
B008602KQI|3.0|I liked it, and I'm hard to please when it comes to movies.  They must be creative.  It's the story that really counts.  Three stars for this effort.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, found it hard to put down. The ending was a little disappointing. Wish the author would have added a little more. The book seemed to just stop. But overall, I enjoyed all the books in the trilogy.
B005LAJ1HW|4.0|Boardwalk Empire is truly an exciting experience.  The stories are excellent, matched by great film shots and good writing.  Can't wait for the third season!
B006LSZECO|3.0|After reading this novel, I was almost \\"gone\\".  The story seemed endless and as the plot was unfolding it became interesting and at the same time totally unrealistic.  The ending was totally absurd.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great continuation of George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones saga. The only disappointment was that I thought it was the last book of the series, and it ends with tons of plots that need to be finished. (This would be good news if the sequels were already written and published!) If the next book is not released soon, I will have to reread all of the previous 5 books to make sure I have all the characters and their movements down pat.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|At first it was an easy read, until you get to the parts where the heroine orgasms in almost every single way the male lead acts or reacts to her. Unrealistic in many ways (26-yr old BILLIONAIRE?? who wants to solve the world hunger, extremely handsome, master in lovemaking, etc..etc...). It seems like this was written by a teen-age girl who fantasizes about the perfect man. What a waste of money... i'm skipping the next 2 books :(
B000SEGEKI|5.0|I read this book several years ago.<br />I gave five stars then and now I give it five stars.<br />A must have.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is a wonderful story about love, opression, trying to beat the system, family and community.  It is perfect for teens although I doubt one could get their 14 year old son to read it, his Daddy would.  My husband at 65 years is reading it now and loving it.<br />You need to get all three books.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What they say is true - this IS mommy porn. Trashy, yet you can't put it down. You just gotta read it to the end (all three books).
0345803485|1.0|I started ready this book on monday night and today is thursday with that being said it was hard for me to get into the book because it takes forever to get to the point.. I only made it to chapter 4 and to be honest I can't go on with it. I tryed. This book is for someone who is extreamly bored and is addicted to reading no matter what type of book it is. It was make me mad as I was reading more on with the words that was being used. Some of them I've never heard of!!! Chodos to you people who really liked this book, I just dont get how!!!!!! Im glad I did not buy it, a friend lent it to me and its going right back to her!!!!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|i love Maroon 5 and love this album. it was a great buy and i was lucky enough to get the \\"deal of the day\\".
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I read the series, more out of a sense of obligation than anything else.  Besides the sheer pornographic fulfillment, these books are horribly written crap.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This app is a lot easier to use with a large screen such as the kindle fire, and my little drawings are now cuter and more more fun to draw. However,  I rarely use this app without the notifications to let me know there is a drawing for me to respond to. I know this isn't fixable, as it runs on wifi. Just my reasoning for 3 stars.
B008M34INW|3.0|If you like Mel Gibson you should like this. I had never heard of \\"Get the Gringo\\". But being a fan of Mel Gibson I felt like I should see it.<br />  Enough action and suspense. A slightly different storyline. Criminal does crime. Goes to prison. Typical prison stay. Then gets out of  prison and gets women and lives happily ever after. With the loot that got him in prison.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|To much boom for this  book ,and to tell you the truth not one of my favorites. Read much much better book than this.
B005LAII08|3.0|I enjoyed the movie in the theater enough to want to buy a copy of the film, but I can't seem to locate a single-disc Blu-Ray edition. There seem to be a lot of movies coming out that force you to buy a multi-disc set that includes both a Blu-Ray and a DVD edition but I'm only interested in the Blu-Ray and I don't need all the extras. Perhaps the publishers are trying to force people to go streaming only by coming out with very expensive multi-disc sets? I would think a lot more single-disc Blu-ray editions would be sold, enough to generate far more revenue per sale. For this one I think I'll just wait til a much cheaper rental version is available.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|From the three books the one I liked best was the third one. The first dragged on saying the same thing on all the chapter, and I even skipped a couple of pages .. The second was  a bit better but still repeating  itself and the third was the one I liked better. Would not read this again .
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book right up to the end, but it couldn't have ended any other way, so I guess it was perfect.
B008JF8O9M|5.0|I found that Printbot was trouble free easy to use and found my printers right off using kindle Fire OS system.
B008602KQI|4.0|The DVD version of the Hunger Games is a very good presentation of the first novel in the trilogy.  It provides the background and history of the story in a coherent fashion.<br />The acting in the film is excellent.  This film contains many instances of violence but it is handled in a brisk and not too graphic manner, making it appropriate for younger viewers as well as adults.  It can be used as family entertainment that provides a stepping stone to discussion of social issues and politics with young people.<br />The second DVD in the set is full of extras that have not been viewed as yet, but am looking forward to viewing this further perspective on the making of the film and adapting the novel to film.
B008602KQI|2.0|The movie was well made and the acting was great. If you were a fan of the books I'm sure that you would have loved this movie. I did not read the books and was considering not watching this since I knew the storyline. Well I came very close to turning it off. I found the story very very disturbing and hard to watch. It actualy bothered me to think about how popular this story was and that people brought their children to the theater to see it. Call me old fashioned or over protective, but there is no way I would have let my children see this. Bottom line is this is about children being forced to kill other children and I do not call that entertainment. I gave this video to my best friend and she felt the same way. We both agreed that we do not want to see the sequals. This is my personal opinion so if you are hating on me I really don't give a crap. I know a ton of people who loved the books and the movie, but again I found it very disturbing.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|You know it's going to be bad when you know the reply to almost every line or situation. The script was totally predictable formula and sounds like it was written by a 18 year old video store clerk. \\"Dude, I've watched like every SciFi video in this store, like, you know, 5 million times! I can write a way-cool script!\\" This is the result.<br /><br />The rendering of the aliens and alien armor was the best part of the movie. Apart from that, why did they make this POS? The plot holes, story idiocracies - way too many to list.  Hmm. A ship's window can withstand re-entry, submersion to hundreds of feet, mini-meteorite strikes - you name it, but a 50 cal goes right through? Er, no.  A mothballed battleship gets underway in an hour or so, with tons (literally) of explosives and rounds? Really? REALLY?! A ship that REQUIRES a crew of hundreds to operate, magically works with a couple of dozen people, most of whom can hardly walk.<br /><br />If you watch this, you'll find yourself hitting the FF button through the first 25 minutes (total waste of time, terrible and pointless back-story), plus on and off throughout the movie.  I'll guess you'll skip over 50% of the movie. That's the great part of BlueRay - 4x and you can still see the picture.<br /><br />\\"Acting\\" - this is what passes for acting? Wow. Remember the lawsuits and outcry over the SciFi channel airing a movie called \\"American Battleship\\" - a total rip-off of this movie, by a company that makes it's living ripping off other movies. Guess what? \\"American Battleship\\" - the no-name, lousy movie with no-name actors is better than this abomination.<br /><br />Two stars for the aliens. They should have cut all the game-related battleship B.S., trashed the stupid and pointless \\"hunt\\" and made it about the aliens and their armor.  But then again, the one time there was an opportunity to have a great scene, the alien got his butt kicked by a guy with two fake legs. Riiiight. A suit that bounces .223's like a windshield deflects mosquitoes, shrugs of .45 rounds like so much rain off a boulder can get taken out by a bare knuckled buy with no legs.deflects mosquitoes, shrugs of .45 rounds like so much rain off a boulder can get taken out by a bare knuckled buy with no legs.
B005PK553C|5.0|Thought I would try just the first episode - got the rest of the season and watched it in 2 days!  CREEPY story and movie angles! Loved, loved, loved it and can't wait for Season 2!
B005IQZB14|3.0|Cheryl Strayed is a complex person and she was able to look back at a troubling time in her life and put it in perspective when combined with her rash decision to hike the Pacific Coast Trail. I've hiked in the Sierra and am amazed at her novice start to such a trying journey. Well, she found out fast. However, it was hard for me to like her reckless lifestyle and I'm not sure if I'd like her if I met her now. However, she is a talented writer and she kept me engaged for the whole book.
B0079NQZLE|2.0|It's an ok movie. It wasn't worth what i paid for it. It's a better purchase at $5 than $10.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This series really keeps you hooked - book after book - you finish one and NEED to get the next.  The characters are great..... the evolve nicely.....<br />The book really connects with today's day and age and today's technology; the main character views on the society mesh with everything today and it makes the story all the more real and able to be identified with.<br />There is sexual content in this book - its not a Young Adult novel - technically - however - unfortunately - it really is if you really want to just admitt that most young adults these days literally talk and think like this main character in regards to relationships and sex.<br />The sexual content is very tasteful, the author NEVER goes too far and it always seemed like just enough to make it believable... I was never left rolling my eyes, or feeling uncomfortable.<br />I recommend this series to fantasy lovers who like some good twists in turns .... but isnt a sappy romance and the focus of the book isnt ALL about star crossed lovers - even though - once you read all the books - looking back it is a bit of a star crossed lovers scenario..... great book(s). :-)
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Validates everything I believe to be true about the Japanese philosophy on work and living a fulfilling life. Very well done and truly inspiring.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter was just a good read.  As usual Phillipa Gregory captured the<br />flavor and unique customs and morals of a most interesting age.  She developed the characters<br />pretty well, and wrapped up all the loose ends at the end.
B004FOA84A|4.0|It only took about an hour to finish this game, but it was fun! A casual, Myst-like \\"myst-ery\\" game.<br /><br />Most of the puzzles are clever and enjoyable, just not very challenging.  They are largely solved in one step (see clue in one area, use it to solve puzzle in a different area).  A few are true head-scratchers that take a little longer and require multiple steps (multiple items and trips back-and-forth between rooms).<br /><br />The interface isn't a smooth as the \\"Lost City\\" game from the same makers - the \\"back\\" function is just an arrow.  There's no \\"journal\\" function, so you'll have to write down your own clues unless your memory is photographic!  Otherwise, the sound and visuals are quite pleasing.<br /><br />The game is completely family-friendly - nothing occult or suggestive here!  My elementary-age children were able to get through it with some prompting from me, and have played it repeatedly since.  Overall, a good purchase.
B003RV43X4|1.0|Lilliputian.  Best thing about it is some of the special effects, makeup and costumes.  It was popular enough, I guess, that they actually made a sequel.
B002P7BKVO|5.0|The Friendship Algorithm is the best episode of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" ever. It's funny and goofy but great! I love this show.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I read this book on the advice of a co-worker.  After finishing the book we had both came to the same conclusion regarding the little boy, the Romance ending however, was a surprise.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire runs right from the Hunger Games and continues in a spin until the end  The awesome ending of \\"There is no District 12\\" just made me want to read it again and then go to \\"MockingJay!
B001DCN178|5.0|I like having all of the input/output options, especially midi in/out and mic.  Also like the weight and ability to use either batteries or an adapter. Wish I had known the adapter in addition to being 9v also needed to be 200mA per owner's manual.
B006O5YI7G|5.0|Blackthorn is a well made Western set in 1927 Bolivia.  An aging Butch Cassidy yearns to return to the United States, but his plans are thrown asunder by a chance encounter with a Spanish-born thief.  This movie has a superb cast and the cinematography/locations are superb and well worth the price of admission.  I'm a Western fan and strongly recommend this movie.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This was the first book I read by Kate Morton and I enjoyed the well-visualized characters and the story from two different perspectives.  In some ways it evoked a bit of Rebecca, with the mystery of the 3 old ladies and the house.
B000ID37T0|5.0|Of course I will have to admit before I do my review that I am a huge fan of Al Pacino and his acting.  The movie itself was excellent.  I had not seen this one and I was not disappointed.  He plays a retired officer and that is all I will say so I won't spoil the story but definitely is a \\"Must See\\" for sure!  I give this one a thumbs up!  Loved the ending!
1439102430|4.0|Keeps your interest. Characters are good and I like the author's writing style. If you like the TV series Bones you will like this book!
B000I9YX06|4.0|Loved this movie!  Would have given it five stars if there had been a little romance thrown in.  It was very good, even so.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|The movie really Hits home with the things that our armed forces deal with in the line of duty. Great movie
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Never read the books but think I might enjoy them. Would probably enjoy the<br />Audio Books even better.<br /><br />  I liked the movie but I'm sure it's not for every taste. It was for mine though<br />and I give it four stars for it's entertainment value and leading actress.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The first three books in this series were five star, but books four and five were very disjointed, hard to keep track of, and left me very confused (and not looking for more).<br />Five just seemed like the author was in a rush to finish the story line. (which was not done) at least that is my perception.
B002OUTIOI|2.0|I really liked his previous album, but this one is not nearly as good. Kind of flat, not fun, mostly.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|This was a good movie. It was well casted and acted. The feel of everything reminded me of Rome back in its glory days. An entertaining movie worth checking out. I watched it on my PS3 through the Amazon video service and got HD the whole time. Was worth the rental.
B001O05X2U|4.0|I'd only heard one song from Mika before, very recently. Liked it, so listened to a few snippets and bought it. It's got a couple of irritating tunes, like \\"Lollipop,\\" but overall like it very much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great book. Couldn't put it down.I couldn't wait to download book 2. It would be a great book for couples to read together. Especially if you need to add a little spark to things.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|It has a lot of sounds and melodies to choose from. The problem I had with it is the sleep timer doesn't close the app and some of the sounds you can hear a loop in it.
B007X15GRQ|2.0|The plot barely moved along. After being very excited for this movie I ended up falling asleep before the end.
B008602KQI|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in years.<br />Great job of selecting actresses and actors.<br />They did a superb job in a superb movie.
1416550550|4.0|Very slow and confusing start.  Took too long to get familiar with characters.  Last few chapters in book made sense of a lot of loose details in text.
B008602KQI|4.0|THG movie was a very good adaptation of the book (I've \\"read\\", but have not read the book series myself). It was reasonably well \\"acted\\" and had good and suspenseful action scenes but unlike the original \\"Star Wars\\" movie THG didn't leave me \\"chomping at the bit\\" to see the next movie; if I didn't already know there were sequels to the book and movie series I would have been reasonably content with the ending. I would really rate it 3 1/2 stars if that was a \\"choice\\".
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|My granddaughter insisted we get this book.<br />What a smart young teenager.<br /><br />The author is awesome, and anytime I can read a book and cry, laugh, cringe and get goosebumps and jump up and down, well, its a great book.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" opened my mind, heart and soul.<br /><br />I expect no less from a good book. Expectations met.
B008M36ER0|5.0|Mel Gibson is over the top great in this movie.  Lots of action, good gritty story and just plain fun!
B006LSZECO|3.0|What a strange book.  I finished it, but just shook my head when I got to the end.<br />Would not recommend this!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Great app...and it's FREE!  Over 50 news stories every day covering Top Stores, U.S. and Canada, Technology, Features & Analysis,Busines, and Science and Environment. It was recommended to my by school teacher friends.  If you want a little bit of everything in your daily news, this is the app for you.  Enjoy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app.  I am addicted to pinterest and this is the best app for it I've found. Very easy to use :)
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Wow! This show is awesome, its everything I could have asked for from a TV series. It is more like a long movie that never looses your interest.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good read! Can't wait until the next one :) if you liked 50 shades, you will find this one to be more realistic!  Gideon is every woman's fantasy!
B001EBV0NU|5.0|You can't go wrong with Tim Burton.  This is a mindless fun-filled flick.  Total camp. Well filmed.  Good acting.  And good special effects for 1997.  And for those of you who don't remember,  this movie is based on bubble gum trading cards of the '60's, so it's kind of nostalgic too.  Enjoy.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|If you enjoy fantasy you will enjoy this book.  The story writing pulls you into a world that keeps you enthralled and entertained.  I loved it.  Thank you Mr. Rothfuss, please finish part 3 ASAP!  Can't wait.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book was a blatant ripoff of Fifty Shades! I can't believe that the author got away with this.  I would not recommend this to anyone and have removed it from my Kindle which is a first for me!
B007WPM4P0|3.0|I couldn't wait for this DVD to end.  It was confusing and slow.  I almost went to sleep.  Whoever wrote this needs to \\"keep it simple\\".
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This would have to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I have no objection to reading details of sexual acts but this book is so poorly written.<br />The style of writing is what I would expect of an immature teenager. In addition I found the storyline quite unconvincing.<br />It's popularity could only be because of the fact that after the first few pages it is constantly full of sex and the poor prose is not noticed.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I can't figure out what in the heck is going on.  I've never had this much trouble getting into a story, but I am going to keep going and hope for the best!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I cannot say enough about AWOLNATION!  I truly love every song on the CD and wish there were more songs actually.  Aaron Bruno is an amazing, super-talented artist and he has found a great group of guys to round out the CD.  From what I have seen of their live shows on youtube, they give an outstanding performance every time.  May they continue their success for years to come!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love this app, but I had to search the internet to find an older version because the updated one has some kind of bug that prevents it from opening (thus rendering the app useless!) I'm sure it will be great once they fix this!
B001O7SVL8|5.0|I don't know if this album was hurt by having such a \\"viral\\" (this would have been it, had such a term been used back then) video.  While Take On Me was great, it doomed a-ha to one-hit-wonder status, despite it being an excellent album.  To me, this is one of the quintessential '80's albums and if you had to pick 5-albums (and only 5), this should be included.  If you do the math, that means that if you have more than 5 records from that decade, you need to buy this one - if you don't already own it!  :)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The puzzles are challenging, the music is charming, thank you!  I will certainly enjoy it to the end! And I look forward to more!
B000JCSPG0|3.0|Amazon makes it easy to watch a great movie like star gate .... Good pick for any sifi lover !! the quality depends on your tv setup but its still a easy deal then going out and buying the dvd or blueray, when you just wanna grab a movie for dinner with out leaving the house sit back order a pizza and watch Star Gate ...
B003QP4BJM|5.0|This is a balanced and thoughtful discussion of what the difference is between logical optimism and \\"pie in the sky\\" wishful thinking. This is what Liberals and Conservatives argue about constantly. The Conservative wants everyone to believe that all people who run a business are nice guys and do the right thing...so who needs any regulations??? Sadly, there are far too many people who believe this no matter how many times we see it fail. On the Liberal side, there has been a bias that indicates all change is good and all efforts to help the working class, poor, and elderly are good. Again, the Obama Administration has brought home millions after they cracked down on waste and fraud in Medicare and other Federal Programs. You know that these folks didn't just start with the Obama Administration but under the Bush Administration... The IRRATIONAL Optimist...all people from Defense Contractors to Wall Street to rulers in Iraq & Afghanistan were ASSUMED to be wonderful and honest.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you start reading, you wont be able to put it down. I read all 3 books in 16 days. I wrk full time & part time school, still managed to read them all. I'm not a big reader, but this book got my attention.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|Good premise for a \\"Hunger Games\\" like trilogy. I like the characters and it had enough twists to make you want to read the next book. With a Katniss-like heroine, I think this trilogy will be a winner. Looking forward to book 3!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A very good read.  I really liked the way the book was written as I could hardly put it down but the ending was a bit of a letdown.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|In Game of Thrones, I could hardly keep track of the 200 characters in the book. It felt epic in only for the cast. (Amongst other things!) In Feast for Crows, I am finding that the characters are scarce, at least those that seam to matter. Am only half way through though and love this series.<br />Great read for all 4 so far! Highly recommended!
B0058W74UY|1.0|It didn't work.  I can't play any videos of any kind with it.  I was very unhappy! There needs to be some changes or something with the product.
B003QS9TKU|3.0|I did not purchase this product, and I am wondering if my account has been compromised.I cannot find any other way to communicate this concern.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn weaves an exceptional love/hate mystery. This novel is one you cannot predict....it keeps you running back for more.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|a little harder, more aspects added to this version vs the original quell, including multiple droplets, and poison dro
B003SFZ3FG|5.0|I very frankly bought this just so I could see Geddy Lee (and his daughter)in a cameo in the final scene. I love \\"all things Geddy\\", and apparently his daughter adored The Gilmore Girls which is why this came to be. While watching the episode, though, I saw what a great time I'd been missing in not watching The Gilmore Girls from its first episode to its last.  Wonderful cast, great humor and drama, the whole gamut. I plan to order the whole series.  (Oh, and Geddy and his little girl were great, despite not saying a sound...lol)
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Not a book I would reccommend to any of my adult friends. Seems to be written for a teenage readership, perhaps. Boring !
B008FH6SUQ|2.0|this is not the Chris Brown lyrics I am use too.. I really don't appreciate it I wanted and expected better from him.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Well-written book that is entertaining and informative. As a mom of a toddler, I was quite interested in seeing how another culture views and wrangles toddlers. Some ideas I've now borrowed in my own parenting, while others were just interested to read about but not for me. I definitely recommend this book.
B003B02O3C|5.0|A suspenceful plot that could easily happen in real life. Filled with numorous surprises and an apropriate conclusion. A you get to the later chapters; it gets harder and harder to put it down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I flew through this book.  It was fun and exciting with very unexpected twists and turns.....things aren't always what they seem.  Although it may not be an ending you'd really hope for, it is a realistic one.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this movie. I went and saw it twice in theatre and then a few more times when i recieved it in the mail. It didnt follow the book as well, but they did in the main parts that actually meant something,
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie will keep you riveted to your seat. It moves right along and never make you think \\"get on with it\\". At 2 hours and 22 minutes you will wonder how the time went so fast. If there was a way to rate this movie at 10 stars I would do it. Enjoy the movie and may the odds be ever in your favor.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy were the first Suzanne Collins books I have read.  I couldn't put them down.  I was impressed enough that I went looking for another Collins series.
B003D5FFY0|5.0|Worth the purchase for getting well loved songs by Paul.  It's a great add to you collection if you don't want to buy all of his cd's.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is an excellent film on just how bad civilizations can become if allowed! Children forced to kill other children in order to not only survive, but to improve their districts food allowances for the sake of entertaining the Capitol and it's citizens. Bucking the system can bring reprisals in unusual forms as the next movie in the series will demonstrate. It is a very good story on why \\"not\\" to allow a government to control every aspect of their citizens lives!
B00241YHMU|5.0|I watched The Curious Life of Benjamin Button for the fourth time last weekend. I think the story line is so interesting and very romantic.  I wonder what it would be like to live life backward as Benjamin Button did.<br />I do wish that Brad Pitt had gotten more awards for this movie. The actors were perfect in their roles and to watch things unfold thoughout Benjamin's life made me feel as if I was right there living it with him.  This movie has to be watched right from the beginning.  The beginning holds the whole purpose for Benjamin's journey to begin.<br /><br />I am sure I will watch this a few more times before my time is up.  I highly recommend anyone to get lost in this movie and I am sure you will feel the same.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great read! This psychological thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat for hours; I couldn't put it down.  Amy is fascinating, brillant and scary.  Now I know what to do when my next husband cheats on me.
0525953728|5.0|I read No Easy Day in one gulp and found it exciting, factual, and intentionally non-political.  Having had a series of clearances well beyond Top Secret I also looked for violations of classification standards and found none.  While the book does not attack Obama neither does it praise him and by a simple statement of the thrilling facts shows the regime pronouncements to be false.  This fine book, which is excellently written, beautifully illustrated, and printed better than other military books I have read, is a real buy at the price and will end up on my permanent book shelves.  As a 21 year veteran of two wars I found the book an inspiration and hope it reaches a wide audience where it will spark a similar response in most readers.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I was a great app! I just didn't have use for it.  It told me everything in details concerning the battery status, but for me it was just using necessary space that I later needed.  If I have to download again I would.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|After hearing so much about this show, I have to say, it more than lived up to it's hype. I blew through this 1st season in just 2 weeks. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and was not short by any means of plot twists and turns. The characters were excellently developed, and all actors played their parts superbly. I would give it 10 stars if I could!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is simply amazing...proactive and leaves you wanting more. Definetly would recommend this series to any and everyone! It is a must read!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the books and this movie matched it extremely well. I was very happy to see the details that they went into, it was really a great movie. Very impressed!
B008KWHM6U|5.0|I was very much anticipating the release of Two Door Cinema Clubs second album, Beacon, as I must say that Tourist History was one of my favorite albums of the past few years.<br /><br />At first listen I was a little let down as only one song, Sun, really grabbed me. Each song in Tourist History blew me away and I could not stop listening to that album and I still get butterflies with each listen.<br /><br />The more I listened to Beacon the more I enjoyed it; I'm actually listening to it right now. The Beacon album is much more civilized and grown up that Tourist History, it seems a bit less fun, however it is very upbeat and catchy and with each listen I like it more and more. Sun, is by far the best song on the album in my opinion, it is slower, but the beat is memorizing and I love the lyrics, however the entire album is amazing and while it did not blow me away at first listen, it greatly has grown on me.<br /><br />Honestly this is the best album I have listened to this year! Recommended.
B007SGM084|4.0|Let me start by saying that a few friends were reading it and recommending the series as a \\"fun\\" read.  When I found out what it was about, I was curious that these particular friends would be reading this kind of series LOL.  Honestly, I didn't want to start a series that would distract me from other, more \\"important\\" things AND I didn't need to be getting all hot and bothered by a book.<br /><br />Well, I was bored one afternoon and bought Book One.  The writing is horrible, the characters are predictable and unbelievable, and I cringed every time Ana says the two words \\"down there.\\"  I felt like I was reading a teenager's version of an XXX rated love story.  The sex scenes are very descriptive and yet the author can't seem to use the words \\"penis\\" or \\"vagina\\"... or similar words to describe the human anatomy.<br /><br />So I finish book one, and I go on and on about how bad it was to one of my friends who read the series (while she laughs)... and within a week I have purchased book two. Book one had left me hanging and I HAD to know what happened.  Sigh.  I am now in the middle of book three. It gets better. The plot gets a bit more complex and I found myself actually getting interested in the character development.  Ok, and the sex scenes are bad either.<br /><br />I am giving it 4 stars for this reason:  It is entertaining and a great distraction, which we all need once in a while.  And honestly, my husband really appreciated that I was getting all hot and bothered by a book :) Nuff said.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Why can't intelligent women who read non-fiction all the time enjoy a little romance???  I don't normally read this kind of stuff, but I seriously enjoyed the books.  They were great summer reading that got my mind off of work, and other stresses.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|Campy and downright fun, with an amazing soundtrack by Queen. Even if you don't care for this genre, it would be worth watching Flash Gordon just for the music!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use and nice simple layout. I love how the calculator fills the entire screen on my kindle fire it's nice to plug in quick numbers to figure out some of my budgets, paychecks, grocery costs, etc... overall great app.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very enjoyable game.  Simple to learn, but progressively more challenging as the array dimensions get larger. As the dimensions increase, the resolution decreases, so it does become a bit more difficult to trace the route with your finger without overlapping other lines.  Suggestion to the authors: allow the user to put it in a mode so that while writing one line you can't overwrite another line.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Generally good book, but it did not live up the hype for me.  Felt sort of like a Presumed Innocent light.  That said, good summer read.
B000SEFM6K|4.0|I lost myself in the portrayal of the era...the details were beautifully written, although more wordy than I am used to reading. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, there would be another twist to throw the reader off. Reading this book was like a lovely mental vacation. I was sorry to see it end!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|In the words of Christian grey... we aim to please..,.... and pleased I sure was!! I have not read a book since highschool 15 years ago...... but once I started this trilogy.... I was hooked!
B003R50FRI|5.0|This book is a great read. The stories about the guys life are unbelievable and I would defiantly read it again. Once I began reading the book I had to finish it in one go.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|Ichi is a fun little puzzle game i like the art design its simple and colorful the controls are so simple my dog could play. my only issuse is that its kinda big for a puzzle game 23mb if you want to spend a buck on a good game that isnt angry birds buy this.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I love Blackberry Smoke & this cd is amazing - its a must buy!  There isn't a song on here that I don't love.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This was the first Harry Bosch book I had read. I enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down. I have already purchased my second Harry Bosch book and can't wait to get started.
