B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 5 year old daughter was psyched to get this.  This is a great movie and she watches it over and over.  Great environmental message for kids!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game (Timple Run) is a really amazing game to play<br />this game was made for anybodeyanybody (kids,adults,old folks,etc.)<br />this game was made to have fun and that's what it does.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|*I can't believe it's over :(<br /><br />*Still debating over 4 or 5 stars.<br /><br />*After reading some reviews I was afraid about the ending, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't as open-ended as I thought it was going to be, *SPOILERS* there were answers and there were some questions left without a response but I think what Maggie Stiefvater was trying to do here was leave it up to the reader, like she said her intention was to end with hope and I think that was a good conclusion for Sam and Grace and their world.*SPOILERS*<br /><br />*I love the series: Maggie's writing, the cover art, the songs (in the books and the ones out of it), the trailers, the art, the poems, how the characters grew up so much, the love between Sam and Grace, the friendship between all of them (!!!), the sense of family some characters had...and how it was all beautiful and sad, but happy at the same time. One of my favorites, definitely.
B009JBZH54|1.0|So I recieved the batman trilogy on blu-ray and I went to play the batman begins disc and it would not play. I tried it in a blu-ray player and my ps3 with firmware updates and got nothing. Not only does it not play but it shuts off and freezes the entire blu ray player, and on the ps3 you get to the home screen and there is no play button. Soooo disappointing !!!! even though I'm in the minority with this opinion I like batman begins as much as dark knight rises. So I say to what ever company is pumping these out without quality control, PLEASE STOP!!! it is not just me this has happened to 2 other people I know.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the greatest book ever! I laughed the entire time. Well, I'll red another book and see you again recruits:)
1400067820|5.0|Taleb's [[ASIN:0812979184 The Black Swan]] is still his best book. Personally, I like the author's way of throwing punches around. He misses quite often, but it is highly entertaining. And sometimes he hits quite well. I have just read a couple of dumbed down books written with a lot of input from editors and the like (see my reviews). So it is liberating to read a book that actually has a reader who writes what he wants to write.<br /><br />The idea of anti-fragility is of course not so novel as the author claims. Nevertheless, I think he is describing something important. As long as you like his style (full of himself, lots of trivia), most professionals should read this book, not just financial markets types. You can build an anti-fragile career, anti-fragile government, etc.<br /><br />The book is not Taleb's most important, but it is still worth five stars
1582701709|5.0|My highest rating. Probably one of the nicest quality books as far as construction and talent go. The message is well expressed by Rhonda and her listed mastermind group is a dream team.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Goes places, let's you find your way home.  And roughs up your passive groupthink along the way.  As it should be.
1612931227|5.0|A definite read for us Law of Attraction fans. I have been searching this particular subject matter for some time and this is the best find as yet. I rate it up there with 'Think and Grow Rich', if you catch my drift. I would suggest to begining seekers to read your way up to this one. Try 'The Secret'  first.  by Rhonda Byrne<br />One thing though, I would advise to read it through quickly the first time then comfy into it and draw out it's message thoughtfully next.
B007S3S8HO|1.0|The game does not follow the video game that your child may be use to.  The catapult<br />does not launch the birds like in the video game.<br /><br />To launch the angry bird is equivalent to squeezing a pimple on your face and waiting for it to pop.  Save your money and buy an Angry bird toy that you kids will enjoy.<br /><br />Lucky we brought other Angry Bird toys for my son so when he found how crummy the toy was he just played with the other Angry Birds toy.
078322740X|5.0|I would go on an adventure walk from Manhattan to Boston to see this movie. Fun for the whole family. Someday it will be given the credit it deserves.
B000VK99Z6|3.0|Pretty mindless and not as funny as some of Simon Pegg's other movies -- not a bad movie, just not a must see....
B0094BB4TW|1.0|won't show many posts, only about ten, and it's very annoying for those who don't sit on Facebook all day. hope . it gets fixed soon our I'm deleting it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is a really fun to play you can earn coins to buy gadgets, jetpacks, and clothes.In jetpack joyride you try not to die from lasers and misles.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I absolutely love playing this game! it is especially fun because I get to draw stick people and other items. it almost resembles Scribblenauts, which I enjoy. Hope his helps!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is great you get to make allies or attack enemies! The only bad thing about the is that you have to be online to play the game. I like how a player must build their city to build up their army.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is the best free app out there.The only problem is when you turn on your kindle it pops up.<br /><br />I STRONGLY recommend this app
B005IFWXWU|4.0|Had some difficulty getting it to download but husband was excited to receive for Christmas. Great CD. Relaxing, easy listening.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|I had a great picture! The movie was also great! Got to love them half naked men! I recommend this movie for sure.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We took the graandson to see it at the movies. The wife had to take him to the restroom at the end.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I have two of these, works like a charm to connect my iPad to my first generation Bose sound dock.
B000000OS2|5.0|just as described. The wife loved it. She had never herd this one before. Glad I bought it for her
6305428042|5.0|I adore this movie. It is hilarious.  Even better some of it was filmed in Salem, a love of mine.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|This is a a very well set up and easy to use media player. Just having a problem getting it to play my videos. The videos are on an sd card and the titles appear under the video section but when I click to play them it's just a black screen and sounds all scratchy?? I'm trying to play them on a Coby mid 9740-8. Any advise would be very helpful, as this is for my 4 year old son who is growing very impatient with me because I can't figure it out!!!<br />Thanks in advance,<br />Stacie
B000641D2Y|5.0|I love this movie. A bonus is that Tim Curry is in it. I am a New Yorker so enjoy seeing my city on screen. The pigeon lady always makes me cry!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't stop playing!!! I beat more and more of my friends high scores per hour!!! If you love long addictive games this is one you will never forget
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite book series!!!! I love it. It's one of the best books yet!!!(: k hope she comes out with more books for this series
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have btd4 and I LOVE it. my brother tells me about btd5 and I'm like :D. buy it its worth it!!
B005HSL626|3.0|Because I am unable to retrieve the highiest level that I finished off at and I don't like thar other than that it is a good game
B0096DZKZC|1.0|so, I got the free version and let me tell you,  it was great. I wanted to buy the full version since it was only 99&cent; compared to its origanal price. I tried to down load it,  wouldn't. I think its really stupid. this isn't my first time trying to down load it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|An excellent read.  My youngest grandchild can't wait to get her hands on this book.  Just as entertaining as the Twilight series.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|lot of fun. I would have given 5 stars but it would be nice to change tiles also, instead of just the backgrounds.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|The descriptions in this book are beyond belief, the author makes you feel like you are right there the entire time. The characters are mesmerizing and the government is aggravating. This is the best book I have ever read and highly recommend it to others.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|This was a very good story. The more I read it, the more I wanted to read it. Having Haller on the &#34;other side of the aisle&#34; was an interesting twist.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It was INTERESTING to read the reviews for this movie. Some gave poor reviews saying it it was not anywhere as good as the book. I did not read the book, but that makes no sense to me. I know a good movie when I see one. The movie should be reviewed on it's own merit. Some argued the racial issues were overblown or nonexistent. I know that argument is invalid. So what is it about this movie that provokes so much defensiveness and need to dissect and inject personal perspective?<br />This is a movie. It is a work of fiction (despite the fact that there are issues that were/are real). I found this movie to be compelling and the acting, by all actors for the most part, to be very good to EXCELLENT. I SAY BRAVO. JOB WELL DONE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie for it's presentation, content, and, especially, it's superb performances.
B0041KVV8U|5.0|This record was bought as a gift and my granddaughter loved it.  Would recommend it to anyone who loves the beatles.  the sound was awesome
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I gave this movie 4 stars--the same as Skyfall, even though I thought Skyfall is better. My favorite is CASINO ROYALE. None the less, DANIEL CRAIG is absolutely great as JAMES BOND. He is FERFECT in that role. So far, I recommend all the James Bond movies DANIEL CRAIG has done. I RECOMMEND this movie. SEE THEM ALL.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of the most pleasant animated movies I have seen.  It is funny and the characters so much fun to watch, I think it will become a classic.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I will just say, CASINO ROYALE is my favorite and it set the standard. BUT, this movie was great. I liked this movie better than Quantum of Solace. DANIEL CRAIG IS GREAT, and I think SAM MENDES did a VERY good job (director). Goodbye JUDY DENCH. YOU'RE A FABULOUS ACTRESS. Now I'm looking forward to the next one. Of course, I TOTALLY RECOMMEND this movie.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|was good game....didn't take very long to finish it but worth the money. like the puzzles and mini games some were kind of easy and they didn't take to much time.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|ummm 99&cent; for google? dies anyone else see a problemo here I mean really, anyone else it does not make sends to me
B0091LS07E|5.0|I have always loved Alicia Keys and his album continues my love for her music.  Great voice, great music, what more can I say.  I have recommended this album to all my friends that I think would enjoy the smoothness and energy that Alica produces.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|Yup another yougster movie. Sure Guy gets the Girl. Classic Movie script and  if like this type Movie uncommingly well done.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I bought this album for Red and 22. I don't care a ton for the other songs but then again, I've never been a diehard Swifter. Happy with my purchase.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Only because of the Actors who take a long time to get together but they do great nad not to bad script. Twenties examined.  Both are dating others but are drawn to each other at the End. Can't believe it is Okay movie I bought,. Top Notch script and they acted very well.
B007EDYN36|4.0|I thought this was a well done book. Kept my interest throughout. The only thing that kind of turned me off is that so many of these books have to talk about or end on a note about religion and how they have changed or their views on it. I am agnostic so I have a natural bent in not having any interest in that topic. But I have to respect the fact it is important to him telling his journey. It was very believeable book and definitely changed my opinion on Gene Simmons. It is very consistent with what you watch on this reality show and hear from other sources. It is quite disappointing that money drives people to such horrible behavior. Good book.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Best Christmas  Movie Ever made. Prefer the 2nd  Disc in Black and White as when child I saw it first in Black and White. However colorized version works great also. If you are collecting Chrsistmas DVDS this one is one you want to collect.
B009JZOOKO|5.0|Awesome movie very interesting story and the ability to purchase it right on my ps3 made the experience that much better.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Darn DVDS are not well  made as this DVD  does not play well on my DVD player. Too bad a this is an excellent top notch movie about  people not from Earth but lok like Earthlings. Very powerful though. Top Notch Excellent Movie
B009JBWOU0|4.0|So yeah, I got this baby and proceeded to drool all over it! But when I opened it some little flyer fell out saying, \\"hey heres a code for you to save some extra cash on some memorabilia we'll be selling with the box set: dark knight ULTIMATE COLLECTORS EDITION in 2013!!!\\" I was like, \\"what the h*ll!? Then why'd I buy THIS if you're just gonna Rerelease the same movies but with a ton of tasty special features?! So what im sayin is, if you like extras as much as me and every other red blooded American then DON'T buy this! Get the blu-rays or wait til they come out with the good stuff in a couple months. Movies are cool though.
B000AARKO4|5.0|Boy is this well done from Historical Standpoint during the Crusades. Currently in Christain Hands. But Chrsitains were arguing  leading to there downful. Great actors well written love History and this is well done.mone of my favorite movies. Strongly recommend .
B000BVMAJ2|4.0|The order arrived early and was exactly as advertised....our 16 month old grandson will find it in his stocking when our family gathers for Christmas.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|The  President is captured and a cool rescue is planned getting on plane of terrorists. A classic Movie First movie like this. Again if you like Classics here is one to get.
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|My daughter had asked for good family movies that mom and dad could enjoy along with the children.  Based on true story; good environmental lesson
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the person could not of been more pleased.  This item arrives in its' own box so you all items are secured and you can just warp up the box. It is a limited edition and carries the series number. I was very impressed.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Amazing; one of a kind!  This was my gift to me! Have enjoyed Leonard Cohen for years and this is just a great compilation of his work.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read. Exciting and suspenseful. Makes you want to keep reading. Very hard to put down. Can't wait to see if more will come.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is a simple tale, bursting with pearls of wisdom. My copy is well highlighted. Paulo Coelho is like Aesop evolved!
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I rented this movie expecting a movie that would provide a few good laughs.  The language and vulgarity in this movie was just beyond what any reasonable movie watcher would expect...a few off-color jokes would have been fine, but it was one after the other after the other...the movie was not worth renting for any reason.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love it!!! I like that I can draw my own person and play with him :) oh and I love his little buddy!!! His name is squishy!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This movie was one of the best I'd seen in a while. Kudos to all involved...exciting, unique, and fun to watch!
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|This was just too over-the-top, and reminded me of the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, where the romantic female turns out to be the villain.  Except the Bond film was fun to watch, and this one just draaaaagggged.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|This movie was ok but nothing particularly worth the rental fee.  And I really hate that I have to have a certain amount of words to post this review. :(
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I was doubtful about purchasing this movie but I am glad I did.  Fantastic!  Getting an inside look at these individuals made me more appreciative of their music.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Stands the test of time. Still enjoyed this movie immensely: it's ranks right up there with WHEN HARRY MET SALLY as the quintessential holiday chick flick.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I got bored. Maybe all of the angry bird games are just not for me. I'd rather play the Sims app.
0783114893|5.0|Love adding to my Rutger Haur collection.He is terrific. (Why I need to leave ten more words is beyond me)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I could literally play this FOREVER! I hope I never run out of free Flow Free levels. I will have a sad.
B00004WLVK|3.0|It's very close to the book but the movie could have added more. A younger girl than Sue Lyon would have been better even though she did a great job. Slow.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am kind of obsessed with this site & app. Beware, this app will suck you in! Just wish I could pin stuff from other sites on my kindle......
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Love this new CD.  Heavy Evanescence fan.  The behind the scenes was a nice feature, fell like you get to know the band a bit better and understand where the music comes from.<br /><br />You will enjoy this.<br /><br />Tom
B005HSL626|1.0|I could never get it to open. Major sad face. I really wanted to chop fruit up. Boooo the end.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This was a really good movie.  All the characters have a great personality and it was interesting seeing how they all interacted together.  Some better than others but in the end they all pulled together for the greater good.  I really enoyed seeing this movie and hope they continue with this series.<br /><br />Tom
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The app works great. I like the format. Very easy to use and I use it daily. I would recommend to others.
B003TJR2HS|3.0|This works.... most of the time.  I am using this with an ihome stereo.  It's so tall that when I hook up my iPhone it tilts backward.  And usually when it's hooked up, I get an error saying charging is not supported with this device.  If I disconnect and reconnect, and wiggle it like crazy it works as it is supposed to. But it isn't as simple and plugging it in and having it work.  I spent more hoping it would work without problems, and it's just okay.  I may just take my case off every time I want to dock my phone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Free and very entertaning kids love it. Great graphics and lots of fun for all ages. I would recommed to everyone
1400052173|5.0|- Everyone should read this book. It was a revelation to me on  many levels, from the socio-economics of the region and its poor people, the origins of Johns Hopkins University, and the importance of the HeLa cell line to medical research. ..
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Purchased to see if that was the issue with my Kindle Fire recharging.  Always need an additional cord around anyway.
B005R32L66|3.0|I was glad to have this available for my mini tablet, but the video is slow and jumpy. Also would like to get more volume control.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and really like it so i wanted to put it on my Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD
B0094BB4TW|1.0|As others have said the news feed only shows 10 posts - why is this not fixed yet?please fix it as soon as possible.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and really like it so i wanted to put it on my Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD
B004U52VPS|5.0|Great deal.  Order was not placed correctly  at first.  Ordered 2 but fulfillment packed one box.  Replacement was shipped promptly
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and really like it so i wanted to put it on my Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD
B000VSYDRM|5.0|I enjoy historical or period type movies so this was right up my alley. The fact that I study serial killers as a hobby made this movie even better.<br />Enjoy!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and really like it so i wanted to put it on my Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD
B000YHG72E|2.0|What do ya expect.  This is a decent family movie for mindless holiday entertainment. But don't expect anything more or you'll be disappointed.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and really like it so i wanted to put it on my Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD
B000GL1BHO|5.0|Bought this and another one for my grandson for his birthday. He loves them! Very high quality, durable and so much less expensive than that other brand the starts with S and ends with chleich ;-). I highly recommend these and will definitely buy them again.
B0059H05VI|5.0|I really like Adam Levine after watching him on The Voice.  I have listened to Maroon 5 in the past and thought I would add to my Kindle,
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I never expected to get as fine a protective cover for my Kindle as this item proved to be.  It is sturdy, well made with quality stitching and good fabric and cushioning. The Kindle fits perfectly inside and makes taking it while on the go a added convenience.  Money well spent!
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and really like it so i wanted to put it on my Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Probably my new favorite book! I am now on the third book but I do not find it as great as the first 2 but I would definitely read them again!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is great fun, and since each level is relatively short, it is good for short breaks.  I'm going to . Keep this one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I tried many readers, kindle is great for PDFs and many other file types besides the Kindle books, and makes reading of Kindle purchases easy and I trust the security. Also love the sync between devices. Thanks Amazon. Works good on Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1
B00021HBGS|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old son. He loves bath time and I am sure this will make bathtime much more fun. Great quality!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Sodoku fans need this app. Works good on my Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1. Good graphics, stable program and low permissions, good response on two devices, I like the interface and program. Get it.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I'm young so this does not appeal to me. I guest it's nice to have a big word and by able to look up that word. But young people need better books. Learning is important. Better books with ideas and fantasies equal happy kids. Some  say kids don't need ideas or we'll change the world. Sometimes change is good. Let us have our ideas! It is our own brain you know.
B004SYP5WC|3.0|Works good on Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1, I found no real need for this program and it was not intuitive for me to set up or use. Uninstalled.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I enjoy reading the Kindle virsion very much. The option of dictionary, literally at the fingertip, is making it easy to comprehend, especially for an ESL reader.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This is like the video game where you dance with the falling blocks telling you which foot to put forward, each with increasing speed and accuracy required. You'll have fun with this if you already know a little piano and know the songs. There's an option to buy more songs, but there's enough bundled with the program to keep you entertained. Plays well on my Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1, good graphics and program response. Worth a buck for sure.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I think it is the best social network out there period. I love connecting with family and friends from other states and country's.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Works good on Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1, in my opinion- there's no other moon phase program that can touch this. Got it on the faotd, but worth the money if I was looking for a solution to monitoring moon phases for say...fishing excursions! Nice live desktop wallpaper too. I'll seasonally change my wallpaper, but always come back to this one.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Bane was awesome in this movie and the movie was great overall. A lot of action and story line was good.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|I love the customizations and ability to set desktop widget. I'm sure I'm not using all the features- but it's a great program for if you communicate with people from different time zones on a regular basis. I have enough things to keep track of without wondering if I'm calling another time zone at the right time. Works good on Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A credible story and told with humour. An excellent read. Even if you're not a sci-fi fan this would still appeal
B006O3MU96|4.0|Works good on Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1. The drawback to this kind of game is there are no levels to achieve. You either succeed and the level becomes progressivelly harder, or you die and start over. Either way, when you die, you start over. All you can do is try to achieve exceeding your last high score. If you want to knock off 5 minutes of time (or keep your child occupied for the same period of time), this is the game. Just a feeling, I can't bring myself to give it that 5th star.
B006O3MU96|1.0|My son asked me to delete immediately.  Thank goodness it was free or I would be really angry.  Oh well.
B009H442DG|1.0|I love Grease, and I'm OK with a cheesy Christmas album here and there, so I thought this would be a fun one to add to the collection just for kicks.  This is just bad.  I didn't want any of the tracks playing when my family was here (and they're OK with my cheesy Christmas tunes), and I haven't played any of them since the first listen.  Either save your $10 or send it directly to one of the charities supported by the album sales.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I am a big fan of mini series style TV.  This show is great because each story line lasts only one season.  Every year you get introduced to new characters, and it doesn't turn into &#34;Lost&#34; where you can tell they were dragging out 26 episodes into 100.  If you enjoy the 2nd season, go back and watch the first.  A+.
1451695195|5.0|bought for my wife. she has thouroughly enjoyed the book. has many interesting facts and observations. will order others similar.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Love. Such a classic story, reading on kindle was seamless and easy. Would recommend this book on this device to people.
1551113082|4.0|Ordered this book for a university course.  Slightly bent corners, but what do you expect for a used book.  Arrived earlier than expected and was a great bargain compared to the campus bookstore.
B001TXQN44|5.0|Just good solid music from some pioneers. It is great to hear a little Country mixed in to the sound. Within a year or so of this album's release that would have been distained.
0547848412|5.0|Life of pi was an amazingly written book. It taught me about how to look at life. I would definatly reccommend it.
B005EY2XFC|4.0|The Crow is one of those movies for me that I've always heard a lot about (and often heard the sad story about Brandon Lee dying during filming because of an accident) but never saw. After wanting to see The Crow for years, I finally got it as a gift for Christmas and saw it.<br /><br />As a first time viewing, I rather enjoyed the movie. It wasn't a case where I felt the movie dragged on or it was getting hard to get through certain parts of the movie.<br /><br />The Crow deals with the murder of guitarist Eric Draven and his soon-to-be wife (literally, they were getting married the next day) by a gang of thugs around Halloween. One year later, Eric is brought back by the titular Crow so that he can avenge his fiance's and his own murders.<br /><br />Watching the movie, I could tell it was the kind of movie that you just know was never destined for blockbuster status but rather being a cult classic. Not a bad thing, of course, just an observation.<br /><br />I thought Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, and Rochelle Davis (who sadly seems only did two movies, fifteen years apart) all did a great job throughout the movie. The head villain in this also did a good job at exuding and being a slimy evil crime boss.<br /><br />Having never seen the movie on VHS or DVD, I can't compare but I thought the blu-ray quality looked nice.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's worth a viewing if you've never seen it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed with any of the Big Bang Theory Seasons I have purchased.  I would recommend the Fifth Season to everyone who enjoys this series.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|movie was nice but not to be viewed on the big screen. ending is a little bit lame. but the ted is cute though
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Could not put it down.  A lot more action than the first book.  The only problem I had was keeping the characters straight, so many of them.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|they will kick your ass. i love the knife fight of jason and this guy from undisputed movie. forgot his name lol though he is good. \\"boyka boyka boyka\\"
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is my favorite of all the five series and that is saying a lot since I have loved all of them.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|movie was nice but not to be viewed on the big screen. ending is a little bit lame. thoug new k does look like the old k
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Bought it as a gift for a friend and they loved it, action packed sequel. Make sure you grab the set.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Loved reading this, illustrations were very detailed, the story is great, and I love the characters. Onto the next!! If you like the series on AMC you'll love these!
1439153663|5.0|Wasn't sure what to make of this book but absolutely loved it! Stayed up late two nights in a row to finish. Reminded me a little of the style of The Help. Just an interesting story that I would recommend.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|DVD sent promptly, good movie. Don't know why i have to respond with a minimum number of words - and you wonder why people do not respond.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The ending was probably the best part, but you had to read the first 400 pages to get to it
B00AMBH70S|2.0|lame story, bad script, not even enough 'action'.... not a movie that you'll remember even a minute after it ends. waste of a good night, good wine, and good money.
B000N2HBSO|1.0|I would have purchased this book, but my policy is not to buy anything which is not loanable. It's outrageous to pay the same for ebooks as paperbacks, and not being able to loan them.
0792164903|5.0|Johnny  Depp is great in this  film...<br />But ,if  it  kept true to the  short  story.... Icabod crane would have been a teacher<br />NOt a  police  Constiable
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed the program for its quality of acting and storytelling. It gives a representatiion of the period portrayed in a most entertaining manner.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|I once  recorded  the ninth gate on a vHS tape....but the  visual quality  was  bad..<br />So i had to  replace it  with the dvd<br />I love the additional  material on the Dvd.... which  helpos me to understand the movie
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|My grandson liked the challenge as it took him longer than usual to put together.  The final product matched the box cover
B005LAIISA|5.0|This movie kept my attention from begining to end.  The beginning was hilarious!  I wonder what they are going to come up with next.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is awsome - I can listen to local radio (talk and music) and it comes in clear as a bell.
B0076DELIG|5.0|M.C. Never fails to entertain and keep me guessing all the way.  The only downfall Harry (the main character) is getting long in the tooth. i would like a novel about his vietnam experince start to finish
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was looking for a cool book to read during my vacations and decided to give it a try. I had only seen the trailler for movie 1 and didn't get hooked up, as I had seen before, seing the trailer of Game of Thrones TV series, which had made want to read the books. When I started reading Hunger Games #1 I got pleasantly surprised. The book greeps you from the first page and you just can't stop reading. Katniss caracter is very well described. Even though we can see the errors in her assumptions we empathize with her in her and totally understands her conclusions and feelings. The action is also thrilling. It is very realistic but not to the point to make us disgusted or sick with the description. I highly recomend it.
B006IYG5HE|2.0|I have read his most current titles. They were exciting and page turners. I was all geared uo for another exciting Harry Hole Mystery.<br />Instead i got a bad translation of a long boring essay skip this and go with snowman
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I saw previews for the movie, and wanted to see it.  When it came out on video, I eagerly rented.  It was a great story, and the actors are amazing.  Love Dame Judy!
0743270754|5.0|If you want to know more about the life of Lincoln, this is the one book you must read.  Awesome!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! Great cold night movie to curl up to!  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This game is great would have given it 5 stars but to pay to play not good. should update this game and take this out. will rate it higher then.
1419705849|5.0|It gave more laughs than you could imagine. (Just an inside joke between me and my grandson) I'm sure he's going to love it as much as the other Wimpy Kids books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Trust me folks.....it's that good!  I NEVER thought I would like a book better than Slammed or POR, but she did it again :)  It truly amazes me how engrossed I can be in her books!  I loved how much longer this book was because I was seriously dreading getting to the end.  Words just cannot express how good this book is, I could not put it down!  I read until 2 in the morning and finally went to sleep only to dream of Holder and Sky all night, then got up to finish it!  This is my favorite book ever!  Great job Colleen :)
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|This was a great movie.  My grandson loved it!  The quality of the picture was excellent!<br />We watched it at least 3 times!
B005VPRET4|5.0|Granddaughter says it's a 5-star. Lots of fun. Christmas gift and has already spent hours playing with it. Very colorful & entertaining.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My daughter loves her rainforest friends.  The music is wonderful and the toys are so bright in color and cute to look at.  Even visiting babies love staring at it and are fascinated by it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|it was long and drawn out and no one even attempted to solve amy's whole story even though it  was so absurb.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've had this app installed on my kindle for a couple days now, and like everyone else, use it multiple times a day! So far I haven't had any problems and it works just like the app on my phone! Works great!
B007L6VR12|1.0|I didn't care for the movie and will turn around and sell it.  Sorry I wasted my money on it
B006LSZECO|4.0|A look inside a relationship that seemingly is perfect... The undercurrent runs more than deep. As the true nature of both parties unfolds so too does the plot. An interesting read.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Fun Movie and have watched it numerous times already.  Julia Roberts is great as the wicked stepmother and the customers were fun.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|great movie! I got this because my father who had NO part in helping my mother raise me, acts like hes a saint, so I seen this movie and thought, my &#34;father&#34; needs a wake up call and needs to see what a real father is like. this movie is amazing. i love it.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|This is a great movie for all ages. Also, the blu-ray quality is excellent on this movie. A must have for every kid's collection.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Smooth game play and fun animation from this great little game. The cars move along pretty fast so try and keep up! I dislike tilt steering so under the options I changed it to right and left buttons for steering.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great site.  Been pinning like crazy and enjoying it.  Would recommed it especially  to crafters and gardeners, and any home decorators.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|It's a good app to pass the time. Simple mindless entertainment. Great for waiting on an appointment, or to get better at chess.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins got me hooked right from the start and I hung on till the very end. It began as a weird premise but it was more than just winning the game, it was how to win it that mattered.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the best DIARY of a wimpy kid I ever read. I recommend this book to everyone in the world. Keep making more books please!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I didn't want the story to end. I loved the characters - weird but caring and smart. I guess I'll just have to read them all again.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I've read this series before, and I love it! Great books, all of them!! This one especially because it draws you in
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Perfect reading for the Christmas Season. I practically know all the words by heart. God Bless Us Everyone! Bah! Humbug.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was good enough and there were some funny parts. But I think as Greg is getting older, he's making even stupider decisions
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once hooked on the Hunger Games, this is a must read. It did not disappoint after the incredible First Book.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is very fun. I give it all 5 stars. I think this is good for long car trips, and it is very addictive. And yes, it is free for kindle now.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Add to my collection of Harry Potter DVDs. I can watch the series over and over and never get tired of the clever challenges they overcome.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot it gets across what the most important things in life. I fully recommend this book for all ages.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|As a fan of the TV show &#34;Castle&#34; I loved reading more of their adventures. There are some differences from the TV show but they were not critical to the overall Castle and Beckett story.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|I didn't think the selections or the arrangements were as strong as her first album.  Somewhere Over the Rainbow is painfully slow.
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci is always good and this one did not disappoint. I can't wait for his work to go on sale on Kindle.
B005R32L66|5.0|I tried it only once so far and it worked fine. The only minor glitch at least with my tablet is the person I was talking to got a little echo when he spoke. This was corrected when I plugged in my ear phones....
B001HNE3NO|5.0|When someone told me what this book was about they didn't do it justice. By weaving the 2 story lines, Tatiana de Rosnay told the sad story of the past with the encouraging story of the present.
0441018866|3.0|Set six million years in the future, \\"House of Suns\\" follows two of the 1000 clone descendants of Abigail Gentian as they return for their annual reunion to share what they've learned in their travels across the galaxy. Campion and Purslane show up 50 years late for the reunion they discover their line almost wiped out of existance by members of the mysterious House of Suns. Assisted by their guest Hesperus (a member of the machine race) in escaping, the trio reconvene with the 49 survivors of the Gentian line. They discover that the attack was due to a secret one of them has unknowingly discovered in their travels. They uncover evidence that there may be a traitor among them as someone is still picking them off one-by-one and trying to make these killings appear to be accidents.<br /><br />Alaster Reynolds remains a very talented novelist but the same flaws that often dogs his other novels appear here as well; \\"House of Suns\\" could have used a stronger editor to insist on at least 100 pages be trimmed from the novel as the middle section sags. The conclusion of the novel seems rushed as well given all the build up and readers are left hanging waiting for a sequel to give us more information on the fate ouf our heroes.<br /><br />Having said that (and having enjoyed the novel in spite of its flaws), \\"House of Suns\\" also demonstrates Reynolds continuing evolution as a writer. The ambitious novel told in alternating chapters from the point-of-view of three characters and in eight parts, has an interesting mystery at its core but Reynolds occasionally gets side tracked with details that aren't part of the plot or even the subplots of the novel.<br /><br />\\"House of Suns\\" isn't probably the best novel to start with if you haven't read Reynolds before (I'd recommend [[ASIN:0575083093 Revelation Space]]but it is an entertaining if bloated read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is what everyone is reading! Why???? What am I missing? If I wanted to read about a man controlling a woman I would have stayed married to my EX-husband.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the surprises in this book that kept me reading. It kept me interested more and more as I read.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|As always David Baldacci grabbed me from page 1. I love his characters and how he unravels his story. Wow.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I was a little hesitant to hear the soundtrack because if my loyalty to the broadway version. After seeing the movie, I was excited to download the soundtrack because I enjoyed the variation. However. I am so disappointed that the studio made the decision to omit \\"A Little Fall Of Rain\\". I kept playing through the sound track, thinking I missed it. The recording would have deserved 4 stars if it was included.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I didn't want it to end. Suzanne Collins kept me glued for 3 books and I was so sad to see our relationship end.
B008GOG98Y|5.0|An old favorite...loved it in the 70s; lover it now. Just a great, great movie about good friends and hope.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was so engrossed in the book and was so close to putting it in the top 10 of 2012 but I was disappointed with the ending. I don't agree with her choice but that's life.
B009X00E18|4.0|I had one of these cases for my original Kindle and liked it enough. That Kindle and case has been passed to my grade school daughter and it keeps the Kindle &#34;safe&#34;. I bought this one because of the fact I liked my original so well. This one seems to be upside down though in the way it opens. Since the Kindle can be oriented in multiple directions I think that this case should have opened from the other side. Currently if being used on the stand you can't plug the charger in at the same time. Orienting the cover so that the USB plug was on top would have been a better option IMO so you could plug the charger and mini HDMI in while standing the Kindle up. That would make it easier to watch a movie if your battery was running low and you had to plug it in before the end. Other than that this is a great case and I'm just as happy with it as the first one I got.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It was a mystery, a love story, and a retaliation for a violation. Who could ask for more? But there were more - Book 2 and 3. Yes!!!!!!
0810996596|5.0|My first impression when I received the book is how classy it looks. The content is even better, full of fascinating stories about a man passionate about the items he collects. I can tell that he's genuinely produced this book from the heart.<br /><br />He must have spent so much of his time making sure that it is as perfect as possible. I'm wowed by the variety of items: from gorgeous posters to fabulous toys. There's so much stuff!<br /><br />I've learned a lot, not just about horror movies/items, but also about Kirk himself and how his collection is connected with his passion for music/guitars. There are tons of incredible stories about how he's acquired this collection. Kirk has written all the captions himself, decided on the design, the photos, the artwork - which gives me the feeling of owning something very special.<br /><br />I sure hope that there will be other volumes in the future, as he carries on collecting!<br /><br />I will always treasure this book. I absolutely love it.<br />Thank you so much Kirk!<br /><br />PS: I got this book from Amazon UK, and the copy I've received doesn't have any defect. Delivery was ultra fast: it was at my doorstep the next day.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I am hooked on the series. Unfortunately Stieg Larsson won't be entertaining us any longer with his great characters and stories.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie is what it is, it is for lighthearted fun. Silly, Funny, Entertaining are all words that can describe this. The music and songs are fun. The story line is cute. If you are looking for an Emmy then this is not the show - but if you want to watch something that will make you chuckle and relax then you hit the jack pot. I could easily watch this over and over. I might not watch with my very small children because of some of the innuendos or with very conservative movie watchers, but for me it was a hoot!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|They don't write them like this anymore. Thank goodness for the Kindle dictionary because we don't use most of those words anymore.
B0095H4FAA|2.0|I was not impressed with this book. I had heard great things but after reading half, I had to stop. Too sexual and slow moving for me...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. It was action packed and never got boring! I read this book in two days because I could never find a spot to stop. The book ended on a total cliffhanger, so I'm going to buy the next one. I highly recommend this book.
B0064W65SO|4.0|I read long halloween and dark victory first by jeph loeb. i highly recommend reading this before these, really sets the scene for the batman universe that was trying to be created by dc at the time. the art work is great and the story compelling. that being said i cannot emphasize enough how back and forth mr. miller can go in the terms of being GREAT or being TERRIBLE: All star Batman and Robin (DO NOT READ), Dark Knight Strikes Back (AVOID AT ALL COSTS). aside from that this was a great piece, there are even some interesting women in this even though he usually writes them as prostitutes.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Amazing:) One of the best books I have ever read. Can't wait to read more of John Greens books in the future!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read for people who enjoy observing unique sexual energy between two people (that could be complicated). Of course it's not for everyone
B006K2WXOI|5.0|I have loved this book ever since I was little. It always made me believe in Santa (which I still do) and was a past time for my parents and I. It's one of my favorite books an  I recommend it to anyone and everyone of all ages!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book! I loved the characters, it's nice to have a heroine who's not a doormat in a YA novel. The &#34;triangle&#34; is there, of course, but doesn't overwhelm the story. It's suspenseful, funny, dark, and just an overall engaging book. Is it Shakespeare- no. But does anyone read YA books like this thinking that they will be? I doubt it. This book is worth the read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book it is seriously just so perfect. I love the way that it is to the point, I couldn't stop reading it.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I read this book knowing that there were going to be 6 books total, so I might not have rated it 5 stars if this had been the final book. The last chapter definitely sets up the next part of the story. I loved the series in general, it's one of the few series I've been unable to put down! Does it have flaws- yes, but the characters are so engaging that I am willing to suspend disbelief for some of the plot. Overall- read it! (And FYI I'm a mom in my 30s,  not a teenager, and still loved it!)
B008XBASVY|3.0|The novel was great I myself strongly connected to Carson. He was refreshingly sarcastic and his devotion to his dreams unparalleled. The only disappointment I felt was the ending but I won't spoil it but other than that I quiet enjoyed the novel.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It's free so it's not very in depth.  Is good for what it is, a free game.  My little boy is enjoying playing it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Oh yeah this is a good dictionary  really good hihihihhihihihihihhhi hi hi hi hi hi ii i high i i hi i
B00A757EFW|1.0|This game is really hard to navigate.  It's really sensitive to the touch on the screen and if you use the touch paddle the directions are opposite of what you would think they are.
0446554995|5.0|When you unleash two exceptional mystery writers, Doug Preston and Lincoln Child, with three plots you are going to get fireworks. Two Graves rockets and careens over a course that simultaneously reminds you of [[ASIN:0394402677 The Boys from Brazil]], [[ASIN:B0035LRI4C On A Clear Day You Can See Forever]], and Nancy Drew.<br /><br />It is of course Aloysius Pendergast who drives the action-first in his relentless search for his wife Helen and then to bring to justice those who were responsible-responsible for a lot of things. Then we have a plot line of Dr. John Felder who crosses the line of professional responsibility to prove or disprove an unlikely claim of seeming immortality.Finally we have Corrie Swanson, Aloysius Pendergast's friend who must find her father and prove his innocence.<br /><br />Only writers with the upmost skill could bring all of this together. It's fun and its worth the read.
B005LAIISA|5.0|We have not seen this yet, but we have been waiting for it to appear in our mailbox.  Like their Christmas movie, we have loved each movie that has come out.  The characters are absolutely delightful.  We even like the short runner that plays until we start the actual movie.
B009NT0I06|5.0|Swift's best so far. Not a &#34;filler&#34; song out of the 16. Amazing variety and range. That's why it's the best selling album released in 2012.
0446554995|5.0|I've been getting two chapters a month since August from the authors.  Believe me that this book is  going to be a real page turner!  When I finished the first two chapters sent via email I was already hooked and wanting more.  Now that the book is finally in my hands I'm going to be nose deep in it to find out what comes next!  I love all of the books by Preston & Child.  I  recommend their books to anyone who enjoys a great read starting from their first and following through each one in order as they were published.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|People will be listening to this album 30 years from now. It is Ms. Swift's best to date, blowing away the concept of &#34;genre&#34; and leaving us with 16 great pieces of music.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I think I'd really like this app if my image wasn't upside down on my kindle fire hd. What the heck!?!
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is a good writer of CIA thriller books.  I was introduced to Vince on vacation 4 years ago and have read every book in the series since.  I think there are 14 or so.<br /><br />Vince writes in a way that keeps you interested from chapter to chapter.  It feels like you are ready a movie!<br /><br />The main character is Mitch Rapp.  He is a larger than life assassin that does the \\"real work\\" of the CIA .. the stuff that does not make the papers!  Mitch is stuck between two worlds of bad guys: the ones in foreign lands and the ones in Washington DC.  He must take care of both.<br /><br />Buy one and read it.  See what you think.  I bet you will end up reading all of them!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. I can't believe it took me so long to read it.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|Great transaction...my Nephew loves dinosaurs, so I thought this would make a great Christmas present. The item was shipped quickly, and I was happy about the detail...highly recomeded seller! Thank you!
B007KOYEOC|2.0|too much s and m but the story was good, how can anyone  put up this kind of stuff or even do it
B0036MDNN0|5.0|Great transaction...my Nephew loves dinosaurs, so I thought this would make a great Christmas present. The item was shipped quickly, and I was happy about the detail...highly recomeded seller! Thank you!
B003AND1L4|4.0|I loved it, except for the inconvenience of receiving two instead of one and having to sold the extra, :)
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Witty and worth the time. Put the kids to bed and enjoy some mindless entertainment. Your sides will hurt, not your head.
B000002TLX|5.0|I was looking for this album for so long that I just can't believe I finally got it!  Excellent hits compilation for 80's-90's music lovers.<br /><br />Thanks, Iron Maiden
B0057XMCLA|1.0|And he was disappointed by the glaring omissions in this movie. I will also add that the acting was bad and that the special f/x were subpar. We rented the HD version through Amason Instant Video, so I guess the one good thing I can say was that displayed ok on our HDTV set in 1080p, without any network glitches.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Finally got it!!!  Can't tell who has enjoyed the most, me or my kids.  Definitely the best greatest hits compilation of this band.<br /><br />Thanks, Iron Maiden
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|very disappointed. was not all it was made out to be. slow going. i hope the next one is better.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook download works well  very happy and I love using my  kindle fire . download process was easy.  thanks !
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Must have Angry Birds...best out there! I have played the games since they came out and have never been bored. I love the little \\"bird-power\\" surprises each session reveals!
B008XG1X18|1.0|spent tons of time messing with this app . still doesn't work .  very frustrating and even more frustrating to delete and now it won't let me reinstall. Not easy to maneuvor around this app, very clunky and locks up periodically.
0802473156|5.0|Great book to revitalize your marriage, I highly recommend it. Heard about it through a friend and was impressed with it.
1612933068|5.0|this book has something for everyone. a book that i keep buying because i believe it is a give away book.
034580404X|5.0|I bought this trilogy for a friend. I have actually bought two softback sets and have the hardback set from Amazon,UK. My first set, I passed on to a friend and that set is still being passed on. The second set I kept in mint condition and the hardback is great because it has E.L. James' signature in each book. I will probably purchase several more sets for gifts to friends.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very well written, very well-developed characters and an excellent history lesson for that period. The only problem with it is that it has a LOT of characters. As long as you read some of it every day, that shouldn't be a problem. My problem was that I would occasionally put it down for 3 or more days and had trouble recalling who was who. Once I started reading it every day that problem went away.
0425263908|5.0|Santa must gave me this book in my stocking and I started reading it immediately. I am halway through it. Great story. A fast read. Don't want to put down the book! I'm one that likes to look to see how a book ends. I'm forcing myself not to on this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The varies translations within this bible is awesome!  I  love being able to study God's word with different view points.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have been waiting so long.  O my gosh o my gosh o my gosh o my gosh<br /> I love this game
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love it, becasue the game was many different levels and many birds to keep the game fun.  Feed back from my six year old son.
B0063M22QO|5.0|it is a good one! so easy to use musing will be very happy to see I have added this game!
B005HSL626|2.0|Not enough level to enjoy playing the game.  Please add at least three more levels to this game, feed back from my son.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Never thought I would be one to read this but is amazing!  A must read for anyone who fantasizes about the mysterious man.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|I was just buying this movie for the 3-D. But this movie turned out to be better than I expected. The 3-D is really good places. I would suggest this movie.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Would never never want to watch any movie like this again. Total waste of my money. At first thought NO too silly, then read the reviews of  Rotten Tomato and they were so deceivingly good that I thought it would be at least as good as Wilfred (TV dog series) but not so, gross language, stupid stupid stupid and not funny not even one scene.
B00783NWB6|4.0|Good movie. This is a good movie and the 3-D on it is also good. I wouldn't say that 3-D is great and I wouldn't say the movie is great but they're both good and worth seeing.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl Streep & Tommy Lee Jones are great as always, well seasoned and great actors. Moved a little slow but not that slow and it was entertaining both husband and I enjoyed.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I loved the book - I was afraid that this would end the Pendergast saga, but it hasn't - and I am very happy about it. This book was so satisfying as are all of the Pendergast books.  I got everything done that had to be done, and then sat myself down and read this book all in one sitting!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love, Love, Love this application.  There is such a huge variety of sounds to choose from and combine to create something simply yours.  Its wonderful
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|The pets are so cute. Also it is so fun to take care of the pets. They're so many different pets you can buy. Get this app today!
B009VB9VKY|4.0|Not a lot of story line here, but hot guys with very little clothing on is always nice.  And I liked that the romantic interest wasn't the sexiest girl in the world, just a little above average.
B009E3EY38|5.0|My son had this on his wishlist for Christmas.  He was very excited about going home to listen to it.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Great for kids of all ages!  It's fun, silly, festive and great for watching with the whole family.  Everyone will find something to laugh at while watching this movie
1781163243|5.0|So I'm not the Halo fan. I bout this for the hubby and he was giddy when he unwrapped. I would just say it was good quality all around. It's amazing they invest this much into video game books.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|its stupid I keep pressing the right piano key at the right time and they still keep counting it as wrong.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I've been waiting for this edition since I went out of the cinema, and the extras are really really fantastic, also the 3d edition<br />Recommended!!!
B0000793ZB|5.0|I like every song on this album. Have heard them all hundreds of times and still enjoy it as much as when I first heard it as a teenager.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Is exactly what I wanted a lot of extras just for fans, this kind of classic! thank you very much
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great movie. bring the kids, Clint Eastwood is a great actor. Will buy the Blu ray addition of the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am late to the game but loved this series and the movie. I have to say its a great example of a movie living up to a book's hype.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|And laugh.  I always seem to find the bittersweet books that reflect my life.  Difficult for me to read as it really hit too close to home but definitely worth the grief for the hope it brings.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Based on true story movie and our family enjoyed it very much. Would watch again and suggested it to family.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I really enjoyed this  one from a kid's point of view.... wish it had been longer!! Read it all in one sitting.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I have to erase everything so I can play this game! Really regret getting this. I think it should specify that it takes a lot to play.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This is such a cute story and told in the quirky way that only Wes Anderson can do. The streaming quality through amazon is another story, but the movie, YES, watch it!
B008EEB4TA|5.0|What a fantastic find! Marina's voice is an absolute gem-at times almost operatic (in a good way!)  She hits the high notes with ease and it  all comes at your ear unexpectedly. Meantime, her lyrics can be ironic and brooding with a lot of humor thrown in, and I love the fact that she can be all over the map this way.  Not to mention that she is absolutely stunning in all of her videos, as a brunette, blonde, or whatever else.  Check this talented woman out!  I hope there will be many more years to come.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Got this dvd for 3.99 just before christmas!  Our kids love this movie!  Pretty cool movie with and environmentally friendly message.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Our granddaughter is just 2 weeks shy of her first birthday.  We come from a long line of dog lovers so I wanted her first Disney classic to be Lady and the Tramp.  We bought it for her as one of her Christmas gifts (both my daughter and daughter-in-law teared up when the box was opened).  I would say we are all happy with the transaction.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I'm a huge Vince Flynn fan and this book didn't disappoint.  Must read for anyone who likes Mitch Rapp.  Sorry, not going to bother you with a verbose review, just read the book.  It rocks.
0385344333|2.0|I was so disappointed with this book. I thought it lacked a thoughtful plot and had very little suspense. The development of its characters were very poor. I have read all of Lee Child's books and found this book to be the only one I would not recommend. Sorry Lee.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am actually in the Navy and participated in the first strikes during Operation Enduring Freedom.  I am not going to try to argue for against a Navy Seal breaking the traditional silence about their missions.  It was a well written book and I appreciated the glimpse it gives into the execution of one of the most important events of our time.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|love this sitcom, some people can't get the humor but you have to be a nerd to get it or a gamer.
B009X00E18|1.0|i did'nt like it ,because it was to flamsy and was afraid that it would not protect my Kindle Fire HD
0545128285|4.0|‣ I suggest reading ALL the Harry Potter books before reading this. The book will mean a lot more to you if you read all of Harry Potter.<br /><br /> So, let me start off with the bad things about this book.<br /><br /> ‣ You need more.<br />  This is a BAD thing. You may think, \\"oh, this guy read all the Harry Potter books, so he was expecting more.\\" You are wrong. There really isn't much to this book. A little over one hundred pages is barely satisfying. But what do you expect?<br /><br /> That is the only bad thing. It seems like I'm saying this because I love it- no. I can seem to find a flaw. Yeah, some of the stories are a little \\"meh,\\" but they are not BAD.<br /><br />The book is amazing.<br /><br />‣ Good/Amazing stories.<br />‣ You can re-read the Tale of Three Brothers.<br />‣ Dumbledore reviews every story, which is interesting.<br />‣ Reminds you of old Harry Potter stuff.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying this!
B004MWI2M0|5.0|Grandson loves pirates and loves building with legos.  He was excited to get this gift and wanted to go home and start building.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Mitch Albom has a way that just keeps you wanting more and more.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|A lot of action but I was disappointed that they didn't stick to the original story. They missed the coolest parts of the original.
076115728X|5.0|It is super fun to read.  The illustrations are lovely, creative, and interactive.  Plus, my perfectionist four year-old now loves to tell me that something didn't go as planned, but she is turning it into a &#34;beautiful oops.&#34;  Love it!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I recieve this product before the expected date of arrival on Chirstmas Season and that was very Good. The product was perfect.

B000FC1LOC|5.0|This story goes deep into your feelings for your Brother's and Sister's. Makes you think about what you would do for them in certain situation's. How honest you could be with them and yourself about giving personal need's too them and not feeling pressured about doing them.

B0071PS7AC|3.0|another game one of my girls downloaded....they play it for a bit then get bored think that is with all games...lol
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This series is addicting....you can't stop...and Clair Danes is uh-mazing. The characters who you would expect to be wrapped tight aren't, and the characters who should be a mess aren't. It's awesome, an intelligent alternative to the sad state of TV programming.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was told about this book and wanted to read it....I borrowed this first one at first from a friend in hard back she had all three since it is a old trilogy just coming back around......I liked it but not holding book so I got it on kindle....then I borrowed the other two cause it took me only 2 days to read each book....watched this movie and loved it they did it so well to the book which is different because usually they leave out so many important details in the movie and i cant wait to see the other movies...if you seen this movie and not read the books please do
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose this rating simply because I read this book in one (and a half- being I bought it on Christmas Eve) sitting! Every word had me longing to continue reading to find out what happened next...this book is by far in  of my favorites! Now on to finding more books written by this wonderful author :)
0345803485|5.0|this was the only one i liked in the trilogy! it was the most exciting one! I am still trying to figure out all the hipe on this trilogy because i have read many many other erotic romance books that were way worse than this for all the talk this got
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|I like this series and ejoyed the shows. I don't get cable so it is nice to be able to see the show I missed
B004GYY714|5.0|I have pandora and I still like this so much better.,..you can choose any station that you want to listen too....I used it one time driving from north florida to south florida because I cant stand switching radio stations and because it goes off the satilight towers that my phone uses I never lost MY station
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Differnt of course from the other Bourne movies but an excellent platform for more to be made.  Good action and flow to the film.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was so sad what this girl got done to her as a little girl. I am glad she has overcome it to be able to write about her story...maybe this will give courage to others not to be so oblivious ot life around them....very sad story and she was very couragious
B003SI9WMS|5.0|Idea of time travel and story line is great in this movie !! Interesting concept. Denzel gave a fabulous performance as always
B0054JZC6E|3.0|never play this my daughter got it for her ipod and she plays the games all the time but bores easy
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|In my opinion this one was not as good as some of the previous batman movies. Even catwoman in this movie did a better job dealing with the bad guys as compared to batman !!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great game when it first came out kids love it and i love the stratagy of it and the different kids
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Too unbelievable and vulgar.  I would not recommend any this movie to anyone under 21. Not very unlifting for girls.

B003O86FMW|5.0|this was one of the best trilogies i have read in a long time. I started reading it because someone told me about Hunger Games and I realized it has been out for a few years before it got popular all of a sudden last year. I loved the hunger games finished book in two days and had to get this one right away then of course the mockingjay....I loved them..and cant wait for the other movies as well
B004P91ARE|5.0|The music from this man has an everlasting and generational appeal, it touches the soul and lifts the spirit. Sorry to see his genius go, but we are left with amazing sounds to be shared into the years ahead.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This product was delivered as promised. Gave as Christmas gift. My son was happy to receive it. He was also excited to check out the extra features it offers.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Never  considered myself a nonfiction enthusiast but I just so happened to pick this one up because  of its controversial nature and really enjoyed it.This really is an excellent first hand account of not only the mission itself but of this man's journey from living in Alaska to becoming  a SEAL. This book has given me a much better appreciation for our servicemen and women. I recommend it highly.
B008OJ291W|5.0|CD was delivered as promised. It's been a while since we'd heard these songs.  Gave it to my hubby as Christmas gift. Opened and played it today. Works great. Thanks.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|This movie had everything that I've loved about Halo and it's a great precursor to playing the game. I'm very much looking forward to another exciting campaign, unfiltered, unwatered down, and grim.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I wasn't expecting what I got when I started watching this movie it's very funny but It's not for kids
B0079R8IYW|3.0|This is an okay cover.  I couldn't figure out how to make it stand.  I am a teacher and the covers we have at school have an elastic strip that keeps the cover closed when not in use.
B008Q09K2U|4.0|A good read, not his best but definately up there.<br />The charater John Corey, is a real man, funny, a get a good laugh out of his comments.
0307592731|5.0|This is one of the absolute best books I have read in years.  I am inspired and highly recommend this book.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|My sister in-law recommended this book, she loved it.  I found it a little boring, not much excitement going on.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Love that us FAOTD people actually got a gift for Christmas. I was worried it'd be a cheesy Christmas themed &quot;game&quot; but this is awesome! It's fun and easy to learn! I definitely suggest at least trying this puzzle/balance game. &#12484;
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|You get what you came for! Jeremy Renner being a killing machine! I was a bit upset by the time-table the plot divulges, but hey... it's good for what it is.. just another sequel..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works for me!  Great free app.  Use it all the time and so far have no problems.  If you need a easy to use calculator try this app.
B0027Z837S|5.0|This is one of those kung-fu movies that I never get tired of. Fun action sequences, and a great story. Worth watching!
B006O6F932|5.0|At the price pay this gift set is really awesome! My daughter love it, she assembled all on her own and is really big with a lot of features. Definitely is a good choice for as and added playset for all her monster high dolls.
B008M34CSI|3.0|I came in to this one with low expectations which might be why i enjoyed it so much. Prison space fights await you if you rent!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|More grand kids that love movies. All happy at Christmas to get their movies. I love to give them what they want.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|great film! you can't really understand everything that Bane says, but that's not what you came here for is it? No, you came for great action scenes, and some justice for Gotham!

B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Great fun. The story line was good, but not as good as the last one. Would still recommend it for the kids.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This was a gift for someone else.  She will be very happy when she see it.  It came in excellent condition.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I just can't stop reading the Jack Reacher series.  I started at the beginning and have been working my way through them like a hot knife through warm butter.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Great game!  My kids kick my butt, but we played for hours, making our own rules, and adding pieces, is a great way to play also!
B009J2VQSK|5.0|I saw this on a whim when my choice movie was sold out. It was fantastic. Jennifer Lawrence exceeded expectations and managed to take on a more adult role. I thought the movie was charming, funny and unique. It was actually a quality romantic comedy. And it was very original. I would highly recommend going to see this movie.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|love Mark Twain, hadn't read it for several years and always love reading it again, bought for my boys to read
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I would recommend this book to children of all ages because no matter what kind of mood your in you can always get a good laugh out of this book.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Great kids moving. I found it entertaining as an adult as well. It is a Love story in many ways
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is the best book ever, I can't even explain all the emotions that came from this book. Mainly all happiness and smiles
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|So, so good. I am extremely glad I purchased this album. I cannot recommend it enough. Hope, sadness, love, loss, joy, all wrapped into one.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only shows 10 status updates and blue boxes after that. No way to refresh them either. A waste of a download
B009INAGY0|5.0|While my assertion that this is the top death metal album of all time will certainly draw some negative response,  I remember making that statement back in 1990 when &#34;Spiritual Healing&#34; was first released.  1990 was a high mark for death metal, although it remained an underground sensation. Chuck Schuldiner, Terry Butler and Bill Andrews were at their best on this release and the addition of James Murphy on guitar helped push the album over the top. All eight songs are strong. There is no filler on this album.  While future Death releases drew more praise from the metal press (including the now defunct Metal Maniacs magazine), it was this release, on which the song writing duties were shared, that cemented Death as the top band in the field. With grunge arriving and changing the face of all types of metal (from death to hair), 1990 saw the release of several great albums (including Obituary's &#34;Cause of Death&#34;) but it was &#34;Spiritual Healing&#34; was remains the top in its field, more than two decades later.  This re-issue is long overdue. The comments from Butler and Murphy add to it as do previously unprinted band photos. The liner notes from Beth Schuldiner (Chuck's sister) gives the fans an insight on &#34;correcting a wrong&#34; regarding the production credits. I only wish some comments from Andrews had been included. The former Death drummer has been out of the scene since the end of Massacre in the early 90s.  This is a great addition to any death metal fan's catalog. I still have the original cassette I bought of the release along with three versions of the CD. This release, however, is the definitive offering for the death metal's top release.  Death metal hit its peak in 1990 as did the band Death. The addition of James Murphy made it the band's best lineup and this release proves it. All eight tracks are solid and any could have been the first one on the album. The music and performances are too solid not to be a five star ratings. Still, I wish Bill Andrews had somehow been included.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was one of the best diary of a wimpy kid books in the series!!! I loved and when you read it you should to!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the way the author combined erotica with suspense. Some readers may have figured things out sooner than me, but I enjoyed it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This tool allows me to ensure that my wireless network at home is performing as well as possible.  The channel rating feature is an amazing feature that never fails me.  This is a must have tool!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Everything included, with links to all the relevant information on the Amazon Kindle website. Now if it proves successful when I publish my Kindle Book I'll rate it 10 stars!!!
B0060D123K|5.0|It has always interested me to see the ways in which the most human of emotions and expression can so often most effectively be portrayed by non-human characters. Somehow looking at Gonzo's nose can help us to focus on the true essence of what he is expressing rather than getting hung up on trying to &#34;read&#34; his every microexpression and wondering if he really means the words he is using.<br /><br />Peter
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Its family guy where peter is a bear. Pretty good if thats what you are expecting from the get go.
B009738XXM|2.0|I actually downloaded this for my daughters. My personal collection includes everything from Van Cliburn to Eminem, Neil Diamond to Vinnie James, Willie Nelson to Iron Maiden. so I thought I was fairly open to all kinds of music.<br /><br />But then came Carly Rae Jepsen. Actually, that's not being fair. For light pop music it's okay. My problem with the whole album is that the bass is pushed WAY TOO FAR, which is a production issue to conceal her low impact vocals. Playing it just loud enough for the girls to sing along leaves the lyrics too muted, like a lone seagull flying over a sea of barrels with bowling balls inside. Playing it louder leaves you feeling it too much.<br /><br />So on my personal scale it only rates a &#34;meh&#34;. Not bad enough to change the channel when it comes on the radio, but not good enough to say &#34;turn it up&#34;.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|fantastic enjoyed every page and I will go back for a second read would recommend it to all readers of adventure and romance particulary if you are of scottish heritage like me.
B0013LPS7U|5.0|U2's breakout full album is a must have for any U2 fan.<br />First off, the original 11 track album is a shining example of growing up, songs such as &#34;A Day Without Me,&#34; examining feelings of wanting to &#34;leave the world behind&#34; in its rebel like aura. Such a emotion-provoking album! Yes, it contains the hit &#34;I Will Follow,&#34; but fans know that there are more than just one shining gem in U2's frehsman effort... The Electric Co., Another Time, Another Place, Stories for Boys, just to name a few.<br />Even the bonus disc is worth numerous listens. It contains some unreleased material which really suits those &#34;completist&#34; U2 fans. &#34;Speed of Life&#34; and the live &#34;Cartoon World,&#34; to name a few of the once rarities.<br />All in all, highly recommend to U2 fans!!
B005HCI72O|5.0|fantastic enjoyed every page took a feat of self-control to put it away each time i had to stop reading for daily routine
B0000DBJDM|4.0|First off, this is a review for the DVD version of the directors cut of Live at Pompeii.<br />The performance is amazing -- The band seems so in sync with one another that the music just flows (even when Nick Mason loses one of his drumsticks during the performance of \\"One of These Days\\"). But hey, it is THE Pink Floyd, they can pull just about anything off! The picture quality is ok, but just keep in mind that it was filmed in the 70's. I would love to see this film make it onto blu-ray with restored film and sound.<br />The only problem i have with it is the studio footage that is placed in between the performace at Pompeii in the Director's Cut. Don't get me wrong, I love watching and hearing interviews of Pink Floyd, but I feel that the studio footage interrupts and takes away from the flow of the Concert Film.  However, you may choose, on the DVD menu, to watch the Original Concert Film without any of the \\"Studio Time\\"<br />Overall, a great film that really displays the creativity of the band!!
B003QSS2VW|4.0|Such a cute, classic movie. I loved this movie as a kid and I was pleased to find that I still enjoy it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I don't usually go for horror and the ghost story genre but I must admit, this story had me totally hooked and fascinated from beginning to end. The actors and actresses were totally believable and yes, there were times I was genuinely frightened. And I do not scare easily.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|Honestly I'm torn away at such a sad story. It pains me that there are people in the world that feels the same way. This story makes me think about the decisions I make and how they could really impact people more than what I thought.
B001E7EONC|3.0|it took over 30 minutes of boring film before getting to any real action.  way too much nudity and profanity that didn't add to the film storyline
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Sphlashtop has turned my kindle fire hd into a laptop tablet streaming Windows 8 seamlessly from my computer. This is an amazing app.
B009329Y30|5.0|I loved this movie. I hadn't seen a good movie in a long time until I watched this one.  The Lucky One restored my faith in the film industry.  Definitely one I would watch again sometime.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really loved that book it is no new favorit book . Thank you Jeff Kenney. I read this book on a kindle fire.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a very enjoyable book with humorous twists! Keeps you reading and is hard to put down! Is one of many books that are hard to put down!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I do believe, without hesitation, Colleen Hoover has become my favorite author!  From Slammed to Point of No Return to now Hopeless, she takes us into a world without aliens or vampires and just gives us an amazing story to sink our teeth into (no pun intended) and to cry with, laugh with and not want the characters to rest once we finish the last chapter.  I have added \\"What the Butterfly\\" to my dictionary thanks to her - now I add \\"taking a chapter break\\".<br /><br />I usually have a hard time with the leading ladies in these romance novels, but she did not disappoint me once again - I loved Sky/Hope and I loved her strength along with her unfiltered dialogue.  The characters are wonderful, the story is at times predictable and at times....\\"What the Butterfly just happened\\".  I read it in a day - and I didn't want to finish so fast because I didn't want to let go of these characters and there seemed like there could be more to the story - hint hint we need a sequel.<br /><br />I recommend this book - heck this author - to anyone that just wants to get sucked into someone elses world for a little while, and walk away wanting more, but at the same time feeling satisfied with how it all came to an end.<br /><br />Best first kiss ever!  Best first not kiss ever!  Loved this book!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a very helpful dictionary because yhuu can slide through the book easily and do anything with the dictionary
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook app doesn't work for kindle fire!!!!! FIX IT!!! I use the flip book app for Facebook. It works great!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who was a teenage at some point in there life is now.<br />It teaches very valuable lessons, that are vital to our existence but no one's tends to think about.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|love this movie-- absolutely adorable.  Very well done movie with live animals-- brilliant and so much fun.  All ages will love it

B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is a great mind-bender of a movie. Believe everyone who told you that you should watch it.<br /><br />It was spoiled because the playback was choppy, via Roku. I had to stop watching with about 15 minutes to go. I was able to finish the next day.<br /><br />Watch the movie. Your experience with the playback service may vary.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The story is good but it isn't up to the standards of the original Jack Ryan series. On the other hand, it certainly isn't as bad as the Op Center and other really bad fiction series.

B005ETA5K2|2.0|while it does work, it doesnt do much, any cheap wifi adapter will do what this is supposed to, i only bought it because it is supposed to extend the range. also it sometimes decides to shut off for no reason
B005COO1X6|5.0|Even though you know that you're going on a short ride in this story, you still find yourself completely invested in these characters.  The scare is there, along with the tension.  All in all, one of my favorite types of short stories by Stephen King.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Where to begin? The plot is terrible, the acting is uneven, and I do not understand what is likeable about any of the characters, nor what motivates them. The actor who plays Chon looks like he is on release from a soap opera contract and John Travolta just makes everyone feel uncomfortable. Blake Lively is so vacant that her doe eyed stares only carry her poor acting ability for the first five minutes of the film. This was a poor attempt at pulp fiction for the big screen and would have been in better hands with Quentin Tarantino than Oliver Stone given the campy subject matter.The book was better; any book is better.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Really like watching Jeremy Renner ... he is such a great actor ... love the action in this movie! ... cannot wait for the next Bourne movie.

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Let me start by saying that I've never been a big fan of Family Guy, so when this came out I was a little leary of seeing it, but now I can definitely say I'm glad I did. Please know that this movie is clearly for entertainment purposes only, so if you're looking for something that will enlighten or educate you, this is NOT it. It's completely innapropriate for anyone under 18 and I wouldn't recommend watching it with mom (unless she has a wicked sense of humor). Watching this movie made me forget about everything for a couple hours and have a good laugh with my hubby.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Pretty funny until the last 45 minutes or so. Something from Seth McFarland tends to be hilarious and have an unusual twist at the end.  Instead of a funny twist, you get 45 minutes of wasted film.

0307596885|3.0|I'm sorry to have to  say I found these stories dull and dated.  The writing was spartan, not very descriptive and generally uninspired, I thought.  Of course I enjoy stories that take place anytime and anywhere in the past, but I found Ms. Munro's plots, most of which took place early to mid-20th century, colorless and lackluster, not to mention depressing. Her characters, too, were on the dreary side. Once I finished a story, a few hours later I was at pains to remember anything about it.  The one exception were the semi-autobiographical ones at the last which had a little more passion to them. A much more satisfying read was Elizabeth's Stout's short story collection, \\"Olive Ketteridge\\". I am anticipating  Stout's next work with great eagerness, but, unfortunately, not Ms. Monroe's.

B003ZVJFFM|5.0|A great Christmas movie that I wanted to add to my collection of holiday Blu-rays.  I really enjoy this movie.
0307477479|5.0|This book was superb. Egan shows off her abilities to write in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person, and does it so well and seemingly effortlessly, that it is a joy to read. This is a series of short stories, not a novel, no matter what it is called. If you do not enjoy or are familiar with short fiction and what it is supposed to be, you may be disappointed with this book, so know what you are getting into from the start - short fiction is much more subtle than a novel. The stories are touching and interesting. Buy it, read it, love it.

0395389496|5.0|I have always loved this book and was very excited to give it to my kids for Christmas, in conjuction with the movie. They loved both!
0547848412|4.0|I went the backwards route to this book, i.e., I saw the movie first and then read the book.  Despite that, the book was engrossing.<br /><br />The book breaks a lot of promises.  For one, it promised to make me believe in God; it did not, partly because I already subscribe to a higher power.  It also promises not to be a book about animal husbandry, but it has a lot of very interesting tidbits that can pass as animal husbandry.  The book also promises to make me search my soul, but I did not do so either, or maybe I did.  Just a tad bit.<br /><br />Despite breaking promises, the book holds a lot of promise.  It is very well written, certain sentences simply caused me to pause and reflect on them (a great example: \\"The reason death sticks so closely to life isn't biological necessity --- it's envy.  Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it ...\\").  The book is about Pi Patel, Pi being short for Piscine.  The book consists of the incredible travails Pi faces with a 450 pound Bengal tiger as a reluctant and reticent companion.  These include being marooned in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans for seven months, arriving at an island that eats humans, and surviving on fish, sharks and turtles.  That Pi lives to tell his tale is no surprise, the story is told in the first person from the viewpoint of Pi himself.<br /><br />I have discussed the book with others on which of the two stories in the book is real (ironic, since we are essentially debating about a fictitious notion of real).  The first story, which takes up almost all of the book, is about the journey of survival of Pi with the gloriously named tiger, Richard Parker.  The second story is a short allegorical tale that Pi provides during his interview to the authorities of the ship that sank.  Which story is true?  Could Pi probably have dreamt of the story that takes up the bulk of the book?  My personal interpretation is no, Pi did not dream the uncomfortable existence with Richard Parker and hisharrowing journey through the seas.  But then again, what do I know.<br /><br />This was a great book.  It became a bit tedious for a bit during the middle section, especially the incident where Pi was visited by the blind Frenchman.  But nonetheless, the book is very well written and I applaud the author for his creativity in espousing his views on humanity, religion, and life in general.<br /><br />As an aside, the movie had a couple of great dialogues that I did not find in the book.  One that I remember chuckling over when I saw the movie was Pi describing to the narrator his unorthodox religious views.  Since Pi believed in Hinduism and Christianity simultaneously, the character in the movie says something to this effect, and I am paraphrasing from memory here, \\"Since there are 330 million Gods in Hinduism, I was made to feel guilty not once, but many times over.\\"  Priceless!

0811879542|5.0|While I was \\"shopping online\\" I was intrigued by the reviews already written about this book.  I was just looking for something additional for my 11 [almost 12] year old nephew...thought the book was an \\"OK\\" idea so I bought it.  When he opened this present [\\"Press Here\\"] the room was noisy and chaotic. He started to read the book out loud and [amazingly] within a minute, the room was silenced and all were listening in wonder as my nephew read the entire book.  Truly magical!

B002WCLG48|4.0|i love all things halo and at times, the side stories and bits of info that flesh out this universe are more interesting thatn 117 himself. the stories in this set are well told and aren't just humanity biased. there is one good story that is a beautiful representation of the Sangheili culture, before being twisted and abused by the prophets.<br /><br />i liken it to Matrix Animations. there is even a two part \\"history\\" of the forerunners, flood, and humanity very similar in style to the Matrix history of the robot wars. fascinating, at least to me.

159562015X|4.0|All the traits that it attributes to you are skills, not personality. One could argue differently, but in comparison to tests like Enneagram or MB, this is distinctly different... it lists a few attributes you are strong at whereas the other tests I mentioned attempt to describe you holistically and completely as a person.<br /><br />I also really dislike the fact that you can only take the test once. I don't have quantitative data like the reviewer who mentioned taking the test twice without looking at the results and coming up with vastly different results. However, I bought four copies for myself and my co-workers and we did all agree that our particular dispositions at the time heavily influenced our results, and if we were to take it in a different mood it was clear we would come up with different results. If you have a more stable, static personality, then obviously you wouldn't have that problem... but for most of us, once you take the test and see the types of questions that are asked, doesn't take a psychologist to see that quite a few answers would change for most people given their circumstantial mood. And that would change your results.<br /><br />I think what bothers me the most about only being able to take the test once is that they throw out a philosophical reason for preventing you from doing it that only too conveniently matches with a security measure to guard against a fear of people allowing their friends to log into their account to take the test as well. The entire experience comes off as disingenuous. The reasons they list are that 1. Your traits will rarely change over time as core personality is set once you have passed a certain age so there is no need to take the test twice and 2. Once you take the test and read the results, you will be biased in a way that would alter your answers during a second attempt. I could attempt to address these reasons logically, pointing out issues of environmental circumstance, pointing out the value of experimentation and learning that comes from taking any test multiple times, pointing out how fragile and susceptible the questions are to your mood once you actually take the test and see them, but I will just skip all my personal reasoning and let you judge their rationale using your own common sense.<br /><br />With any body of knowledge, power comes from sharing of information and abundance. Gallup takes the other route and guards their tools closely, keeping walls of secrecy and coming from a place of scarcity and fear. What bothers me the most though is that they aren't honest about it... They could be up front and say that they only allow you to take the test once because they don't want people to share the test with friends or reverse engineer it. Instead, they use altruism as their reasoning. It ends up really souring the otherwise positive experience.<br /><br />Anyway, it suffices to say that it is their loss and it's ours.<br /><br />One other thing I dislike is that there is no attempt at trying to describe you fully, the test just highlights a few of your key strengths. That being said, I really enjoyed their philosophy of trying to lift up what is strong and develop THAT, rather than point out what is weak and focus on the negative. I do think that the traits are valuable to find out, and the comparative exercise of sharing results with people who also have taken the test is enlightening.<br /><br />I'm giving 4 stars instead of something lower because of the inherent value of the test itself, even though these other issues are so flawed. That being said, I'll say that sometimes I shop at Walmart, because it simply has what I need, not because I like how they conduct themselves.

B006O6F932|1.0|The Monster High School House is a piece of JUNK.  One small bump and it falls down. The blue cart does not stay together so I will glue it.  This particular one is missing the pink skulls that hang on the spider webs, which fall off anyway.<br />Our grand daughter became very frustrated trying to play with it. Of all Monster High products we have purchased this was by far the most expensive and the most disappointing. So disappointing that I will be calling Mattel in the morning when the CS lines are open.
1597801585|5.0|The Windup Girl is not an easy read. It takes an effort to absorb it, but then again, so many of the better things in life take effort. To me, this book is like on of the wood carvings you can buy in Chiang Mai to hang on your wall.  At first glance, it looks like a nice carving, be it a forest or an ancient mythological scene.  But as you gt closer, the detail surprises you:  a small bird behind a branch, a gecko climbing a rock, a deer's eyes peering from the undergrowth.  When first reading this book, the storyline is the focus, but then all the little details start hitting home.<br /><br />I work in Thailand, and for me, the \\"Thainess\\" of it was welcome, even if not always accurate (pad siew is not spicy, nor do Thais chew betel nuts, for example.)  Bangkok, even a Bangkok of the future, was readily recognized.<br /><br />The science of the author's future was fascinating.  Some, to be honest, made no sense.  Why would a windup girl be designed to overheat when some of her duties might be to dance or provide sexual services?  Smooth skin alone would not result in this.  And why would spring guns be any more \\"green\\" than modern firearms?  But after I got into the book, things like this simply did not bother me.  I got caught up the universe in its entirety, and as such, spring guns and overheating windup girls could be accepted as part and parcel of this delicious world.<br /><br />\\"The Windup Girl\\" is dystopian fiction, but unlike many other such books, it does not attempt to preach.  The book simply describes.  Any message taken has to be gleaned by the reader.<br /><br />As I read this book, I was able to transport myself into the author's vision. I felt like I was there, I could hear, feel, smell, and taste what was going on.  I was an impartial observer, though, as except for the windup girl herself, I did not feel too much for any particular character. I was just there, reading, absorbing, the entire story.<br /><br />This book is the result of the authors prodigious imagination and his ability to put his vision to paper.  It was a true pleasure to read.prodigious imagination and his ability to put his vision to paper.  It was a true pleasure to read.

B003CSV7TK|5.0|This original movie by far outshines any imitators!  It's a delightful, nostalgic look back into Christmas's past where innocence prevailed and prior to the commercialism that takes place nowadays - although it is just starting to get there in this movie!<br />If you like to take a trip down memory lane and also enjoy the acting of a clever little Natalie Wood you will love this movie!

1557048630|2.0|There seems to be two different types of art books. One with the process in mind, this normally has storyboard cuts, concept art est. And the second is one that focus on story. How to Train your Dragon is the latter. Besides a great story of the writers development history, the rest of the book was fairly poor. This would be great for the people who have never read the books and want more back story on your favorite dragon. Personally, that should be a different book all on its own, not an art book. More than half the pages consisted of bio on the different dragon types showing nothing more than one piece of art work. I am serious most of the book is like this. When it does get down to development, sure you see the different designs for each character, but once again very few drawings. If your  looking for good art book go for Kung Fu Panda OR the very awesome Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs artbook. Don't waste yours or others money on this book.

0385528752|5.0|I bought my husband some other books from this author and this one looked interesting so I bought it for him too. He loves it and highly recommends it.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Album does what it says - all of his best stuff from his solo years.  No problem recommending it to anyone.
B003NGTYPA|5.0|This was my first time watching this movie, both I and my children ages 6 & 4 loved it. I plan on buying the DVD so that it can become a holiday tradition for us to watch it every year!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Did not know much about this group, so this album was a nice surprise.  I am extremely impressed with the quality of the music.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game....easy to get lost in it is fun for all ages...my kids love it too<br />Easy to pass time while playing this game
1400082773|5.0|This book was more than I thought it would be, written in a personal, casual style. It's a really revealing story of the life of our current president written years before he was elected. I loved it.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Got this for Christmas (2012) and the plugs do not fit my iPod Nano or full size iPod or my Galaxy Phone.  The are loose in the connection port. In order to get music to play through the unit, you have to constantly hold the plug against the iPod so it will make a connection. If you relax pressure the sound does not come through the right earphone and a little less pressure and the sound quits all together. I have not dealt with this company before, I hope they will honor a refund!
0345803507|4.0|it was a good read. I enjoyed it almost as much as the Beauty trilogy. It is now making the rounds with my friends
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is without a doubt, one of the best television series ever produced.  The acting is superb, the scenery and costumes are beautiful, the story captivating.  It is the first show since Upstairs, Downstairs that my husband and I both enjoy equally.  To think that Mitt Romney would have done away with funding for PBS, is frightening.  You can't compare quality television like this with the inane prime-time shows.<br />It's very scary to think that a show like Life with the Kardashians or Jersey Shore could draw a greater audience than a gem like Downton Abbey.
0345803493|4.0|It was very enjoyable. It was almost as good as the beauty trilogy. It is making the rounds with my friends.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I loved this album so much I burned a copy so I could listen in my car. Yeah, I still don't have an MP3 player car adapter. The music is catchy and NPH, Fillion, and Day are wonderful! The only downside is that you probably have to have seen the show to pick up on the subtler nuances of plot.
0345803485|4.0|I read it in days. It was almost as good as the Beauty trilogy. It is now making rounds with my friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing I love this book. Great ending to a fascinating trilogy. I can't wait to see what Suzanne Collins puts out next.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love the Supernatural Series..... I cant wait til the new season comes out on dvd. This product is just what I wanted and ordered.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Not only does Macklemore's music sound awesome, in large part ot Ryan Lewis, but the message he spreads is of acceptance.  It is unexpected to hear hip hop artists singing about respecting each other, being mindful of our language, and buying from thrift stores.  Despite all of the good messages, It didn't come across as preachy either.  I really like this album and hope that more people listen to it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game itself is okay but the gauntlet you must at times run to get TO THE game<br />past the ads takes longer sometimes than the game.  Some of the ads give no<br /> way to go to the game unless you download the app they are advertising.
B00008DDRX|5.0|This is one of two great racing movies, the other being Grand Prix.  Both of them are worth watching over....
B004WMKSH2|4.0|This is one of the darkest versions of the Harry Potter series seen to date.  However, alot of questions left unanswered in the previous movies were answered.  I would highly recommended viewing this movie.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|One of two great road racing movies, the other being Le Mans.  Both are worth watching over and over.  Saw this in a theatre when it came out in 1965....
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very unique view of a Near Death Experience.  One has a better idea looking at it through the eyes or a neurosurgeon.  I loved the book.  A little too much medical detail for me, so I have to read it a couple of times over to get more out of it.  This just solidified my belief in the hearafter.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful book, although it dealt with some tough topics. I read it in one sitting! Thank God for snow days!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is great for concentration and teaching kids how to anticipate an outcome. It's also a great way for adults to unwind after s hard day
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover, I will be buying every book of yours because they're just that awesome. This book was perfect! Omg I didn't want to stop reading. Buy this book. You won't regret it.
1936608618|5.0|This book brought the Crossfit concept full circle. Well worth having--great reference tool. It takes you through the lifts, shows you what works best for runners, bikers, and swimmers- Form and technique are covered also. And some training programs for different sports
B000006NUW|4.0|Solid Motown.  &#34;Get down&#34; music, easy to hear again and again.  Hitsville USA Motown Singles Collection '59-'71 hit the mark!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I beleive this is a product worth for the money you spend. I find it hard to carry my DSLR with its accesories during travel. This bag has good enough room to carry all your DSLR accesories. After keeping my DSLR and its accesories, I still find room to kep my Handycam, digital camera in this. So... I dont really have to bother about carrying multiple bags. This backpack takes care of everything.<br /><br />For sure... you will never regret.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|they were cute and love is true these are the kind of stories when want to come true it's a more realistic fairy tale
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Description says match 3 with hidden object, but I have yet to see any hidden object.  Still fun.  Playing on Kindle Fire H D.  Nice graphics.
034580404X|5.0|The books are very well written. Not at all what I expected. Wonderful love story. Fun to imagine what the characters look like.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is so funny! I always love to watch this around the holidays -- great quotable movie lines too!
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|If you're looking for a great way to workout or some wonderful tunes for a party, this is the only album I would recommend... The collaborations with other artists are phenomenal!
B00846REIS|5.0|These books are just as good as the fifty shades series can't wait to read the third book. You will have Cross on your mind for days!
B001TH16DI|5.0|I know there are some hardcore trekies out there that follow all of the new shows and movies but I'm partial to the original cast and crew.  Having all of Kirk's greatest movies in one space on Blue-ray is great for me.
0547884591|1.0|It's not a cook book. Don't buy if for someone that likes to cook. Buy it for someone that thinks the world is going to end and needs to know how make a stove out of an old can or how to slaughter a deer in the wild. There is a picture of the deer's heart hanging on a stick if that's your thing. The book also claims that it will teach you how to speak fluent spanish in eight weeks, become a world record holder in tango after 5 months, memeorize a deck of cards in less then 60 seconds, and lose 20-150 pounds on a slow carb diet, whatever that means. The book also claims that it compresses 6 months of culinary school into 48 hours. It does not do that. Well maybe a poor culinary school, maybe.
B00425S1H8|4.0|This is a useful cable.  There's not much else to say about it.  It seems to be well contructed and was just what I needed to hook my G-Tech Pro to my newer computer.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only most recent wall posts show on Kindle Fire. Once you get past the first posts it won't load any older posts properly. It shows some of the text from a couple posts but it's not formatted. Won't load anymore posts. Please fix this.
B004U52VPS|5.0|This is a great game and can be a great gag gift for someone.  My mom wanted to play angry birds because she heard about it and saw something on TV.  She was still rocking an original Motorola Razor flip phone though (in 2012) so I bought this for her so she could finally play Angry Birds and not have to break down and buy a smart phone.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is humorous, educational, and inspiring.  Everyone should read it.  It would make a great book club read.  The main characters in the book have many facits to their behavior and personnal character.  Read it!
B0013N7AD8|5.0|I really only like the first two that Micheal Keaton and Tim Burton did but the others are good comedies to watch occasionally.  Batman & Robin keeps me laughing the whole time.  So if you're lookig for good action you have the first two movies and then you can kick back , relax and laugh at the next two movies.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I did not want this story to end until all the broken pieces could be put back together.  It was amazing how the unspoken language of flowers could say so much.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The wait was worth it.  This movie is as awesome as you heard and then some.  Make sure to watch all of the movies leading up to it to get warmed up and then prepare to be blown away.  (Iron Man steals the whole movie BTW.)
B009MCRHH6|3.0|this was a free game for me so I loaded it and played it for awhile.  I will not get attached to it because it doesn't do a whole lot.  I will get tire of building bridges after awhile.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This is a great movie for all of my fellow nerds out there.  We know they're out there and Paul shows just how human ET can be.  I can't think of who could have done a better job of this than Siman Pegg and Nick Frost.
B00APUQJLO|4.0|Robert has a great potential and a bright lasting career for not only he is a good actor but such a sweet decent human being Paul Giamatti an Robert scene are awesome cant get it out of my mind.its a weird movie its not for everyone but I like it .Rob fans will difinitely love it.the casting ensemble are all good actors and actresses
B00005T7I1|5.0|I remember going to see this as a kid and then having to get the old radio shows and it is still great.  Its a bit cheasy now that I'm older but it's still a great movie to watch with my nephews.
B008M721MS|5.0|Still learning.  Hope I get better at it.  Just a baby boomer amazed at all the new technology. My son is currently on deployment in Afghanistan.  To see him when we talk makes my heart a little lighter.
B00867GHS8|5.0|My wife loves this movie and I think the bits I've seen are pretty funny.  I'm looking to watching this with our kids some day also.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Love it! The book is amazing a really descriptive of the events the only thing that ruined it was taking this survey
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm sad that these are the only three they'll make but dragging it out would have ruined it.  All three of these movies are great and it isn't like the normal trilogy where the middle one sucks.<br /><br />A great collection of three great movies.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Story line is great especially the way Chbosky chose to write letters to a mystery person throughouf the entire novel.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I used this behind my rear-view mirror so I wouldn't have to use the suction cup mount on my windshield for my Ram mount.  It is very stable and you hardly see it even though I leave it there all the time and just take the rest of the pieces off.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Excellent book. Easy read. Made you think. I have all also seen the movie but the book was deck definitely better!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I haven't seen one of these break but I've seen more than a few people loose these and have to borrow my phone cord to charge their Kindle. These are cheap so grab an extra to keep around just in case.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Test test team to the point of this is not the point is you reality that the government of India
B0049GYXDG|5.0|This is the original Disney movie that many of us grew up with.  It is now re-mastered and looks great even on the new TVs.<br /><br />Make sure to grab this to share with your future generations.
0525952616|5.0|The story-line is good. The technological realism is credible.<br /><br />What sets this book apart is that its premise is fundamentally realistic as a prognosis of future warfare, and the consequences of this being so are frightening.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I grew up watching Rocky and while these movies are all predictable, and if you've seen one, you know how all the rest will go, I still love them.<br /><br />This is a great replacement for my old VHS tapes that finally died a while ago.  The best will always be Rocky V, Rocky Vs. the Russian.<br /><br />Make sure to grab these to preserve them to show to future generations.
383651723X|5.0|I love the pictures in this book. Great pictures. It gives me inspirations and make me want to go and take pictures more.Highly recommended.
B004H83IM8|5.0|I have hundreds of movies but these are some of my favorite.<br /><br />Just so you know one of the discs is a standard type disc and the other is a double sided with one movie on one side and the other on the other side.  For some odd reason the double sided disc is 1 & 3 and part 2 is on the standalone disc.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|I loved when it was shown over iTunes. Great band, great singer. Even if his voice is fading away, the sound is wonderful.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I hate to see House go but this was the best season ever and I don't know how they could have undone what they did believably or topped all that they did in this season.  I hate spoilers so I don't want to say more.<br /><br />If you're a House fan you won't be disappointed in this season.  If you haven't really watched the show go and check out the other seasons or this just won't have the same impact and you'll probably be lost as they tie up so many little loose ends.
B004OC07N0|5.0|The book helps to put a framework around starting a new job or transitioning to a new position.  You can skim through it to get a basic idea of the points or take a few minutes with each chapter to really think through the details and you will get a lot out of it.
B00867GKIK|5.0|My wife can't watch this without crying in the beginning.  I laugh through most of it but it is a little heartwarming in parts also.<br /><br />Grab this to share with the young ones in your life and you can enjoy it also.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I liked the movie and it was on an extremely good sale so it was worth it. I had could not play the video on the computer but i did get it work on the DVD player.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|There are a lot of zombie movies these days but this is one of my favorites.  It's about the most realistic movie also.  Face it, if the zombies do come are you going to just happen to run into a passing Spec Ops guy with a stock pile of weapons, or is it going to be you and your pub friends with sticks and bats?<br /><br />Start readying your survival kit and make sure to include the lessons learned from this movie.
0385535147|1.0|\\"Who is the Racketeer? And what does he have to do with the judge's untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister.\\"<br />I've wondered if Grisham would someday decide to write a book with an anti-hero lawyer as the protagonist. Most of his novels feature an idealistic good guy (or girl) lawyer trying to right a wrong. Here, as Amazon's blurb reveals (so I don't think I'm giving anything away), the \\"hero\\" is a criminal, and not a sympathetic one at that. Malcolm Bannister is not a lovable conman or gangster like, for example, Nucky Thompson.  He's totally self-absorbed, cynical, and reprehensible. He outsmarts the FBI and Marshal's service, and a big time black drug dealer whom, with others who trusted him, he stabs in the back. The feds are a bunch of bumblers.<br />The first half of the book, Bannister is a sympathetic  character, wrongfully imprisoned for financial fraud, scheming to get out by ratting on a drug dealer. The book then veers off into absurdity.<br />Bannister comes up with a Rube Goldberg plot to steal from a guy who is not too bright and a fairly decent human, whom he absolutely destroys with not a shred of remorse.<br />I agree with others who have questioned if Grisham even wrote this. What is even scarier is, maybe he did, and this shows that he's out of ideas.
B0013ND30W|5.0|The classic many of us grew up with brought back and re-mastered to look great on new high def TVs.<br /><br />Make sure to grab this to share with your future generations.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|it is a great book. i cant wait until the next book comes<br />out, i am very upset it will not come out until may 2013.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I hated that Panasonic had this on exclusive deal so you couldn't get it on 3D for a long time without buying their glasses.  I use a Samsung TV so $150 for the Panasonic set wasn't going to happen.<br /><br />Now we can all finally watch this great movie in the format it was intended.  Avatar is just so much better in 3D.  Some movies you can do without but not this one.<br /><br />Enjoy everyone!!!!
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|It's ok to see once, but I would wait to see it when it's free. It's has a few funny parts, but also allot of dry times.<br />My wife thought the whole movie was boring.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Facebook app Kindle Fire sucks! I am having the same problem as so many others. The app only shows the first ten or so posts and then it stops. What is the point? Just access through the web.
B00887490Y|3.0|As anyone who has watched [[ASIN:B001MEJY8W Martyrs (Unrated)]] knows, Pascal Laugier is the Real Deal when it comes to creating disturbing horror. So when I saw his name attached to this I didn't hesitate.<br /><br />There are some plot similarities between this and \\"Martyrs\\" - both relate to crimes against children, both have a number of direction changes in the narrative which can take a bit of adjustment on the part of the viewer, both hint at the operations of a shadowy network operating outside the law and apparently led by a stern matronly figure.  But there the similarities end. While the network in \\"Martyrs\\" was unspeakably wicked, the one operating in \\"The Tall Man\\" is more mundane and less overtly sadistic.<br /><br />Strangely enough, this has more in common with the excellent (and superior) [[ASIN:B004SIP7VM Gone Baby Gone]] than any horror movie I've seen.<br /><br />A strong cast and expertly done atmospherics make this worth your time, but don't go into it expecting another \\"Martyrs\\": it's less confronting, less memorable and far less ambitious.
B009GEN0JO|1.0|After viewing Never say never again i was disappointed to find that<br />some scenes are missing. Note!!! I have seen the movie when it came<br />out.  I'd like to know if  i can get a replacement or what
B000RJW1Y2|3.0|the wheel does not stay clamped well and I could never get the pedals working with the Wii system.<br />but it works great with the playstation 2.  wish the cords were longer so I could move my chair back from tv a  little
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|.Worst movie of year I love sears but not this one.. movie has become boring and predicted . Do not weasel money
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book one of the best I've ever read in a long time. I would read it again
B003CSV7TK|5.0|It was wonderful to be able to view one of our favorite movies when we wanted to.<br />I'm go glad this movie was available.  Thanks, again.
B001UBHX62|5.0|In my immaturity, I lived on early jazz of Louis Armstrong, Big Band, Bing Crosby. Even early Miles Davis seems immature now that I've heard this. It is the death of jazz, the end of culture before the revolution. Miles work here puts one right in the center of things: the death of the old jazz, a promising hope for the brave new future. After this everything is con-fusion. I have no idea of where we go from here. All we've done for the last 40 years is have a viewing of the coffin of past culture - ala T.S. Eliot. Miles was the last great gasping sigh of humanity.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game to help waste time over a long period of time. Needs ability get get investment points faster without posting all over Facebook or buying them.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app Is fun and addictive. I would most likely choose it because it has barely any glitches and its so awesome!
B000VIPJKM|4.0|It starts out too crudely formulaic and, more importantly, unlikeable (Sex and the City, the College Years) but actually winds up solid and affecting (Clueless goes to Law School) with its heart in the right place, and something I'm glad I had my daughter (13) watch.
B00634GHJA|5.0|this app is very useful. I truly love this app . it is really cool. cool cool cool cool cool
B0031RAOVY|5.0|it was a great story-and a true story-would recommend to anyone, not just dog lovers. the true definition of loyalty.
0374214913|5.0|I received this for Christmas, and finished it the day after.  It is a really enjoyable read, especially if you have a love for both books and technology.  I felt the characters were well flushed out, despite the author not taking pages to build them up.  The story is fun and fast moving.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|very disappointed! this app should load completely. a simple cell phone does better! fix it or this kindle fire hd 8.9 is returning!
B007YNBOJM|5.0|Probably the most hilarious thing out of Japan in awhile.<br /><br />My only complaints are...<br /><br /> the device chews through batteries rather quicky (you'll get about 2 hours out of a 4 AAA's batteries) but that's easily defeated with two sets of rechargable batteries<br /><br />The ear socks and foamies it comes with stock are rather plain. (new ones are 14$ and up though)<br /><br />as far as the device itself, besides it seeming pretty fragile it works great! It's fun to see your emotions and thoughts displayed through the ears and how they react to different people. If i stick them on my 5 year old daughter, they almost permanantly stay up and tend to wiggle a lot until she gets sleepy. (yes they continue moving and reacting to your brain even when your dreaming...pretty neat) But on an adult they tend to chill out until they're intrigued about something.. also try scaring someone while they wear these (hilarity ensues)<br /><br />I can totally see these being next christmas' must have gift (=^_^=)
0316069434|5.0|My only complaint, is that I wish the book were longer.  It was over all too soon.  Already looking forward to the next one.
B0000640SA|4.0|This review is for the Two-Disc Limited Edition of Memento.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie, which I feel is just as fresh and exciting now as it was when it was first released.  But the thing that REALLY impresses me about this movie is that if you watch the scenes in order, the movie still works as a thriller, and a mystery.  The original version, with the scenes played backward, is a gimmick, but but it's not JUST a gimmick.  I highly reccomend buying the Limited Edition DVD, which has an easter egg which allows you to reverse the scenes.<br /><br />The one annoying thing about the limited edition is that the menu is not set up as a normal menu.  You'll have to either play around and explore the different menu screens, or just google for directions.
157421327X|5.0|This book was delivered as described.  It's a great addition to my drawing books and I'm very happy with this purchase!
B007WYPRHI|4.0|Always liked this movie, particularly the performances of Jet Li and Aaliyah (a promising talent, tragically cut short). Great action, nice modern take on the Romeo & Juliet tale.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i absolutely love playing this game, and that it is free is even better. Everyone should down load this game.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|you can run just about any computer with this app. finding the program for the computer to use for it was a challange but once you find it it's so cool.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I am the collecror type. I don't just buy a movie I like, I get the &#34;special edition&#34; etc. This package came with several formats of the movie: 3d, blu-ray, and digital, so you can enjoy it any way you like. I also found that trying to downlaod a digital copy of ANY movie to a tablet other that an iPad is a frustrating experience. Anyhoo, the package also has great extras, outtakes, and other stuff you won't see anywhere else. Ordereing it from Amazon, and being a Prime member, I got it shipped fast, and free, so the price I paid was great, and basically the same price you'd pay for just the regular movie in any store.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Kept me wanting to read more!! Excellent series of books....can't wait to read more from Sylvia Day!!! Bravo...bravo..what Is next?
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Good sound, nice picture, and extremely convinient! When I get kicked out of the bedroom and want to play my ps3, I just put it in this sytem and go all night. I can take it on vacation, and even to work (shhhhh). I wear headphones when I play, but even with out headphones, it is plenty loud. Best purchase ever!
B002MRRRAA|5.0|Any Nirvana concert is an awesome show. But there's something about this seemingly legendary performance. Maybe it's the dorky dancer, or perhaps it's Kurt's energy. Regardless, I was very happy when the DVD came in perfect shape and on time. Can't wait to watch it again!
B004CURZFC|5.0|Great 3D on this film --adults enjoyed the film as much as the kids. The whole family was glued to the screen!
B000002KDO|5.0|Almost every song on this album gets your foot tapping within the first 30 seconds. It perfectly accentuates Black Sabbath's warm and heavy sound. Can't beat the hit &#34;Sweet Leaf&#34; of course. That one never gets old.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This is a predictable film but enjoyable.  Lots of action which keeps you entertained.  I would recommend this movie to someone who is looking for an action film.  However, this is not a Robert Ludlum story which is the reason why I gave it three stars.  It just doesn't have that Robert Ludlum spy plot that keeps you in suspense.
B000WQW988|5.0|What a beautiful performance. The setting is so eerie and dark, which sets the mood perfectly for the set list. My favorite song on this DVD is the cover of David Bowie's &#34;The Man Who Sold the World.&#34; It arrived on time and in good shape.
B0095J0AL6|4.0|Package is creative.  Overpriced to me.  It was smaller than I thought it would be.  Daughter wanted it no matter what so it was worth it.
B000A1SZ2Y|1.0|Dont waste your time, I found this adapter useless for macros of moving and living things, it may be good for still life but I am not interested in that. Its ridiculous with the shallow DOF is you do ever mange to get a good shot!
B002413TY2|4.0|I bought it at a great price.  It completed my collection of the series.  Movie was exciting.  However, the first of the series was still the best.
B001F0WXY0|4.0|Dune,<br />It is a classic.  How can you go wrong?  I read this many years ago and reading it again was like reading it for the first time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It was addicting and good for thinking with the brain. I had a great time playing with it and I did not want to stop!
B009AJDDQU|3.0|&#34;Aliens&#34; fans probably will like this picture. People have different tastes in movies i was very disappointed with the ending.A+ on special effects. Charlize Theron  is always hot!
B006O3MU96|4.0|It was FUN! and I would consider it for people who have good skills at tilting things. I liked it!
B009KHBDUU|3.0|If you are a johnny Depp fan you might enjoy this one. It has some funny parts but overall I expected more.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|after seeing the trailers on tv for this (quite a while ago!) I figured it would be a cheesy movie with a few one liners - boy was I wrong! it surprised me from the beginning and I can still laugh while thinking of a few parts of it now! I don't even like Cameron Diaz but in this she does GREAT!<br /><br />not one for kids though! I still won't let mine watch but I'm strict like that.
B008ENNXQI|1.0|One of the worst pictures i have ever seen. Doesn't fit my taste at all! maybe someone out there may like it good Luck!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I had ordered a pink cell phone cover and received a gray cover. Would have liked to receive what I had ordered.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was great with just enough to expect and be still surprised about it all. You should definitely read it.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|My kids like it but it is not as easy as one would think it would be.<br />Will purchase extra legos to go with the game soon.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was the most amazing thing I have ever read in my entire life! 5 stars for sure!!!! Like omg!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The 3D is absolutely amazing in this movie,this movie makes you think which I like,I'd give it a 5 out of 5 :)
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|At first I loved it and after you play it a lot or beat the whole entire game its actually kind of boring but if this thing cost money I would never buy it.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|How much fun this program is. I play when my mind is gone and it seems to help things come back together. Great stress breaker.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I haven't found a G5 game yet that I don't love. Great storyline and graphics. Fun puzzles and I like having to figure out what I'm supposed to do in each scene.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I had very high hopes for this movie but it really let me down in alot of different ways. Tom hardy was the exception if it wasnt for him this movie would b 1 star...
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This was a great season of Dexter. I'm very pleased with my purchase and the speed and condition in which it arrived to my home was great!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a must watch documentary. I believe that if I change few eating habits and change the way I buy my food, I can make a difference.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written personal account of the training leading up to the event, and the blow-by-blow account and aftermath that we'll probably never hear about in the media.  Written from an apolitical perspective, which really made it a great read.<br />God bless our armed forces and their commitment to protecting our nation.
B009EELNTK|5.0|Watch it every year. Weet watch it even when it's not Christmas. Sweet and funny. Always qioting lines from this movie .  How can you really go wrong with Christmas movie?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Very fast paced and intriguing. I can't wait until the second book. It should be quite fascinating to find out what happens to the residents of District 12.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids really like this game.  The game downloaded quickly and easiliy to their new Kendle Fire.  They will be downloading again.
B007RTAR64|5.0|7 year old loved her Katniss doll. Even if it is a &#34;collectible&#34;, I got it for her to play with. And she did :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids really like this game.  The game downloaded quickly and easiliy to their new Kendle Fire.  They will be downloading again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book in a long time that I couldn't put down until I finished it.  The ending was unexpected, so that accounted for the extra star.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book without violence, profanity or a lot of sex.  It was just a good book?
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids really like this game.  The game downloaded quickly and easiliy to their new Kendle Fire.  They will be downloading again.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book drew me in in the very first chapter. I couldn't put it down. So many unexpected twists and turns. I absolutely loved Abby and Travis!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  Johnny Depp always seems to become his characters.  Casting was well done.  I watch all of  Tim Burton's  movies.  Dark and satirical comedy is his forte, and I am one of the fans for this type of work.  He and Johnny Depp, along with Helena B. Carter, make a terrific team.  Michelle Pfiffer was a great addition. This movie stands alone even without knowing the original series.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have only had this app a few minutes and, already, I see why it recieves so many 5 star reviews!<br /><br />I have an 8.9 Fire and keeping track of it's charging status will be a snap now. What a great, useful idea.<br /><br />The last thing I'll say is the price is cheap when considered against the incredible quality and usefulness of this app.<br /><br />My hat's off to the developers - good job guys!
1936891026|3.0|It's approach towards the topic of interest is way too romantic, It feels unprofessional, friendly and amateur.<br />It has a touch of &#34;self-help&#34; genre that is not coherent with my expectations, as I was expecting a professional - or rather interesting- analysis of the creative process.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|The book made me laugh out loud and so does this movie.  Very funny with absolutely marvelous actors.  See it!!!  Now!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it! The whole series is outstanding! Jeff Kinney I'd a genius and will always be! I love it!
B008PUXMP2|5.0|I was very impressed, exceptionally good collection of Amy's music. I would highly recommend this collection to friends. If you like Amy's music, buy this.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Well I personally can relate a lot to the book. It's quite eye opening I think.  I liked it a lot and recommend people read this.
1451627289|5.0|As an avid SK fan, I wanted to continue my collection of his books and found this one to have an unusal twist, Hard to put down but very enjoyable
B000VYX8PE|1.0|this book is completely sad there are no happy it was depressing and the whole time I felt they author was dead serious about the kids lives. I also felt like the counts eye addiction was not explained and it also left me questioning the judge I do not see how she didn't see that the marriage document was real.
B004YXE438|5.0|Great for the whole family! I appreciate the fact that there are more puzzle pictures released now and then. My daughter enjoys how easy the game is to use. We also like that we can select how easy or difficult the puzzle is.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really loved this book! It was very different from the other books but I totally recommend this book it shows a different side of Greg with still his awesome sense of humour!
B009ANP48G|5.0|This movie was great, but the third will always be my fav. All of these have great storylines, and although most guys I know make fun of anyone who likes it, after watching they were hooked lol
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|This app didn't work with my device. I want a refund. Thank you. My problem is really that simple, but they want me to write more words before I can submit this and there is no other way to ask for a refund. It's really not a very fair process. Thanks again.
1400082773|5.0|Mr. Obama can really write, and that's what the haters hate.  It's a wordy 450-page self-examination, don't get me wrong, but few presidents have ever been so introspective, nor since the founding fathers, so well written.  Obama's intellectual struggle is documented via an uncanny memory, and really, an uncanny mind.  Mr. Obama writes untainted by office; raw, emotive, and unexpected.  'Dreams from My Father' is something akin to 'Being John Malkovich' in that it is a portal into Obama's head, with frequent mentions of the n-word and drug use.  Kinda cool, really.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Fun to read over and over kids love it<br />Has been my daughter's favorite book forever.<br />Love the blue furry Grover!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book definitely urges you to rethink differently about your habits. You sometimes don't even know that a habit is there in you. this book had some great information on recognizing the habit and how to break out of it if you want. It gives us several examples of both people and corporations. The middle part of the book dragged a bit, but the end was interesting.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This game is amazing and in my opinion better than minecraft but it should have more demo time even if it's only 30 more minutes!
B007FEZQF8|4.0|You will most likely like this. I got the Kindle version and I like the fact that you can zoom in on each pannel.<br /><br />I can think of nothing I dont like.
0596007124|5.0|great concepts broken down in bite size nuggets. the examples are written in Java i use c# but i did not find it hard to follow the book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless does not disappoint.  It was a wonderful book full of emotions and a very sweet love story  of Sky and Holder.  I also read Slammed and point of retreat and they are also amazing booms.  Colleen Hoover is no  on my must read list.  I'm hooked.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Hands down.  I loved this movie, had to have the video.  For the price, no point not getting the multi-disc set.  Blu-Ray is crystal clear HD, movie is fantastic.  What more is there to say?
B003297I1U|5.0|Our four year old grand-son loves it. It it so heavy we are expecting it to bring joy for years to come.
030759565X|5.0|Perfect blend of the personal and practical guidance for the ordinary (aspiring to be occasionally extraordinary) cook. Feels like you're hanging with a friend in the kitchen....albeit a very talented (but also modest) friend.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Top of the line everything! Great writing, directing, cast, acting, special effects, etc.<br />Why can't ALL movies be this good?
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|Very good and hilarious. Great for both elementary school kids and middle school kids. Any kid will love this book.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I needed a dictionary because I am NOT a good speller at all. My fire does not have spell check so this is the best dictionary. Easy to use and helpful with pronunciation.<br />Thank you for offering this product. Great price too.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is very fun for any age and is also very addicting :) I would totally reccomend this to my friends and to any one who asks me about it!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Love this set of LEGO's and the colors.  Bought this because of the colors and price.  My daughter loved this gift!  Highly recommend.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|After I understood the App's way of assigning stars I realized it could become one of my favorite daily challenges....
B004EKCNMA|4.0|Great movie! My 7 year old daughter enjoyed watching this movie on Christmas Eve.  One scene where she was a little startled, but other than that this is a good film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These are three of my favorite books of all time. While their very explicit (and erotic!), the books are romances in the truest sense of the word. There is a lot of BDSM covered, but I never got the sense that that was what the books were about. They were much like Twilight in that they were stories about a couple with an unbelievable attraction for each other and all the things they do for each other to accommodate the other's very different lifestyle. They both did so many sweet things for each other that the books were an absolute pleasure to read and very uplifting. Despite the sentimental cores of the books, they were at the same time quite edgy taking on some of the moral and ethical issues of BDSM and the business world.<br /><br />I highly recommend these books if you like romances and are not put off by a little tasteful explicitness.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I love vintage stories of evolving women. If you do too, then this is a must-have in your movie library. I encourage mentors of young women to get this movie, especially college deans & professors.  This movie takes a look at early college life for women who aspired to be successful.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I've heard from a few different friends on how great this show is, but I've never seen it before a few weeks ago. I burned through the first season in about 2 days (There are only 7 or 8 episodes). Yep, I was hooked. Purchased seasons 2, 3, and 4 soon after. Then I bought the first half of Season 5 on Amazon Video on Demand. I'm all caught up now and can't wait until the conclusion to the series next summer. Very highly recommended show and worth every penny. I haven't seen the special features so that will give me something to watch while I wait.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Every married woman should read this wonderfully provocative book, I giggled the entire way through. Definitely not for teenagers or the meek-minded.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|as i am writing this review i have me headphones on with the amp going, and it sounds GREAT.<br />there is no distortion<br />the bass sounds great<br />and the max volume went up a lot!<br /><br />i will up date this review if i have any issues, other wise it was well worth the money
B008MEM24S|5.0|very entertaining when waiting for my flight many levels to keep you busy for a low cost.<br />I can see why it has good reviews
0316743003|5.0|but I wanted to increase the star rating of this truly wonderful book. I am a physicist and really thought that this book was full of useful insight into not only Skunk Works as a company (arm) but also as a government contractor and a research hot spot. I only wish that more books of this caliber existed out there about say Bell Labs during their prime time.
1455519006|4.0|In David Baldacci's \\"The Innocent\\" I was amazed at how complex the character weaving could be. In this instance it was a little too much for it to be believable. While I enjoy a complex plot over one that you figure out half way through the read it also needs to be plausible. Overall the characters were well defined and I thought Will Robie made for an interesting focal point of the book. The ending was indeed a surprise and I would say that it helped soften the otherwise over-the-top plot that I mentioned earlier. This is my ninth Baldacci book that I have read and I would recommend it even though he has crafted better stories such as THE WINNER, SIMPLE GENIOUS and ABSOLUTE POWER. Baldacci is on my short list of favorite authors and I know I will be entertained with any of his writings.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Youversion Bible is very helpful to the casual and/or serious student of scripture. The many versions help compare and contrast particular verses and show how language usage change and give different meaning to the original text. Especially helpful to me are the devotionals plans that help me stay consistent and allow me to set an alarm to remind me.
B000SOYEQY|4.0|A good, not great old movie, to long, could have made it shorter, was better on a 70mm screen, a little lost on a 52&#34; screen. Worth watching again. not on my best 25 list
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is my favorite harry potter movie and I have seen them all several times. That being said you really need to see the whole series so dont pick this up and expect to understand much with no prior HP knowledge! A truly epic finale to a great series 10/10
B000AQJPQE|3.0|We received this as a XMas gift and mounted this to my son's ceiling today. Here's the good and bad.<br /><br />Good<br />Very educational and the planets have neat detailed colors.<br />Simple to assemble.<br />It is about as hard to mount as a fire alarm and mounts the same way.<br />My 5-year-old controls all of the ceiling fun from the ground. The remote is very simple to use and the IR has good range.<br /><br />Bad<br />It is VERY LOUD when turned on.<br />The light weight for ease of mounting also makes it fragile<br />It require two holes drilled into the ceiling. That means a heck of a commitment to an item we probably won't keep very long.<br />If the sun were that dim, we'd be in big trouble!<br />It contains 2 screws for mounting and overly large metal anchors. Smaller screws and plastic anchors will suffice.<br /><br />Overall we are happy to have it up since my little guy loves it and it was a gift. I probably would not have committed to two holes in the ceiling without the gift factor.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|this game looks lame at first but after you play it you'll get addicted. Great game I don't regret downloading it Lol
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Very good story. Eva was kind of a brat at times but I still enjoyed the book and am waiting for the next one.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Movie was okay but was not true to comic. Certain plots were changed for movie script expected Robin to play a role too. I was disappointed.
B005ONTD42|4.0|This little ball is so much fun! It works as described and has great battery life. My dogs love it too
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling has left Harry Potter behind with this interesting adult novel.  Great characterizations and  plotting.  Didn't know there could be such intrigue in a small English town.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|This book does a great job summarizing what we know about our universe from the big bang to the present and a glimpse into what we may know in the future.  With great humility it suggests how that fits with the many ideas of &#34;God&#34; and creation.
0525952926|3.0|I absolutely loved Fall of Giants and anxiously awaited this book, but I am disappointed in the depth of the characters and the glossed over historical content.  I completely agree with other reviewers that it seems as though Follett had inexperienced ghost writers and formulaic editors who undermined what should have been a great story. The end seemed rushed... as if his deadline to publish the 2nd volume was more important than the quality of the read. As a Humanities teacher, I would have loved to share this with my students,  but the gratuitous sex scenes were so contrived and unnecessary that I won't be able to do so. I hope that Follett and his editors take their time with the third installment and give us something comparable to the first.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Great romantic comedy!  I acually watched this one and then had to go back and watch the first one.  I enjoyed them both, but I think this one is my favorite.  Colin Firth is a great leading man.  Best Renee Zellweger movie.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|lovely music, easy to understand, easi for my five year old to follow, easy to learn, good intro to learning the piano
B0027Z9C2I|5.0|It is one of my favorite all time movies.<br />Would watch it again.<br />Love the music and it is a great love story.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|easy to play and understand, characters are cute, the game is colorful, i like that you are able to do the level over and over until you pass
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Keeps the kindle protected. Fits into purse nicely.<br />While traveling it is handing to hold on to. Tugs in to brief<br />case.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|If you Like Reggae this is essential to have. Heck even if you don't like Reggae you got to love this album
B004AKCME8|5.0|My four year old son asks to watch this movie every night. I actually like it too! I would definitely recommend this movie and seller.
145162445X|5.0|This book explains why nothing is impossible... or rather why the idea of absolute nothing is impossible. Very well written and easy to follow.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was fantastic; this style of writing is not usually for me so I was a little sceptical. My son recommended the 3 books to me so I decided to give them a go; I was glad that I did and even more pleased that I didn't have to wait for the next book to come out.<br />The writing was good; the plot was so intense; I really couldn't wait to pick it up each day. I am so disappointed there will be no more books by this wonderful author.
1439192812|5.0|This book is filled with detailed, but easy to understand explanations for virtually every question your kid will ask you. I bought it as a gift for one of my two brothers who love to argue about how they think things work now they can look it up.
B001706I5I|5.0|Most kids AND adults i know love this movie. Perfect to watch christmas eve or christmas day! I recommend this movie to everyone who grew up with the original movie and all kids who love christmas movies
B000641ZA4|5.0|The only way this DVD could have been any better was if it also featured actual puppet show versions of the videos.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Love this book. I learned so much about Lincoln and the Civil War. I wish it had been longer. Didnt want to stop.
B0086700CM|4.0|With all my work on the game I think it is a very good game. All of you out there I think that you can and should  download this game.: ) :) :) :)
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Was like watching an 80's action movie. Could of been better with out Arnie I'm from CA and can't stand the fool.
B000ICZD5M|2.0|one has to take into account when this miniseries was made.... having done that the production values were poor... the movie itself was not a fabulous retelling of the story but adequate....
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Perfect happy ending love story and would gladly read it again! Anything by Mira Lyn Kelly is a best seller waiting to happen!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is a great game and always will be. You can't beat classic games even my 15 year old son loves playing PAC man.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|This was a cute movie.  Kids would like it.  As an adult I thought it dragged on, but kids would enjoy it.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|Listened to it on my Bose and its the best!! I will highly recommend it for anyone who loves music.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love that this show stays try to the book that it is based off of in many ways. I think they did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life.
B007P6PLDI|5.0|These are from the best album ever.  The package itself was much larger than I expected, but was thoroughly appreciated by the gift recipient.
B003N9ASEI|5.0|An absolute classic. Movie never gets old for me. And I've seen reviews where they're saying you have to watch previews and can't fast forward. Well that's completely false.  I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was amazing....I'm not one for reading.... but I read this in 3 days..... I couldn't put it down!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I got this app for my grandchildren ages 8 and 10 and they have only played it once or twice.  They just don't like it as well as Angry Birds.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I made it to the 7th page, then I turned around and basically flipped.  This game is worth it, if only for the tension and surprise factor.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|I grew up watching this. Recentely my Daughter who is a super Gleek fan for &#34;Glee&#34; Watch a Glee episode when they did the Glease and she really wanted to see the original movie. so I bought here on Amazon reccently and we watched it and she ♥ it!;)<br />It is for any &#34;GREASE&#34; fan. young and old alike. Music is great. It is neat to John Travolta so young and charming. same with Olivia. alltime classic hit! Loved it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Well I had already boguht this game though this would be awesome Christmas present to u all!  Dobt miss it!

B00138GZAC|5.0|Have been a fan of Sade for several years, and the songs bring back good memories from when the songs originally came out. The music and lyrics stand the test of time for me, and still enjoyable
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is a great CD and a great deal with 16 songs! One of Taylor Swifts best in my opinion
B0096C7QF0|5.0|Love this album!  I am amazed at Joe's mastery of the guitar.  He is a genius!  His songs are very touching.

0399157565|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell's books. I haven't read it yet but I know I will really like it. Her Kate Scarpetta stories are great.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I was absolutely overwhelmed by this book. I have seen the play and after reading this book I wanted to read it again. The details of the characters help you to get lost in a world that is not your own. If you are looking for a journey this is the book you need to read. I was so intrigued by this book that I did not even realize 8 hours had past since I started reading it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really loved this book, well written, great story, it's one the best books I've read.Ths story through the eyes of Enzo, the dog. You cry, you laugh, you learn about life and how overcome difficulties, how to face you troubles and how to live your life with joy and love...I'm gonna read it again

B003WUYRGI|4.0|Io non sapevo come andare avanti e quindi ho dovuto farla.  Mi è piaciuto perchè esprime bene le parole e non mi è piaciuto perché è troppo lungo da sfogliare. Questo libro lo raccomandare a tutti perchè è un dizinario d'inglese.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I was never one to watch Cameron Diaz.  I couldn't figure out all the hooplah about this skinny, frail...okay, she's just hillarious!  I laughed from the first scene all the way to the last.  I'm happy to say I'm a true fan now.  This woman has got to be one of the funniest comedic actresses of all time.  Hats off to you girl.  You got me. &#34;Honey! I'm home! Get yourself...&#34; well, you know the line.  Too funny.
B00846REIS|2.0|a harlequin romance for 15 year olds.  There is no depth to the characters and no real story.  don't buy it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I shared this book with my 6th grade class, just before Christmas, they really enjoyed it.  Several of them purchase the book for home reading.

B00APUYWYA|3.0|This was an okay movie. The most funny parts were those that were in the movie trailer and not many more. It was not what I anticipated.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Normally I don't like to follow the crowd when it comes to series but I'm glad I did on this one. It's been awhile since I've read a book and haven't been able to put it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like how you get coins to buy new people and boasts. also how each person goes faster and is way skinnier
B003TSEEDY|4.0|For the most part, this book was great. It really shows the transition from innocence to adulthood. The main character, Charlie, provides the audience with a way to connect with what he is going through. The book is very philosophical. I just wish that the ending was a little bit more clear.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|If I could give this movie fewer than one star, I would.  As if we haven't seen enough films showing adults killing each other, now we have to be subjected to teenagers killing each other.  This is pornography.  This is obscene.  From the first moment at the beginning of the game to the last, we see body after body of children murdered by other children...and, several times, we see children murdering other children.  No one is saved from this, even our hero who kills without thinking twice.  There is no merit to this film.  Parents, if you let your children see this film you should have them taken away from you.  Sure it is simulated killing by actors, but simulated sex by actors is considered porn, too, and you wouldn't want your children to see that, either.  No excuses.  No one should be proud of this movie.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I loved this dictionary .the  most favorat part is that it can read to u.I like that because  i abuslaty  hate to read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|do you remember on the old nokias they had a game called canal control? I loved that game and have searched for a similar game for years.this isn't similar but as close as I have come. fun game,not too hard but makes you think.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|5000 times better than the tv show! If you think the tv shows better, say that in Tony Moore's face!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Perfect! Thanks, Colleen Hoover, for encouraging me to grab a part of my life and punch it in the face!<br /><br />&#34;Sometimes life gets in your way. It gets all up in your damn way. But it doesn't get all up in your damn way because it wants you to just give up and let it take control. Life doesn't get all up in your damn way because it just wants you to hand it all over and be carried along.<br /><br />Life wants you to fight it. Learn how to make it your own. It wants you to grab and axe and hack through the wood. It wants you to get a sledgehammer and break through concrete. It wants you to grab a torch and burn through the metal and steel until you can reach through and grab it.<br /><br />Life wants you to grab all the organized, the alphabetized, the chronological, the sequenced. It wants you to mix it all together,<br />stir it up, blend it.”<br />― Colleen Hoover, Slammed
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book is as good as Kate Morton's previous books.  She does her research well and brings the reader into the era and location of the story.  I am half way through the book and looking forward to finding out the final answers to all the questions raised by the author and the main characters.....
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had Much more action and steered away from the twilightesque love triangle a little bit. Can't wait to read mockingjay.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is the first time I have played this game and.....I am addicted to it!  This edition seems to be well done and easy to use for a beginner.  I am now looking for more challenging versions.  :-)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Thanks for the creators at Rovio for connecting Star Wars and Angry Birds.  I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, but I am a huge Angry Birds fan.  This game is awesome!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyable young adult science fiction story.  Presents a future where peripheral areas are required to send children to participate in a game run by the central state.  Engaging narrative and well written.
B0012NO4WO|5.0|I like this movie because it has lots of action in it. Dennis Hopper plays a great bad guy and I'm a fan of Sandra Bullock. Even though I've watched Speed before, I'm always on the edge of my seat with this one!
1600247245|5.0|The story is fabulous and the writing is up to Connelly's high standards.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the audio version.  If you like Dick Hill's narration of previous Connelly books, you will have a very hard time adjusting to Michael McConnohie.
B00005AR3G|5.0|I love David Spade in this movie. I laughed through the entire movie. The screwy adventures of the characters reminds me of the Looney Toon cartoons I used to watch. Definitely a thumbs up for this movie!
B001FD5KJM|4.0|I like both the Iron Man movies.  They are watched over and over.  I would recommned buying if you like action movies.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book. Thank you Jeff Kenney. More books! More books! Two thumbs up. Five stars. 9.9 out of 10. Keep it up Jeff.
B000T433CO|5.0|This movie brings together modern Los Angeles, and the beautiful, quaint English countryside for a wonderful story taking place around Christmas.  The pairing of Kate Winslet and Jack Black is very special and cute.  Cameron Diaz is spectacular and quirky as Amanda Woods, the film trailer creator.  After breaking up with her boyfriend, Amanda decides to go on vacation and trade houses with Iris, the English writer who has recently been jilted by her cad wanna be boyfriend Jasper.  I love this story because of the contrast of Amanda's gorgeous mansion in LA and Rose's cottage in England.  Amanda is a mess, and so is Iris!  Jack Black is wonderful and loveable.  Not as crazy about Jude Law, but he wins me over in the end.  Love this movie and it rates at the top of my list this Christmas.
B004EKCNMA|3.0|Good family Christmas movie.<br />We were disappointed that the movie had stopped several times throughout for extended periods to reload on Dec 24th. Never had this issue w/Netflix streaming movies that we used b4 & after watching Disney's a Christmas Carol movie.<br />Hope this is an isolated incident?  I will b more cautious b4 we rent movies fm Amazon in the future.
0761163808|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson and although he is too young to really appreciate it, every adult has been \\"wowed\\" by the visual effects.  Hope there will be more.  Bought one for myself too.
1419705849|5.0|My son (8) collects the Wimpy Kids books. This was the only one he didn't have. I was very lucky to buy it through a Lightning Deal. He's very happy and so am I.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is my son's favorite movie at the moment.  He acts out the scenes and I've even succumbed to the shameless product promotions and bought the toothpaste, hat and gloves set, house slippers and backpack. LOL....
B00574P9EQ|5.0|This was our first time &#34;renting&#34; from Amazon. No problems at all. We used our laptop and hooked it up to our tv. The movie itself was very good. My kid's loved it.
B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter wanted this for Christmas so bad after seeing the Monster High DVD.  She's been playing with it all day.  It could have been constructed better and sturdier for the price so it will be interesting to see how durable it will be over time. I was borderline rating it a 3, but the joy in her eyes playing with this was worth the 4 stars.
B000L53D4O|5.0|It is sturdy and has lots of activities to keep him busy.  He is walking all over the house using his new walker.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Holiday left me with a good Christmas List to give people of what I wanted to do for cooking. I am thouroghly enjoying reading this book, learning and applying cooking and learning ideals. Suddenly it all makes sense and I am looking forward to serving my friends more than Pasta or hot dogs for a meal. Don't let the size of the book intimidate you. It is a breeze to go through. I recommend both the E-Book version and the Hard Bound because of the added graphics you get in the book vs the electronic edition, but the electronic edition is easier to have around when you are in the kitchen or wanting to read around town (best on a tablet... the Kindle version has so many colors of text it sometimes makes it difficult to read on just the B&W Kindle version) Plus the Tablet version makes for easy navigation to websites.<br /><br />Highly recommend the book to all. Tim's writing style is charming and self depreciating. Easily able to connect.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is truly the ultimate version of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. This is a beautiful 70 mm BLUE RAY print that explodes off of your television screen. The audio has been punched to new levels and the bonus features are amazing.  Not to mention the goodies included, such as the book, the repro souvenir book, replica postcards from Saltzberg, the soundtrack and so much more. This is truly necessary for anyone who has ever seen this film and loved it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I saw the film on Christmas Day.  Unlike many people, I think Russell Crowe's voice was perfect for the part.  I'm glad they chose actors that could sing and also stayed true to the original musical.<br />The only dissapointing aspect of this album is that it is &#34;Highlights&#34;.  I'm hoping they release a full recording in the future, but it really is a beautiful album.
B009SQRL4U|1.0|Both of our kids lost interest in the movie after first 1/2 hour. Wait until movie is included in Amazon Prime or Netflix to watch.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I normally do not review products.  However, this application did not work.  It is only a couple of dollars, but buyer beware.  Apps should not be sold that have not been proven to work.
B0001I561E|5.0|Well done; nice to have independent female characters in the story. The packaging is well done, but I seem to be the only one in the family who thinks maintaining the original surround has any value. The outer, protective cardboard is easily removed and thus discarded, rather than used to protect the outside of the video case.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Could not put it down!!! Finished in one sitting!! I would highly recommend this book!! Look forward to reading more by more!!
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a family favorite in terms of a children's video. There are parts that are scary at first viewing and a child should watch it with family the first time, so they can see things are not always as they seem. Maximus, the horse, is everyone's hero. Grandpa is required to be Maximus, so he can be ridden around and around the living room. There are many good lessons in this story, as well as great humor, appreciated by adults and astute children. I love it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great app! Very addictive. It's a great challenge so your mind is pushed. It seems so simple but the strategic element adds a whole other aspect.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter, but she is not allowed to watch it because Ariel is seen as a weak woman who gives up everything for a man; my son and his wife do not want this message presented to their 4-year old until she is old enough to understand the implications of the choice Ariel makes. I grew up on fairy tales, and though they were written versions and not Disney productions, I loved them and still grew to be a very independent, strong woman. My granddaughter is very bright. She's get it right now, but we will wait until her parents are ready.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|Too atmospheric for Norah fans, not layered enough for Danger Mouse fans, this is still a great, moody piece of work.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|To me, an episode of Family Guy is better than this whole movie. It works when you're in a stupid mood, but there's no point in re-watching this movie.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Sure, she's still the lovelorn and love forsaken balladeer from the past, but there's a glimmer of maturity on a couple of tracks which implies that she might have a career for the long haul.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie was awesome, the blu-ray picture is so great! I could not believe how awesome the picture looked. AWESOME!
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Will she continue to be around for a couple more albums like, say, Adele, or kind of fizzle out like Duffy?  We'll see what happens, but I'm hoping for the best.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|put some time aside because as soon as you start, you want to keep challenging yourself. It is easy to play and if you like puzzles, its a great way to pass some time.
B00917IQFY|3.0|Not to say that the album is bad - it really is great to have Graham Parker reunited with the original Rumour.  Some of the tracks (even the ones that may have been considered &#34;controversial&#34; back in the day) sound like they're going through the motions.  However, after seeing them live, I appreciated the tracks a little more when I listened to them again.
B003HKN52U|4.0|I love the vampire movies and was missing this one in my collection. Not as good as some but still fun!
B0099G3I96|3.0|I might need to listen to it a couple more times, but No Doubt almost seems to be phoning it in on this one.  Like other artists who have waited too long to get back together after going their own separate ways, the product turns out to be kind of by-the-numbers.  Maybe the tunes are better live, who knows?
B001UG56ES|4.0|The story moved slowly at times, but overall beautiful cinematography and wonderful acting.  Would watch it again for sure !
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|After seeing her train wreck of an appearance on SNL, I had no desire to hear any more of her music but, after this was offered at a steal by Amazon, I thought I'd give it a try.  It turned out to be a nice, moody piece of work that, for some reason, made me think of David Lynch (maybe it was her version of &#34;Blue Velvet&#34; - it probably was.)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Purchased this for my husband who's a huge Batman Fan.  He needed to add this to his collection.  Finally, the collection is complete!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I wont go into a review of these movies. Chances are you already have seen them for yourself and know how amazing they each are! This review will be in regards to the actual collection you are purchasing. The quality of the materials used in the packaging is very good. This is a sturdy box, with a sturdy sleeve that comes out. When you unfold the sleeve there are nice graphics (as you can tell from the picture) and you do not feel like the sleeve will rip apart. If you enjoy these movies and want to get them all in one collection (with 2 bonus discs; one for The Dark Knight, and one for The Dark Knight Rises) then this set is for you. The booklet that comes with the set fits nice and snug in the box, but doesnt really contain much content. There are some good concept art sketches and still photos of sets and props, but that is about it. Do not buy this collection for the booklet alone. Just consider that part of this set a nice add-on.
B00447G29S|5.0|This Blu-ray is so Beautiful, The colors are brilliant & The 3D is Great.<br />I recommend this movie for everyones Hoilday Collection
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is for sure in my top 5 BEST READS OF THE YEAR (possibly best reads ever!).<br /><br />This book taught me so many things. For one, I learned what a slam is and I swear before I die, I will be attending one. I also learned that I LOVE THE AVETT BROTHERS!!! Thank you Colleen for introducing me to them through all of the lyrical references in Slammed.<br /><br />I promise this book will have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more, and never putting it down. I read it on a Sunday afternoon in a 4 hour sitting.<br /><br />I am not a cryer, by no means at all. This book had me on the verge of tears, with the 2nd book, Point of Retreat forcing them out. This book stole my heart! My whole heart! It had my undivided attention for 4 hours straight. I was so sad when it was over, only to learn that there is a 2nd book which I immediately moved on to.<br /><br />There is not much to tell about this book without giving everything away, and we don't want that do we?<br /><br />Lake is 18 years old and a senior in high school. She moves to a new city with her mom and brother. Her father has recently passed away. She meets a few new friends in the neighborhood before she starts her new school. She has the perfect few days before school starts. On her first day of school she gets the shock of her life!<br /><br />That's it, sorry! That's all I can give you. If you want more you will just have to read the book. I know you will not be disappointed.

B00448SE4S|5.0|It was a very funny movie I would really recommend it if you like comedies or video games for that matter there are a lot of funny references in it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I read the whole book in one day and its great I couldn't stop reading I would recommend this book for anyone who likes comedy
B0015DROBO|5.0|The book prompted me to read the trilogy and by the end of the 3rd book, the loose ends were tied up. Unfortunately, we will never have any more work from Stieg Larsson.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It is a really good dictionary because it tell u everything.<br /><br />My email is rogerbegay1964@GMail. Com<br />U can email me
B005NJU8PA|5.0|For many years I struggled in learning and finding out what works and what doesn't. The 4HC provided me a solid method to overcome obstacles, find a direction, and to FOCUS (the most valuable thing of all). Thanks Tim!!!
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I chose this rating because I didn't think the book was funny like it was in the past wimpy kid books and I also chose it because I found it kinda boring in the beginning when Greg keeps talking about how it was like being a baby
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a read in one day kind of book!! Loved every second. Very suspenseful, keeps you guessing! Five stars.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I like this TV series and have bought each season. If you like Vampire series I think you will like this one.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great new disc by a longtime superstar. Some songs old. Some new. All fun to listen to. A new Xmas standard in the making
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This is the sort of game that one plays to relax. It has great graphics. It isn't too hard. But it's challenging enough to be worth doing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Deep insight into the struggle in the society the characters face. Challenges you to think of the inhumane acts of people in our world.
1439170916|5.0|My mother-in-law passed away this year after a long and courageous battle with uterine cancer.  I picked up this Pultizer-prize winner in an attempt to educate myself as she went through a battery of surgeries, radiation and chemotherapy.  \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" is a truly remarkable book, charting the course of humanity's battle with a terrible disease from the Egyptian physician Imhotep in 2500BC to the cutting edge research on oncogenes today.  Gripping and beautifully written, it's amazing that the author, Siddhartha Mukherjee, is an oncologist.<br /><br />Nearly 500 pages long, Mukherjee breaks the book into six parts, atomizing the history of the fight against cancer into sweeping epochs.<br /><br />Part One, \\"Of blacke cholor, without boyling\\", begins with the Egyptian physician Imhotep in 2500BC and ends with the launch of the \\"Jimmy Fund\\" by Sidney Farber in Boston in 1948.  Mukherjee brilliantly synthesizes and explains five millennia worth of cancer understanding and treatment, from Herodotus' history of a breast cancer of Darius' wife in 400BC to the influential \\"four humors, black bile\\" assessment by Hippocrates and further promoted by the second century Roman physician Claudius Galens.  Cancer is an ancient and feared disease, but one that for most recorded history existed on the fringes of medical science and social consciousness.  In the pre-modern world there were many, many more things to worry about than cancer, Mukherjee writes.  Cancer is mainly a disease of age and, until recently, many other ailments would have likely killed you before cancer got the chance.  Also, medical science has gotten much better at detecting cancer in its many forms.  For centuries, if not millennia, deaths by cancer have been attributed to other, often mysterious causes.  For thousands of years cancer surgery stagnated with the black bile theory.  Then, in the mid-nineteenth century, a pair of discoveries in close order (anesthesia in Boston in 1846, anti-septics in Scotland in 1865) led to an explosion in invasive tumor surgeries for nearly a century, driven by the \\"radical mastectomy\\" performed by the brilliant (and cocaine and morphine addicted) Johns Hopkins surgeon William Halsted.  Finally, there was the discovery of cellular mechanics, which opened the possibility of targeting cancer cells directly.<br /><br />Part Two, \\"An Impatient War,\\" introduces philanthropist Mary Lasker and early oncologist Sidney Farber as they take over the American Cancer Society, injecting a new sense of urgency and hope in an organization that had become staid and moribund.  They would champion a massive concerted government campaign against cancer, often employing the analogies of the Manhattan and Apollo projects.  For all of his passion, Mukherjee essentially confirms that such lofty ambitions were misguided; it was like undertaking the moon landing without a basic understanding of Newton's law of gravity.  The early findings with chemotherapy were similar to the line of reasoning followed by Halsted with surgery - only correct (i.e. the more the better).  For most of cancer's history the disease has been treated as monolithic - the rapid division of cells - and thus the efforts to cure it have also been monolithic, from Halsted's surgery to early chemotherapy.  By the late 1960s all seemed to be coming together for winning the war against cancer.  There was widespread (but ultimately premature) conviction that the scientific community had found both the cause of cancer (because of the chicken experiment of eventual Nobel laureate Peyton Rous) and a cure (in the form of a combination of chemo drugs) - and that this explanation for cause and cure essentially applies to all cancers.  It led to the National Cancer Act of 1971, which poured billions into cancer research and would, in the end, be a dud.<br /><br />Part Three, \\"Will you turn me out if I can't get better?\\", begins with the clinical trial wars.  The author stresses how the surgeons and chemotherapists were split into opposing, often hostile camps, which for a long time limited experiments involving both surgery and chemotherapy.  The tradition of the radical mastectomy of William Halsted was only buried in 1981 when it was shown conclusively that the survival rates were no better than more limited procedures.  If radical surgery was dead, radical chemotherapy was arrogantly reaching its apex in the 1970s, with doctors utterly convinced that a universal cure was just around the corner, if only the right combination of chemicals could be found.  The consequences of these treatments on patients, who were literally pushed to the verge of death, were not considered, but merely treated as the ugly side effects of an all-out war.  Palliative care for terminal cancer patients would only emerge in the 1970s, and when it did, it came from Europe, not the technology obsessed United States.  Perhaps the most important insight to emerge from this period was that cancer is incredibly heterogeneous (i.e. there is no \\"one disease, one cure\\") and that it is thus critical to know the type of cancer you're battling before you try to treat it, as the type will dictate the treatment strategy.<br /><br />Part Four, \\"Prevention if the Cure,\\" is a section largely devoted to the effort discovering the link between smoking and cancer and the multi-decade campaign of cancer advocates against the tobacco industry.  The central theme here is the importance of large and statistically significant trials to pinpoint causality.  The case central method worked well early on in tying together rare professions with rare cancers (e.g. chimney sweeps and scrotal cancer and asbestos insulation installers and lung cancer), but what was the intrinsic characteristic of a carcinogen?  Through serendipity (another theme of this book) it was discovered that certain chemicals increased mutation rates in bacteria and that these mutagens were also often carcinogens.  Knowing what they were looking for, researchers could start looking for carcinogens prospectively, rather than merely retrospectively.  Yet, progress still came frustratingly slowly, compounded by some major setbacks, perhaps none worse than the discovery of massive research fraud on the part of South African oncologist Werner Bezoda, something of the \\"Bernie Maddoff of cancer research,\\" who argued for a combination high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant.  Mukherjee highlights the moral challenge of conducting solid, rigorous (but also slow and diverting half of the participants to near certain death) clinical trials in an age that demands results now.  By the end of the 20th century, the War on Cancer, some many times trumpeted as being on the verge of victory, was at best a stalemate.  Some cancers had seen real improvement in treatment; others had gotten worse.  Clearly, there was no \\"magic bullet\\" in the war; it would have to be \\"back to basics.\\"<br /><br />Part Five, \\"A Distorted Version of Our Normal Sevles,\\" focuses on the discovery of retroviruses (i.e. viruses that \\"go the wrong way down a one-way street\\" allowing the virus to change the composition or structure of a cell it attacks) and feels a bit like a primer on molecular biology, which may make this the hardest section for the layman to follow and absorb.  Intensive research on a wide range of cancer types found that the cells tended to \\"slouch toward malignancy\\" (i.e. cancer was a very slow developing disease), requiring a combination of rare and gradual events: 1) proto-oncogenes need to be mutated, which is a rare event; 2) tumor suppressor genes need to be inactivated and this mutation had to happen twice, an even more rare event; and finally 3) these mutations had to happen to many genes over time.  Thus, by the year 2000, the history and understanding of cancer had seemed to come full circle: from a view of cancer as a single, unitary disease, to one that was very heterogeneous with all types of potential causes (e.g. virus, external, genetic), to a return to some common principles, a few (six, actually) hallmarks of cancer that applied to all types.<br /><br />Part Six, \\"The Fruits of Long Endeavors,\\" reviews the present cutting edge of cancer research and the most promising paths to future success, from the new cancer drugs like Herceptin and Gleevac to the possibilities unlocked by the Human Genome Project.  Yet, it ends on a sobering note, even more sobering because it feels true.  Mukherjee writes that cancer may very well be a \\"natural process,\\" a normal part of life and aging, something inevitable, unstoppable and therefore incurable.  Given enough time, cells and genes will mutate and cancer will arrive.<br /><br />Thank you, Dr. Mukherjee, for writing this important book and making it so accessible to so many.ey were looking for, researchers could start looking for carcinogens prospectively, rather than merely retrospectively.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I liked it , but I didn't like it when all of the dots were connected and there was space left with no specific directions on what to do to complete the puzzle.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|If you like anything St. Vincent or David Byrne has done, you will enjoy this CD.  It's the best of both of them melded together.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|This movie is prophetic and full of information on whats to come and whats going to take place yes yes
B009EAO38C|5.0|These guys do more then play a piano and cello, they feel the music so when you listen you feel it too. I am in awe of them. If you like to relax by listening to music you will like this. You can check them out on Youtube. They do both classical and pop and everything in between and do them all exceptionally well. You will not be disappointed with this CD.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Arrived quickly and in great condition. Love David Garrett so that's a five star right there. He's an amazing performer and this is really a great CD.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Please fix news feed and why don't I have the ability to save any pictures.  You can sync to FB but not to cloud.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was really inspiring. I can't wait to read the rest of them! I have to say this novel reminded me much of the \\"battle royal\\" it was written before the hunger games, but it had the same concept. If you liked this book. Check out battle royal.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I've followed Christina's work throughout the years and she continues raising the bar for herself. This album is a perfect example of this. Big pipes, spot on notes, and full of sass and raw emotion - perhaps erring on the side of \\"This is who I am, am you either love it or hate it.\\" But let's be honest....this has always been how this headstrong lady has been, right? Full of spunky attitude and pure, raw, & fine-tuned vocal talent! This is yet another just buy from our girl :)
B0083EM24C|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for our daughter who had the exact title & group on her &#34;want&#34; list.  I know she appreciated it!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I'm still crying, I've grown attached to all the characters. I'm truly impressed with Rowling's newest and most stunning piece.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|When using this amplifier there is a noticeable drop in audio quality and I can hear a static sound coming through as well. The static is loud enough to make it unusable while charging. It does make the music louder, but considering everything else I would much rather just use my headphones without it.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Fun series about all our favorite nursery rhymes.  Very well done and a must see.  Looking forward to season 2.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This movie was not what I expected, but in a good way. It's a thoughtful relationship movie that's elevated by the performances of two of the best actors in the business. Definitely for mature audiences because of the subject matter (fairly frank discussions of sex in a long-term marriage) and because it takes a little life experience to really appreciate the issues this couple faces.
B0086213XW|3.0|Chick flick! Being bored doesn't seem like a good enough reason to question  your marriage. But we all know people like her!!!
B00493E1GI|5.0|What a beautiful movie!! It is definitely one of my top choices when I’m looking for a good wine & pajama girls-night flick. Julia Roberts’s performance is extraordinary, as always. I have watched this movie time and time again and never get tired of it.<br /><br />Ps: Be warned, this movie will make you crave Italian food like crazy; I immediately had to whip up a dish of pesto-pasta after watching it :-) Enjoy!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Just what i expected from the movie. The story was quick, so it was never boring. The action scenes were pretty neat and the special effects where a lot better than i expected. Hopefully they make a sequel to this series.
B004AKCME8|4.0|My mother bought this as a running owl joke (don't ask) for my wife.  I got her to watch it with me, thinking it would be something for background noise while we worked on a home project.  We ended up stopping said project and watched the movie instead.  Very cute movie, worth at least a rent if not a straight out buy.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great time killer the game is very addictive. spent hours playing and I was very entertained.I love this game. bye
B002MU4NLI|5.0|I grew up watching this movie with my grandparents and look forward to watching it with my family for years to come
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I was certainly surprised at how different it was from my expectations, Hollywood has done this great story no justice.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's a dictionary... What's not to like about it? And here are the eleven words needed to finish this off.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very well written!  Could not put it down.  Down to earth, no macho B.S.  Gives you a much clearer idea of what is actually  going on in the war!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|As many similarities as this book has to the \\"Fifty Shades trilogy\\" I still found it entertaining. Can't wait for the next book.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Yes it is mind bending but I like that a lot I wish it had things like sand storm witch id easy and can make things like abrasion but overall I give it a 4 and a half
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Loved this album;  Fiance and I couldn't stop listening to it since about the beginning of Dec. (when I bought it).  Love, love, love it!! PTX is such a wonderful group.  My favorite song on this album is The Christmas Song :D I definitely do not regret buying the full album instead of just a few songs.  PTX does NOT let down.
B005HSL626|5.0|Everyone in the family loves this! From seniors to toddlers all enjoy slicing fruit! We have had to add it to all our devices.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Lots of action.  Story was weak.  Arnold movie was better (if you can believe that).  Farrell has personality of block of wood.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Carcinogens bodyweight Heidegger hehe they buddy hehehe Gdansk behind buddies hidden behind brushed thanks see benign judge haha haha whiskies Judaism
B00821PCJS|4.0|If you had been raised on a steady diet of science fiction like myself, you'll find this a Si-fi lovers dream!
B004TTHLBE|4.0|I had heard of this story before, was glad to finally read it.  A intriguing tale, some parts a bit disturbing.  The Enhanced aspects did not work on my 3rd generation kindle, so I have no idea if it was worth it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I Couldn't put it down! This was such a great book I read it in a day! Full of adventure!
B00A757EFW|4.0|A lot of fun, the same game we remember that was, and still is, an icon in the industry. A bit of nostalgia and deja-vu.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I absolutely love Taylor Swift, her amazing talent to write songs about her life is unbelievable! I am always full of anticipation on what she will write about and sing next! Not only is she talented but she is also beautiful! I love all of her songs and sing along with them when they play on the radio!
0061992860|5.0|The SAS is the oldest of the world's special forces;our Delta Force is patterned on the ideas and techniques they pioneered.  Having a book written by one of their survival experts with 26 years of experience is an incredible resource.  Moreover, the book is well written, well illustrated, and gets to the point of each lesson briskly. It covers a vast array of topics,from identifying edible plants to ways to track animals to find a water source.  The book also cleverly makes frequent use of pnemonic memory devices to ensure key survival points are easily recalled.  The convenient pocket size of the volume means its easy to take with you, be it on a casual hike, or something more extended and challenging.  This would make a great gift to anyone who enjoys the outdoors.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|There were some parts where the picture was awful, but I think that might have been my fault? I will watch from Amazon again!<br />Great price also. 48 hours for 2 bucks!
B00846TRHY|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Uganda and caring for orphans so I appreciate this movie.  Language is insane yet probably close to reality.  I appreciate the work Sam does and the lives he's saved.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was a great read and kept me reading...can't wait to read the next one. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is by far the best mini-series (and best Western) that I hveseen. I read alot and hen see a movie version. and the movie is never as good as the book. Until now !! I loved the book by Larry McMurtry, and this is as close to the book as any I have ever seen. Each character from the book is just as I imagined. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones play &#34;Gus McRae&#34;and &#34;Woodrow Call&#34;, respectively. They play the roles of ex-Texas rangers turned ranchers exactly as I had imagined when I read the book. That is so rare. And the rest of the characters were also extremely well cast and the actors did a wonderful job of bringing them to life.If you liked the book, you will LOVE the movie (or mini-series....just a long movie broadcast in 3 parts.) And even if you have not read the book, you will still love it. Highly Recommended !!!
B0086449YA|4.0|There are no duds among Mark Knopfler's albums if you like his style. This album is more vintage Knopfler, possibly not his overall best work but certainly not his worst. A very good listen and a good recording.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|A stellar cast supports Paul Newman's brilliant performance as a hopelessly non-conformist &#34;rebel without a cause&#34; who would rather die than take orders from anybody. One of my all-time favorite movies. I don't watch many movies more than once, maybe twice. I have seen this movie so many times I have lost count, but conservatively  I would say at least 25 to 30 times (and maybe 50 or more),And I just bought the blu-ray !!!
B007TG34QU|5.0|If you like Vivaldi and want something other than the standard works like The Four Seasons, etc., go for this. It is a group of somewhat lesser-known concertoes, well played and very well recorded.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|John Fogerty's genius cannot be denied. The rest of the band is good enough, but without Fogerty's incredibly prolific songwriting they would never have made it off the bar band circuit.This is a good introduction to CCR for new listeners and a great  &#34;can't help but sing along when you're in your car alone&#34; compilation of radio-friendly hits. All 20 songs are genuine hits !! No fillers here !! Highly recommended. Contains almost (but not  quite all) of their biggest hits. Great road music.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This show is awesome and the DVD set arrived brand new and seems great. It was a gift and the person I bought it for loves it. Thanks!
B000VHMF0A|5.0|What a deal for a buck.  Brings back memories.  Thanks for the Xmas present Amazon.  Great for downloads on computers and MPR's.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Excelent movie<br />good old school! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! ! ! ! !<br />Nice
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I deeply enjoyed the many layers of meaning and sense of time that this book offered.  I read a lot, and rarely am I this pleased with a novel, especially one that could seem like a simple romantic novel, it is much much more and handles difficult social issues our society has with grace and poise.  Well done, Ms. Diffenbaugh.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Excelent movie<br />good old school! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! ! ! ! !<br />Nice
B008ROH07W|4.0|This is awesome playing; however, I must point out that this is an exact duplicate of another album of hers called \\"[[ASIN:B008LZYR5K Kings & Queens]],\\" and both are on EMI! What is up with that? Is this some kind of marketing ploy? I also must point out that both albums state that she is playing on \\"natural\\" trumpet, which in the profession has come to mean a pure natural trumpet with no tone holes (which did not exist before 1790). I have seen the video footage on YouTube of this album being recorded, and she is clearly playing on what we call a \\"baroque\\" trumpet, i.e. a natural trumpet with tone holes in order to more easily correct the out of tune partials inherent to the instrument. Nevertheless, I could not play like this with or without holes, so my hat is off to Ms. Balsom; I just wish she had warned everyone not to purchase (or put on one's wish list) both albums. I am rather disappointed in both EMI and in Ms. Balsom for marketing these two discs in this manner!<br /><br />In hindsight, it has been pointed out to me in a comment that \\"Kings & Queens\\" is the European release of the album (which I should have guessed since Handel's name is spelled German style \\"mit umlaut.\\" So, the onus falls on Amazon for not listing the tracks on the web page for that album. Anyway, her playing is well worth listening to twice anyway! :)
B004SIP8OI|5.0|Excelent movie<br />good old school! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! ! ! ! !<br />Nice
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Such a great design idea. The case came in a timely manner and is of good quality and condition. Thin, sleek and lightweight, and I believe it is a big hit with the person which I gifted it to.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Excelent movie<br />good old school! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! ! ! ! !<br />Nice
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very sweet and sometimes funny story. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right? Well maybe not. Here is a story of two people who meet hit it off and wake up married. Megan wants a divorce and Connor does not. So Connor proposes a three month trail and hopes to convince her that they are perfect for each other. They want the same things, have the same goals, they both want children but do not want to fall in love. I really enjoyed the authors voice so to speak in this. The writing was really nice. And I found myself reading it in one night. I will be looking for other books by this author.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Excelent movies<br />good old school! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! ! ! ! !<br />Nice
B000ZMCVRI|2.0|When I bought this it said it included both discs, but only downloaded one.  When I checked the cloud, it said I only purchased one disc????
B006PZBR8S|4.0|I really liked this.  It's not going to win an oscar but the performances were good and Hugh Jackman was fun. It was far more heartwarming than I expected.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Can't get the damn thing to work at all...simply searches zip and then appears to hang. And have no way of getting help...
B006VREOOY|2.0|I love Robert Deniro and Jason Statham and this movie was pretty bad.  Not just the dialog but the acting.  I expected much better.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King is a literary genius and this book does not disappoint.  I've recommended this to many a non-King reader and all were amazed by this book.
B005OYKIJ0|4.0|I liked it.  You get exactly what you expect from this franchise, cars and cops and racing.  Since I like all those things I like the movie.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Good book, not just a romance novel. It did seem to drag on a bit, but all in all a worth the read.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie was really fun.  I rented it for Christmas day and the whole family enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I started this book without really knowing what the main subject matter was going to be. I had read 2 chapter before I purchased it and I enjoyed the funny comment way the author wrote.<br />However getting to the &#34;meat&#34; of the book I was surprised at the real subject of the book and frankly did not really like all the erotica described.<br /><br />It ended up being about a person who could not really &#34;give&#34; of himself.  The use of all the S&M stuff was merely the way he could express his sexual needs and it was clear the he had been corrupted and obviously used.<br />Now he could not really give in the normal way.<br /><br />It was disappointing for me.  I ended up not finishing the book as it seemed to be the same thing, she is appalled but goes along with the sex, he's intrigued because she doesn't want to really be submissive.<br />Waste of my money.
B007JUWM64|4.0|This was a very fun movie.  It is not to be taken seriously, it is just a fun action packed movie.
B008M721MS|1.0|Just spent 30 min trying to input a US country code into a UK box AFTER I switched my language back to English US  waste of time. Thank God it was free
1449433251|5.0|Fabulous set of best cartoon series ever. Box keeps all the books together and makes a great gift. Good price, too.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As expected, the characters were interesting.  Didn't like the ending with John severing the head of the terrorist.  He should have taken him in.  Also the wife didn't have a prominent role; and she should have.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Wow! I can't say enough about this case. It has been great. It's been dropped on our asphalt driveway while running and was totally unscathed. My husband said it would discolor since it's clear but it seems fine to me. I guess it might be a little yellowish but for $7, who cares? I didn't buy it for fashion; I bought it for function. I've been thinking of &#34;upgrading&#34; but unless I find one that's this great of a deal and this great of a protector, I will be sticking with this:)
B000003CMC|5.0|Great to hear Mountain Jam as a continuous song instead of the 2 sides of the double album. Only drawback is it is in the middle of the CD instead of being the finale. But still wonderful memories.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|I rented this because my girlfriend wanted to watch it. She's into comics and im okay with them. You immediately get the feel that this isnt one of those typical comic movies. The characters are real, vibrant and believable. The detail given to each is both Watchmens strength and weakness. I docked one star mainly because I felt that it was just a bit too drawn. The story is wrapped up beautifully and is definitely a second watch film.
B000003CMB|5.0|I've introduced more people to the wonderful sound of the Allman Brothers with this album than any other. The live performance of the original lineup (with Duane and Berry Oakley before they tragically died) is truly awe inspiring. I must have for any Rock and Roll fan. Also pick up Eat a Peach as more songs from the Fillmore concert and the final encore Mountain Jam along with some studio songs after Duane passed.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Ed Nortin and Bruce Willis steal the show with their characters. The story is pieced together the way you would expect from Wes Anderson. Its definitely one of my favorite from him. I just dont understand why the scene with lightning (no spoiler) existed.
B001VSZ7RQ|5.0|Awesome!!!  Love all things Keith.  I can't even pick a favorite song, I just keep listening to all of them, over and over!
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Skip the commercials and watch it here. Season two is what defined the direction of Walking dead. Character development is key here. If you thought season two would be a resident evil video game on autopilot then you will be disappointed. Many felt this season was drawn out and slow. I feel that people feel this way because they were looking for the wrong thing. The deterioration of Sean is fascinating to watch. By the end of the season you can understand Characters actions based on their current mentality. Lincoln gives us the Stability of the ranch to see this development without much outside distraction. It sets a great stage for season 3.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have always loved Susan Boyle.  I will always buy her CD's.  She has a beautiful voice.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is a review of the Hunger games series. If you have read the first two there is no reason why you should stop here. I best describe the hunger games as Game of thrones stripped of 10 of the 12 layers. It is a light quick read with little depth. If you are looking for fantasy with depth move over to the game of thrones series. Buy a kindle as you dont want to lug around those books and make sure to start fan mail requesting that George Martin finish the series!
B000YHG72E|4.0|Will Ferrell's goofy humor makes this movie. As a human raised at the North Pole he thinks he is an elf but has never fit in. Once he learns that he is not a true elf he goes to New York to find his real father. Of course he finds himself in lots of funny situations and learns many lessons a long the way. Sweet Christmas movie.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Rowling has a wonderful style with pen, but the subjects of this book were depressing, self-centered and pitiable. Subject matter matters. I wouldn't buy a painting of a trash pile, even if a master painted it.
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie portrays a lot of married couples. It is easy to get in a rut of being together. Tommy Lee's character is humorous, he kept my husband and I laughing! All 3, Streep, Jones, and Carrell are great. The end is great and really lives up to the movie's name. Definitely worth watching!
1932735410|4.0|Excellent book for preparing for the PMP Certification Exam.  Provides Tricks of the Trade, tips for the exam, and additional information not covered in the PMBOK.  If you have limited time, this is the book to read and review prior to taking the PMP Exam. This is a must have reference for passing the exam.<br /><br />Read the book 2-3 times to obtain the maximum benefit.  Her examples and exercises are on target.  The exam goes beyond the PMBOK and you must know what the project manager must do first, next, etc.  The questions at the end of the chapters are reflective of the types of questions you will see on the exam. This editionm compared to the 6th Edition, adds the technique to determine a process of elimination to identify the more correct answer and eliminate those that are not applicable.
B00003CXSM|2.0|Sometimes funny and cute.  But sometimes it comes on too strong -- trying too hard to be funny and cute.  Not worth it.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Basically an hour and 40+ minutes of Family Guy type humor...very funny!  I will probably by the DVD and share it with my buddy who loves Family Guy.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|For a fraction of the price I got a wonderful collection of Bob Marley hits from Amazon. Had some trouble downloading some of the tracks initially from the cloud drive, but it worked later.
B00887490Y|4.0|I rented this movie expecting the typical horror movie based on a local urban legend killer, something akin to Candyman, nothing new, nothing that hasn't been overdone, just mindless fun for a Friday night in front of the tv.<br />What I got was something very different. This is not a horror movie. The fact that it is billed and marketed as one, may be part of what causes some disappointment for some viewers. This is more a crime drama. If you watch this movie with that in kind, you may be able to remain more open to it and appreciate the fact that it is more thought provoking and has more depth than a typical serial killer movie normally has.<br />There are a lot of twist, turns and misdirects aimed at getting the viewer to think they know where the story is going, only to find it suddenly veer off into a different direction.<br /><br />I think the movie could have gone just a  bit longer and spent a little more time on some character background and maybe filled some explanation for a  couple of things that seemed a bit implausible.
1400069289|4.0|The Power of Habit could have given the reader the same learning experience with half of the writing. What it teaches though is very interesting, and even though it doesn't seem revolutionary it forces the reader to take a more in depth look at the reasons why we do the things we do in a day to day basis.<br />The scientific backing that Duhigg inserts in the book is useful but it seems that at sometimes it is redundant and repetitive. Although the book explains the habit loop and how one can change it, much more could have been elaborated and focused on how we can use the teachings in the practical sense of our lives. After all, most of us are reading the book because we need/want to change habits we are slaves to, instead of just reading it for psychological, neuroscience, and medical pleasure.<br />I would recommend everyone to read this book. After reading it, I started seeing why I craved some of my habits, and also -and very importantly- the way human nature manifests itself when someone reacts with aother employing (sometimes without being aware) automatic and maybe harmful responses.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing love story/ suspense ....... I have read all three of Colleen  Hoover's books and they are all amazing. I would love to see them all hit the big screen.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Simple controls, I found it much easier to control things like wall-jumping than in comparable games like Super Meat Boy.  Scientists, why don't you try to arm yourselves?  That guy just comes by and greases you every time.  Get a gun, or something.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is one of the best books I have ever read and the sequel is just as good. I look forward to more books from Colleen Hoover.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|The physics of orbiting around planets is an interesting twist on the Angry Birds theme.  The ads, at least on the Kindle Fire, are too frequent and hard to dismiss, and detract from the game play.  I'm not enough of a Birds addict to get the ad-free version, so this will probably sit around until I delete it to free up space :)
B0081SPK0I|1.0|Why does this game need access to the system tools? Games like this shouldn't, or at the least explain why they do.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good, but same basic plot as first book. Plus it's becoming difficult to continue buying into main character's ongoing naïveté.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved the story and the writing style. The characters were well developed for a short novel and I enjoyed the chemistry between them.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|Been awhile since I read fantasy-fic, but this was a good series. The plot dragged at times and probably could have completed the story In 2 as opposed to 3 books, but worth the read.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I hesitated reading this book because of the title/cover art/back cover description. I wasn't interested in a lovey-dovey, let's cry throughout the book tale of love and loss, etc. But honestly I was hooked quickly! I really enjoyed this book and I recommend everyone giving it a shot. It is such a great book that teaches you about the language of flowers while telling you a great story. I really enjoyed it and suggest you don't hesitate. It is a quick read and really worth it!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I'm always intrigued by life beyond death.  This book was interesting but it became difficult to wrap around at times because it was written by a Neurosugeon, which I should have guessed.  I had seen Dr. Alexander's interview on the Dr. Oz show which  prompted me to read his book.
B004R63MWQ|4.0|Wouldn't watch this movie for the plot (doesn't really make sense), but the visuals were amazing and really memorable.  Would totally recommend for any sci-fi fans or if you want to watch a cool movie.
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan is already famous for his incredible voice, but Charlotte also has a wonderful voice, and they have made a beautiful CD I enjoy listening to over and over again. I've read some of the negative reviews, and frankly I don't notice any of the technical problems they mentioned. Perhaps they got a bad copy? Anyway, people with this kind of talent only come along every so often - don't miss it!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Its pretty cool. I wouldn't play it all the time. If I was waiting for something in a place with no<br />wi-fi this would be my first choice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Old time favorite that measures up to expectations. Great way to pass the time when you have a few spare moments
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not sure about this game as have never used it. Would be unfair to write a review without having tried the game.
B005QPMB2Y|2.0|I ordered this for the audio pickup.<br />I use this for MP4 video from a Cisco camera.<br />However if I put the audio on, then the video is garbled....its like somebody sliced the image into  rectangles and then scrambled them randomly....not overlapping...but about 9 or 10 pieces....interesting but not useful.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|this web page informed me that this app is not compatible with a kindle fire hd when I tried to install it. it does not appear on the app store either. useless.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|This is a wonderful movie to watch.  My husband even enjoys it. Highly recommend it along with Pride and Prejudice.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Got the season in good time no trouble with it my roommates and I have thoroughly enjoyed it can't wait til I can order the third season
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Good app on both my droid phone and the kindle fire hd.  I can keep track of my pending watch list and bids.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love adeles music, It is down to earth, and easy to sing to.  I can't wate to see what she comes up with next.
0062127241|5.0|My husband is on a read frenzy about various rock musicians. Loves this book. He's not a big reader like me. The hard cover is his choice over the kindle. This is a real book and very enjoyable.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Excellent!!!!  From directing to acting to storyline.  Weary of second season especially after realizing same actors would be included with different roles, but never seen something like this done so well.  10 stars!!!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Great,well written thriller that kept me guessing and had some very surprising twists that I would have never expected.  Definitely a must read!
B005CVWWJY|3.0|The story telling was superb the only downside was it tended to over detail sometimes...I am waiting on the sequal.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game that can be challenging at times, but it never becomes so challenging that it becomes frustrating enough to put down. I finished the game within a day of downloading it, and am looking forward to more levels.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love using this app for Facebook everything seems good and I had no problems so far an I love it thank  for the amazing app.
0316228532|5.0|This book was a gift. Never has a gift, gifted so well before. I am the king of gift giving thanks to this gift that gifts so well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the romance in the book! The book wasn't predictable to me and I really enjoyed reading this book! Amazing
B005ORVMCY|3.0|I think these sets are a little over rated - the remixes are fine but a little overpriced if you already own the RUSH Cd's.  There is only one DVD audio disc in the set, which does sound fantastic, too bad all of the albums weren't in DVD.  They advertise these with vinyl like sleeves -  its nothing more than a clear piece of plastic the CD sits in.  One thing I would have liked is some liner notes about the \\"Sector\\" project series, the only written material is the words for the songs.  It would have been interesting to read what the producer set out to do and the experience of getting to remix the RUSH catalog - I'll have to do internet searching instead.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love all the details in this book!!! Couldn't get any better than this!! Hunger games is a good book and movie now!!
B0055D3EFU|5.0|The movie was excellent. Was very suspenseful and well planned out, a good buy for people who enjoy scary movies.
0525952926|5.0|Super follow up to &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;.  HIstory that's easy to follow.  Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|i would have given it a 4-star rating but for the end, which was mediocre. i think bourne ultimatum was the best so far...
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|a very useful and free financial web site. I would recommend it to others seeking info on financial markets and news.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I'm a long time fan of Rod Stewart so I don't think he does anything bad. This is a beautiful CD.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Same plot as Alien.  Nothing new.  They also left some holes and unexplained things.  Visually it is pretty interesting and it is exciting.  Also, had a hard time suspending reality that anyone could endure what they did and still be a better fighter.  Especially after having major surgery.
B005LAII80|5.0|Simple and effective. It does not try to be anything it's not and it takes pride in its campy, dark nature without going into grindhouse territory. Instead of cheesy one-liners, Dredd delivers a face full of bullets, but when it comes time to dish out the dialogue, Karl Urban does a great job with the his gravelly voice to create a larger than life walking death machine. You literally never see his face the entire film, and yet he is oozing with character. They give you little tastes of the possibility of a sequel but when I saw this in the theater, there was about 5 other people besides my friends. This is what a modern action flick should look like, I just hope they can find a way to make another one. If you like the film, be sure to buy a copy so it has a solid after-life and possibility of continuing.<br /><br />10/14/13 - UPDATE - I just purchased a lg 60\\" TV and watched this in 3D and it looks fantastic, the 3d is almost right on par with the cinema, you just don't see things coming out of the screen as much, the depth is incredible though and if you are looking for a 3d movie to watch on your new TV, this is a good place to start since you can usually get a used copy with 3d for much cheaper than other 3d blu-rays.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Pretty fun! I did not expect to enjoy it so much. this minimum word review is annoying though. that seems ridiculous.
B005QUQP76|5.0|I got this mouse for playing my MMORPG and fps games and it works great all around. Love everything about it.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love all Scarpetta novel, haven't read one I didn't. I love all the characters. I just keep hoping after I finish one that there will be another!! Keep it up. If you haven't read one with Scarpetta, please do so.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|un reloj con con un diseño diferente los colores son muy llamativos ademas el diseño del lego es super a mi hijo le encanto
B00530FC6O|4.0|Bertie Wooster is my favorite character of PG Wodehouse's imagination. Although I enjoy a few of the other Wooster stories a bit more, this one is certainly enjoyable.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a great representation of grief in all it's forms, of life handing you an impossible situation and fighting your way through it. I was completely captivated and could feel every emotion as if it were my own.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|Diary of a wimpy kid is the best book ever created I personally think that it reminds kids like me to have a funny part in our lives<br />  From,<br />  Cameron o.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I really liked looking at all the different words that are slang and different meani eacause who need a thesaurus
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantasy and Calgon, take me away! It was a good quick read for by the pool this summer. It was a page turner, but just because you wished you were a mega millionaire and you could do anything you wanted, any time you wanted. Surely not written well, nor was it that unique, but still it kept my mind busy while I suntaned! ;)
B009HV2JT8|4.0|all in all Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a good movie, even if it is a bit far fetched! i enjoyed it no doubt though!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Appears to be in line with the rest of the trilogy and good over all. Cat woman script seemed a bit weak, but well performed. Action good, but a little convoluted in parts. Bomb did not seem to fit well, given the blast radius was said to be 6 miles..which just didn't fit at the end...distance traveled, etc..[avoiding giving too much away of plot].
B009FZHYKU|5.0|overall great show! I love the survival of the fittest concept that the show brings. Facing daring trials in a post apocalyptic world, and making hard decisions is a great way of putting a story together. Taking a 12-gauge to a zombies forehead is just an added bonus! #teamdaryl
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Read the introduction and looking forward to having the time to read the rest of the book. This is a great service.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This album gives off the same vibes as a the rest. The songs are inspirational, about standing together, standing up for what you believe in, and being a good person. The most heartfelt rock lyrics that the ladies love, backed up with hard sounding in-your-face instrumentals that bring you back for more. This band continues to deliver!
B0051XJ9YE|5.0|another 'bad guy' for my son to play with. now theres a reason for having all those 'good guys' toys
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Followed the families developed in book 1 of the trilogy through WWII.  Compelling character development as well as a historical review of the events leading up to the war and the supposed impact of the war on people.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|If you like the sound of Van Morrison that he has laid down on his last bunch of lps then you're good like this one.  If you don't have any Van music this is a really accessible place to start.  His voice and phasing is unique and still able to project that GB soul sound.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|The story is a bit clumsy in spots, and a bit preachy even for Disney in spots, but overall it's a solid rental.  Plus, anything with Kelly Macdonald, even if it's just her voice, has a lot going for it.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Gary Clark can and does play every style - with his spin on the music.  Every time that I listen to this album I hear another nuance - and I like it.  He leads when the song calls for it and chords when he needs to step back from the front.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|I watched this on Christmas day. What a wonderful Christmas movie.  It is witty, charming, smart and very clever--a real Christmas present.<br />So great to see such an original and creative story be brought so vibrantly brought to life. Very rare these days.<br />I saw it in 3D and it was really special. A new Christmas classic....James McAvoy and Hugh Laurie lead the stellar cast of voices.<br />Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Give me a break, this was mindless writing.  A total waste of money , someone needs to learn to be an author because this was the worst book I have ever seen.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 3 year old LOVES this movie.  This movie helps to teach about the environment and protecting the world around us.  I highly recommend this movie, and so does my 3 year old.  Very nicely done.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great series. I got it for a really good deal too.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|As a kid I loved LOVED Oregon Trail.  I thought that I would enjoy playing this game, but I didn't.  The game has a number of technical difficulties and I want the time that I played with this game back.
B009YQJ322|4.0|Although Stalone's mouth looks better under the helmet, and his voice is deeper,<br />Karl Urban pulls it off. This is a really good movie, better than the previous one,<br />and does follow the violence, splatter and unemotional action of the comics.<br />The story is simple.<br />Trapped in a huge building, Judge Dredd and Judge Anderson<br />that is under review, respond to a violent incident. And it gets really complicated<br />after that, with bullets flying around and some great scenes.<br />Director Pete Travis has some aces up his sleeve, especially the slow motion scenes,<br />and all in all it is a good action movie that lasts just short of 90 minutes!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|this book had me :-) and :-( with every turn of the page. I love  Jodi Picoult style of writting.  She gives it to you from every characters angle.. Its a page turner that gets you hooked. Makes you rethink the justice system.. And makes you want to her the other side of the story. I doubt that I will ever look at a convicted man in the same light. It really does take 2 to tangle.
B0013TTLDE|2.0|Long, drawn-out story with characters, most of whom are not especially compelling.<br /><br />Societal moors were somewhat interesting, but the final secret was not revealed to the appropriate character.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Appreciated by cat lovers especially, this is a fun film with an interesting, even if it has an unusual and meandering story.  The fairy tale creatures are rendered in a new way and the voice talent is excellent, with Antonio Banderas reprising Puss and Salma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws.  Also features the great voices of Billy Bob Thornton (Jack, of Jack and Jill)and Zach Galifianakis, who plays Humpty Dumpty.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Avengers does what a comic movie should do, creates the comic universe without trying to appear to be in the real world and without making apologies for it when things feel over the top.  Radioactive mutants?  Yep. Super soldiers from military experiments?  Yep.  High-tech powered suits of armor?  Yep.  Mystical God-like beings from another world?  Yep.  Super-secret government spy agencies with super spies?  Yep.  From the first Iron Man film until now, Marvel has never hindered these films by the real world or trying to explain it in real world terms.  The collection of films also pulls off what only comics have done until now, a universe of individual superheroes who interact with each other from time-to-time.<br /><br />This frees up Avengers.  We never get bogged down in the multiple origins of each character.  Everyone learns about the others by being handed a file, so we don't even have to slog through dialogue explaining it for the characters.  This allows the story to get straight to the main plot.  Add in the the stellar dialogue that Joss Whedon has been known for in the past, and this feels like picking up the first comic book for a team made of already known characters, who have trouble getting along.<br /><br />I know that calling it the best comic book movie can lead to a lot of controvesry with fans of Nolan's Batman, and I won't deny that those are also great films.  But they are not, in the sense of how a comic book feels, a superhero, comic book movie.  They are, as many of the Batman: The Dark Knight books are, more detectice noir starring a vigilante than superhero.  If you put a batsuit on Sam Spade it would feel similar.  I feel they are in two completely different kinds of movies that cannot really be compared.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|So if you haven't been driven mad by the Perplexus rookie or original, you are free to forge on to master the Epic, which is another layer of challenge.  Great for teens to adults and makes a good gift.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I have long had an attachment to Jurassic Park.  I was only 14-years-old and in the hospital from a surgery when it came out in theaters.  The first thing I did when I was allowed to go out was see this movie.  The impact of seeing an incredible movie after feeling like I had just regained my freedom was one that couldn't be beat.  Now, I have a young daughter of my own and she loves dinosaurs.  While she is not old enough to watch the whole movie, she loves to watch the scene when they first arrive at the park and see the first dinosaurs.  It is a majestic and beautiful scene that has the viewer get sucked into the magic of the park with the characters.  To a two-year-old, it is the most amazing thing she has ever seen.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version of the films appears to be well adapted from the original footage.  There are occasional moments where the HD causes the special effects to be obvious, but nowhere near as bad as even more modern day films.<br /><br />I did give it four instead of five stars because the second and third movies don't have the same magic.  The premise from the very beginning is that this is a dangerouse place.  There is very little of the magic left, as instead of feeling like we are walking into a world of scientific miracles, we feel as if we are going to Monster Island.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor has done it yet again. I love her music and think I like this album best of all.  Keep up the good work
0810989956|5.0|My 8 year old daughter received this as a gift.  She didn't put it down for over an hour and keeps picking it back up to write in.  It's a great activity for her and will be fun to save and read her answers years down the road.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase more of these books as gifts!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I live at a Caribbean island and I ordered this movie as a Xmas present for myself.  It arrived two days ago…<br />We celebrate- in my country- the Xmas Eve and on the Xmas day we relax a little; so I dreamed, in the middle of the pre Xmas busy days, taking the Xmas afternoon just to watch a good movie related to the occasion. I just finished doing so and I can say that this movie made me live a wonderful and a magical moment. I could have not chosen a better one.<br />I’m planning to watch it again with my seven’s year old grandchild during the next days.<br />I recommend it for people of all ages.
B00000B9BD|4.0|I grew up in the 1970s when Strawbs was at its peak but somehow I managed to overlook this band back then. I recently bought Strawbs' \\"greatest hits\\" compilation CD, Halcyon Days, and discovered what I'd missed nearly 40 years ago. Since getting Halcyon Days I'm gradually buying the individual Strawbs albums. This is the second Strawbs CD I've bought (the first -after Halcyon Days- was Bursting At The Seams) and I really like it.<br /><br />This is a very good album although - IMHO - Bursting At The Seams is a bit better. This is definitely one of the Strawbs albums to get if you like this band or, in my case, have just discovered the band and are exploring their albums.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The rental was clear and showed well on my laptop. It was also a pretty good movie and the first one I've ever rented through amazon.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great music. Decent acting for the genre. A feel good movie all the way around.  Not an academy award winner but fun.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A \\"coming of age\\" label is what I've always heard about this book. After reading it, it's so much more. The way that Charlie expresses his thoughts and emotions about everything is so raw and honest. It allows the reader to not only experience the awkwardness of being a teen, but the depression and anxiety that comes with age. I wish I would have read this book many years ago. It's great for adults and would be amazing for teens as well.
B009157BWU|5.0|very beautiful cinematography along with giving the viewer a better understanding of the intelligence, mannerisms, feelings and abilities of our cousins, the chimpanzees. Really a worthwhile experience for any age.
B001HADE00|4.0|Got this for family member who likes groups like Ratt, and Slayer. They were thinking of buying a digital down load for their music player so this worked out well.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love this game! It's exciting and engaging and hard to put down. My only complaint is some levels don't give you enough instruction and you waste resources having to figure stuff out the hard way. Oh well, I still love it!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|You get a Blu-ray disc, a DVD disc and a code to download a digital copy. A family member watched the DVD and loved it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was a good book. It had good action. It also had good detail and made you not want to stop reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've had this app since it came out, and I can say, it's amazing. I have no problems with lag on my Kindle Fire. This game is far from boring, and I, along with all of my friends, love this game.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|In some of his past books he's gotten into so much technical detail about various parts of his story that it can be cumbersome to follow. In Threat Vector he keeps the story moving along at a pace that keeps the reader engaged and turning the next page. I really liked it!!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|All perfect. great product. Product delivery smoothly. great movie, Natalie Portman is perfect, great performance and great beauty.Great music, original story, with action sequences very well done.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Provided that you leave the Kindle Fire plugged in an electric outlet, you can have an alarm clock and a tablet/book on the go.  Works well.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I watched this with my grandaughter and she was in ah. I enjoyed watching it with her. She is 4 years old.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is verry fun! I recommend it to people who like dragons and of course to people who like awesome games!!!!!!!!
B0081SPK0I|1.0|It won't even open in my motorla droid 3. It comes with a error pop-up that closes right away and can not read what it says.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|If you have lived, loved, and sacraficed for a greater good, you will 'get' this story. Superb acting, as always, from Meryl Streep.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't want to jump on the sexual fifty bandwagon. Finally gave in and glad I did!! Couldn't put the book down- I finished it in two days!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I was always wanting to know what was going to happen next. Loved the ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app all the time. I would highly recommend this app it is simple to use and the display is large
0316187216|4.0|At no point does Red Country pretend to be anything more than it seems to be at first glance- a mashup of Fantasy and Western genres. It seems to look for a fresh voice just by combining the the two genres while not necessarily redefining anything in either genre. As the number of stars on my review indicate, this is not necessarily a bad thing. The story telling is smart and moves at a breakneck pace. The set pieces are impressive and the execution is brilliant. Some of the highlights such as the storm, the Dragon People and every fight with Logen Nine fingers are amazingly written. A better writer would have concentrated more on Ro and her transformation. But, we are not really looking for that kind of book in this section, are we?
B005COO1X6|3.0|While done in the usual King style with excellent descriptive style, this is really more of a short story than a long read.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|It's alright but I like the Big Fish games better...also this one is marked as free but after you get partway through you have to pay $2.99 to continue.
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|Resident Evil Retribution has good actionbut not much of a plot line. It lacks some of the creativity found in the originals. While we expect certian liscense with reality some items are to outlandish to swallow.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and can't wait for the next one to come out!  I may read it again because it's that good :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|it is a good book and I really enjoyed reading it. It was all that I wished it would be.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Need I say more? Just buy it and she will be happy.  This dvd has the whole enchilada as well as the pieces at the end of the show to bring encore to the finale. The performances are true to any production and well worth the extra blu ray cost if you have a blu ray - either way you won't lose.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|This is the first PKD book that I have read and did not really know what to expect (even though I've seen most of the film adaptations of his book), although, not being a SF fan I was not expecting much. However, I really enjoyed the book, and am now starting on another PKD book.<br /><br />The book seems to follow similar themes to that of total recall and minority report (I'm guessing that predicting the future and the inability to be certain of what is actually reality are common themes in his books) and sometimes this leads to confusion as to what is happening. This is of course entirely deliberate and - as far as I can ascertain - is done with very well with no loose ends or huge question marks left lingering.<br /><br />I would thoroughly recommend this book to others - SF fan or not.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Nothing too exciting...was expecting more.  I expected the comedy to be wittier but instead I got a few base laughs. It was just ok...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book in its self is great. The way the story is told really immersive and you can relate easily with the way Katniss does and feels about things. It has some really dark critique on abuse of power and on the apparent loss of conscience over the death and suffering of others.
B009738XXM|4.0|My  6 yr old daughter downloaded it for Xmas and loves this album. Great price for the whole album. Easy to download.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One more entry that makes us fall deeper into the world of Katniss and its needs and darkness.<br />Just as immersive as the first and thickening as far as plot goes, delves us profoundly into the abuse of the Capitol.
0525457585|3.0|It came in the time promised and was in pretty good condition.  It was brand new, so I wish more care had been taken in packing, because the cover was bent a little on the edges, but other than that it was okay.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|this book is less about NED and more about the authors family history. Utterly disappointing. even the part of NDE was very superfecial, i encourge people who are not just wooly non logical sorts, to read better authors like Ramachandran.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Intelligent - complex - elegantly written, and impossible to put down. Sad that Stieg Larsson's death ended what promised to be an incredible series after the first 3.  He has an unusual talent to handle whatever violence occurs in his plots with restrained, spare writing and maximum effect without dwelling on any more details than necessary.<br />Must read!
B009VB97EY|1.0|A  useless film of inane exhibitionism and most likely targeted for an equally inane audience.. What else can I say?
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|i lucky have this one .. good prices & have 3D combo. Transfer picture amazing so clearly and very sharp with a great audio DTS HD 7.1. Content movie and feature are separated. A lot of feautured in it. So why so wait for buy this edition if the price is right
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It did seem a bit implausible but was an entertaining read. Not as suspenseful as previous books. I would recommend it though.
B006BG7RI0|4.0|4K is good but my LCD not support and i think waste perhaps if i have nice LED with 4K. But i love this edition. transfer picture good and average audio. But a lot of featured for this edition. i am happy because buy cheap at amazon.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Preposterous, idiotic, and a lot of fun. Perfect Christmas fare. One of the only Will Ferrell movies I actually enjoy.<br />Zoey is gorgeous and fun, and even the animated sequences are delightful.<br />Enjoy!
B004N6369Y|2.0|Ok but she repeats herself.  Not that it wasn't interesting but just got boring after awhile.<br />Made one wonder what it was like growing up in a hotel!
0345529057|5.0|This was a present for one of the roommates, and he absolutely loved it. Product came in on time and exactly as described.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille is a fabulous writer.  I can't wait for his next book to come out.<br />I loved everyone he has written.  I got hooked when The General's Daughter first<br />came out.
B009C5Z112|5.0|This album is a must-buy for any true metal fan. Jari's compositions are some of the best of our time.
B008M36EEI|4.0|I like how the movie does a brief intellectual teaching of being a visionary and the requirement of faith that needs to be applied to become a full-blown visionary. It may be brief, but the writer is perfect in getting the message across about how to complete that visionary path. Sometimes it takes just a brief message to tell a whole story through the eyes of the believer.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|very simple, easy to use app. very much worth the price. alarm works great and the Wordy skin is pretty cool
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This was just awful, nothing but one long action scene with a plot that couldn't interest me or keep me awake.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Ride the Wave of Live of get Consumed by it. I found this piece funny and real. A reflection of what it feels like to allow yourself to let go and pursue what you feel like doing.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|What a must-have DVD! Love this movie and have for years. We purchased the DVD to take the place of our old VCR copy. This movie is a must, especially during the holiday season!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|A wonderful holiday read! The definitive story of Christmas redemption, and the original is the best version with terrific illustrations.
0756688701|5.0|My 4 year old loves this book and so do I.  He's always asking me what his cars are named and I can never remember them all.  great for reference and cool to see the cars we need to com
1423140591|5.0|For my daughter-in-law who loves to read and she will enjoy this book.  She is and avid reader and a teacher.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Right off the start the movie is a great rollercoaster ride.  I hope the with the way the movie ended that an Expendables 3 could be in the near future with all the Great Action Stars from the 80s and 90s plus maybe one of the current generation actors to join it.  It would be cool if Clint Eastwood could bring back Gunny Highway in the 3rd movie.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|easy to play and addictive...hours of fun and enjoyment.. even my 4;year old niece figured out how to play. not very good tho
B005LAIH9K|5.0|The movie closes many of the lines that were left open from previous movies but I must say that Fing's mom is the TRUE MILF!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Wasn't sure if my daughter would like the movies all together this way, as opposed to having each one separate for her collection, but she is thrilled with this grouping, just the way it is.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Persuasion is classic Jane Austen and a good read. I think anyone who likes Jane Austen's prose and character development will not be disappointed.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I love this series and it's the perfect gift for my hubbie. Each disc is pristene and the case is perfect. And it came exactly when predicted. Thanks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There's no other way to put it.  One of the best books I've ever read.  Tugs at the heart and really makes you \\"feel\\" what the characters are feeling.  I read it from start to finish in one sitting.  I couldn't put it down!
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I remember playing this as a kid and it hasn't changed a bit. Definitely recommend this one for fans of sonic
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Fortunately, I had TiVoed Season 2 before watching Season 1 on Amazon....because each episode makes the next episode a \\"must see\\".  In addition, Season 1 lays a firm foundation for the rest of the series, and Season 2 would not be as enjoyable without seeing Season 1.  We're now more than half-way through Season 2 (sometimes watching 3 episodes at a single sitting) and beginning to worry about the fact that Season 3 will not begin until late next year.  The series is original in its plot, very entertaining, yet easy to follow so that one can care for each of the main characters, regardless of their complex life and character flaws.  Watch it only if you are not afraid of being hooked.

B007WFTFG6|4.0|Its good. Baby liked it. He likes the many colors.  I would recommend it for young kids  under the age of 5.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Enjoyed it.  Will read more by the author. A bit confusing at times but it all comes together. I think you'll enjoy it.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|I love her and her style but i like hearing more regular song lyrics then curses and in some of the songs they seem to be thrown in there quite often for what seems like no real reason but lack of thought.
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|I'm an old fan of Arkady Renko and just went back and read it again. Since I am not a sophisticated reviewer, as are so many here, I will simply say that Smith really has a handle on the Russia of recent years and does a smooth job of telling a story.  He makes you feel you are almost there.  Good relaxing reading. Have read ALL of M.C.Smiths work and most of it is very enjoyable.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I am a big fan of Wes Anderson movies! I added this to my collection and have watched it several times since. It has the Royal Tenebaums dysfunctional family with an endearing story of young love. The cast and acting is phenominal.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I couldn't read this one...I got about 10 pages in and put it down two or three times.  I have finally given up and won't be reading it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had never read this book, and with the recent movie debut I decided it was time to read it before I saw the movie. I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the writing and the story. The meaning of the story really spurred great conversation with many family and friends who read it. Not all like this story, but I think it is really a beautiful one that cause much self reflection and provides great insight through the voice of a hopeful young man who befriends a Bengal Tiger named, RIchard Parker.
B00112GVFO|4.0|Not bad at all. Sort of an Indian Jones type adventure.  Worth a watch espicailly if youare a Primw member since it is currently available as a Prime movie. Decent story and it keeps moving along, doesn't drag out much. Really stretches reality a bit though.  But hey, that is what movie fantasy is all about though, right?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games kept me on the edge.  I could not put it down. What a great story.  I totally enjoyed this book.5stars
B007RE0RR8|1.0|My daughter asked Santa for the \\"Monster High doll with the ice cream\\", so Santa ordered her this Draculaura doll pictured holding an ice cream container. Unfortunately, it came with a magazine instead of the ice cream that is pictured. What a disappointed little girl I had on Christmas day:(
1451695195|5.0|This is a wonderful book and I believe it to be true. I have seen Dr Eben Alexander interviewed on television too. This is the third book I have read on &#34;Near Death or Out of body experiences&#34; This book will help you understand there is a Heaven.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Let's all be honest, the Walking Dead is amazing, but there were a few slow points in the first and second season.<br /><br />Not in this season though. It starts off with a bang, and while others episodes might not be as action-packed as the premier, all of them are interesting and have some great scenes.<br /><br />Also, almost all the characters have changed for the better. Carl and Lori for example redeem themselves for the way they acted in the first two seasons.<br /><br />This is a must-watch for any zombie lover.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The worst movie ever. The best thing about the movie was the dancing. The story line was awful because there wasn't one.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game can't stop. Skimping on the review so I can get back to it.<br />Awesome visually stunning.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Thi game has some nifty graphics, a cool retro theme, and is definitely worth a dollar. I think the controls are easy to learn and the game plays wonderful on my kindle fire hd. You should definitely get this game, especially today at this great price! Highly recommended if you like to race!<br /><br />I really liked the way the game lets you choose a path at different junctures, and continues building from there. I wish there were more stages, but the replay value of racing games is always good, at least for me, because I like to try to beat my own scores.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|My 9 yrs old daughter requested The Parent Trap (starring Lindsay Lohan) DVD for her birthday present, and she was so happy to get it! We watch it over and over again. The story is just perfect for her age, and the movie has perfect cast - Dennis Quaid (the late) Natasha Richardson, Lisa Ann Walter, Simon Kunz, Ronnie Stevens and Elaine Hendrix. We love the songs in the movie too and would dance along with them. Nice entertainment!
