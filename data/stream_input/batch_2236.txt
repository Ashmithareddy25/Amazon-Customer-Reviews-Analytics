B00821OX98|3.0|Took a little while to Get going with story line and money spent on production. Progressed and seadon 2 gets better
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Recommend this to anyone that enjoys history and the 1900's and 2000's time period.  Story line is excellent as well the costumes.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|i love the books and it took me while to get used to the series. i was but richard  WOULD NEVER do that.[ a Sword fight to kill rahl really] In the book it was very traumatic richard had been beaten and had to wear a ring round his neck that denna chained him to a post and tortured him with the agiels. when the sisters of the light came for him they said he must where a rata han to control his majic.Richard prior had sworn never to be confined in this manner again. kahlan said if you love me u will do this..he did it for her but felt very betrayed.<br />Anyways my adult children had never read the books, but watched the series and liked it. So i kept watching it on its own value. The scenery is outstanding, the actors were likeable and humorous.<br />The story is very campy. richard and kahlan had such cheesy lines...cara was over- Exposed . the producers knew she was hot so focused on that. tabbett though made it a character u could almost see her being as cara in the book.<br />The last 5 episodes were the best of the season then it ended.. my kids then decided to read the books and enjoy them very much so i am grateful to the series  for that.<br />kahlan is now on beauty and the beast something even 4 her i could not get into, but i wish the cast the best in all things.
0061537969|5.0|Absolutely a page turner - couldn't put it down.  Where your eyes go, the rest of you will follow; along with the race car you are driving.  Powerful themes.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Max Brooks takes an interesting and thought provoking approach to telling the story of a zombie apocalypse from the eyes of survivors across the world.<br /><br />A Must Read.
B00174TKGI|1.0|The movie simply stopped working(froze) with about 15 minutes to go. Never saw the end. Disappointing. Enjoyed until that point
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This knife is indestructible!  It feels so good in your hands! You are a true dragon slayer with this thing! The ONLY reason  i gave it 4 out of 5 is due to the sheath, i felt like they spent a lot of thought on making the knife, but not so much the sheath... but overall great knife
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I really like Richard Castle; a new author for me.  Couldn't put the book down.  Read until the wee hours of the morning.
B004P12SSW|3.0|I was hoping to see more/better talent than I saw. Too much mechanical performance and not enough real entertainment. I was disappointed.
034580404X|5.0|These books are really good. now i see that everybody is coming out with their own version of this book.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|This was so helpful in planning a big vacation. Plus my Harmon is out of date and this is so useful in finding restaurants and hotels nearby.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|of all the crap Hollywood has dumped on us over the years this show still stands strong.thank you gene and cast
B002DEZXOE|5.0|This movie is the best next thing other being there. This was a time when music mattered. The sound track of my generation.
B00BHU2A7I|1.0|Perhaps Alfred Hitchcock is too familiar, but Hopkins did not do him justice.  However, the facts portrayed about &#34;Psycho&#34; and the surrounding events were interesting.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|I've really enjoyed reading the E-Myth and it's had a positive effect on our business.<br /><br />My only critique would be that the writing style is a bit &#34;waffly&#34; and repetitive, so I found myself skipping so I could get to the good stuff! But I highly recommend it as a read for a small business!
B008R14YBK|5.0|Bridgit is a very talented girl. We will be hearing from her more in the future.You go girl. talented girl.
B0079J28NW|5.0|finally I can introduce my grandson (age 2 ) to the music of the Beatles and appease his appetite for Blue Meanies in the bargain..This film was light years ahead of any animation project of the time. Some of the jokes are a bit stale in 2013 but the music and the visuals are still Spectacular!!
0316223239|5.0|*4.5*<br />wow, just wow. a definite must read, really!! very gripping premise that doesn't disappoint!! if you're like i was and wonder how you can get into a book that has a 5 year old narrator, just try it, seriously. such a unique and interesting take on abduction.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Kind of not my type of game.  Hard for me to play.  I like matching games, word games etc better.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|If you have not read the book, you will have a difficult time following the characters.  Perhaps a movie is just not adequate.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for kids. My daughter and her friend play this game all the time! They even stop their activities just to check on their horse. The only thing is that they are very temped to buy diamonds and money. You may want to put on parental controls.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best yet. Couldn't put it down  Haven't seen the movie yet but with this cast it should be great.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Brits do these long haul intimate stories very well. Well acted, well written (with a few anachronisms) and nicely directed...uniformly superb
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|This movie is hillarious. I bought it for my 7 year old grandson. He loves these movies. Adults will like them too.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I found this book to be hilarious! I enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />From USA TODAY bestselling author Mira Lyn Kelly comes WAKING UP MARRIED, a free book in Harlequin's brand-new contemporary romance collection—Harlequin KISS.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Quality exceed my expectations......looks and feel like a very expensive watch and the strap band is very good quality as well.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This is so much better than the condensed version. Now I see everything I saw on my computer. I like that I can choose
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|Terrible movie, terrible acting, the way they describe it sounded like it was going to be good.  My g/f and I both fell asleep watching it, but for free, what the heck.lol......
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Play this cd loud it rocks and the song selections are excellent Amob should stick to covers the bands original songs are horrible.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its better then temple run but I would prefer subway surfers just because temple run 2 gets very annoying and is very glitchy
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Order came in a timely mannor. DVD case was delieverd unopened and brand new. Everything was in perfect condition. And I was pleased with this season :)
034580404X|5.0|I shared the book with my aunt and both of us loved all three books. This set was inexpensive and arrived very quickly.
B002L9PQGG|2.0|I had to return the first one that came in, due to severe skipping problems. The second one was better, but still wasn't the greatest quality. I have a brand new turntable, and it plays my 20-30 year old vinyls wonderfully without any skipping or sound distortion. I guess they just don't make vinyls like they used to. (The same thing happened with the Babel vinyl I bought).
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|A very interesting and somewhat disturbing take on our role in the universe, especially because it was written so many years ago
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great, couldn't put it down. I love N. Sparks books! Definitely waiting for the next book to come out :)
B000W7JWUA|5.0|What a great group game - you can play this will a small group or pair or with larger groups (if you have the expansion pack).  A great strategy game.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|Words cannot express my love for this show. Package came in a timely mannor and was unopened upon arrival. High quality product.
B00448SE4S|4.0|I'm glad I watched it. Amazon provides great quality movies at fair prices always. The movie itself is a tad strange and I wish they had chosen a different actor for the part of Scott Pilgrim, but it was a good movie overall. I'm glad I watched it.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Did not get to see it ...........it did not work on my ,,,,,,P/C  TV orTablit had to call your service.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Most of the people who didn't like Clapton 2010, or McCartney's standards album are missing the point. This is music where the song, and vocal usually come before guitar shredding. If you want straight EC blues, \\"From the Cradle\\" exists - if you want Cream they have their own body of work, this is unrelated.<br /><br />These are songs EC has enjoyed his whole life, and his singing them is for his own enjoyment - he isn't trying to change your life (again) or hit the top of the chart (again).<br /><br />\\"All of Me\\" works very well, a song with many definitive versions (Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong), it is also where he harmonizes with Paul McCartney. \\"Till Your Well Runs Dry\\" is very nice seeing as most people who know Reggae always think of Bob Marley, a Peter Tosh album cut is very welcomed. Gotta Get Over has the typical After Midnight feeling (also found on \\"Run Back to Your Side\\" from 2010). \\"Still Got The Blues\\" is a very nice addition to the album, with Steve Gadd going into a great groove towards the second half of it. Lastly, after many listens to the record I would add that \\"Goodnight Irene\\" by Lead Belly (a song already with many covers) is beautiful to hear with Eric's voice and lovely slide playing.<br /><br />The songs are strong, the playing is low key and rewarding - It's Eric Clapton finally content in his life, after a career of tragedy, drugs, gains and losses... He is playing to play, not to prove he is still \\"god.\\" If you need proof that he is of course \\"god,\\" there is plenty of it (Cream, Derek and Dominos, Blind Faith, Slowhand, Journeyman, From the Cradle, Unplugged, John Mayall, Concert for George, All Things Must Pass, Crossroads Guitar Fest, etc).<br /><br />Enjoy the album for what it is! Sooner or later he'll be gone, and you'll wish there was a new EC album.
B009SH5JS4|4.0|I love the movie, great quality on sound & picture, but...I only wish it had come with a digital copy.  With all the new movies coming out these days, it seems there's always the option to get a digital copy.  Usually it's a Blu-Ray / DVD/ Digital Copy combo.<br /><br />The product, the service, the movie, all great...just missing 1 little thing.
0821221841|5.0|This Classic Trilogy of the great master Ansel Adams is a must have if you are involved in photography.<br />Exellent !!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|puzzles and seacrches are challenging. graphics are pretty good. ther should have been more than ten chapters. the conclusion felr rushed.  overall I enjoyed the game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't have cable TV, so this is the cheapest and easiest way to watch the walking dead. I absolutely love it!
B000FVE3A2|5.0|I am outdoors for work and play, This watch is tuft watch. I wear it all time, it gets wet or dirty, runs great keeps great time.<br />  I would rec amend this watch for anyone who needs good watch and great looking<br />  Thanks Amazon
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock was one of the best directors and producers.  The video and audio quality of such an old movie was outstanding.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Hands down one of the best books I have ever read! Very inspiring and gives you a sense of hope if you are struggling with any type of addiction.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I really wanted to like this film.  Loved the first three, and unlike the fellowhsip I have actually read the hobbit.  The film is quite good, however I found in the theater I was looking at my watch quite a bit and kept wanting the story to move along.  The scenes in the hobbit hole go on and on, and the portion with the goblin king seemed to take 30 minutes to me.  It reminded me a great deal of Iniana Jones 2 in the mine carts.  They could have cut quite a bit of that out and it would have improved the film immensely.  While some reviewers stated it was the phantom menace for hobbit land, it is by no means as bad as that sorry lump of garbage.  This is a great film that has too much lard added on the outside.  If they had trimmed 30 minutes off it would be a 4+ star movie.
B00005CDNI|5.0|ABBA outdid themselves with this great Disco CD. I love Gimme Gimme Gimme and Madonna must have also since she sampled it for Hung Up. Besides the hits Kisses Of Fire is exquisite too.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|this game is so big that i have to delete all my other apps just to use it<br />just make it smaller<br />then i can actually play it and make a proper review
B007C3TVEY|4.0|This movie is a very strong, very disturbing investigation if the nature of evil and the nature vs. nurture argument. Sadly, it's as relevant today as it was when it came out. The acting is pitch-perfect all around. This will stay with you for days.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I forget how unimaginative these bond movies are.  Looking for something that challenges my cranium a little more than this one.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Solid performances from both Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway. Not what I expected from the clips in the previews. Pleasently surprised. I am considering buying, now that I've rented. This is definitely one that I'll watch again!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|good,  l can use many different types of colors. but not the best flashlight app.<br />It's kinda boring but it is a good app.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|If you liked Gone Girl you'll like this book! Keeps you guessing and it's also (sort of) more realistic than Gone Girl!
B000ID37SQ|5.0|I always heard this movie was a classic and that I had to watch it and I always wanted to but never got around to watching but I'm happy that I took to the time to watch cuz it is an amazing! Highly recommended
B0083SBJXS|5.0|As far as great spectacle movies go, this one sets the bar. The effects are well done and in the service of the story, not the other way around. Acting is great by a superb cast. The action is very well directed, making you feel like you're in an Avengers comic book come alive. And while the story is a little thin (The Tesseract isn't an interesting McGuffin and never explained well enough), the movie is propelled by the character interactions, which are a delight. It's not just a great summer blockbuster superhero film, it's a great film.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this book based on the recommendations I found here on amazon. When I first started reading it, I then got really hooked on it and I just couldn't stop! The story about the war reminds of my own time going through the war in my country. This story brings back so many old memories, the good ones and the bad ones. It was excellent in the way it was written on the perspective of Death itself. I just couldn't put the book down!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is so great!! It's inspiring and encouraging, and even funny at times! But this book tells a lesson, and you might get teary eyed at parts---but overall it doesn't matter what you look like on the outside, but how your character on the inside is! BEST THING SINCE HUNGER GAMES, AND THAT'S HARD TO BEAT!(;
B007EECSFA|5.0|The book kept me in suspense until the very end. Enjoyed the time period in English history. A good read.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Was a very good movie but not what I expected however I would recommended it since it was very good watching.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. Perfect follow-up to the first novel and now I have to buy the next one. Immediately. Thank you, Ms.Collins!
0736092269|4.0|The STA book line is the good standard of exercise books. I've never seen a better illustrated guide, and I've seen numerous. It's easy to read, easy to understand, and inspirational. However--and I say this as someone studying for his Master's in biomechanics and ergonomics--it suffers from quite a few inaccuracies. The anatomy etc. is all perfect, but the form is off here and there, in a couple of exercises quite egregiously. That said, so is every other public-consumption book.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a must buy. Soooooo funny!!! Wayyyy better than Bridesmaids! My boyfriend and I love it, both found it very funny and will watch it over and over again. Highly recommend owning it!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Now this movie was hilarious, each girl brought so much comic diversity to the table.  There were several laugh out loud moments like every time the commentators spoke during competition or when Fat Amy was on camera but there was also a nice amount of &#34;finding yourself&#34; moments and making amends with friends/family moments.  It's the &#34;Stomp the Yard&#34; and &#34;Step Up&#34; for acapella singing.  For a good laugh and good singing this is the movie to watch.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This story is enthralling and charmingly odd, told from the perspective of a man who doesn't recognise his own aspergers tendencies. The characters are appealing and beautifully drawn. I regretted having to stop reading when real life had the audacity to intervene ! Highly recommended reading.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Couldn't get threw 1/2 way of this book, it was more, for a much younger crowd of readers. It was misleading to me. Teenager would be most likely to have a lot of interest in this story. Wish i could of taken it back, but oh well my grandson will readt his
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As usual Patricia wrote a story full of twists and turns.  I have always been a fan of the Scarpetta books.
B0086700CM|4.0|this one is difficult for me. i have to spend more time on it. after all i am 60! Crazy!!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was funny but not great. Not as funny as I expected. One of those that they showed all the funny parts in the commercials. However, my boyfriend really likes it!
1451695195|5.0|Scientists are rarely believers in a supreme being because you cannot prove one exists. Enter Dr. Alexander who lived the proof and has unimpeachable credentials as a first class scientist. I haven't been on the tour he experienced, but I am deep into hospice care so it shouldn't be long...and I welcome it! When a non-believer shares his view, I show him the book. My family has difficulty with my sunny attitude in spite of what I have gone through and what lies ahead, but it is simply because I always believed there is a hereafter.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was very interesting and held my attention with all the twist.  It reminds me of the movie&#34; War of the Rose's.  I did not like the bad language that was used.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this because of the public bragging in regards to this book. I guess it's because, i have a husband who i have been married for a long time and we could write our own passion book. I guess, i was just under peer pressure when i bought this. &#34;Oh well, it probally has helped many other couples who need help in the Oh la la dept.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game it is very fun I like playing the game. The horses look very real all of the stable look very fun
014312093X|5.0|For those who like an intricate thriller with great characters, this is one of the best.  It brings back so many memories of the Cold War era that we tend to forget today.  This is a book that has aged well and still tells a relevant story.  George Smiley, the central character of this and two other novels, is remarkably nuanced - on the surface bland, mild, easily discounted, yet underneath a leader with the right mix of intelligence, courage and cunning.  A thoroughly enjoyable read.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|Superficial look at the very relevant issue of infanticide in India, with other social issues of slums, adoption and cultural differences thrown into the mix.  A mish-mash...did not satisfy at any level.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This was a very interesting and good book. I would wreck a mend it to anyone. Love the pictures at the end of this book.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Awesome movie, good plot, good story, good scares. Kept my wife up all night!! A must see horror movie will make you have that feeling that someone is watching you!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|I love this CD, I have a lot of their cd's and other &#34;best of&#34;, but this one really has a great mix of songs, including Tell Me Lies which is often left off other cd's
B0053JJLLC|5.0|It's such a shame we will never have another new book from Michael Crichton.  He was an excellent author!  My husband and I miss him.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|From the first chapter, I fell in love with the characters that John Green created. I aspire to write as deeply and intelligently as this book is written. It's a very quick read, but I did my best to stretch it out over a week so it wouldn't be over too fast. I only hope the movie lives up to it. I don't know if that's possible.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Considering the years that these performances were recorded I thought the sound and visual were very good.  Robert Plant's voice is like having another instrument in the band.  After all of these years I am surprised he can still talk.  A job well done.  If you want to see two other DVD's of legend rockers, try Mettalica playing with the San Francisco Orchestra and ACDC No Bull Concert filmed in an arena in Spain.  You will not be disappointed in either one.<br /><br />A.J. the D.J.
B00785P2QC|2.0|I bought (and loved) the original Virtual City. I played for days and never spent an additional penny. This one so far is just an excuse for in app purchases. I wouldn't recommend this game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my chair wanting more. All though I am sad for this series to end I Loved finishing because I finally found out what happened
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Easy to download, I like all Jo Nesbo thrillers and of course the e-book is handy for travelling as it is small and light.
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely loved all three of these books.  Couldn't seem to put the down. Hated to see it end.  Will most definitely be reading them again!!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great series, keeps me on the edge of my seat wondering what this team is going to do next. Woo!
1616550414|5.0|Great artwork and very informative on the history of the series.  Best purchase I've made recently, recommended to any Zelda fan.
B000J159N8|5.0|This picture was done very well. It accurately portrays many of the horrors of war, yet demonstrates the warriors code and beliefs on both sides of the battle.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|you will enjoy this movie, but it wasn't a comedy classic. If you enjoyed movies like Bridesmaids, Knocked Up, and What to Expect When You're Expecting, then you will like this film.  Fat Amy is hilarious.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This is one of the best movies ive seen this year. Filmed in one of my favorite vacation spots and based on actual events. Must see movie.
B00555X8OA|4.0|This book helped  me understand what is happening on my mind and body when reacting to almost every daily thing and unusual things,,,,
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun. My daughter loves this game. It's so life like. You have to take care of the horse. Feed, brush, train, buy things for it ex..........
B000LTAY1U|5.0|It's a nice and simple watch no need for battery replacement, the shipment was fast and the price is reasonable.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I am an avid Star Wars fan and have loved the original movies since my parents introduced me to them nearly 20 years ago. I was excited at the opportunity to buy them on blu-ray for such a low price, and I don't regret the decision at all! Shipping was fast and the movies were in excellent condition. Empire Strikes Back looks as amazing as ever, and I am very happy with my purchase!
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|As a fan of the book, I am frankly shocked that the movie was so well done. It was flawless, and the unique format was a genius way to convey the feeling and messages of the book while keeping it to a modest 2 hours. Beautifully acted, directed, choreographed, scored, adapted, cast, etc. I just adored it.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|My 11 year old son LOVES this gun. He has quite a collection of nerf guns, and this one might be his favorite. He likes that you can fire so many shots (because it has the multiple orange dart cases). I thought it would be a little bulky to run around with, but it doesn't seem to bother him. Note that it doesn't come with the max number of orange dart cases that it holds, but you can buy those separately (or you may have some that came with other nerfs).
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I watched this movie expecting a really good comedy.  Unfortunately, I seen all of the good funny parts in the previews.  From there it turns more into a drama story.  If I was expecting a drama story, then I would have been surprised.  I expected comedy and walked away empty handed.
0070511136|4.0|Very good insights and practical guidelines on how to cross sell more to your existing clientele without being too &#34;pushy&#34;.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Hate het hate the ads. They are  non stop. I will definitely be buying the game if ok still like playing in a week or two
1118156307|4.0|Thoughtful book with useful frameworks, and helpful examples. Supported with a few online tools - not many - but I think this will be a handy reference nonetheless. Will update when complete.
B00AFEY354|5.0|\\"Perks\\" is an absolutely stunning movie to watch, to feel--to just let yourself go and feel all the feelings any teenager has ever experienced in life.  Based on the novel of the same name (written by Stephen Chbosky), I was hopelessly hooked from the very start of the movie.<br /><br />The main character Charlie (brilliantly played by Logan Lerman) is fitfully anticipating his first day at school as a...FRESHMAN.  He doesn't know too many people at his high school; the few he may know treat him very badly.  And what makes it even worse, is that Charlie is not your typical Freshman.  Mature way beyond most of his classmates, he loves to read, he actually seems to enjoy school, and that makes his \\"fresh meat\\" for the bullying types.  He and his English teacher (wonderfully underplayed by Paul Rudd) seem to hit it off almost immediately, but Charlie is in search of a different kind of friend.  This happens when he meets Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) during (of all things) Shop Class.  He then meets Patrick's step-sister Sam (superbly played by Emma Stone).  Through both of them, Charlie is introduced to a much older, much more sophisticated crowd.  But through all of this, Charlie is harboring some very dark, deeply hidden secret.<br /><br />I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie and didn't look at the timer on the television to see how long it had been playing.  I also don't remember a movie that made me smile so much and feel so much for its characters.  I would have given anything to have been introduced to high school characters like Patrick and Sam.  The 80s had its \\"Breakfast Club,\\" now this day and age has its \\"Perks.\\"  To say I loved this movie would be a huge understatement.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for adult content, the movie runs 103 Minutes.  Don't miss it.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love, love, love Bruno!  Another album to keep in my mix all the time.  People stop sleeping on this man!
B009FB3WQ4|4.0|I bought this because I love Barbra but I also love one of the singers on it,namely Faith Hill. I love &#34;Send in the clowns&#34;
B001UTW7QU|5.0|have seen first season, hooked on it for other seasons.  especially good in HD.  good character actors, and enough variety to keep it interesting..
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I am a avid older reader of SF, this books storyline is more in tune with the style of the SF books I grew up reading,  good story and lots of action with the twists and turns of adventure. It is my intention to read all of this line Mr. Scalzi's books.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Lame. Time I'll never get back in my life, no matter how much I wish I could. Johnny, are you just in it for the money these days?
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Some of this book was predictable and some curves to. Overall I liked this book and will read the next book too
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|It's a good listen but not on my top play list.  Good mix of different beats to listen to. :)
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Again superbly done and I wish, only, we didn't have to wait so long for the next season.  two words
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Besides the fact I'd like to have it as the locked screen wallpaper - trying to customize this app was difficult and the special features ie: snooze, advanced  settings are previously set without any options to customize.  At least it was only .99 I thew away....
0393327345|4.0|I read this book for school about 5 years ago.  I really enjoyed reading it.  It reminded me of A Clockwork Orange in its use of language.  It had such a wonderful cadence to it.  I ended up listening to the audio-book version as well.  It really helped in understanding how Palahniuk wanted to convey the story.  The book and movie should be seen as two separate entities.  Each has its own merits.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Not as rebellious as the cover tells you, but if you like Bourdain, you will enjoy this book. I wish he would open up more about his past, but I guess that's what his other books, TV shows, blog and endless internet fan-interaction are for.
B008NMT684|4.0|My son loves this game. All the cars should flip and make that silly noise though not just the little cars
B008JOLG7U|4.0|All the songs I like.  Good to listen to when working out! :)  Glad I got the album instead of a couple of songs.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|a most delightful glimps into the times and lives of the subject characters.  Superbly cast and acted. three more words
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I read  about a break up with Bella swan and Edward Cullen when she was giving birth to renesamee that is nice to do because she died while giving birth to renesamee
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I adore Colleen Hoovers other books (Slammed and Point of Retreat) so I didn't hesitate in buying Hopeless. I was NOT disappointed. If for some reason you're hesitating to buy the book, DONT! It's seriously amazing. Sky and Holder's story is captivating and amazing. I could not put this book down. I dont want to spoil anything, so I'll be intentionally vague. I usually can sort of guess where a book is headed, but not with Hopeless. It was such a refreshing, touching story that has stuck with me MONTHS after finishing it. I read it in about 4 hours, I simply could not put it down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, like the storyline. Not for young kids as it's gory, intense, and has adult themes. Buy this, you won't be sorry!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am really enjoying this book as it not only covers Lincoln, but also his rivals lives. It gives great insight into that period of history.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book brings a smile to your face at the end, to what had been a very tragic beginning. Well written and definitely worth reading. A very nice surprise to find a good book when you are not expecting it.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Please include subtitles.  It's helpful for the hearing impaired and brings more clarity to the conversations.  Thank you for the consideration.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My stepson saw this movie playing on their TV at the entrance where all their Nooks are displayed. He didn't want to move further than that so we promised him that we would rent it at home and watch it. Found it on Amazon on our Roku and purchased it. He and our older step-daughter enjoyed the entire movie since they were both glued to the screen and very quiet. For me, that puts the movie at 5 stars but since I watched it too, I give it four. I'm not a fan of Disney showing bullying people (the little girl) but Ralph showed better character and judgment by standing up for her and doing what is right. This was a good movie since kids now are all about video games. They could relate very well.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked it from the start. Fast moving. Entertaining. Kept you guessing. Giving you hope, when you could see none.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The best book I have read in years.  So much truth and information that you can relate too.  You know when reading it that all the information make sense.  I'm in the process of re-reading the book and will purchase the companion book.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Sound of music is definitely one of my favorite movies! I hope it stays around for a very long time. I watch it when I'm down and it never fails to lift me up again. :)
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great mobile game and I totally recommend it. However I also think they should add caves for those cave lover's like me. This is great for home and on the go. Happy hunting!
0307592731|5.0|The book was shipped as stated, and I am giving it a very good use in my class!  Gracias! =)
B007FEZQF8|5.0|A very well done piece of art. Albeit different from the series which is based upon this, the comic is beautifully drawn and skillfully put together for the reader. Very much worth the price.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I found it boring and not my type of subject . I thought it would be more around boardroom dynamics, not bedroom dynamics
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Item arrived damaged free.<br /><br />A great movie for the whole family with a solid cast and several funny scenes.  Worth buying.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Page turner from the beginning. I decided to purchase the book because I loved the flim Zero Dark Thirty. I enjoyed how the book provided more details leading up to the day from the Seals perspective.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Saw this movie at the theater and the grandkuds liked it so much that they couldn't wait to see it again.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Perfect for the whole family.  Amazing! We really enjoyed that it was a surf movie and a learning movie as well. Fast shipping!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written. Gray is a creepy stalker and molester. Didn't even finish the book.  It is not worth the purchase.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|the game is really good. Even though android doesn't give updates like they do to Apple ipads. Now how ever there are annoying and frustrating bugs. I am in a guild but every since the last update i can't talk to or see when my guild members are online. This is extremely frustrating considering the fact that my friends lists says they are online but yet my guild chat room will say they are not. Another thing is that the server error was fixed but now it's back. Please if any one is having the same problem please post so we can get these problems fixed. Besides these bugs the game is great.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Arrived damaged free.<br /><br />This is one of my favorites and I'm glad it's out on Bluray.  I have no complaints.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I loved the Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon, and the Bourne Legacy with Jeremy Renner is just as great. Love both actors.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|I've seen it several times over the years and certain scenes still surprise me.  ALL TIME GREAT PICTURE.<br /><br />  LOVE IT!!!
B008MEM24S|4.0|Yes I like it you should get it if you finished the free one<br />It's just like the free one but after a while you get bored of levels
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is very enjoyable.  The basics of horse care and exercise is what I love about this game and the fact they thought to put that in a game is awesome.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Such a cliff hanger although it is the best book I have ever read!<br />I really recommend this book! YAH!!!
B00371QQ2U|5.0|Arrived damaged free.<br /><br />What can you say about this movie.  It's based on a true story (some say, ha!) with an amazing cast.  Highly recommend.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The movie rocked and so does this app. the coolest temple run game and well worth paying a dollar for :)
B00138Z97C|5.0|I had not heard many of the Caballe recordings so this collection is a gem of classic opera arias and unusual Spanish music with which I am not familiar.  A must have for any opera fan.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really awesome and a great copy of temple run. :) :) It is a very fun and addictive game. Beast Mode Game!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun i love to lay it for hours and hours. I hope that everybody else will love this game too.
B00005JNX0|5.0|Purchased last second for a birthday.  Arrived on time and saved the day.  Everyone loves it and plan to watch it again.
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|As most Star gate fans, I was hoping for more from this series.  Think they should have ran the series at least another season to bring more excitment, and expand more on the story line.  SG-U is probably more real than the other series, put really didn't get the chance to draw more people into the story.
B0088D3PYE|3.0|if you liked the other books, you'll probably like this one too. personally, i found it too similar to the previous ones, so much so that at times i was wondering if i had read it already...
B00280LYHS|5.0|If you didn't know how to find this then you are stupid. My best time to read a Percy Jackson and the Olympian book is about 10 days.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This is a very intense movie and is the scariest movie I have seen in a long time.  This movie has rekindled my love for scary movies and I no longer assume all scary movies will suck.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Item arrived damaged free.<br /><br />Another favorite.  I was not disappointed in the blu ray offering.  Would highly recommend to others.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|well buy form them sometimes i play on mydvd or ps3 play.the do good job on time.it fast on the date this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game ! Especially since I love the movies, this game is perfect for me :)  very creative and a fun way to set your imaginations and designing skills to the test. Enjoy scrat running across the screen in my kindle fire while I try to catch him :)
B008VBYN80|5.0|its a very good game. Just know that it is turn based fighting. Also you can upgrade your units. If you just joined and need a friend on gameloft.-->(xaleb)
0385493622|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who teaches high school math.  Math has never been my strong suit so I approached this book with some trepidation.  It is one of the most interesting books I have ever read!  I think it is actually more about history than math.  I loved the sections on Pythagoras and the Library at Alexandria.  It told a very human tale, about one man who refused to give up even when his peers thought he was wrong.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in either history or math!
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Not intended for smaller children, so if you have a toddler who loves Batman and you think this is a cartoon, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Story line is for older kids and it is rated PG-13...I just overlooked it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was really good.  It was so good I hated to put it down.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Luv it It was so easy to use and I would recommend this book to other people I would have to say it was the best book of the whole series
B0095VP8D4|5.0|This cpu is very good and I highly recommend this to any budget builder. The packaging was horrible and I thought it was going to be DOA, but it worked fine. Very fast and for the budget, beats any intel i3 you throw at it. Just one down side is that it's socket FM2 so you can't really future-proof your machine for the 8-cores, but its probably the best bang for your buck!!
0060245867|5.0|This is one of my favorite children's books.  The illustrations are wonderful and really bring the book to life.  I would definitely recommend this book to children and adults of all ages.  If you enjoy following this little guy, you might also enjoy Patches' Awesome Day (Patches the Dog) by J. Martinez.  Both are well illustrated and keep you entertained throughout the story.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Item arrived damaged free.<br /><br />Not much to say about this but amazing.  I have always wanted to buy the catalogue of their music but was waiting for the box set.  The wait is over and I am truly happy with my purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is fun exciting and entertaining it also helps pass time and it can be a little confusing to buy like New people and things like that but it is still amazing please make more great games keep up the good work.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Way Lovely -- Way Out there... Listen to it over and over and over and over.... and over and over
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wish it would be more true to English tack and not western saddles. I like this app, it's fun.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Tackling some tough topics in a way that is readable, interesting, and unique. Descriptions do this book a disservice. The title does the book no favors despite it being perfect for the book. It brings mind Victorian 'flowery' love stories.  That kind of 'fluff' is not here. This book is smart and harsh at times while weaving the lessons of communication and respect for those who have difficulty being in the presence of others (in this case through the Victorian meaning of flowers) throughout the story. I would not have read it given the flowery connotation if it hadn't been strongly recommended by 3 others whose opinions on books I highly respect.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Great package and arrived quickly and safely. Only issue is that it doesn't contain the first trilogy in their original form, only the modified versions  I have to keep my current dvds to watch original versions of Star Wars, Empire, and the Return.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and addictive, my 2 year old nephews even play this game. Even my mom is good at it, this game is just fun for all ages and the world tour, you just have to love it!!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good acting and story, but I understand not factual  Now that the picture won Oscar, it was worth seeing.  Happy to see it on Amazon Prime so quickly<br />G. Sweitzer
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever and if you don't give it 5 stars may your soul be curse for a thousand years
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a really great app! the graphics are good, and it is a fun game for any kid who likes taking care of a realistic pet. -bambino di paolo
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|In my waking hoursf when I just cannot sleep, or wake up and can't go back to sleep.  This is my game.  I also play when in the waiting room at doctor appointments...boy does this speed up the waiting time.  Love It!!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is the most amazing show ever!!!! Absolutely ecstatic when it came in the mail. I was behind when i first started watching it but once i got the seasons i was hooked!!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. Different types of searches within the game.  I hope to more similair. I have not. spent any money to buy anything and still enjoy the game.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Clever little app for my kindle. I play the piano and use this when I'm with one of the grandchildren to play kiddie songs and to show them what keys to strike. Fairly responsive, good tone, several &#34;voices&#34; to choose from. There are more features available if you want to delve into them...
B00BHMETKC|2.0|The chase seen at the end really blew it for me. Hollywood must have big drama to sell anything . I guess that may never change.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Got new kindle..I am back to using kindle. This usb cord will come in handy later. Used it when my old kindle didn't work. All is well now.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it is a shame tha Amazon sells stuff that is free elsewhere ¡. this is a good app, but things that are free everywhere should not be sold here ¡
B004FDPOHC|4.0|I just wish the song were a little bit longer. As it is, the songs are represented just like they are in the movie.<br />One of the best movies in the last couple years.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The supernaturally smart kids are a stretch, of course, and the Ender behavioral theme of crushing the enemies is heavy-handed, but I really enjoy this book. Fun ideas, a great central character, and good food for thought.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I received a used sounddock when someone moved but I didn't have an iphone or ipod.  It was nice to be able to hook up my android phone and listen to music using this adaptor.  I had to finagle it a bit as I didn't get sound at first.  For example, I had to unplug the sounddock and plug it back in before I got sound.  Once I got it working, it has continued to work.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|Awesome preamps, awesome size. its like a little nuclear bomb tiny little thing that pack a huge punch!! it should have come with a few more plugins and maybe protools also as an option.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting. I mean really addicting and its much better than temple run.  What could be better than that?
B005NS5CX4|5.0|This album was downloaded for my lil princess so she could sing her songs in the car.  Bettr than buying individual mp3s
B003R0MEZ4|3.0|This disc wouldn't play. It said not NTSC or B, can't remember. I had seen 2 of the episodes on tv but could not view the other 2.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a great book. There was always something new you could learn when you read it. I think this is the best book Rick Riordan has ever written yet. The book had me at the edge of my seat at times and at others holding my blanket. I can't wait for the next book in the series. I know it will be worth the wait and money though.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Very enjoyable. A nice mix of English history and drama without apretentious use of words. Would recommend this book as well as the other Boylen girl.
B00330UFQS|5.0|My daughter has become quite the Lady A fan and I bought her this mp3 album so she could sing her favorite song.  Nothing like a 5 year old telling you, &#34;she is drunk and she needs you now&#34;.........I expected this later on in life.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome game for those wait time at the Airport, Docs office or at the play ground with the kids, also ideal for the kids on road trips
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Loved it just as much as the first one. Little slow in places but still a great follow-up to the Beautiful Creatures.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Great book better than the movie with more detail the first book I ordered for  my Kindle i got for my b-day I absolutely loved the book and would recommend it to anyone
B008JOLG7U|5.0|Great price for some music that I wanted to add to my collection.  Spending a dollar per song can get kind of expensive.  This one had some good songs on it and I would have paid more for just the songs if I hadn't found the hits version.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book sucked me in from the beginning and grew more and more suspenseful.<br />I hope to read more books like this.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Entertaining but somewhat repetitive in parts with the O.C.D. but then I guess that to be expected. An over all good read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I workout three times a week and stay pretty active but this 30 minute workout had me sweating in no time. Its perfect when you are in a crunch and can't make it to the gym or if you prefer to workout at home.
1476734941|5.0|For the very low price, this excellent hardcover book just might be the biggest bang for your buck investment in better health (and healthy weight) that you'll ever make.<br /><br />The book expands upon the content of the 60 minute long BBC Horizon episode Eat, Fast, And Live Longer, which originally aired in the UK in August 2012.  As of this writing, the film is available for viewing on Vimeo.  In the film, Dr. Mosley visits scientists in the United States who are exploring the relationship between lowering the intake of calories and protein and beneficial effects at promoting longevity and reducing disease, along with improving mental acuity. The links found in the research are fascinating.  The documentarian then explores different methods of reducing overall caloric intake through periods of intermittent fasting, and finds that a very manageable regime of two days a week of eating 500 (women) or 600 (men) calories will produce quite dramatic results, and allow the person to not have to be concerned at all about calorie intake during the other five days.<br /><br />Somewhat counter-intuitively, persons on the regime tend not to make up for lost calories after the &#34;fast&#34; day, and over time actually tend to develop more healthy eating habits on those days.<br /><br />This very concise and easy-to-read book goes over the material in the film more expansively, and also spends more time helping to prepare the reader for what the experience will be like on the fasting days.  Dr. Mosley's text is supplemented with a nice selection of meal plans by author Mimi Spencer.  There is an extensive guide to calorie counts in the most common foods, and my one minor quibble with the book is that the serving sizes in that guide are all metric, so readers in the USA will have to convert.  It would have been nice for the book to show both standards of measure.  But American calorie guides are plentiful and cheap, including free apps for tablets and smart phones.<br /><br />This new approach to eating is easy and flexible, and eliminates the need to even think about calories for five out of seven days.  Although the book sets weight loss expectations at a fairly modest 7 lbs. per 8 weeks, most users do much better, myself included.  The film is definitely worth watching, and seeing it would make a good first step if you are the least bit hesitant to purchase the book.<br /><br />Try it!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are absolutely fantastic in this series. It's nice to step away from the speed of the modern world and the overwhelmingness of it all and zone out with Jeeves & Wooster. The setting is light-hearted and the humor is fast and clever. A great escape and a thoroughly enjoyable watch, I can't recommend Jeeves & Wooster enough.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Excellent book! I was worried that it would be very sad but the ending was simply inspiring. Any one and everyone should try this book
B00AF6B22E|3.0|- There is a lot of drinking and drug use, but also a fairly good look at the consequences of doing that to yourself (not completely real but not horribly unrealistic either).<br />- You can skip the first 10 minutes or so to get past most of the very unnecessary nudity... but once the show actually starts it gets good prety quickly.<br />- There are several highly stereo-typical characters in the show that are not even remotely believable, especially the co-pilot's wife.<br /><br />I don't regret buying this movie, but it will not be one I watch often (if even rarely).
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think this game is awesome You get to make your own town you can get ponys and make your own town . You also can get coins by playing games.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Well this game needs  super vision it's like stacking cups together fast without even seeing it.<br /><br />  You must try this when u reach 604300 it's harder to get out of.
0316228532|4.0|I like J. K. Rowling's &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; because she shows us that she was worth her Harry Potter's books, and now one more.
B005LAII80|5.0|If you get past the 3D effect garbage and understand that it's not the Stallone version (not even close)... you can start to see this movie for what it is.<br /><br />There are a few very comic-book-ish scenes, but the story isn't as bad as I was expecting. It's basically &#34;Field Testing&#34; with a legend for a rookie Judge who's borderline but gifted in unusual ways.<br /><br />It's worth watching... especially if you like FPS games or any of the comic-book movies... but still really good even if you don't.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I wasnt sure how this was gonna be but its awesome just like any other deftones album so BUY IT!!!
B004XZR63M|3.0|Only concept even remotely useful for my country is the financial knowledge and obviously living with in your means etc...<br /><br />We don't have houses anywhere in this country that are even under  a hundred thousand dollars, also it doesn't mention anywhere how he went from 'working class' to rich quickly, then uses things like 'you know people who have money to lend you etc' except normally people DON'T know people who have even a spare 10k lying around to help out in investments. Of course you do you're now rich and people know your good for it so hey why not.. Book is VERY focused in the US where housing is a atrocious and.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like Temple run; you will like Subway Surfers.  This was a Free download for my Kindle Fire and I couldn't be happier! Fantastic graphics and loads of fun for all ages!)
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this CD after listening to Lindsey for a while on YouTube... then took my family, including my four year old neice, to her concert a few weeks ago. Both are excellent.<br /><br />There are too many groups today that can't figure out how to perform good, clean music... so we end up with a lot of noise and cussing (especially during concerts), but this is one artist that lets the music speak for her and really loves her work.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all ages.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|This might be a more realistic Batman considering that Bruce would probably in bad physical shape due all the abuse his body sustained over the years but between Bane's out of character voice and the stereotypical plot, the movie did not work for me. Let's face it, Batman is supposed to be bigger than life but his suit lacks the necessary armor to properly protect him, the BatGear looks bulky (the only thing with a slither of a \\"cool\\" factor was the motorcycle), and he's a quitter. I used to prefer DC characters over Marvel but why is it that DC can't even get close the the wow factor of Marvel movies?
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Couldn't wait to share this movie with my children. What I thought was going to be a fluff, fantasy, entertainment flick - turned out to me a deeply moving, engulfing and spiritually connective story telling that went beyond mere entertainment.<br />Gorgeous, psychedelic imagery. If Richard Parker was animated, and to what extent- I don't have a clue: graphics were totally convincing!<br />Kudos
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am in awe of Ken Follett. A multiple-layered story that never gets lost. Loved the characters (well most of them) and sat on the edge of my chair when their lives were in danger. I couldn't put it down and was sad when it ended. That's a big sign of a really good book.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love this show.  Was able to watch all of epsiode 1 series on the TV's on demand.  However, episode 2 was not available and epsisode 3 was already playing.  Needed to catch up and this was the only way to go.  I'll pass this on to my family members.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put it down once I started it. Very visual in the descriptions. Would like to see the movie. Very intense
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|zone out for endless hours on a game that takes no brain power.  if you aren't color blind and love listening to one song remeniscent of a japanese love RPG over and over<br />AND over... then this is the game for you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I hate period pieces, but must see them to please the Mrs.  So I started Downton Abbey on the wrong foot.  Its plot, character development, and mood captured me and my attention.  In the last 4 weeks we have finished the first 2 seasons, and will probably finish the last one this week.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book.  Love the plot and hope the next book is just as great as this one one thanks again
B008XG1X18|5.0|too cool.  love that pictures link back to websites so the right person gets credit!  just wish I could actually remember to try all the recipes I get so excited about!
B003Y6GJD4|5.0|This is a great movie. The music, acting and shooting locations all tie together for a great experience. The only thing that I would change is more scenes between Pierce and Ewan, The scenes they share have a great yin&yang feel to them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|See my comments on Seasons 1 and Season 2 -- I really loved Downton Abbey, and so did my wife.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|What a great album, has a very awesome, synth 80's tone to it and lots of feeling.  I love their stuff and this is a great sound for them.  Keep it up girls!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Love the relationships of these characters. As always keeps you guessing until the very last page! A must read series.
B000066796|4.0|there is some cursing and innuendo to make you watch having children watch it, but has the mostly gentleman-like, decent, romantic image displayed in Leopold (Hugh Jackman) that comes back in time to find Kate (Meg Ryan) to fall in love with.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Life of Pi is a great movie, It won four Academy Awards. After 20 munites the action starts with a wild ride across the stormy sea.It is really a movie for teens and adults. Little ones should stick to all the animation movies. I give the movie 5 Stars.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|This is a very fun game to play,as angry birds go but constant advertisments<br />Really get annoying.otherwise its great. Yet i would still suggest its purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I simply love this site...it opened so many doors for me...and the options were endless as to what and where you were looking for.
B003ITZBVI|4.0|I thought the movie was pretty good. Although I still don't see the point of having 2 discs. All the special features are on the same as the movie.<br /><br />I didn't follow the red hood story line, so i didn't know what to expect. After the opening scene, I already knew who the Hood was and had a good idea of what was going to happen.<br /><br />Good movie for a good price.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Intouchables is a must see movie. While watching the movie, you laugh and cry. It is a must see movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We absolutely LOVE Amazon instant videos!<br /><br />Wreck It Ralph is a PERFECT family film. My kids, from age 2 to 17 absolutely loved it. And I'll admit it - as a child of the 80s, I loved it as well.  Great flick for a family night. And Amazon Instant Video is our &#34;go to&#34; for the latest and greatest films. LOVE IT!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I had no real expectation for this book before reading it and I quite enjoyed it. The dystopic society presented is a fresh twist on the normal Orwellian, Huxley societies. I could see this being a good 3 year run of tv episodes on BBC.

B00AGKHEUI|3.0|RUMOURS is indisputibly one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time. Hard rockers admire it as much as soft hearted listeners. Artists enjoy the album as much as popsters. The depth and fluidity of the music on the original album is simply mind blowing.<br /><br />The addition of SILVER SPRING makes any upgrade worthwhile.<br /><br />However, the downfall of this set is the other two discs.<br /><br />The earlier remastered 2 disc collection, in my opinion, is just as remarkable (and equally as valuable) as this 3 disc collection. While the covers, alternative versions and outtakes of the third disc mostly differ from those on the 2 disc set from a few years back, the sad reality is that the live disc is worthless.<br /><br />Unless you are a diehard FLEETWOOD MAC fan and simply crave anything collectible, the live disc offers almost nothing. The sound quality in and of itself is bland. Worse though is that the performances of most of the songs are simply unenjoyable. Almost all of the songs are rushed (played at a significantly highter time signature than the studio recordings) and most seem to be played without any genuine emotion, almost as if the band was just going through the motions to get through another RUMOURS concert. Knowing what we all know now, there is probably a reason why the songs were played so fast... but out of respect for the band I will not indulge in the cheap shot.<br /><br />The conclusion is this... if you already own the two disc remastered/ expanded version, you need not waste your money on this one. Considering I am such a big fan, I have the live disc as a collection piece, but I doubt that it will ever again leave its sleeve for a spin in my cd player.<br /><br />5 stars for RUMOURS (6 stars with the inclusion of SILVER SPRING)<br />4 stars for the outtakes and alternative versions disc<br />1 star for the live disc.<br /><br />3 stars for 3 discs of a 5 star album
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Works as advertised, making a significant drop in CPU temperatures when compared to old dry manufacturer installed CPU grease. 2-4 degrees Celsius drop in CPU temp on average is what I saw.
B002OUQTF4|4.0|Pearl Jam is a very difficult band for me. This album was pure genius. An album of a generation of flannel and fear of AIDS. However, after this album PJ decides to experiment with obnoxious things like the un-tuned banjo and screaming cats. Get this album and banish all thoughts of purchasing any of the others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season three does it again. I didn't think it could get any better, but it did!!! Awesome storyline, acting, directing, and overall performances!!!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Extremely well done reworked visuals.  Better than the originals<br />which I used to watch in B&W when I was a kid.  The remastering adds<br />better colors and some up to date special effects.  A good buy for the price.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Interesting read, I'd say more excited for the movie. Sad ending, not what I was expecting. Thought process was unique.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I rounded up. I read this book because of all the craze before the first movie came out. It's decent. It is a good time and quite forgettable unless you are a teenage girl or a middle school boy who is confused.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It was pretty good - I guess as movie of the year I had very high expectations - that it did not meet.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|Two great actors in one of the best wayne films I have ever seen.<br />Being a John wayne snob as I am, I could'nt pass up the DVD for the price.<br />Vera Miles most beautiful in this film as she was in Hellfighters, another Wayne classic.
B00006AVRK|5.0|This is one of the few shows I can watch again and again without being bored. Fry nails the character of Jeeves right on the head in every scene. He's just magnificent.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Pretty sure I took this girl to homecoming. The sad part of this story is how over the top it is in trying to get across the irony of a &#34;relationship&#34; yet how often have we seen things just like this in the news. I won't give examples because I don't want to spoil anything...just read it and you'll see.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So far I like it quite well. It is certainly helping me learn more about Scripture. Definately worth a try.
B000BISBDY|4.0|Most Cash fans will already have recordings that include most if not all of these songs. Nothing new here; just early Johnny as we know and love him. Good catch for those who don't have any of his early stuff.
B001QKSWOE|3.0|I've read all of the Plum series (19 I believe) and some of the Between the Numbers.  This was a bit far fetched compared to some of the Numbers novels.  If you like monkeys, magically disappearing characters, explosions and the like, then maybe this is a book for you.  I must admit that I woke my husband up with my laughing at some of LuLu's antics.  I think I'll stick to the Numbers series from now on.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If there were a way for this book to contract an STD I would gladly take one for the team to infect it. We get it E.L. James, sex is liberating.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Its an excellent beginning for the series.  Unfortunately the plots and characters weaken as the series continues, but this book alone is well worth reading.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I was skeptical at first and actually only bought this book for my book club,(ironic, I know). This turned quickly into a very good read. I enjoyed every page.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Way better than Quantum of Solace but maybe not as good as Casino Royale.  If you like Bond, you'll love this one.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|How this book is not taught in schools or heralded or not heaped with awards is amazing. It is truly a stunning novel. The different voices are fascinating and it is so hard to believe one person can present such various styles of writing and still not lose the reader.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I have it for kindle. will u please make for ps3 :) please it would be easy
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I like Craig Ferguson. I like how he is open about his life, how he screwed it up then - with help from people who cared - fixed his life back up!<br /><br />In the process he became a US citizen, an entertainer and someone I admire.<br /><br />Don't be a wimpy Douche'!  Read this book and laugh!  You might learn something about human nature...
B005T87QCI|5.0|I play it on my samsung and it is awesome!I highly recommend it to be the free app of the day.<br />:)
B004LROUW2|3.0|Pretty sure this book has like 15,000 pages. It is okay. It's not earth shattering like other magic realists (Gabriel Garcia Marquez). It's not that magical either. And quite honestly the ending was more of a weak sigh. Maybe that was the point...?
B001DF68MA|5.0|Because this thing is the bomb!  Our daughter absolutely loves this - as does my wife!  Way safer than the child riding on the back of the bike.  We live in an area with tons of children and moms/dads pedaling their children all over the place.  Interestingly enough, everywhere we go someone asks us &#34;Where did you get that seat???&#34;  Great product, and would highly recommend!  Oh yea, it's easy to install...took me 10 minutes, and I pay people to fix most everything at my house.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|I did not find the story very compelling to me but I enjoyed the acting sooo much. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix proved again they are the best.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The story line, the scenery, the actors, the direction, the production all combine to make this my #1 favorite movie ever. For those that haven't seen it...check it out. Peter O'Toole hit his peak...Omar Shariff is terrific as a warrior Arab, and Anthony Quinn is also exceptional. The fact is that Sir Lawrence lived and accomplished much of what the picture depicts. Of course this is a fictionalized account, but the characters live on film and the events are tumultuous and exciting.<br /><br />If you are bored with this picture, you ARE A BORE, and impossible to please.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|You don't even have to be a dog lover to read this book; you just need to be human. In fact, psychologists should use this book to determine who is a psychopath because if you can finish it without crying then something in your soul is broken.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great modern day not so far fetched Robinson carusoe a fun and funny read that takes a few jabs at the bureaucracy
B0026O475M|5.0|i appreciate it how my movie was mailed to me in a timely manner and how it was packaged. it was in perfect condition and picture was very good.
030758836X|5.0|We loved this book. It was scary and tense and thriliing all wrapped into one. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Book club spent hours discussing it and what made us feel so uncomfortable about the plot. Definitely recommend it for those looking for something that pushes the edge a bit. Can totally see this getting made into a movie.
B000V6583C|5.0|One of the best all time rock albums. From the beginning to the end each song is a delight in debauchery, alcoholism and drug dependency. The mental health community should be sending thank you letters to Axl and the girls for how much this album rocks making the listener want to throw televisions out of hotel windows.
B008133MDK|5.0|Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch are brilliant. I wasn't super-happy with the first episode (&#34;A Scandal in Belgravia&#34; - there was quite a bit of gratuitous innuendo), but the last two more than made up for it. :)
B00003CXPD|5.0|I am a dance lover, so this movie is one of my favorite of all times.  Genious, talent, and ability comes out of the most unlikely places.  Very inspiring.
B006FE83UE|5.0|my mother was very happy to have this, and she enjoyed it alot<br />she was very pleased to got this as a mothers day gift.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|NUMBER ONE TIME PRODUCT WHICH I ENJOY AND FEEL IS A NECESSITY IN OUR LIVES AND THAT I USE DAILY
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!!! Awesome.  Recommend it to all.  This the kind of game I could spend the day playing in the rain..
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great watch at a good price. It wear it like 10 hrs and it stays running<br />All night long. Style is sweet band is perfect no problems. I would<br />Buy it again.
B00AYF5SRG|5.0|Finally a Carmignola recording with Vivaldi concerto's again. And boy does he deliver, the same smooth sound we are used to from his prior recordings, even though it is here with a new/different orchestra. The orchestra falls a bit back compared to Venice Baroque in finesse but only slightly so. Still, highly recommended and utterly enjoyable Vivaldi sound few soloists can master and produce these days. Next please: Bach Partitas and Sonatas.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like the show but after the first episode I was hooked, now I can't wait to see what happens next.
B0076DELIG|5.0|When you find the black box, it's all explaned! Just find the damn box so it will unlock the chain.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|A much better story than the Oscar winning movie, a really moving story with likable characters. A list talent in every aspect of production. I liked it so much I wish there were even more special features. Hoping for a sequel. A definate buy for me on blu ray.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Bought this for my kids and 4 of the 8 have read it so far. They seem to really like these books. They each have read to me from the book and I can understand why my kids can relate to the main character...he's funny, clever and there is always an adventure to be had.
0718178122|3.0|The Rosie Project has attracted a host of pre-publication reviews, the majority of them are 5 star and readers have fallen in love with the story of Don and Rosie.  Whilst I have to agree that the writing is clever and the story is quirky and unique, I didn't connect with it in the same way as many others.<br /><br />Don Tillman is a professor of genetics, he's never got past the first date and at age thirty-nine, he requires a wife.  The Wife Project is born, Don produces a sixteen-page questionnaire for prospective wives to complete.  Rosie Jarman arrives into Don's life around the same time, she has issues with her paternity and between them, Rosie and Don embark on The Father Project - they intend to track down all of the guys who were in Rosie's mother's graduation class and collect their DNA - one of them must be Rosie's father surely?<br /><br />And so, the reader becomes part of The Wife Project, The Father Project, and Don's own personal Rosie Project.  This could prove complicated, but Simsion's writing is sharp and to the point and the story is easily followed.<br /><br />Although it is never stated in the story, it is clear that Don is Autistic - his day-to-day schedule is rigid and if he has to change even a tiny part of his daily routine he becomes anxious and confused.  There is no doubt that this is a very funny book, some of the one-liners and Don's observations of people and place are hilarious, but I felt that at times, these were pretty over-done.  Don's vulnerability is exposed and the forced humour at times left me feeling a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />This is a very quick read, the writing is accessible and the characters are carefully created, at times the story did veer towards the ridiculous, but the saving grace for me was the underlying emotions felt by Don
B00571F26Y|1.0|This book could be re-named \\"the Revised Atkins Diet\\".  I believe that wheat, especially the Dwarf wheat product that is most used/processed in this country is generally unhealthy...and addictive...but I can't get past the author's utter lack of nutritional knowledge regarding his \\"diet plan\\" and total disregard of the negative impacts of eating large quantities of meat and dairy (even the USDA advises against this) and the countless other misstatements and unsupported claims that people should avoid (non-animal derived protein) foods like quinoa, legumes, beans, etc. It makes no sense to replace one unhealthy food with unlimited amounts of even more unhealthy food.  I intend to seek out more information about the effects of wheat and gluten on non-celiac sufferers...from a more credible source...and I recommend that the readers of this book look to other sources for sound nutritional advice generally such as Dr. Joel Fuhrman's book \\"Eat to Live\\".
B002BWP49M|4.0|The movie condition was clean, no scratches at all. The disc played no problems at all. I saved money adding a movie to<br />the Twilight series.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I continued to watch the rest of the movies after Captain America and Ironmans. This movie had a great storyline and left you ready for the next movie .
B00AKCJB44|3.0|Thought I would like this. but is not one of my favorites.  Kind of sorry that I ordered it, but my husband likes it.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|This movie started out pretty good and then just started to drag on.  Once the plot was unraveled the search portion was kind of slow and uneventful.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Loved this movie! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Great quality. Very much worth checking out. Cant wait for the sequel and to watch again.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I am sure this is an awesome app. I use Avast on my PC. I just like AVG as much and tried it first on my Galaxy 3. So far I have loved it. But I am sure this app rocks too.
1609611543|5.0|If your concerned with your health you should read this book.<br />It has a lot to say about what's wrong with today's wheat.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great. I couldn't put it down. Quick easy beach read. It's a love story like no other.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|sensitive, beautiful writing. there is so much to learn from reading this great book on what is needed to be done in order to make the world a better one for our children.
B0015AARJI|5.0|When I purchased my 2 controllers they were only 35 a piece, which was a huge savings over buying them in a brick and mortar store. They are much higher quality than the 3rd party knockoffs, and will last a long time as long you don't spill anything on them, which is how I ruined my original controller (oops). I actually like storing them in the plastic molds they were shipped in, to keep them protected from dust and toddler hands when not in use.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|horrible movie do not waste your time viewing...bad acting, bad singing, bad jokes...really what else can i say, i hated it...cheers
B0000524CY|5.0|Until this day this movie scares me the most. It's not a blood gore zombie fest like all of the ones today. It's a mind blowing scary film. Wow is all I can say...
030788743X|5.0|If you're a fan of video games, pop culture, anything from the 80s, and things that may be considered &#34;geeky&#34; or &#34;nerdy&#34; you HAVE to get this book. I was hooked from the first page and I couldn't stop reading until I had finished it. It's not &#34;Catcher in the Rye&#34; and it's third act seems a little rushed, but it's still darn good. You owe it to yourself if you grew up in the late 70s, 80s, 90s, play video games, love sci-fi, to buy this book.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Great read, love the series.  Waiting impatiently for the story to continue. The book is always better than the movie (or series)
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great suspenseful read from the beginning to near the end. A bit of a disappointing conclusion but still well worth the read.
0345803507|5.0|My sister yes the one who did not go to Harvard says e l James is a great writer. What a good trilogy with the twists and turns and it's funny.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|There is always someone out there for everyone,  so never give up. Very good book, I recommend it to anyone who loves romance.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book I actually felt like I was really there. my favourite character is Annabeth she is awesome!!!!!!!! She is ooooooo hysterical.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book describes in detail how someone can survive some of the most challenging situations that life can throw at you and you can still become a better and stronger person in the end. This book kept my interest from start to finish. A must read.
0345803493|5.0|Got this for my sister she is the reader of the family even though she did not go to Harvard she likes to think she did with all the books she has under her belt. It's a great book with a big surprise in it that you don't see coming.
B00ATP24SW|1.0|This album is terrible, is impossible compare with the original Stratovarius, without Tolki this band lost his soul, is a shame that Kotipelto-Johansson and Co. continue destroying the name of this legendary group, if you are a true Stratovarius Fan don´t buying this piece of garbage, avoid at all cost.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|These books flow really well.  Once I read Beautiful Creatures I was hooked and bought the whole series.  Great series!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great alarm clock. Easy to program. Simple to use. There are options where I can set alarms and indicate which days to use them. That's quite handy. There are other nice features to this alarm clock. Check it out!
B000A6T1JU|5.0|This movie was a favorite of mine. Growing up I was in my I knew it all phase where I would wear the black weightlifting gloves to show I was lifting weights. What an idiot I was but it goes to show what effect this movie had on me it makes me laugh so much. Life back then was not what it is today.
B005LAII1C|5.0|From beginning to end lauhging without stopping.  A great adult comedy and provides a great time with friends and family members
B005T87QCI|5.0|this game is awesome I watched the movie and loved it this game will excite you if you play it.
B006JN5KBG|1.0|Dont get me wrong i love fright night childhood gem of mine.all the actors,the scenes,the music,the front cover will always remain with me in a special place.if you pay 200-300 hell even more than 50 bucks for a dvd you are insane!!! I prefer the vhs issue.this just takes the fun out of collecting when people buy out a huge stock and sell it high dollar.i f you didnt or would not pay that much for it eventually it would be at a reasonable price.stupid! Long live fright night you are my favorite.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Highly enjoyable movie for the whole family. Disney has put out another great movie.  My kids say this is their new favorite movie.
B0064O927I|5.0|It is Increable to know how technology has improved. Easy way to find steps to set time and know the rest of features that a watch as this has provides
B0095P31L6|3.0|it did not keep my grandaughter interested therefore i could not watch it either.ill have to rent again some time
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds are always fun easy fan games and Rio is no different. my nephew loves this game. Love it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved this Masterpiece Classic!! Can't wait until season 4 is out! Bought this and have it stored on my TV through the great services at Amazon! Thanks.
1416583432|5.0|A wonderful book! Clearly written, with excellent information and just enough personal story to make it touching and relatable. It made me look at my dog in a different, and I think better, light. It has also been useful for training in a way that I did not expect, as I now take into account more of how she would percieve the world. Highly recommended!
B0083P1QUM|1.0|This book was disappointin because it was very graphic i.e. more than usual, took too long to get to the storyline, dark theme, no added characterization of the current characters.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this application, easy and clear to use. next kindle needs to make the pages manager application available. Use daily.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I loved this book. She brings up a lot of serious feminist issues but in an entertaining way. I love that she is also bewildered that there are women who will not call themselves a feminist. I love that she brings up porn,pubic hair and ridiculous underwear. Great book!
B000J670ZI|1.0|Silly and boring.  Probably a good movie in its day.  The story line was too unbelievable.  Didn't care for the rich girl who had everything in the world STEALING whatever she felt like taking.  I don't find smashing into other people's cars on purpose funny or entertaining.  How on earth could a man fall in love in one day -- or a hundred days - with such an insane woman?
B004SBX112|5.0|I love all the angry bird games Seasins is one of my favorite s. Love the Halloween and Christmas. I play them all
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Wanted a Google search for my home screen. Don't know how they can call this Google because it isn't. It's nit just the home screen looks different, the searches aren't as good either.
0385341008|5.0|Another of one of the best books I've read.  Fun to read and I loved the bits of history woven into the tale.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|kill the ads. Sick of ads. when I pay for something there shoud be no advertisement. If I wanted the ads I wouldhave just kept the free version
0760794855|5.0|The book is in excellent condition. it was shipped and received on time.<br />I have purchased a number of books and this ranks with the best. I use the same<br />review (to save time) unless their is a reason to change because of circumstances.<br />I am happy with the service.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|from 4 to 58,we enjoyed it.we do Friday movie nights an look for movies the whole family will enjoy.this fit the bill!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie, although directed at young adults, is infact, a message to us all.  The concept that it can't happen here, the hunger games is reminiscent of a time long gone.  When power is nested in the few and privileged, and the eternal struggle of youth, against this oppression!  One can feel the anger, that youth are in that eternal struggle against that which adult.  The performance of the movie actors is impressive, although, what movie ever equals the power of the printed word, but this does come very close, Ms. Lawrence performance shows that she really does or has read the novel.  Even in a situation of the imminent horror, or the games which one mistake and she loses not only her life, but the life of another,  her utter confusion during the combat of the games, her indecision about the two men in her life, her fear, her anger. and mix that with her utter hatred for all those that impose themselves, is life just taken by the producers to a level that a teenager imagines their life to be!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Bible on the go and so much more!  An easy readable Bible that keeps track of your daily reading and provides basic reading plans from devotionals to specific topics.
0345803485|3.0|My wife wanted to read this book due to the publicity and the simplest source for purchasing it was amazon. Received it quickly and in excellent condition. I read the book also but the writing ability of the author is certainly not as good as amazon's delivery.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|As I said in the subject, It just would not update. It said it was updated but it was not.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I did like this book.  I am a regular reader of Nicholas Sparks and usually I am not disappointed.  However, I felt this story line has been a bit over done.  The book is good, and the writing entertaining, but I swear I was reading Sleeping with the Enemy, just swap out an old grandmother and add in a set of children.  I also found the ending a little on the strange side.  Still a good read and worth the money in my opinion.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was a good movie, I did enjoy it but I don't understand it being 'movie of the year'. That being said, I am glad I saw it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My daughter and I both absolutely love this show. The best ever.She has watched it over and over many times...
B0000085N4|5.0|I have always loved these guys and been wanting this cd for a long time so i finally got it and it was well worth.......it
B005LAIGZU|3.0|this movie has some fun action sequences which is good using real life navy seals, but in between the action is horrible acting and so i usually just use it to skip between some of my favorite action scenes and stay away from the talking and story.
B005HSL626|3.0|this was a fun and new game that i downloaded on my kindle fire. it was super fun for about a week. now i am over it. maybe i am just saying that cause my boyfriend beat my high score.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A good writer.  Not a joyful book.  To true to life of young people.This is the first book I have read by Jodi,  Probably read some more of them.
B008220C38|3.0|Liked  the story, costumes where great, but somehow did not convince me.The splits back and forth where disturbing at times.
1907590331|5.0|This book has been a classic and read all over for sometime now.  I have already borrowed it out to a friend for their enjoyment.
B001HN6922|5.0|The kids love this movie- it arrived in time and they watch it all the time- thanks so much for everything
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|its too repedative (don't think I spelled that right) I got bored after 20 minutes I don't see why everybody loves it so much.
B00AY0A71I|4.0|This is an older comedy But it still is as funny as ever ! John Cleese wrote this movie and is a comedic genius !
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is great, it helped me realize the what and why. Everyone I have recommended it to hasn't been able to put it down.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|The story &#34;idea&#34; was very cute. Arcade games that come to life at night when the arcade shuts down, very clever. However, the writers were evidently not as talented as the team of writers that wrote for Toy Story,  Monsters Inc, or even Shrek. They had a really good concept in the beginning of the movie and you think &#34;oh that is cute, this ought to be good&#34;, but it then it goes off task. There were too many plots...it was hard to tell which character was the lead (because it kind of veers away from Ralph and makes him more of a supportive character which was weird)...It wasn't that funny either...it was just not good.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|the phone works great. it is the same great phone, color, and everything as you would find in the retail store for a way cheaper price. very satisfied
B006X5L6VS|4.0|I had a rough start getting it set to my geographical location-but once set it opened up the universe to me. Not a night goes by that i'm not out on my deck checking the night sky!
B0045XICB2|4.0|yes, the first one isn't the best but the movies definitely gets better through the series. The love story isn't as bad as it could be and is pretty basic when you think of vampires.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Super popular, recommended by many of my friends.  I finally sat down and read through the series.  I read straight through all three in less than a week.<br /><br />To be honest...it will be a while before I re-read them...but that is probably more because I am a guy reading a book that resonates more strongly with a female audience.  The characters are fantastic, the themes and plot exciting, the mechanics driving the story are clever.<br /><br />The third book seemed rushed...but other than that I loved the books.  They got me thinking about gender roles, government power and the importance of being true to yourself...or becoming a baker...whichever.  :P  (That's an inside joke for all the Peeta fans out there)<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone that's got a soft spot for young adult fiction...including young adults.  Or even as a book for someone sick and tired of the lack of strong female role models in our society.<br /><br />Good book, exciting read.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|a fast read<br />wish it had gone slower<br />now i do not remember it at all<br />not as good as first of trilogy
B0034G4OYA|5.0|let my toddler watch it on the plane and he loved it so much so i bought it..funny movie really
030758660X|5.0|great ideas for knitting and some even quick projects as well. Love the kid items of a hat and sweater. Working on the cover project at this time and can't wait till it's done.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Been wanting to watch this one for a while, we all loved it. The quality of the movie also impressed us.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|i love this movie and it is so good for the car because it doesnt have a foreplay like the others..great without having an unpatient fussy toddler lol
B000HF0IIC|4.0|this isn't the best batman but great to watch from the 90's- 2000.  great cast and concept. more family friendly than the newer versions
B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter loves Monster High.  It has a lot if details and fun accessories.  Not very sturdy with how it holds together but for its purpose, its not so bad.  She loves it.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Love Muse so much, and this album was another hit. I seriously played this over and over and over again until my ears rang! If you haven't gotten into this band yet, you should start!
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|Alice N Chains is back in a way. Jerry Cantrell did one hell of a job putting this LP together so quickly after Lane Staley's death. This is my fav Band!!!It rips!!
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|My daughter has always been their fan, and this was a great gift to get her! She plays it all the time!
0345803485|5.0|This has been one of the well described and visual books that I've read in long time. I'm very interested in seeing the film adaptation. I hope EJ continue writing books with these two characters. They are so likeable. This has been a complete page turner. I'm glad that I'm finally finished so I can get some sleep. I couldn't put the book down until I finished all three books. Would definitely recommend to anyone over 18.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a great book for us introverts, as it makes us feel good about what others perceive as one of our weaknesses. As I read this book, I grew to appreciate my introverted nature, and made me realize that this is actually a strength, not a liability. I would recommend this book to anyone, extorverted and introverted alike, because it makes the reader appreciate the fact that we do not all respond alike to the challenges of the world. Also, it would be a great book for extroverts, so they can learn how to interact with us introverts.
B0046MOVD0|4.0|If you likethe Resident Evil series of Movies then you will love this one. Milla Jovovich is great as usual. I like all the movies. I have them all. now.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|My daughter has always been their fan, and this was a great gift to get her! She plays it all the time!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|All this app ever did was get to the file load screen then either freeze there, load then freeze,  or crash. A few times it even caused my Fire to lock up completely. Thank goodness it was free.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|It was both painful and great to see this remarkable film once again. In a recent interview Steven Speiberg explains that to present what the Holocaust was really like would be impossible. No one but a survivor could possibly understand.<br /><br />I was fascinated by his explanation of using metaphors in imagery to express larger issues, as an example he talked about the little girl with the red coat who we see twice and in the second shot being lead away to her death in the gas chamber. The use of red was the only color in the black and white film and goes unnoticed  and ignored.<br /><br />His comparison of this sequence of images was to show how the world, especially the United States being well aware of the atrocities did nothing. It was a striking point.<br /><br />To see the Holocaust through the eyes of a Nazi party member, played with amazing complexity by Liam Neeson is brilliant, especially as we see him change from an opportunist whose sole ambition is to  make money off of slave labor to one of the great humanitarians who risked everything to save the lives of those doomed by a regime of unprecedented evil.<br /><br />It's a fearless tour de force performance.<br /><br />Seeing the film again, the performances are impeccable, Ralph Fiennes is horrifying as the notorious, living personification of sadism Amon Goeth. In turn Ben Kingsley is heart wrenching and spectacular as Itzhak Stern, Shindlers accountant and later Ali is perhaps his finest hour on film.<br /><br />Shindlers List is a remarkable and dreadful to bare look into the largest and most horrific mass murder in history. In the light of the recent discovery of over 400 additional death camps Shindler's List has never been more relevant.<br /><br />I'm pleased to see the rating reduced to PG-13 - for to bare witness is to remember. To not remember the past means we're doomed to repeat it. A must see film by one of the most prolific and visionary directors the world has ever known.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved the writer...wish he were still with us....great series!!!!  Looking forward to the next movie!!! Always mysterious and I absolutely loved the main characters!
B009JBZH54|5.0|My daughter's best friend, loves these movies, and my daughter was looking to get her best friend something. Founding out her best friend had just gotten a blu-ray make this perfect for her!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This is the type of movie that if you're watching (but not paying attention), you will be left without the true meaning the the story line is trying to tell you. I would even go as far as recommending the viewer to watch this movie multiple times, on a minimum of 7 days intervals.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a good book. The plot is intriguing and the conclusion poetic. As a literary work, the book is relatively simple but effective in conveying its ideas and message. Despite various plot points resting on concepts and actions that lack feasibility and reason, Ender's Game manages to tell a great story in a pleasing fashion. It provides an accessible entrance into the genre of science fiction for young readers.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Even though this was a work of fiction, I became so involved in the story that I actually had to go back and make sure that it was indeed a work of fiction.  I wanted to believe that it was a true story ..... Martel grabbed my attention and wouldn't let go.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My younger daughter, loves this game! She has a hard time putting it down, and enjoy it's so much! A must have I say!
B007IK44CK|5.0|The story was written very well, the action scenes are stunning, there is some funny parts (to break the tension), good actors team and Tom Cruise did all the scenes without stuntman and minimum CGI, so, is perfect. I loved.
B008Y2X78S|5.0|This is the best series going on cable TV - bar none!  I can't wait until the next season starts.  Episodes also available via Amazon pay per view videos.
B00632HWOG|2.0|On Sunday we tried to set up the product but we are still unable to make it functional!  Help!We haven't been able to rate the product since we have been unable to use.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My son loves this and I must say I do as well.  The construction is very sturdy and has a nice weight to it.  A much better quality figurine as compared to others I have bought.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though I grew up during this time period I still thought my heart would stop on a few occasions even knowing the outcome.  The movie was very well done.  It is a shame Ben Affleck did not get nominated for a directing Oscar.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|She is an amazing writer, and this book shows her true colors.  I found myself listning to her voice narrating (maybe it's because of all the 30 Rock I've seen).  It's a book about everything and anything; and depending on the moment you're found in your life, you will get her messages.  Simply amazing, would recommend to anybody +16 yrs old.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Granddaughter loves it! A little hesitant  because buying things on site not really clear.And it's hard to have a 2nd grader stop to tell you something has to be bought.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing i love the whole series and i would read them 50 thousand times i love the hunger games books!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fun to read and get tantilized, but not a novel that will go down in history other than it gets bored housewives some excitement.
B007UXSPK2|2.0|It's painful.... So so painful. I actually liked the first Mission Impossible but this appears to have been written by a 8 year old that was fed a 5th of Jack and left to play Bionic commando on the NES for 7 days with no sleep. (Bionic Commando RULES by the way)<br /><br />Seriously.... Did this movie make any money? I've seen car wrecks with better stories and more finesse. If this movie cost .25 to rent, I would have felt ripped off. Only Bloodrayne made me want to punch myself in the manhood more than this.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This series is a great read.  Once I started the first book I couldn't set it down and promptly read the next two within days.  I can't get enough of it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My five year old keeps trying to steal it whenever I'm playing it.  It's fun and challenging at the same time b/c the levels get progressively harder.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I can't pick which one is a favorite! BRAVE I guess since I've listened over and over to. He's changed a bit to be more modern, but still the angelic voice says it all. He has never disappointed me in his music. Truly a voice for the ages.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The moment when you see he can slender walk and not only teleport I screamed. It was a pretty good game.
B00000DLUV|3.0|So, I just want to know who was the brains who decided to leave off Too Much Heaven on the CD?
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Too mindless, it was interesting for a few days then I moved on.  It was worth the price (free), just to say I tried it.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I got the request to review this purchase before I actually received the item.  Good thing I have seen it a thousand times and LOVED EVERY SINGLE MINUTE.  One of the best movies ever.  I watch the restaurant scene with Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci over and over just to hear Ray Liotta laugh.  Buy this movie now.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|After reading a certain book series for 16 years, it finally ended and I was in need of another series. The Sorcerer's Ring series is an amazing tale and envelopes you in the story line. It doesn't take long to get lost in this new world created by Morgan Rice. I'm addicted and can't wait for the next book to release.
B003L20ICE|2.0|Both DVD's have a locked code so I can't play either.  I didn't notice that I should have specified they were coming to Australia and we are zone 4 and the dvd's are zone 1.  I think this is something that Amazon should have picked up.  Will think twice before I order anything else.
0062238868|5.0|A down to earth---American Hero--seems to explain the path of a sniper becoming the deadliest of all shooters.<br />How I admire and respect this man among men.
B000089CJI|5.0|I am in love with this CD.  If I could, I would marry it and bear it's children.  Go buy it.  That is all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Recommended by co workers.  passed on the great reviews.  I cried it was fantastic.  Will want to read more of the nicolas<br />sparks books
B002W1UEW4|3.0|With the sequel upcoming, I wanted to be ready. For a movie with Channing Tatum, it's not all bad. It sets the scene for what should end up being a viable series of movies.
0525953728|5.0|The death of a mass murder -----the extensive plans----the shear toughness and heroism of our navy Seals is so often swept under the rug-----and I have never understood that until now--secrecy is imperative for an Operation and The Seals Safety
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I read the books (that have been released) three times and I love this show.  I heard a lot of complaining from friends about the second season being so different than the books.  I have to say that I completely disagree.  I love it!  I see that the changes they made were necessary, and I feel like I understand the books better knowing what they deemed important enough to keep in the show.  The only way it could be better is if they brought Drogo back from the dead.  RIP my sun and stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it easy to win and lose at time.  lot of fun I I am learning the new harder ones now and how to go against someone else
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was a real page turner. It presented the moral dilemmas of loyalty to one's son or loyalty to the truth and one's profession. The murder of amiddle school bully sets off a cataclysmic destruction of the accused boy's family.  Does the defendant have a \\"violence\\" gene? Will his lawyer fatber remain ethical or involve himself in a cover-up? As the parents become victims themselves of this situation can their marriage survive? You constantly wonder how you might deal with this tragedy - this predicament.<br />I highly reommend this intelligent and intriguing novel.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|The crossfire series is the best, I think it is on a par or better than Fifty Shades, so can't wait for the third to be released.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm only thirteen and this is my second time reading this book I just love it might read it again
B0094BB4TW|5.0|great to look who is doing what  I love the convenience of using it in the livingroom.  This way I keep company with my husband while he watches tv.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show, only a few tweaks and it would be perfect. For example... if everybody is dead... it isn't stealing
B00866H7SS|5.0|The crossfire series is the best, I think it is on a par or better than Fifty Shades, so can't wait for the third to be released.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I downloaded this from the app store to my tablet and it errorred out. When I complained to Amazon they stated &#34;you should only download directly to your device&#34; Real good customer service. This is why I don't use the app store very much.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple run is really fun but also addictive I say that because you just keep trying to beat your high score but I love it you should check it out!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Touching book that will seriously touch your heart and rip it to pieces while making you laugh at the same time
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I chose this book because I have read all of Mitch Albom's books. I really like his work. It will make you stop and think.
0062082353|4.0|Great book, amazing story, cruel, real, impressive, an example of heroism. I suggest to improve the paper sheets quality. Anyway congratulation.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|The one and only for everyone.<br /><br />Iconic music to keep your spirits up<br /><br />Start it up and remember the time
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Im only 16 and this game my grandma likes and there is very little she likes of the games i have
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book makes you want to keep reading all night. You just don't want to stop reading it.  Great love story.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I am amazed on how hard it works you. I was out of breath for sure. Can't wait to do another workout tomorrow
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love mahjong.  i don't find this one very challenging.  could be space problem. the computer and ones you buy and load are  so much better. but do love the game.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love it because when I have homework it helps. Any fraction homework or any everyday fraction work. I love it!
B002PNAY9C|5.0|One of the best books I have ever left. I think the Christopher Paolini finally got it.  It wasn't ever boring.  The first books got boring at some points, bit Thu  book was good the whole way through. It's definitely worth 5 stars!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone. It is so easy to become emotionally involved in it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|what can you say about solitaire. always fun to play. only play klondike, have not tryed spider or the other ways.  love it!!!!!!!!!
B00BESCJII|5.0|This film reminded me of my youth — what seemed at the time like soaring highs and traumatic lows. It also helped me understand my teenage son's life today.
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|Fun concept, great dialogue.  Some of the effects are typically low-brow and the Torchwood hub set has the same amount of coolness/&#34;fake-yness&#34; of the rest of the show.  Wasn't able (or drawn) to finish the whole season at one sitting, but it's great fun for a couple of hours!
B00BLGZDYA|1.0|I did not finish it because it was such a gross story. If you buy this, you will regret it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book and I Highly recommend it. If you have ever loved someone or lost someone you love you will love this book.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|One of the most difficult books to read.  I feel like I'm back at grad school, with a dictionary in one hand and the computer to do research in the other.  I am determined to finish it!!
B004F5GLJ0|5.0|Kristen Stewart....  What can I say?  She is awesome and has stolen my heart.  I just finished all 5 movies in 3 nights.  One, two and two.  Each movie is intriguing in and of itself.  They all make more sense and are better understood when watched from first to last.  Did I mention Kristen Stewart????
B007REV4YI|5.0|I accept those who put Goldfinger or Casino Royale over this one, but it's my favorite.  In his three movies, Daniel Craig's Bond has grown from a new 00 agent to one who is older, possibly past his prime.  Bond is more human in this movie, and yet still manages to come out on top.  There are some cool surprises and some sad ones, but nothing matches the interaction between Bond (Daniel Craig) and Silva (Javier Bardem), with the emotional content all tied to M (Judi Dench).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|that you can run jump and do not have to turn your game that is why the game is so awesome
B00136NUG6|5.0|like the sound. I am from that era and it is good to hear some of the retro songs. Downloaded with ease.
B00942V1J4|5.0|Kristen Stewart....  What can I say?  She is awesome and has stolen my heart.  I just finished all 5 movies in 3 nights.  One, two and two.  Each movie is intriguing in and of itself.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have always liked the musical Les Miserables, the movie is better than I expected.  Quite a great production...  Amazon sent the cd to me in 3 days (as requested) and all is well...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is good for passing time but it takes a long time to unlock games. Some of the games are excellent arcade games.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|bought this and the plug so I could put one set by my chair and one on the table by my bed.  no more reading all night and running out of battery just before the end.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|We went to Amazon to download the episodes that we missed. We really like dynamics between Holmes, Watson, and the interesting members of the police. This is defiantly the best derivative of Arthur Conan Doyle we've seen.<br /><br />Given the violent nature of the crimes they do a good job of not overdoing the on-screen violence.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|I have heard good things about Brave, and I thought the animation was lovely, I just found the heroine to be a bit of a brat. To me she seemed quite spoiled, she was given a lot of love and attention and seemed quite privileged. She accepts all but none of the responsibility.  When it comes to being responsible, she runs away, never owning up to her actions. She wasn't compassionate, she wasn't considerate of others, and aside from shooting a bow, she didn't have a lot of talent at much of anything. I didn't find her that brave. I think this could've been written differently, so the heroine's rebellion would seem a bit more justified, and less the actions a form of tantrum. Yes, I agree, being forced to marry someone against your will is a bad custom. But so is hereditary leadership, royalty, an privilege. I didn't notice that she was all that upset about her privileged life in the castle. In fact, her and her brothers seem to take advantage of their good fortune quite often, plaguing the servants, and wrecking the kitchen. To me, she seemed quite spoiled. Rebellion against custom can be brave- but it is more brave to rebel against something that you personally benefit from. Getting upset because you are forced to marry a prince against your will, while enjoying your privileged life and more personal freedom than most people of your time.. I found it tough to sympathize with really.<br /><br />This was an okay film. I liked the mother. Prolonged bits involving the mother-turned bear went on to long. Probably would not watch it again.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The author spins an awesome story about forbidden love at its most extreme. Can not wait to read the next book in the series.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought one of these earlier and got another one to keep in the car.  don't forget to buy the plug that connects it to an electrical socket.  quality merchandise.  definitely not one of the cheaper made, but just as expensive, &#34;this works with everything&#34; cables offered elsewhere that will not stay plugged in.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|my kids love this one.  saw it at the theater and purchased on amazon.  Sarah Silverman steals the show.  Awesome.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|I really like all of the 3 volumes of Green Day's current release, but this one is the best.  Very lively.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|A very funny movie with great actors/actresses! Keep me intrigued for the whole duration of viewing it for the first time in 2013.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great book. Well worth the price paid. The only issue I had is that I am not an engineer, nor a math guy. I was very impressed how well integrated the creative aspect of the book and the technical parts were. I got bogged down in parts but very much enjoyed the read.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|My favorite bond movie yet.  I always love back story stuff, and this one has just the right amount.  Great.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Anyone who grew up watching this trail blazing show will love the revisit!  It's also fun to see how many of the show toys have actually become a reality today.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is truly addicting! i love the creepiness because it creates a dark tone, but its not terrifying. the mini games are lots of fun andbeing on advanced mode has even got me taking hints from time to time. all in all dark arcana is a great game!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love it. I added it to my new kindle fire. Its always good to have Google by your side.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Just a Bond movie and one I might not remember for very long.  I do appreciate the decreased campiness of these latest Bond films.  Daniel Craig is good as Bond and brings a visceral edge to the character.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I read a lot of Grisham's books, and I'm really loving this one. One of his best, in my opinion.
B0002BO05S|1.0|if it wouldn't cost me more to return it than what the video is worth i would, the quelity is terrible,i couldn't even watch the movie
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I have not played it yet. My son purchased it. He plays it a lot and he seen to enjoy it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After being repeatedly told by several of my friends how good this book is I finally caved and bought it.  Even then, it sat in my To Be Read pile for several months before I got around to reading it.  When I did, I was amazed.  The first short story in the Omnibus totally and completely sucked me in and I finally understood why my friends had been raving about this writer.<br /><br />Hugh Howey doesn't spend a lot of time explaining this world he has created.  He just shows the reader what the world has become and most importantly how it effects the people living in it.  Little by little you are given a glimpse of what this post-apocalyptic world has become for this small group of people.  From Holston's internal pain and sorrow to the anger and betrayal felt by the people of the down- deep the reader is immersed in the life in the Silo and the tragedy that this life brings.<br /><br />This book has taken its place among some of the best I have ever read!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best dictionary.  Recommended to my friends to use for Words Sith Friends.  Very handy and easy. GREAT!  Try it.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. You just get sucked into the story. Once I picked up this book and started to read I had a hard time putting it down again. The lore entwined with the action in the story is also pretty interesting in my opinion.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|The choice of music for this album is very good. It shows off Andrea's wide range of vocal skills. David Foster did a remarkable job with this album, also.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It kept the husband and kids ages 12-4 entertained for hours. The friends came over to play also.  Great game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this book. It will make a great movie. Kept me guessing right up to,the end and provoked discussion with other family members who had read it. Like Dark Places, it gets a little wonky and you have to suspend belief, but Ms Flynn does a much better job of tying loose ends in this novel than in her other one. A really good beach read.
B001TODCII|5.0|I like the movie right from the beginning, it kept my attention. It's a great movie, and I would recommend it. It's a must watch.
1616550414|5.0|I was really excited when i heard that Hyrule Historia was being translated into English and brought over to North America. This book has such amazing art in it, I have looked though it over and over again and I am always blown away. I &#60;3 this book.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I liked the book - took a while to get into the cadence, but then I looked forward to how each problem would be solved.
B0027MJU00|2.0|After reading Gone Girl, I thought I would read this one. It was good until the last quarter of the book where it descended into the depths of absurdity. It was as if the author could not come up with an ending and so threw in the whole kitchen sink!
B001A3GSFW|5.0|Just fun rock and roll.  Nothing deep or existential.  Tongue in cheek lyrics that put a smile on your face with catchy backing arrangements.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|This album is probably the best punk rock album to come out in the last 10 years. I can't stop listening to it. it's so damn good!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I got it as a gift, so i havnt seen it but they keep telling me how great the movie is and the extra features is even better.
0385349947|5.0|I'm an academic with advertising industry experience. My research is on the under-representation of women in advertising creative departments globally. The average number of women in creative across the world is under 20%. In creative management it's far worse. Some say a low as 3%. But, my classes (and those of my colleagues) are overflowing with women. I'm teaching a class this semester, which explores this very topic. I'm also lecturing on it while a Visiting Professorship in Italy (where women make up only 7% of all advertising creatives!). I blog about it too, at Grow Cultural Geography.<br /><br />When I saw the previews for the book I changed my syllabus (in mid-semester) and added it. I thought I'd like \\"Lean In\\" because it is about inspiring women to lead. I do not like it. I LOVE it. Period. It's smart, honest, inspiring and written with soul. Everyone who loves a woman should gift her this book. I know I will and it will now be required reading for my students. The world will be a better place with (more) women and men leading us into the future.
1601251505|5.0|After playing this system for 4 years now, it has grown beyond its 3.5 roots and become a fantastic part of D&D in its own right.
0446547573|5.0|but there was really no ending&#62; That was unfortunate and the only problem I had really. Must be a reason
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this series and I love this book! I would definitely reccommend it to anyone of any age. Such an awesome read!
B00A7Q814Y|2.0|I was hoping that DG would live up to its richly deserved reputation and put the CDs in their original jackets.  But obviously I was hoping too much.  The collection is great, but so cheaply packaged that much of the value of collecting this set is lost.  The CDs are housed in generic, cheap-looking paper jackets, without their beautiful original illustrations/paintings/pictures.  Unlike DG's superb Karajan 1960s collection, which uses original jackets, this set will unlikely become a collector's item.<br /><br />My advice: don't buy if you do not value, as I do, the artistic beauty of the original jackets.
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|big fan of pink floyd and wanted this for my collection,the album is awesome,i love it,thank you all very much
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I absolutely love this tv series.  It was a heartbreaker when Andy Whitfield passed away but Liam is doing his best to help us forget him.  It's an awesome movie.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|i loved the movie and enjoyed watching it more than once... I would love to own this movie.  and I will one day
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this for the grandkids.  I tried it but keep killing myself.  The kids really enjoy it.  I get nervous playing video games.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This was for my husband.  He loved it.  It is one of the best collections of songs by Diana Krall.  She has many cds out, but we liked this combination the best.
0205313426|5.0|These were purchased for the office and have been a help more often than not.  My boss has us all purchase one.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Totally hooked on this show! I highly suggest everyone watch this show!!! Jax and Gemma are my favorite!! Such bada**es!
B0042JTAI8|1.0|Started well but didn't deliver, long winded and empty, I just could not go on until the end. Laborious. I give it one star because I have to.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|It's a shame this wasn't picked up and carried on for more seasons.  Fun and funny!  It's just as good as Star Trek and should be watched for the same reasons.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is really fun and easy to learn! I enjoyed playing and caught on quick! The characters are so cute! Thanks!a lot like temple run
1468179993|5.0|This is a great book for anyone in public speaking regardless of whether you intend to do a TED talk or not. Any speech can be given in the structure of a TED talk.  It breaks down a TED talk into the various sections of a speech:  pre-open, opening, post-open, middle, end, and final closing.  The book is well sprinkled with examples of what to do and what not to do. The author rewrites what not to do speeches into what to do ones. Throughout the book, the author directs the reader to various TED talk videos so you can get real examples.  A very worthwhile read for those that want to present well.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|but this version of Total Recall was a real letdown.  This 'remake' does not improve in any way upon the Schwarzenegger film.  Setting this on Mars was even a lot more plausible than subterranean Earth.  You, know what, this was Total Garbage.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|thanks nmg for this awesome game! this is one of the best free horse games there is. I think that there should be other free horse games like this one.
B002BWP49C|1.0|Everyone knows Twilight blows. This movie is so dumb that I haven't even watched it yet. I hate it. The guys are all women.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This is a great book. It is well researched and very detailed. There is no deep economic theory here, no advanced mathematics. The writing style is easy to read and light.  The basic theme is prosperous economies are inclusive economies and poor economies are extractive ones. No surprise there.  The value of this book is the author looks at numerous countries around the globe, and shows why they are poor or rich. It goes deep into the historical roots of these countries, explaining how their political institutions coupled with economic polices create an inclusive, extractive, or absolutist environments.  It also details how and why these environments change over time, some swinging from inclusive to extractive and vice versa, and what happened to cause this transition.  The only real downside to this book is its length. There are so many examples and examinations that the book demonstrates its points over and over again, and is longwinded.  This is definitely a book worth reading.
B001HN697M|4.0|good movie, good sequel,<br />i don't like long surveys....mmmm mmmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmm mmmm mmm mm mmm mmm mmm
B0093ST02E|3.0|slow in starting and a bit whimsical. It just sort of drifted along without real life thoughts. Just fanciful thinking.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Helps me access zip drives on my Kindle Fire that I normally couldn't access. Makes my life easier and my music listening more enjoyable.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|While the movie was great and stayed very close to the book, the book was richer and more vivid in details of Pi and what he suffered.  Pis' mental anguish was as great as the physical things he went through.  It's a book that should be read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have watched every episode of this series.  From day one.  Excellent.  I highly recommend it to any horror or zombie fan.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app delivers everything I wanted it to. LOVE the voice notification detail. If you are looking for something that shows up on your main menu of your kindle fire hd, this is for you. I like that this app breaks down each function on the kindle fire hd and tells you accordingly.
B006MQRLSA|2.0|I guess I don't appreciate the game enough to appreciate the story.  Not for me, but seems like it would be great if you love the game.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This film is a must see! Very well written and visually stunning. This has been a staple in our Bluray collection.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Love Mr. King  Love the trip back in time Loved stop out to Derry and seeing the kids again Beep Beep
B008S68ZTG|5.0|Although there are at least 4 or 5 Oldfield albums I like better than QE2, it's still awesome, and the bonus disc that comes with QE2 has several great cuts on it that make it well worth getting the Deluxe Edition.  While it was also good to get remastered cuts of Taurus 1 and QE2, I'm especially fond of the live cuts of Taurus 1, Sheba, Conflict, and Ommadawn.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love to love the lovable characters and also love to hate the hateable characters!  Everyone adds to this great show of times gone by.
B005ETA5K2|3.0|I have the Alfa AWUS036NHR and Alfa AWUS036H. The AWUS036H has better reception. Using the same antenna with both and the Alfa AWUS036H always wins.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|It was a decent story but I've read so many that were much better written.  Can't say I'd choose another by this author
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A good start to a great series and character.  Great character building, plausable scenarios and enough action to keep you coming back for more.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I guess it needs more to it. it only has 2 places to go and the papers are in the same place everytime. so its not that thrilling and spine chilling the second time you play it. it needs more but its definitely good to have your friends play and watch their reactions! im glad i got it for free and didnt pay cause i dont think its worth the money.
1451695195|2.0|This is just another description of one man's Near Death Experience.  But we are to give his description more weight because he is a Neurosurgeon?  Kind of like a book named Proof of Sasquatch because it is written by a zoologist.
0061339202|4.0|If you'd like to understand the true underpinnings of happiness, this is a must-read for you. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars was because of how dense it got at times. Still absolutely worth a read!
B0027BVMSY|4.0|Great movie. Action never stops! Daniel Craig is a perfect James Bond. Second only to Sean Connery.<br />You won't be disappointed!
B00B49L7JY|4.0|An incredible story.  This movie just goes to show how truley divided the world is.  How in one world your poverty level and in another you can be bigger than elvis.  Its amazing and disturbing !  But what an incredibly humble man!!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I had a young person here to watch it and they loved it.  I though it was OK.  So mom and dad's can watch it with them and enjoy it also.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The first couple of chapters were good but all of the chapters kept the same theme.  He is a true hero but would have been better to have other commentary.<br /><br />Tragic how his life ended.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Don't expect a lot from the plot of this movie. It makes sense but not very deep. Lots of action though from beginning to end. Lots of tongue in cheek one liners from the cast of former action movie heros.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My grandchildren and I enjoyed it, this is one of my favorite movies, even my grown children like it, they watched it when they were young.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic, can't-put-it-down book! Could it be better than the first in the triology? Highly likely! Looking forward to reading Mockinjay too.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I think this is a 5 star book because you understand all if it and it seems shorter if you read it in like 3 days. This book is best if you read it on a screen. This book has a lot of good pictures and it is a good book for kids.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It was good and interesting but did not capture me, not memorable. Perhaps I expected more. At times it was a little hard to follow. Glad we saw it after all the hype.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Story was exciting but jumped all over the place. If you had not seen any other mission impossible shows, you will struggle following this.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. It was so juvenile yet I would never want any juvenile to read it. Dont' bother.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Everyone was talking about this movie, but for some reason I never watched it until today.  My kids (7 and 5) absolutely loved it, and I thought it was very well done.  Loved all the nostalgic video games in it.  Would watch again and again.
B009CV7IIA|5.0|Plunges into nerd detail immediately (including footnotes!) There's no need to read this or the thousand other adoring reviews to recognize the electricity at the page 6 footnote: \\"A freeze-frame of this scene appears nearly identical to a painting by Jeff Easley that appeared on the cover of the Dungeon's Master's Guide...\\". If that gave you the same thrill as it gave me then: (a) you are a nerd, and (b) you will love this book. The book's preview is available on the (Paperback) page, and is a very fair representation of what you're getting. The whole book is like that; the upfront nerd delight reminds me of 'Soon I Will be Invincible' page 1, but 'Ready Player One' differs from that book in defiantly embracing the values of an 80s video game: Cline isn't discussing or challenging these conventions; he is celebrating them, and he doesn't stop until the last page. If you are looking for classical literary merit, you've come to the wrong place. Reading it (in one sitting) I was disappointed by the aggressively simple-minded approach to character, plot, theme, etc., but if you love a book then it deserves five stars, and I loved every word. Yes, I would have preferred a more reflective or nuanced take on the material, but the writing keeps you hooked from page to page. Playing a great computer game, you're not asking for depth... you know the game is good when you skip sleep to play it. Judged in those terms, and judged in terms of commitment to its concept this is an A+ success. And its an A+ success that makes trenchant points too; it's just that its points are *about* nerdcore subjects (not literary ones) and in this it is hard-line & universally correct: permanent death *is* essential to making an RPG awesome.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Very nice and neat .can't ask for a better calculator...has everything you need in a calculator graphics ,%, roots a complete one thanks
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This is the absolute best scifi series in the last ten years.  The entire cast is so believable and I can truly see them in real life.  Anna Torv's range in the characters is only challenged by John Noble.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Love this set. It looks amazing on Blu-ray with a smart tv! The time-lapse photography is ridiculously awesome. Nature lovers, buy this!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love just about all hidden object games and this one is no exception. The graphics are top notch. The side games are fun too. Looking forward to more of their games.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|It was off with the flu and starting watching a marathon.  That easy I was hooked and needed to see it all.  Love the cast.  Penelope Spencer JJ Hotch Rossi Morgan.  I hope it stays on the air for a long times.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I knew the plot all the way through, but it was still thrilling. Recommended for anyone who wants some drama mixed with a fairly accurate history lesson (though some liberties are taken in the final 15 minutes).
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love this trilogy. Great thing is you get high quality video. Even better if you own some sort of 5.1 surround sound system. I have some great gaming headphones with amazing 5.1 sound and honestly you will enjoy the movie even more.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I was interested in this book before Chris met his demise and had to read after he was killed. I have read many combat and sniper type books, but for some reason this book seemed odd. I enjoyed it very much and it took you through training, combat and his personal life but somehow it felt empty during the reading. It just seemed as though the story was waiting to come out started moving in that direction and never came to fruition. I know in many books I have read soldiers tell of not being able to talk about their experiences for many years, I think that might have been the case here or maybe information was to sensitive to Chris or the Government.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|t was off with the flu and starting watching a marathon.  That easy I was hooked and needed to see it all.  Love the cast.  Penelope Spencer JJ Hotch Rossi Morgan.  I hope it stays on the air for a long times.
B0080XN3C6|5.0|I can't tell you how much I enjoy her music, there just wouldn't be enough time in a day. I can say that I love some of the &#34;old school swing&#34; that some of her songs have I just can't get enough of.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|another great game from g5&hellip;just couldn't give 5 stars. quick download compared to others..smooth transition screen to screen. interesting story line and characters..the ending was predictable but overall great game just not quite 5 stars. played on first gen kindle fire without any problems.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|If you love the movies before you will love these too. I bought 1 and 2 at the same time. I waited until two came out before watching one. I love watching them both together.
B008KE3960|5.0|Best tower defense game ever. Kinda hard to see all the action on a smart phone, but very visible on a Kindle Fire. Get this game if you want to be a hermit.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|When I first heard Thrift shop, I didn't care for it. Then I heard it a second time and thought it was kinda funny, after that I watched the video and laughed my butt off. I bought this cd when it was on sale, but I have to say there are many other gems on this cd like &#34;Same Love&#34; and &#34;Wing$&#34;.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I loved the way it was written, was like I was in the book, seeing and experiencing what the author was. Really got into the characters. It got better as it went on, in the end, it was hard to put down. Lots of twists, new paths to lead and discover, full of suspense.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|If you love the movies before you will love these too. I bought 1 and 2 at the same time. I waited until two came out before watching one. I love watching them both together.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Such a cute family movie.  Everyone loved it. From my 5yr old to my senior citizen father.  Def a great buy.
B0036OS3EM|5.0|I love these boots, they are light and fit very well.  I use them all the time and they keep my feet warm in the winter and dry as well.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|After a long, long time away from the recording studio, Bowie is finally back.  This album was worth the wait.  Like the cover of the album suggests, it contains something old and something new.  No, the songs aren't old Bowie songs rehashed like we've seen on his various \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilations.  These are new songs.  But, they have that comfortable Bowie feel to them (if you can describe any of Bowie's eras as comfortable).  But, true to Bowie's form, he's kept up with contemporary music, art, fashion and culture, which not surprisingly find their way into these songs.  Bravo Bowie!!! Thanks for the decades of great music.  We look forward to years more of great music.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Missed this movie in the theathers, though it was on my radar to see. Saw it listed on Amazon Prime and the family stopped to watch it. Four people, all with differnet tastes, all enjoyed watching the movie. A couple of predictable moments in the movie but overall very entertaining.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works just fine!  I am happy that I downloaded it.  I am able to bid and pay for items I buy.  No glitches.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Won't watch unless Leonard and Penny are together.  They are now.  Sheldon, Penny, and Leonard are very funny.  My favorite.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works like a calculator..good figure. Easy to use and handy.  Easy to read and punch numbers. Nothing more to say.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The watch is very stylish and working pretty well. But time to time, you will feel the friction of the movement inside the case. The fabric strap is also elegant but if you are planning to use this watch  everyday,  you will need to change it after some time. Regular-in-office movements keep it running at nights.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|You never know the good guys from the bad until near the end. The story keeps you guessing.  Reacher comes through in the end.  Great story.
B00008S7KC|5.0|Being a huge fan of the Floyd and having read about this production for years now, there was simply no way I could do otherwise. Another must have item.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This app never showed up on my kindle fire therefore I was never able to play any of it. That was the point of getting a game...to play it.
B007RJTHXS|3.0|is a very  nice  movies,, I remenber  when  I was a little  girl  melody,  melody,  melody  very nice  and quite
B008OOYALE|5.0|I started playing because my bakery game recommended it. But it became  a lot of fun any very addictive. Very enjoyable.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Not one of Danzel's best... but definitely good.  The way they ended the movie definitely made the movie, for sure!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you're a Lost or Dexter fan - you will love Walking Dead.  It's very entertaining.  The end of each episode will leave you yelling at your TV for more!  I'm addicted.  My family scoffed at the first couple episodes, but are now more addicted than I am.
B0012HRJEA|4.0|amazing  was a proyect  for my daughter at the school  was helpful  for the school  my two  daghter watch  the  movie
B004XQYBA2|2.0|Too many different and odd ways to try to play a simple.  OK to have degrees of difficulty, but not presentation.<br />KIS - Keep It Simple
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Surprisingly good in it's own way. Not to be compared with BBC's Sherlock since they are both good in different ways.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|The movie was really good, up until the end where it took a turn for the PG crowd. It was intriguing, but ultimately written for a young crowd.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck has had an up and down career, and this is his zenith.  Great movie!  It was great to be able to watch it instantly on Amazon.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|It tied up many things that had left unanswered and I first read Interview With a Vampire years ago. Read it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is fun and easy! Very very addicting! I would highly recommend this game! I play every night before bed
B00867GK26|4.0|It was a gift for a great grand child and both parents were pleased with the product.  Shipping time was acceptable.  I was pleased.  I am not familiar with Blu-ray or Nemo.  As long as the family was pleased, so am I.
B0012GMVQC|4.0|Not Jeff's best effort, but good anyway. Too many of the songs sound the same, but the combination of Beck and Bozzio is a great one. They could do better, I'm sure.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game.  I got it as a free app of the day.  Now that I know how wonderful itnis I'll be sure to buy any new versions.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this is a wast of your money because wonce your kindle fire is out of battery and your on your profile it deletes your profile so I will prefer nor to buy it for you kindle fire but I still like minecraft
B001EOQWF8|4.0|This is a gift for a great grand child which was suggested by Mom and Dad.  I am not familiar with Wall-E or Blu-ray.  It is out of my league, I'm 79 years old.  Shipping time was acceptable and product was in good shape according to the family.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|A fantastic album. Marley's words and music are inspiring, interesting, and stick to your insides like a warm bowl of oatmeal!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very funny and enjoyable animation for the whole family. I think anyone would enjoy the  main characters journey to find happiness
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fun read.I was 20 years old the day JFK was assassinated so I remember the day well. This is a fictional account with time travel but also a lot of true facts. Stephen King claims to have drawn on a stack of reference material taller than himself when stacked on the floor. Somewhat gorey at times.
B005HSL626|3.0|Although there does not seem to be any point to this game, it can be hypnotic and &#34;fun&#34;. Loads fairly quickly.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|NCIS has been a staple of mine forever.  Season 9 was a good as it could get.  Season 10 seems to be more of going through the paces.<br /><br />Still the best thing on TV and better than most movies.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I really enjoyed unravelling the mystery of the maze with Thomas. I gave it a four because as much as I liked it as a page-turner, I would have liked some if the characters to be developed more-or to have met more of the gladers. Can't wait to read the rest...
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|My son had seen the movie and loved it, but when asking me to go see it with him, he wondered about the bad reviews it had gotten.  So I wasn't sure what to expect.  Well, like my son, I'm dismayed at the bad reviews and at those who say the movie is too long or seems to have filler.  Perhaps it does have filler, in a sense, since the powers-that-be decided to make it a three-part item.  However, it's not like they went back and filmed more, right?, in order to make filler?  It was all planned, and as with all movies, parts are later cut out (in this case, they left more in).  Anyway, my son is 15 and has ADHD, and HE did not think the movie was too long.  Lol.  I have to wonder at our sound-bite culture that thinks this action packed movie is too long.  It would seem these same folks would think the majority of older movies were made almost entirely of filler.  In any case, we loved the movie.  I gave it four stars instead of five because of Jackson's portrayal of certain meanings and characters that diverge from Tolkien's intentions.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is such a fun game and I am glad it finally made it over to the KFHD! Its quite a chalange balancing the different aspects to make the biggest impact, but really love it!
B008Q0D32S|5.0|Even my wife who hates westerns said she couldn't not watch. Fonda and Bronson were just the topping on the cake of fine acting.
0060531053|5.0|I just started brewing, and this book answered a lot of questions I had about the first steps, as well as how to progress part extract brewing.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|If you are a dog fancier you will enjoy this heartwarming story of Enzo and his owner.  A quick read with a surprizing ending.
B009178OQA|4.0|While I'm not normally a fan of documentaries, much less subtitles, I found this to be a fascinating movie about the life of a sushi chef at the top of his craft.  The film maker brings us into Jiro's life at the end of his career and provides insight into how he became the man and chef that he is today.  His difficult upbringing, alcoholic father, war, and then his rise as a chef all play into his life in the movie, and we learn about all of them.  Jiro's relationship to his work as a sushi chef seems to be the more important thing in his life.  The interplay between Jiro and his sons, the younger of whom opened another brand of the restaurant, the older of whom still &#34;studies&#34; under his father, is fascinating.<br /><br />All in all, this is a well crafted movie, it tells the story effectively, and it left me thinking about many things, not just going out for sushi!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|The entire series was enchanting and showed the struggles in the west for a new town trying establish itself as well as a woman breaking the glass ceiling a century before it was fashionable
B00B935SUY|5.0|Great movie for music lovers. The artist that recorded at Sound City have made such an impact on culture today that without Sound City we would possibly never heard of those artist.
B00005JL0I|1.0|Surely you can think of more interesting things to do with your time than to watch this movie - like rearranging your sock drawer, or watching paint dry, or getting your teeth cleaned.  I can't remember ever spending so much time waiting for something - anything - interesting to happen, as I just did watching this trite, vapid farce.  I even got out my magnifying glass to try to read who the director was - thinking that surely it was Woody Allen - because it holds your interest almost exactly the way everything does that he ever had anything to do with - which is to say, not at all - but to my complete astonishment, it was directed by John Huston!  I think he must have been hypnotized by Woody Allen, because if I were him, I would disavow any knowledge that I had any input whatsoever into this joke - and a very bad joke, at that.      * * *    I just noticed that there was another movie included with this - another \\"Casino Royale,\\" in black and white, a TV show from the fifties.  I watched this, and it was an attempt to make a serious drama - not a comedy - and it was incredibly lame. Just as bad as I remember many programs being from the fifties - I actually felt like the clock had been turned back 60 years.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I love this music, way cool. I especially like listening to it in a surround sound car. No complaints, I'd recommend it to bass lovers who wish they were in tech world.
B00B6LS9HS|5.0|Great effort here by these guys!  Always been a JSS fan and guitar work is great.  Really enjoying this guys!  THANK YOU!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|This game I love! All of Dr.Pandas games are good but the supermarket is awesome! The hospital is also good but the supermarket beets it! LOVE AVA!!!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|The book was wonderful, and the movie was great also, although there were some differences or it would have been a five star! Wonderful job overall!
B004SF30HI|5.0|I bought it because my sister had it. Its very pretty sounding. I don't have any complaints. It is a little cheesey, but most of it is enjoyable and awe striking.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I would recommend this, the choices of bell tones are great.  It gets me to the cushion each day. thanks
B00095NX9G|4.0|The first dvd is yoga it is a great workout, the second dvd has some yoga and Rachel does 2 performances, then she explains how to do the dances. She is a very good teacher, the first performance is rather easy to learn, the second is harder with back bends,I will never be able to do those back bends, I am not flexable like her, never was never will be. If you are not that flexable, you can still have fun with these dvds, just remember your own limitations.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|We had not watched this season previously.  Each episode has been captivating.  We are looking forward to watching the next 4 seasons.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Loved the first one because of all the action star in it and the great story. This one is basically the same, minus one of the member of the original group, but makes up for it by adding four or five action legends (don't want to spoil the movie). Also has a great story. I love the expandables movie and if you love action movies, you HAVE to get this movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abby...all seasons...all the actors and actresses are wonderful...I watch seasons over and over and always find something I missed....can hardly wait for season 4...
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Some parts of the book were a but too drawn out/repetitive, but there were others where I couldn't put the book down. Overall an entertaining read.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|So disturbing, and yet I can't look away. I love the noir lighting.  And Jessica Lange. Skip the aliens please...
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids loved this movie...It was so funny. Just a great movie! So pop some popcorn and have a family movie night.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Always the best....I throughtly enjoy Downton Abby...everyone really plays their part well...I am always excited when a new season is coming
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|I rented the unrated version and I can see why it earned a NC-17 rating in the theaters.  The movie has some violence (but nothing like the movie Hostel) but the sexual situations are what I found most disturbing.  The family in the movie is very dysfunctional but it makes for a fantastic movie and storyline.  If you're looking for a movie that makes you go \\"Wow, that family was really crazy\\" then you'll like this movie.  Matthew McConaughey did a fantastic job playing Killer Joe, he made the movie really good.  I haven't watched the R version so I can only comment on the unrated version but if you do decide to watch it be prepared to see some stuff you wouldn't see in a rated movie.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Es un Producto de calidad, he usados esta marca por varios años, he comprado productos similares,el envio a sido puntual, Excelente Experiencias
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best gane ever invented they should make more of them instead bringing updates bring a number 2 out because then u will have 2 lots of games coming out and gettin reviews and buyings
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved it, I felt as if though I myself was in charge of where the book went in a way, BECAUSE I myself can be described as a wallflower.
0062073192|5.0|if you love the show then this book is a must have no problems with shipping condition or price just a great book to go along with the show
B0094BB4TW|5.0|After several incarnations, it seems as though they finally got it right this time around. Images display properly and the whole interface seems to be faster and more responsive. Considering Facebook developers tendencies to &#34;mess around&#34; with things that aren't broken however, I'm sure I'll be back to writing negative reviews by the time the next version rolls out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great romance story. This was one of the best books I have read. Yes it was a little predictable, but I will tell you that it had my full attention from the very beginning to the end. I didn't want to put the book down that's how good it is. I think most people will enjoy reading Safe Haven.<br /><br />The movie is coming out and even though I read the book I can't wait to watch the movie.  Good job Nicholas Sparks. Can't wait to read more of your books.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Didn't like it nearly as well as other books from Lee Child  -- loike the later Jack Reacher books better.
B0016CQCMQ|5.0|I love this album. One of my favorites. Mr. White can really write music and with this particular line-up, the music they make together is phenominal.
B008NEMPTO|1.0|This movie was grossly insulting to the history of the old South-it works off the premise that the vampires all lived in the Confederacy in order to own slaves so they can have a food source. There's a scene where all the white vampires consume a roomful of African slaves-it's completely designed to stir up racial hatred.  It insults both races equally in this movie. I realize this is supposed to be a fantasy but I found this movie distasteful and degrading.
1451696205|5.0|love this book. excited for the film, although it could never do the book justice. but, isnt that always the way
B005LAJ212|5.0|This was a great deal. My wife really loves this show and has me hooked now. Fast shipping and a great price. Can't beat that!
B00931JMRE|5.0|Thanks, ZZ Top, for never letting a fan down. This record is just as raunchy, blues-driven, hard rock n' rollin' as the rest. I would buy it again!
B00881VLCE|4.0|A lot of fun. Plus you can make it tougher to solve by choosing more pieces. It's keeping us busy and no need to use all our table space
B006LSZECO|4.0|This story will get you hooked to find out where the twists and turns will take you.  Very fun read.
B0048IDWAA|5.0|Great, great product. I would definitely buy again from your website. As described and shipped very professional. No damage whatsoever.
B00499NHLC|5.0|What if the deductive logic skills of Sherlock Holmes skipped over the 19th and 20th centuries only to blossom in contemporary London?  Watch the Sherlock series and see.  Modern day caricatures of traditional Conan Doyle plots add complex twists and turns  that mirror the more complex life of the modern age.  And Dr. Watson's memoirs of all these exploits?  Maintained in a blog, of course.  Best advice:  pay close attention or you'll miss something important!
B0010T0OCY|4.0|what an excellent, mind bending film. Director alex proyas really knows how to create futuristic visions that are not only stylized but also clever and has a lot of inner logic into them.
0071766588|5.0|This commodity quality is very good, also can arrive on time, the package is strong enough. If necessary, I will buy again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed the development of this book.  Colleen Hoover NEVER disappoints!  Holder is just the sweetest guy on the earth and I really felt a connection with Sky.  The plot was not what I expected but in a really good way.  Loved the twists and turns throughout the novel as well as the romance that comes with it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game, but my camera keeeps spazzing out. I tried reinstalling like a million times, but it didnt work. Plz mojang fix the issue!
B00130UFY2|4.0|You'll stay on the edge of your seat for the whole film. Paul Greengrass does a great directing job, and the story stays believable.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|This processor is the bomb!! My old processor was more than a little out dated so I needed a replacement. I tried 2 other processors before settling on this one... Man am I glad I did!! I Love This Processor!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The idea for this movie was so creative and they played it out well. I enjoyed the memories of old games, and the subtle and not-so-subtle allusions throughout the movie. The characters are really well developed and distinct, playing off each other well.  Overall, fun movie to watch!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I think it can actually do well as a movie, I already have a few pretty boys in mind for the role.  Lead character was well developed.  It might have been more interesting if we got to know her friends a little more.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|I Am Legend is even better than the movie on which it is basd (The Omega Man), and that's pretty rare (that the remake is better than the original).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It is very I<br />Entertaining. Having lots of fun trying to catch up to my friends scores,
B0094MAZKK|5.0|this is an all out action movie from beggining to finish big fan of iko uwais since his first movie merantau excellent!!!!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This a good way to waste time and not really have to pay that much attention to the game. It is a great free game.
B006PERRMY|4.0|such a good idea wasted on such a poor execution. The concept of time used as currency could have been used to create a masterpiece, instead it became just another mediocre film that doesn't really go deep into things. Plus, justin timberlake is really bad.
0767903374|5.0|The workbook has helped me to feel better equipped and more able to speak up for myself. Instead of taking everything personally.
B007SSF3O0|4.0|watched it with my girlfriend.  worth the time.  you'll find yourself laughing right along, and the acting is top quality.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I've cut up several bottles with this thing and it does a decent job of scoring the glass in a consistent circle, but there IS a learning curve to figure out how to make a good score.  I think its construction and materials (light aluminum with wingnut connectors) could be more robust, but the resultant product would probably cost more.  I typically brace the cutter with clamps and blocks on my workbench to keep it absolutely secure before I score a bottle.
B001RUXW48|4.0|I can't deny that the movie was very suspenseful and even tense at times. Leonardo DiCaprio proves to be a really gifted actor as the years go by and he gets older. His parts get more sophisticated and challenging. Basically an undercover CIA agent in the middle east, plotting and scheming to find a terrorist leader that is responsible for different bombs across europe. Russel Crowe supports as an intelligence Langely operative. Great ensemble, and solid movie throughout.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I've read all his other series and this series is awesome dealing with the Egyptian gods rather than the Greek or Roman gods
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love the humor and although at first I thought the season started a little poorly with the script-writing and jokes, it has recovered significantly and remains having my interest. Although I do think the show needs some fresh meat writers, but that goes for all of today's entertainment really.
B00174TKGI|4.0|While it's not a great gangster film, the story is enough to keep the film engaging. Denzel Washington turns in a great performance.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|It was such an amazing film most of it was historically accurate. Its showed the debatury down to a T. Although it showed nothing of his childhood it started pretty much with his descent into madness. Such an awsome film not for childeren or the faint of heart but great for a fan of anceint rome or Fans of Malcolm McDowell. This film showed Malcolm's ability to play the evolution of insanity.
1421550644|5.0|Haven't read more than a few pages, purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loves it. The artwork is incredible, and the movie poster that's included is actually pretty sweet. If you're a fan of the movie, definitely pick this one up, as it expands on many of the concepts introduced in the film.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Absolutely stunning in every aspect. Can't wait for more. Emile deserves all the award. The hype is spot on. Ms. Sande delivers big time.
B0024Y7H10|4.0|Terminator the series isn't as good as the Terminator movies, at least not as good as the first 3, but it's not bad nonetheless.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|I love this. I have this on my Kindle Fire.It makes it easy to access his songs no matter where i am.<br />We try to purchase all of Kid Rocks Music. Plan on buying more music from this site.<br />Thank you<br />nkwilson40@yahoo.com
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son kept bugging me for this game. All the kids are playing it and he wanted it. So, he finally got his app. More like a reward for him for keeping up with his chores. Looking at him play make me think is a good game. So yeah!!! I give it 5 stars for it. It's worth it. Keeps him busy when we are in the road...lol
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved every aspect of this book. Steve Jobs was fascinating! He was such a genius and this book makes him seem real and human. I will read this book again.
B000QGAU4E|4.0|this film, based on a fascinating book by p.d. james, has a very good concept. The result is a bit too bleak for my taste but still captivating and suspenseful.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|It was working fine but now I can just take pics but I can not make a video... wtf why? Every time I click on make a video it says (stopped working) why? Can I get my money back?
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I loved watching this movie with my daughter and the cheesy jokes and video game references are hilarious. I will definitely watch it again
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I could not download this for my tablet (Chuwi V99) fromt he google play store, but found it here and it works great.
B0042C1BP0|3.0|Oh man, this has got to be one of the worst bond movies. It's not bad in the sense of productions values or anything like that, it's bad in the sense that nothing happens. He just plays poker for ages and ages.. In between there are some explosions, pretty girls and al the usual but all in all, it's a pretty dull movie.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This was definetly a keep the lights on kind of movie!!!!!!  Pretty believable, and was very light on the cheese. !!!!
1926778103|4.0|Usually missing all the artistic work while playing the game, heres a close up of the demonic beasties, settings, designs done. Cool yet disturbing at times, a great ref if your into these type of stuff.<br /><br />Found it interesting even if I don't play...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It works and it is free.  It has a nice interface.  There's not much more to say about this app.
B00498YZH8|4.0|Winter's bone is a great proof that you don't need a great deal of money to make a great movie, just a great story and some great acting won't hurt either. Touching, suspensful, and guaranteed to stay in your memory for a while...
B00785P2QC|3.0|its fun for awhile but then it gets really borring and old, there isn't much to really do besides build houses and things
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a new fan of Firefly and the series is wonderful.  I wish I had seen it when it was on.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I could not download this (ad-free) for my tablet (Chuwi V99) fromt he google play store, but found it here and it works great.
B000ID37SQ|4.0|This film is one of those extremely rare cases where a remake is better and more memorable than the original. This doesn't mean you should watch the 1932 version, though...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great to wake up to a gentle alarm or favourite song. It is great for the price. I recommend this to all Kindle users.
B005LAIISA|1.0|I've never actually seen this movie but I have to listen to it 8<br />hours a day 5 days a week at work. The master of the sea and the opening<br />and end credits song are the most annoying things I have ever heard<br />they make me want to punch small children.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I could not download this for my tablet (Chuwi V99) fromt he google play store, but found it here and it works great.
B001VTTRC6|4.0|watching this movie today, 10 years after it was shot, makes you think what happened to Clint Eastwood these past few years. This movie is surley at the top of his creation. A great mystery involving childhood friends, each went on their own path and somehow they meet once again under the worst circumstances. a wonderful film.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have been a fan of Josh since Ally McBeal.  His song touch me like no one else.  Even the songs in Italian!!!  I turned my sister onto his singing and we both are die hard fans.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|This album is still one of my favorites just because you simply can listen to it from start to finish and like just about everything about it!
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|Great album, and easily recommended to be replayed.  It's a testiment and throwback in the sense that this album if made to be listened to in it's entirety.  There are a few great tracks on this album, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice without listening to the entire thing in order.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|one of the greatest cinematic achievements in the field of sci-fi, this film definitly deserves it's status as a masterpiece. A must-see for every fan of the genre.
B0098460O4|5.0|The best ever buy I've made!!<br />The voices of both Jonathan and Charlotte are brilliant. Especially Jonathan, he is on the same level as Pavarotti, a real opera voice.<br />Not one of the tenors worldwide is as good as he is in my books.<br />Jonathan has an outstanding voice and I think he has a golden future<br />Charlotte has also such a beautiful voice and my c.d. 'Together' is just about worn from playng over and over again.<br />Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed.
B000ZNRBK4|3.0|The lens hood fits fine, but a bit smaller than I expected.  Adding to the front of the camera's lens rotated the fine adjustment on the camera and I didn't realize that so had many blurry photos.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|if you like funny movies and love family guy you have to see this movie, if youre just hearing the movie you couldnt tell the difference, I thought I was watching family guy while I streamed this movie and was working on a school paper.
B00794MAR6|4.0|If you're looking for a tv-show that deals with the core of human relationships then go no further than this show. It revolves around Gabriel Byrne who is a therapist, and it shows his own doubts and dilemma's regarding the issues that his patients present in front of him, which for a change, in the process showing the therapist side of his job. Based on the israeli format called \\"Betipul\\".
B00899F0G8|5.0|I watched an episode of this on Netflix on a lark when there was NOTHING on satellite one afternoon.  Since the first 2 seasons were available there, I watched 6 episodes in a row before I even realized it.  I was instantly hooked.  We began recording season 3 on DVD before finisihing the first two.  Unfortunately, we missed episodes 1-4 of season 3 and were very happy to find those available to stream on Amazon!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We just finished viewing seasons 1 and 2 which we missed the first time around, and needed to review the opening show from season 3 so we could put all the pieces in place.  Great series - acting, scenery, plot twists - a soap opera with class!
B00633PFQC|5.0|I had heard Michael Sandel's talks on morality and justice - we have to often choose between the two evils, smaller vs the larger. Markets pose similar dilemma. Certainly a must read book.
B001TCNSOI|3.0|For an Eastwood movie, I can't say it's one of his best, he had better. It's the story of how Angelina Jolie deals with her son being kidnapped in 20s Los Angeles, while LAPD trying to brush off the kidnapping. Personally I just expected a more powerful film, and it seem to kind of pass by you when you watch it, nothing's changed emotionally for me after watching the movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its fun.<br />.........<br />..........,........<br /><br />..........<br />.........<br />.....<br /><br />...<br />.<br />.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />...<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.
B00000ADG2|5.0|If I could wish for any one artist to return to the 'scene' it would be the incomparable Lauryn Hill!
B006HL9G10|5.0|This application does exactly what it advertises.  It is a timer for meditation that rings a variety of soothing bells at the end of the session.  Timing can be set and can be stored in profiles.  It will also track the time that you spend meditating, which could be useful.<br /><br />While the application can be used to see who else is meditating in the area, I am not sure why anyone would want to know this information.  If you do not care, the application can be used without registering.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|The Matrix is one of the best films ever made, the action in it is fantastic, and it's also a very philosophical movie that raises some very interesting questions.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|The game is fun but it's not very scary u play and then thee is a slender spazing out in front of you
B00BHMF578|3.0|This is a great story, filled with talented actors and authentic locations. So why didn't I connect with it?  I'm old enough to remember the era first hand, so I expected to have a deep understanding of the respective time and culture.  I did.  But, there was just no visceral connection on any emotional level.  Although the tempo is paced nicely the plot seems very predictable and &#34;rehearsed.&#34;  There is no meat on the bone.  Affleck walks through the film without any significant emotional display, failing to ramp up the fear and dread that the captives must have experienced.  The actors playing the captives do a good job of expressing their tension, and the woman playing the Iranian housekeeper does a good job in her one good scene.  Why weren't these characters explored on a deeper level?  Alan Arkin and John Goodman in support keep the tale interesting and entertaining and Bryan Cranston gives an outstanding performance, providing the film's only moments of genuine pathos. To me this typical of Ben Affleck's work:  slick, handsomely produced and well-crafted, but lacking any emotional core or raw energy.  Not nearly the best film of the year.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|Great show, as we all know, great commentaries, as we all know.<br />Packaging...not so great. Brand new DVD's and getting them in and out of the glued together sleeve is a task. I am very careful with my DVD collections and I have already noticed a lot of wear and tear on the corners just from getting the DVD out a few times. I have seen these sleeves before and after awhile it will come apart.<br /><br />Season 1 by far was the best packaging of any season of any show on DVD.
B000T45CDM|4.0|Sure, it is not in the same caliber as the all time greats (Godfather I and II or Once Upon The Time in America), but it is, an excellent addition to the genre.
B00867GJYK|5.0|It is a great movie for all ages. I have never met someone who did not like this movie and did not enjoy all of the antics of the characters.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Maybe had my husband noticed the unrated posted on it, it would have been better.  We did not enjoy the vial mouth stuff Teddy Bear. May the rated one would be better if all the bad language would be excluded...If you enjoy one bad word after another, this is the movie for you.....not for me.
0385349947|5.0|This book is a pure shot in the arm for women, and one that I will have my daughter read, and will suggest to just about every woman I know.  Sheryl touches on so much that one (me included!) often feels to be true, but perhaps feels that you should not acknowledge it, even to yourself.<br />  You know, don't bring up or refer to the fact that you (as a woman) is likely ALSO carrying twice the load at home along with your career...and therefore those extra late night hours you put in, along with &#34;the big boys&#34; are done AFTER you take care of the kids, household etc... But don't mention this, cause that would be whining, and you did, after all, choose to be a wife and mother, right?  And don't you dare bring up things like inequality for same pay... Or things like assertiveness in a woman being perceived as b%#*%iness, while being perceived as an admired and strong leadership quality in men.<br /> And, the heart of what Sheryl talks about in this book, which is how women, more-often-than-not, downplay their contribution and worth, and therefore, often try less (read that: don't aim as high as men, NOT don't work as hard as men... of course, this is a generality, as there are, thankfully, growing numbers of exceptions to this rule).<br /><br />Sheryl does a beautiful job making this point, and suggesting that women CHOOSE to step up, CHOOSE to value themselves and their contribution and CHOOSE to aim higher, without making it a blame game against men.<br />I am still only part way through the book, but had to put my recommendation out that other women read this.<br /><br /> Sheryl, you've done an amazing job with this book, and in just a few chapters, have given me the re-encouragement to re-examine my accomplishments (and lack thereof) in a way that will allow me to grow from what I learn, and to do less blaming (of myself especially) and more Leaning In.<br />Thank you so much!
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Not really worth going to the cinema to watch such a movie, but for a home viewing it's entertaining enough.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This is a  must read to complete the trilogy.  I enjoyed it right to the last page.  Couldnt put it down.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used all of the common trace keyboards but this one is my favorite to use. It just seems more intuitive and the anticipation of words will save you a ton of keystrokes
B000P0J09W|5.0|movie was in new condition. Very happy with my order. Kids enjoyed the movie as i did when i was a kid.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|I like everything christian bale does, so it's not a big surprise I loved this film as well. Yet besides bale's acting it is also portrays a very interesting world that makes you wanna find out more. Really good.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I like the package and after reading the reviews I was ready to replace the package by cutting the cardboard<br />to release the dvd's. I found upon receiving the product that the cardboard is sandwitched with double sided tape.<br />If you take a blunt object (butter knife) and seperate the center piece of tale the pressure on the dvd's is released.<br />I am able to enjoy the dvd's and keep the package.
B00BHU261S|3.0|Anthony Hopkins was amazing as Hitchcock. Really enjoyed the background on the making and financing of a film and how progressive he was in the making of Psycho.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|It was slow for me in the beginning..got better midway..then it got me so interested I couldn't put it down...I found my self getting really attached to my own dog Emma....
B000NGTJTY|4.0|The original Hong Kong film (which is part of the trilogy) is much more suspenseful and clever than this remake. The US version is still pretty good.
B000M06KGQ|2.0|Half of the vinyls did not work, it just played no music at all. the ones that did work were great.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|Got this for my grandchildren, but have to say it was very good. The animation was outstanding. Not only did the kids like it the adults did too. This may be one we have to buy!
145162445X|5.0|I had to read this book twice to get the overall drift. I'm not a cosmologist nor am I an astronomer or physicist. Yet the book made some remarkable points and it is a shame I won't be around in several billion years to see if Krauss is right or wrong.<br /><br />However, it doesn't make much difference. Krauss spells out a story of how it is quite possible that something did in fact come from nothing and will revert to nothing again in the far distant future.<br /><br />Right or wrong, this book is interesting to a point that the reader may find their mind dwelling on the &#34;bigness&#34; of the universe and the smallness of our little speck of a planet amid the universe and the contents there of.<br /><br />Key words, cosmology, astronomy, dark matter.
B008QTUPUW|4.0|Aside from some holes in the story, this show does deliver suspense with great acting, while succeeding in avoiding cliches.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Homogenic will always be my fav, but this is a close second. Bjork has always been connected to nature and the elements, and really goes to intelligent extremes in expressing her appreciation for it on this album. Cosmogony is probably my favorite track. Followed by Crystalline and Mutual Core.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Another awesome, amazing, fantastic, Game of Thrones book :) I'm anxiously awaiting the next installation. Hurry up George R. R. Martin!!
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Purchased after the Grammys. Exceptional CD. The Paradise Edition is well worth the price difference. One listen and you have to listen several more times. Not sure what happened with the negative reviews, mine is absolutely a gem, everything listed and more than expected.
B002W7J3SO|4.0|This is my favorite Hitchcock film ever. It has Great suspense, and is still is one of the greatest thrillers of all time.
B006T5GTK0|5.0|I like this movie, therefore if I like the movie, I probably like the product. You really don't need a lot of words to describe why you like a movie or not. It's like art, you do or you don't.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love John Green's videos and now his book. I have no other words, just read his words. Do it.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I just received the 20th anniversary Blu-Ray edition and it is simply superb. The sharpness, the clarity, the print is just flawless. What else is left to say about this brilliant and moving and disturbing film? It should be in everyone's library. It is truly a masterpiece deserving of every award that it received.
B006VR68OS|4.0|Finally, Steve Buscemi gets his much deserved chance to be a star. He is just such a good actor, and this show fits him perfectly
B0098VYKSA|2.0|I think a lot more could have been done with this. The plot was a little thin, the acting uninspiring (even Michelle Pfeifer). But Chris Hemsworth looked good.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I am not able to play through my facebook Acct. on kindle.  I can only play as guest so I am unable to gift or chat.  Any suggestions?  Got no help from customer support.
0061122416|5.0|Thank you good read and short too,. Believe you can do and live your dreams. Don't let anyone take them away.
B000I186FW|4.0|natalie portman is excellent as the naïve girl thrown into dark plots and schemes against her will. The visualization is also excellent, like one would expect from a wachawsky brothers film.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The great thing about Bond - you know exactly what you're getting. Fast cars, hot women, and explosions. Nice bit of history into Bond's childhood and a nice tip of the hat with the car at the end.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|That was such a good book. I loved it. It caught my attention from the start. I love Nicholas Sparks books and movies. He is the best. Thank you for another good one.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love British drama and Downton Abbey is no exception. Season 3 may have just ended, but I am happy to revisit the story. Great series!
B00274EYKY|4.0|It might not be for the average viewer, being borderline Realism in terms of it's editing and visual style. That basically means the movie is very slow, and tries to give an honest depiction of reality without covering up things. Aside from that Mickey Rourke gives an amazing acting comeback after years of not being very active, and i'm glad it's with this role that shows a very personal and intimate story of a broken man.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game. I'm 9 and I wanted a fun game to pass the time. This app is what I was looking for! Om Nom is ADORABLE! I bought the experiment one, and it's not as fun as this! It's really addictive! IGNORE BAD REVIEWS! THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD FUN MEANS! IF YOUR LOOKING FOR AN AWESOME APP GET THIS APP<br />ishkabibble
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Seamless installation and concept simple but requires skill. The more you play the better your skill becomes. Those little pigs are so cute.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is written from the perspective of a recovering mental patient. There is mystery and suspense around how he came to be in the \\"bad place\\" (mental ward) and interesting conflict between his view of his wife and his actions versus the opinions of his friends and family.  This book opened my eyes again to how one's perspective influences \\"truth\\".  It was a worthwhile glimpse inside the head of a man bent on improving his life and believing the best future is possible.
B0019IMVDG|4.0|The main problem of this brilliant film was its timing. Coming only five years after Scorsese's mob masterpiece, this cinematic tour de force was treated as a mere retelling of the same story, but for my money it is far more enjoyable.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is awesome. It is so much fun. No problems with the download. It gets addictive so easily. If you are looking for good old fashion fun, this is it.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Unlike most novel to film ventures, The Lincoln Lawyer captures all the suspense and surprises of the original. Very well done and very well cast. Matthew McConaughey is spot on as Mickey Haller.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I'm a huge DeMille fan but this is not his best work.  Bringing together his prior heroes,  John Corey, Kate Mayfield Corey and Paul Brenner,  created a huge opportunity which missed its mark.  The Corey sarcasm/wit, which I've always enjoyed, was over-used to the extent it was annoying and took away from the plot.  I found The Panther disappointing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was just amazing i loved this book so much it was great thanks to the author it was good
0143120530|5.0|It is quite common for us to forget something: the words come up to our minds that we want to say; The car key which left nowhere few minutes ago; The passport which is left in apartment when arriving the airport. Those forgetting are indeed annoying enough to drive us mad. However, you might solve or, at least, have an idea on how to solve this situation after reading the book Moonwalking With Einstein by Joshua Foer. This is a book makes me addictive, since it combines both the interest and science to help us understand the concept of memory. Also it shares the secrets and methods making Joshua Foer a journalist who used to live with a lot of post-it notes to ensure he would not forget his schedule, become the champion of the US memory championship.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I lost 15 pounds with this sick little DVD. I am also on a paleo diet so I'm sure it helps.  It's great that it so short and challenging! I did the entire 30 days with the odd break every 6 or 8 days. now that I'm done, I'm going to use Jillian's\\"3-2-1\\" method to use for my order to do the levels each day ( probably switch me up more if I get bored). I'm really liking my results so far! Buy this DVD and you will feel fantastic!
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|Good family movie - 6 & 8 year old loved it, even the 22 month old belly-laughed at some parts.<br />Super fast shipping and just exactly what we were looking for at our Family Movie Night!  Target may have the better price on it this week, especially if using store card and saving an extra 5%, but we had free overnight shipping (TY Discover Card) and didn't spend any gas driving to Target!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Movie just had a strangeness to it in the way the story was told and the characters themselves.  I could have swore Bill Murray directed it.
B002NJWHHA|3.0|Unbelievable!  Someone finally edited that adjective laden tome.  The novel's prose made me cringe on several occasions.  Honestly, I thought the filmmakers did a good job on this.  I wouldn't mind seeing them edit the other three books too.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book left me with a profound sense of peace which strengthened my faith in eternity.<br />I really loved it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very fun and lots to do. Have had some problems with the glitches, sometimes things won't open. For the most part I really enjoy the app.
B00AFEYUVG|2.0|I am currently minoring in film.  While I am no expert yet, I do think that Chbosky did a pretty good job with the actual filming of this story.  So if you happen to be an indie filmmaker, this is worth a quick watch.<br /><br />However, the actual story was just not good.  There was really no plot or real point to the story, but it was so over-dramatized, that you almost felt like perhaps Chbosky had created a well-written screenplay.  But, really, when you look back, you think what actually happened?  Nothing.  That's the quick answer.  And, no, I'm not sorry that that sounds harsh.  It's my review, and that's my honest opinion.  I really cannot seem to figure out why the book is so popular.  My only explanation is that teens like to read about how tough their lives are (and I'm only 20 so yes I know it is rough).<br /><br />As for the acting, Logan Lerman was perfect!  He fits Charlie so well it's scary sometimes.  Very impressed.  Ezra Miller was very good as well, but I already knew he was good from his past work.  Emma Watson's American accent was horrendous in some scenes (couldn't even concentrate in some scenes), yet very good in others.  In the same way, her acting was awkward and terrible in some scenes, yet very good in others.  It was very odd.  I have never seen someone so erratic in their acting and speaking skills.  Hopefully the better scenes are from the end of filming so that she got better as time went on.  I suppose she is still growing as an actress (even though she's had 8 Harry Potter films to work on her talent? whatevs)<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I would not waste your time watching the film or reading the book (I read the book as well- very poorly written).  One exception: if you are an indie filmmaker, watch it for some good ideas!  He had some interesting shots and editing going on.  Lovely from a filmmaking perspective.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I want to see the movie but missed it. It was very, very, good and held my interest all the way.
0792164903|2.0|This disc seemed in good condition at first glance. However will not play in either one of my dvd players. The disc has a tiny flaw that  makes it skip and freeze.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|excellent movie to watch in free time. funny, hilarious, as you can expect from the makers of family guy movie
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This shipped very quickly. We were very happy when it arrived and could begin our movie marathon.<br /><br />Unless you have lived under a rock, you know how awesome Star Wars is. It's even more epic on blu-ray.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Interesting twist in a short novel. A little overdone with the teen sex descriptions but otherwise an interesting tale about fated love.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's worth the price. Something fun to do when you need to kill some time. Takes me back to the earlier days of computer gaming when the controls were simple and you didn't have a controller with 5 million buttons
B00979CS50|4.0|Considering Neil Young isn't getting any younger, it is a nice album.  Some nifty looking back songs.  Some gritty, grungy guitar.<br />The Walk Like a Giant song seems to be the catchiest.  Neil Young still trying to be interesting.  I get it.  We are all getting older.  But he has accomplished what he wanted.  It is very nice.  Now if They Might Be Giants could just create a 28<br />minute song.  Nice work Neil, Love ya.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game is fun and tests how fast you can match the cubes.  It is enjoyable and doesn't do like some of the other games where you only have a short amount of time to complete the game.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|An amusing but sometimes frustrating account of what you can get yourself into if your not careful with the alcohol.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome, especially on my iPad! My horse has great animation and 4D objects. It's just like taking care and training a real horse!!!!!
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I love Josh's voice - but he needs better composers. Go for it Josh - more variety. You have the talent
B001E45XT4|3.0|They are ok headphones although its hard to say that there worth the money. These have decent padding all throughout the headset although the mic had a phew flaws, sometimes it would glitch out and make lots of background noise and could hardly hear the speaker. Before i bought these i looked at the price and the reviews. It seemed like it would be a great deal. Although the mic is for the most part clear it has its moments...Also the padding is great, one of the greatest I have ever had. It fits fully over your ear and and will fit almost any head size. But It does somewhat hurt your head and is not comfortable for over a long time period. If your a hard core gamer I would recommend getting different headphones because they are not compatible with any other device other then computers...That was a large disappointment. These are one of the most durable headphones I have had. Because I know that some of you gamer get a little mad here and then although you cant throw them down as you wouldn't any headphones they wont break from dropping them the first time. Now onto the cord. The cord is decent length if your computer is close to you. I believe its a 10 Ft. cord its decent length although if your looking for a 16-20 Ft. cord then go with turtle beaches. I had the X11 headphones for the longest time before they just started to come off. I treated them decently but after awhile the glue started to come off and fall apart I had tape everywhere on them until the sound went off and completely stopped working. They lasted me over 3 years. Not as long as I expected but the padding never hurt my ears/head never had bad background noise and was very clear mic. Although they were not worth the price because they came apart after a couple years. Sound quality was great. I here a lot of people and read a lot of comments that say they are terrible but I would recommend them over these.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Very much how I felt watching the Fifth element. If you want to know what this movie is vaguely like watch Fifth Element.<br />Bruce Willis is also in this movie. Which is why I probably feel this way.<br />There's also that cool scene with the fire and match; I like that scene very much.<br /><br />One thing: Bruce Willis does not wear an undershirt for this movie- so maybe it isn't as good as<br />the Fifth Element- so you should watch that, then Looper and confirm my feelings on Willis killing<br />baddies in an undershirt.
B0091REZMW|4.0|cool game. too many pop ups though. but over all pretty good. but everyone has different tastes in games. I didn't think I would like it but its a cool game. passes the time.
B00B720N20|4.0|As always Marc Levy is a great storyteller. The book is pleasant to read and the reader can relate to the characters- espzcially the secondary ones,<br />I would recommend this book to all my friends.
B0091REZMW|4.0|You go through all the levels, which was really good, but she never finds her father and the ending portal takes you nowhere!  It's just done.  Needs to have an ending level!
B001XUPF2O|5.0|I wasn't one of the people who was in love with Batman Begins. It was a good movie...good enough to make me want to see this one...but it wasn't what I would call revolutionary.  However, The Dark Knight is a different story.  Much more action and drama. It's good enough that I didn't want to pause it for anything...and it's 2 1/2 hours long.  Just an overall great followup to Batman Begins.  I still don't like the Batman voice though...
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|The movie service works pretty well. If your internet sucks, so does the service, but it's kind of nice to watch a movie from your computer.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Fun game.  Really makes you analyze and think.  My 5 year old can do it and has a blast...both he and I!
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Awesome watch it love it feel it know that your existence is now complete after watching it then realize existence is not complete and that they need to make an actual big screen 9 hour Halo trilogy of awesomeness to truly dive deep into the Halo universe and antill then life is meaningless!!! Watch it!!!

B003WKOU0G|5.0|A great watch for the entire family.  Interesting and adorable.  If you're expecting, it's a must see. Really cute and entertaining.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This was a very hard to put down book. It started a little slow, but then moved along nicely. Will definitely read more by Mr. Lehane.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Funny sound effects and good tips for and while playing.  Easy to understand and gives you lots of chances for success.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Quality of video is good; sound, too.  Story is easy to follow.  Characters are fascinating.  They are not merely types.  Still, they seem familiar, even with all their eccentricities.  Heartwarming episodes, usually.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie already had three things going for it before I ever saw it; Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Amy Adams. The story takes you through just about every human emotion from beginning to end, and it's wonderful. A tortured lonely childhood causes a rift between a daughter and her father, mainly because the daughter, Adams, doesn't understand why her father, Easr\twood, sent her away. It is a wonder and heartwarming movie.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This book  is so stupid it shouldn't even be available for people to buy. It was so stupid when I was reading it I threw up on my kindle and it broke. This book is so not good for kids it is a really bad role model for young readers. How did this mestup author think of this stupid book. Like I said it was so stupid I threw up on it.
0316187216|5.0|When Shy South and her cowardly stepfather Lamb return home to find their farmhand dead and Shy's two siblings missing, they venture into the Far Country to find them. They join a fellowship and head to the mining town of Crease. During their travels, Shy is forced to confront her own checkered past and finds that her stepfather has a past of his own...<br /><br />On the heels of finishing A Dance with Dragons, my jones for dark fantasy with morally ambiguous characters was not sated so I turned to Red Country. Red Country is my first Joe Abercrombie book and won't be the last.<br /><br />Red Country promoted as being a fantasy western and I'd say that's fairly accurate. It's a story of revenge and redemption, two staples of the Western genre, and the trip across the Far Country to Crease has a very western feel to it. Crease has a setup not unlike the town from Fistful of Dollars (or Yojimbo, if you prefer). Lamb and Shy riding out into the unmapped country to find their missing loved ones is straight out of a lot of westerns. Without giving too much away, it also reminds me of Unforgiven quite a bit once Lamb mans up and shows his true colors. It's nice to see fantasy that strays from the rut of medieval pseudo-European quest stories.<br /><br />The characters are an interesting bunch. Shy is a woman wondering why she managed to escape justice for her dark past. Lamb is a Northern barbarian trying to keep a promise he made to a dead woman. Temple is a lifelong screw up trying to turn things around. Cosca, one of the antagonists, is pretty lovable for a villain. They are far from the average fantasy cast and this is far from an average fantasy tale.<br /><br />Joe Abercrombie's books are known for being dark and gritty. What people rarely mention is that they have a fair amount of dry humor and clever imagery in them as well. The quotable lines are surprisingly frequent. What I'm trying to say is that Abercrombie's writing was a lot more enjoyable to me than that of a lot of fantasy writers.f a lot of fantasy writers.
B002HSSAY6|5.0|If  you like old westerns, and we do, you'll like this movie. It's got alot of notables in the lineup and it's a good story. I would recommend this movie.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Nice ending but slow development. Still have a lot of mysteries to be solve. To the next book...  can't wait!
0553801473|4.0|Stannis Baratheon marches on Winterfell from the Wall. Daenerys's empire is threatened from within. Tyrion finds himself enslaved. Cercei finds herself in chains. The Crow's Eye desires Daenerys for his own but so do several other would-be suitors. And Jon Snow faces dissent from his brothers of the Watch...<br /><br />In the latest installment of Incest and Intrigue, more of the pieces are placed on the board. Daenerys can't trust anyone. Jon Snow can't trust anyone. Iron Lords cannot trust their own brothers. Sellswords in general cannot be trusted. In short, no one can trust anyone while the Game of Thrones is being played.<br /><br />This one had its share of memorable moments, both good and ill. I really like how Arya's story is developing but I don't see how it's going to tie back into things. The revelation of Young Griff's true identity was a game changer and its repercussions will be felt in the next couple books. I liked that Brienne is still alive and that Jaime Lannister chose to follow her instead of rushing to Cercei's defense. Jon Snow getting knifed on the Wall by his sworn brothers didn't sit well with me. I'm really hoping he's still alive come next book, whenever that may be.<br /><br />It looks like Theon is headed for redemption but I'd rather see him dead or taking the black. Bran is progressing nicely. Whatever happened to Ricken and that bastard of Robert's that isn't Gendry? And who is Cercei's new champion Robert Strong, the Mountain, perhaps?<br /><br />I honestly don't think Martin will be able to wrap things up in two more books, not with all the balls he has in the air. Plus, it would be all too easy for him to throw more players into the mix to keep the saga going. Still, with A Song of Ice and Fire, George R.R. Martin has made an Oathbreaker out of me. I once swore I'd never get caught up in a neverending fantasy series. In fact, I believe I said I'd rather eat my own testicles. However, I'm pretty caught up in this one. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to join the tent city on George R.R. Martin's front lawn, to wail and gnash my teeth every night until the next book is ready.excuse me, I'm off to join the tent city on George R.R.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This was highly informative and a very great read! I loved it. It took a LOOOONG time to get through and isn't one you can breeze through...but I recommend it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. The only thing I can say is boring me is the story is not as fast paced and action packed as the previous two seasons. Being stuck in that prison and just waiting for the next big thing to unfold, seems to be a longer trail than it needs to be. I also feel some of their strongest characters have died off or are losing their sanity, some of the characters I just can't seem to find interest in. They need some new leading roles that really stand out.<br />But I still love this show, those are very minor complaints, the gore is awesome. When the story does pick up it keeps you watching. I can no longer watch any other zombie movie without thinking, &#34;I wish these zombies looked as awesome as the ones on the walking dead.&#34;<br /><br />Hope this show lasts a long time.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Despite the bad press, it's a great film.  If you enjoy films like Avatar / prince of persia, good chance you'll like this one too

B003E2UQMS|5.0|I read this book a few days before I saw the movie.Of course I liked the book much better.They changed a lot of things in the movie like the character of Pat's father Patrick.the duration he spent in the asylum and the Asian connection in the story. The dance scenes and the story around the competition comes out much better in the book although a visual media like the movie should have scored over it.The author has developed the characters very well and they are all very credible. The story moves very well and is intense and gripping.It was not easy to put it down.The language and the style of writing are superb.I will highly recommend it for any one looking for serious fiction You may be surprised to see so many basic changes in the two scripts if you have seen the movie, but trust me the story and development of the characters come out much better in the book.<br /><br />Shyam Suri, India

B002BCNK1Q|5.0|One of my favorite modern-day tragedies and stories.  There were not any issues with the quality of the streamed media either.  I recommend just buying this movie if you're the type to watch a movie several times if you liked it.

B000XUBFE2|1.0|This was a very long book, filled with the sadness of the Hitler regime. It was about a very poor family doing their best to survive, while they hid a Jewish man in their basement.  There were very few moments of happiness. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have enjoyed listening to this album since its release in the 90's.  Certainly one of their best albums and worth a listen for all Tool fans.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|I wanted to read this book because I had dealt with old age dementia with a parent. I now understand more about the myriad of directions this disease can take.  It was a slightly painful to read as it hit home on many levels.  Lisa Genova provides a very real experience which is engaging as is changes from the experience of the patient to the feelings and reactions of all around her who are affected by the disease as well. I would recommend this book to baby boomers with aging parents!

B005GFPZYK|3.0|I had high expectations for this book. It came highly recommended by a friend, whom had also read Lone Survivor, a book that I really enjoyed. The book starts off well enough, giving background to his upbringing and introduction to the military, but then derails into many fragmented mini stories. The pacing of the book was awful. The stories felt like one long run on sentence. I felt like there was no heart in the stories being told. These were good stories, just poorly executed. By the later third of the book I began skipping pages, looking forward to the end, and bypassing Taya's pieces altogether. I think the book also suffered from his massive ego. He really didn't come across as a very likable person. I understand this man is an American hero and his bravery and dedication to this country cannot be questioned, but a writer he is not. It's unfortunate that he didn't get the same support in penning his memoirs as Marcus Lutrell did for his book. A little bit of editing would have went a long way.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|found this app to be very useful especially in deciding plans for the day.  the explicit weather conditions coupled with the forecast of days ahead make this weather channel something worthwhile having on your android.
0062206281|3.0|I like to read these wonderful novels in Spanish, but I need a translation. I'm rather shocked at the liberties the translator has taken. Now and then phrases and even whole paragraphs are omitted; references to Spanish and Barcelonan culture history are leveled. For example, books about the \\"desamortizacion of Mendizabal\\" are removed, and the English is reduced to books that \\"scare customers away.\\"<br /><br />Come on! We can look up Mendizabal!<br /><br />David
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Loved it. Can't wait for season 3. All people must have been created just for their roles in this story. Everyone is so good , story is very addicting
B000WOWWXC|5.0|A work of art that should be treasured by the masses. The Mars Volta put together a great album that is atmospheric, artful, and explosive.
0790729393|5.0|By this point, Sleepers is legendary, not only as a film that told of the shocking true story of abuse inside of juvenile prisons, but for launching the careers of some of today's best known stars. Along with being one of Brad Pitt and Jason Patric's first major roles, it also launched the film careers of Jonathan Tucker and Geoff Wigdor. Along with a terrific cast of legends and newcomers, Sleepers brought with it an intense story, the likes of which we hadn't really seen before. The film starts out by introducing us to four boys in Hell's Kitchen during the 1960's. These boys are your typical young teens, having fun, and horsing around, when a horrible accident leads them to jail. This is where they're troubles really begin. The second part of the film jumps twenty years into the future, where we see firsthand how this abuse had a profound effect on all the boys, and the results that come from their behavior. The only major actor in both time periods is Kevin Bacon who just keeps getting better. By that point in his career, I'm sure Bacon could have play just about anyone and made it believable. Other people like Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, give strong performance in what amounts to bit parts in support of the newcomers. Their influence can be seen throughout the film, especially in support of the child actors who I'm sure benefited from being around such legends of the screen. Sleepers is an unbelievable true story that was so well written and supported by some fantastic performances. It's not the perfect movie, but I think it's pretty close.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 10 year old is in love with the game!!! He won't stop playing it! I have been able to use the game as a motivation for help around the house.
B00846REIS|5.0|great book. I like them as much, if not better than Fifty Shades of Grey. But, there are a lot of similarities!
0060794410|5.0|My Commander made this mandatory reading.  It really brought to light a lot of things I was doing right, and some not so right.<br />With all the hoopla of popular thought of what it takes to make a company great, this book explores similarities and differences between what makes great companies and what doesn't.  You have to look at the concepts that the leaders used, not the literal tactics.  If you do you can apply them to your company, government, section, team, etc.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case has a really nice design. Its very simple and works great with the white iphone. It's a bit thick but also protects the phone very well. It has saved my phone many many times!
0790729393|5.0|could you get more A+ actors in one film? this ones a winner. the movie is very dark and smart.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is a great brain game for kids and adults love it good job guys keep doing great things  we will ssuported  it
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I loved the acting and I loved the story line in this movie  ! But mostly I loved the fact that several actors stretched their usual limits and sang their hearts out ! So the sound track is just awesome !  I love it !!!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This book did not disappoint. I have read all the other books in the John Corey series and the panther fits right in. Even if the ending was a little abrupt. I wanna know what happened with buck and how did they get out of Yemen?? Next time Mr. Demille
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This was such a great read and it got me going on reading again. Now what next? We will see!
B008MM9630|3.0|I really love this game but the only problem is crystals...why can't we buy crystal with coins ? They are really expensive and half of the tasks require crystals :/ please do something about so it would get higher rates
0892818875|4.0|It provides a comprehension understanding of aromatherapy for beginners.I like the way the book combines oriental medicine ideology with the practice of aromatherapy.
0151008116|5.0|Unbelievable novel.  Fascinating and worth several readings.  Richard Parker and Piscine Patel are engaged in a love affair you will never forget.  Read the italicized portions in the text carefully and enjoy this wonderful book.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I like the easy game play and familiar style. Best FAOD in a while!<br />Hoping my 7 yo donkey gremlin can play it with his warped finger hooves.

0452295548|5.0|i thought it would be written in &#34;doctor-eze&#34; language, but it is informative, understandable to non-scientists. sooooooo glad i read it.
B000I8ERVC|2.0|Unlike fine wine, Easy Rider has not aged well. This drug-fueled 1969 effort was hugely disappointing, which is saying something, given my well-known appreciation for New Hollywood cinema. Fonda and Hopper are weak sauce as leads. I was reminded of James Taylor and Dennis Wilson from [[ASIN:B00001ODI0 Two Lane Blacktop]], but at least they were singers, not actors.<br /><br />There are better films by almost any measuring stick. Most importantly, there are better road films: [[ASIN:B00028HBIE Sugarland Express]] and [[ASIN:B00013RC8O Vanishing Point]], to name just two from the era. Counterculture biker film? [[ASIN:0767818172 The Wild One]]. For a progressive exercise in filmmaking techniques, [[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane]] had it beat by almost thirty years. And if all you want is a young Jack Nicholson on his way to acting superstardom, there's always the diner scene in [[ASIN:B00002VWE0 Five Easy Pieces]].<br /><br />Easy Rider's [[ASIN:B000006YEQ soundtrack]] is really the only thing to recommend.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|The kids loves it. The movie was very funny. The kids watched it 3 times. I would rent it again
B001UTW7QU|2.0|Poor script writing with impractical situations that are too unlikely to actually be believable. Have an accident in a top secret lab and not have the government confiscate all the equipment and materials so that the insane researcher can be released from the asylum many years later and go right back into his secret lab at Harvard and take up where he left off. Come on scriptwriters. It has to at least be plausible not just sensational.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This book is entirely too long and I personally think it should be short and to the point. Hopefully you get this message and decide to takes matters into your own hands and change some things about this book.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|So much for the &#34;classics&#34;!  The story line was great, but Hugo really rambles on so much that it took me over a month to read this novel.  Pages upon pages of uneeded back story, history of Paris, etc.  I found myself scanning and skipping pages at a time to get back to the real story!  The actual story was great, but no more Hugo for me!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the virst. More action better rewards  couldn't stop playing  always on it when possible  amazing for almost all ages
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I think this was pretty good. IF u like video games. which I don't.  but its way better the first one
0785132619|5.0|I was initially hesitant to have it shipped from across the country, but it came in perfect condition. The Kick-Ass series is fantastic and all serious comic book enthusiasts should give it a read.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I want to fly away.  I want to get away, I want to fly away.  Yeah!  That's about it. Boo Yah!
0785152458|5.0|The book came in perfect condition and was delivered very quickly. As for the book itself, it was a fantastic comic. I highly recommend it to all comic book fans, but make sure to keep it away from young children.

B005YVTHT0|4.0|I don't have the space or inclination for a full wheel. I was using an xBox controller and this was a huge step up.  Control is precise and it feels solid and well made. Cable is fairly long and made of durable cloth covered shielding.<br /><br />Only complaint is that the shape, while taken from a real Formula template can slip down in your hands. I modified it by zip tying soft rubber bushings to the top loop of the frame that catches my hand at my index fingers base so it doesn't slip down further. A 50 cent fix.<br /><br />I use this on Simraceway and Shift 2 Unleashed. Works a charm.  Although it doesn't have force feedback, I imagine adding that would make the device way to heavy. It a precise, well made racing controller.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|I noticed the Amazon special; $5 Albums and couldn't resist a look & listen. I came across the Black Keys. I had never (at least not aware that I had) listened to the music before. On this particular day, I gave it a try.<br /><br />I loved the sound so much after just a minute or so of listening that I bought the album. I haven't stopped listening to it since. The Black Keys have been the only other artist I have been listening to in the past few weeks, Thickfreakness became the record to make me give Blunderbuss a rest (albeit a tiny, intermission rest).<br /><br />Immediately I felt like I had been missing out; I had, and needed to catch up. I was blown away at how the band managed this Jimi Hendrix style play with music!! This is truly soulful-blues-rock and I am loving it!<br /><br />Turns out the Black Keys have a huge concert coming up near my city. I found this album just in time to became a fan AND show my support by seeing them live in concert.<br /><br />I don't believe I have ever heard an artist or artists previously unknown to me and become such a big fan so quickly.  That's what this album did for me.<br /><br />Thanks for keeping me in tune with the music Amazon. Thank you Black Keys for your gritty, guitar heavy, deep raspy vocal stylings of artistic expression!!
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Right in step with other Montezuma games. However, does not have too many innovative features - once you have played one you have played all.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|All of this authors books that I have read have been good. Action packed! Reminds me of Dean koontz . Crazy plot, kept you reading, enjoyable.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|It's exactly the same book as Bared to you. I feel very cheated. What in the world is that bout?
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Good princess movie without the traditional fairytale ending where prince rescues the princes.. My daughter (4) loved watching her shoot arrows and fight the bears.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Acting and directing top notch. Alan Arkin was superb. Truth is better than fiction at any time.A must seefor movie fans
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was good and I would recommend it to Grisham fans but I think his earlier works like The Street Lawyer, The Client and The Runaway Jury were better.  The outcome was predictable and you wondered why it turned out as it did.  Was justice served?<br />I will always read his books because I really learn something about the justice system (or lack thereof) and his character development is the absolute best!
B007YJS7G4|4.0|I showed this to my high school class during Black History Month.  Although it was overly-dramatized at times, it was a very good movie.  It has a few curse words, but nothing bad (no F word).  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the military and is African-American.  It is a very inspiring movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I started playing this because of my daughter and now I can't stop. I think this is a great brain buster for everyone to try.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|With all the different permutations of Sherlock Holmes on tv and in the movies these days, it's good to go back to Doyle's original stories to get the real thing. Once you do, it adds so much more depth to the BBC series Sherlock, Elementary and the recent movies. Whether you think Basil Rathbone, Benedict Cumberbatch or Robert Downey Jr. -- or whoever plays him in Elementary -- is the definitive Sherlock Holmes, it really helps to reference the true original stories to see where it all began!
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Favorite album last year.  Love the diversity of sounds and creativity Glasper brings to this Jazz Soul Hip-Hop infusion! Stongly recommended!
B0084IHVGG|5.0|Great shape great timing no hassle no compliants my duaughter loves this classic disney movie its seen everyday in my house
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|really fun game and so easy to do. glad there are free games to play . it would cost a fortune if you had to buy everthing
B00B23O97Y|3.0|Let's face it, the dude's getting old.  Both he and Paul McCartney recently releasing albums that would make my grandfather smile.  Every once in a while Clapton throws you a bone (a bit of a guitar riff), but for the most part, this is pleasant background music, nothing more.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|we needed it to read certain books. I think it should of came with the kindle fire for what we paid for the item
B001GPTC1Q|3.0|Graphics could have been better. Also the movie could have been shorter. Unnecessarily they have stretched the movie to come to the point
B0063IH60K|5.0|really fun game and so easy to do. glad there are free games to play . it would cost a fortune if you had to buy everthing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a fun and not a bad game also I like the new types of places and boards
B00AREIAI8|4.0|cute game. my seven year old cousins love it. wish tasks could be done quicker but I guess it is one of those long term games
B00BETX5PS|3.0|This is not a Bond movie at all. There is no Bond's charm and humor anymore. The soundtrack is not bad though...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i love tis app it is amazing i love eating little baby humans i really like it alot it is the best app ever
B008DVKTMW|5.0|This album is very good, compared to many other new groups I've heard lately.<br /><br />It's not easy to find talent these days..
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|The story idea and Depp character design are great. Too bad the script failed to do justice to the great beginning.
B009PHRIEA|5.0|I love these Mini LP style mega packs!<br />Sound is also very good, and with No Compression Mastering!!!<br />I wish they had the inner sleeves to complete the original package.<br />Still great value!
0061726834|5.0|Definitely a 5 star book! Although the actual story line is hard to imagine, this great author/writer makes you think it's true. A gripping story of the future- society has succumbed under a strict government mind control. There are a few \\"normal\\" people left to fight for what they believe in: love, truth and honesty. At first I thought the first few chapters were a little slow, because it seemed I was told many times about the procedure. (NO spoilers) Then I realized the purpose -the author was making the reader realize how much control the government had over the citizens mind. How the government over the past 40 years had brainwashed almost everyone. So, those first few chapters were very important for readers to understand how much the people were controlled. Then, wow, a fast paced read. I couldn't stop! I immediately ordered the last 2 books of this trilogy. I cannot say enough about the wonderful writing- it was fast, intriguing, and includes every aspect of life. I would give it 6 stars if I could.[
B0018BF1HW|5.0|I love these Mini LP style mega packs!<br />Sound is also very good, and with No Compression Mastering!!!<br />I wish they had the inner sleeves to complete the original package.<br />Still great value!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed this bible.  It is easy to change books, verses, and chapters.  You can decide which bible that you want to read.  That is Great.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was one of the best ho games I've played. . I enjoyed it very much. The story line was EXCELLENT! I recommend this game to any ho games lost, like myself. You will not be disappointed!<br /> Big fish just keeps impressing me
B002Q7JYPC|3.0|It's an okay album. I really like the song &#34;Too Busy Being Fabulous&#34;, but the rest of the songs not so much.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've done this workout for four days now and I feel like I am getting a really good workout.  After the first day I was very sore, but now I'm adjusting to the workout.  I'm still panting and sweating after I do the level one workout so I will keep at this level for at least a few more days.<br />Jillian can sound a little annoying at times, but for the most part her instructions help me to push through the workout.<br /><br />What I dislike is her opening description that is part of the root menu so I can't fast forward through it.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|very fun app and competitave against yourself too. very nice for something to do when your bored. I would reccomend this game for all ages 2 to 60.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Very well written and brought out emotions while I read it. Hard to say that about a sci-if story usually. Thank you for the good story.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|I can't get this app to stay open, it opens to the \\"home\\"  page, then goes to the \\"start\\" page for one second and then dissapears. I have a call into amazon for assistance.
B00122HUN0|5.0|This album was like stepping back into the 80's! They should reissue more of these 80's albums on MP3! Great sound and clarity without the rewinds of the 80's cassette tapes!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|My eyes are open now and my action is to vote in the next election.  What will you do to change our country?
B008MAI0WK|5.0|This would be a fine resource for anyone thinking about getting a Raspberry PI.  It is a great introduction to the PI.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I thought this was good overall, but I wish there was a bit more variety in scenery. You run for a long time and it is nice to have a change of pace.
B001J53X9U|4.0|The first reason why I love this movie is becuase Heath Ledger's performance. Probably the best villian of all-time. The Bat Pod is for display only and it is meant as a display only, as it can't be removed from the stand. The material used is 100% plastic, it will look really good along with your movie collection.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Our family had been waiting for this one...my 10 & 12 year old read 2 of the books. We saw a screening in 3D and my 3 year old, who rarely sits through movies sat with the glasses on for the whole movie laughing out loud. The older ones couldn't stop talking about it after the movie. I'm not sure if I enjoyed the movie more or my kid's reactions. I would also give this an extremely hight family friendliness rating!
B001PPGAIA|4.0|For one thing, the grand sea, continuous mountains, fantastic bare land, prairie, even desert constitute the magnificent and terrific background of the narration of an epic-like story; for another, the story itself elaborates on fight for indignity and integrity, mothering ,amour, magic, natural force, aboriginal cult, root seeking…… and all these elements convey and are stemmed from the same point-dreaming
B003WKOU0G|5.0|My husband and I are expecting in a few weeks and we loved this movie!  It was very cool to see the juxtaposition of babies in 4 very different cultures.  In the end, babies are just babies all over the world. :)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book is definitely worth reading. It has a unique story line and keeps you guessing...to the end and beyond. I would recommend it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great puzzles, it is a fun way to relax and just not think of a thing.  Would love to see more.
B0093X805W|5.0|I love Charlie and grandma Georgina.  Every kid should read this book.  It is so much better than the movie!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I have seen some standing cases that swivel.  That is the only thing I don't like about this one.  It is satisfactory.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Why would anyone read the dictionary? I mean, come on. This book was one of the worst books ever made!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a kind of fun, mindless game at the &#34;easy&#34; level - haven't tried the harder levels yet.  Is there a stylist one can use instead of fat fingers to draw?
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I really liked it - I wouldn't want to be a passenger on that flight but it was superb - acting by all was great and John Goodman's character was a hoot!
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|I don't know if my problems are game related or kindle related. It insists on being upside down now this is a new glitch. Also when I need to tilt device nothing happens tried to get answers from help site  good luck with that
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I thought the animation was somewhat juvenile for the game.  I wasn't sure how to play but I was getting points. Maybe good for kids.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved season 3 and hate that I have to wait till 2014 for Season 4.<br />The costumes, the scenery, that house and all the character are marvelous.<br />I am addicted to the program.<br />PBS has a winner with this series that's for sure.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|It's really really really really bad.  Its so bad that I will certainly think twice before purchasing another Tarentino film.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|If you like puzzle type games this will keep you playing. I find myself losing track of time playing the game :)
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Can't get past 4th game. paid $3 for 10 minutes of play. Thought I had just touched wrong button. Really disappointed.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It can be a little addicting, want to keep playing to top your own score. Have to stay balanced when playing.
B008GWSS6W|5.0|This is a movie with two great stars who always worked well together. Lots of laughter and slapstick humor. Be sure to watch.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|well, this is really the end of the great ALIEN SAGA.....i really like the first 3 ALIEN movies.....They are TOTAL classics, with great stories and AMAZING scenes in the space.....this one, PROMETHEUS is TOTALLY disgusting!!!!! There´s some really sick scenes through ALL the movie, and the story is completely uninspired.....stick with the original first 3 ones....maybe the RESURRECTION one, but stay away from this disgusting NO STORY movie!!!!! BLERRRRGH!!!!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|It was a good enough reading, but lacks a plot or something, since most chapters are disconnected. It actually decrease my admiration for Tina a little bit....
B000001FTD|5.0|While a really like all ANTHRAX´s albums until SOUND OF WHITE NOISE, this one, the classic AMONG THE LIVING is their MASTERPIECE!!!!! All the songs are gens, some are TRUE classics like the title track, CAUGHT IN A MOSH, I AM THE LAW, NFL and INDIANS!!!!! AMONG THE LIVING is TOTAL THRASH HARDCORE perfection!!!!if you like heavy rock, you will love AMONG!!!!!try STATE OF EUPHORIA and PERSISTENCE OF TIME too!!!!!!ANTHRAX RULES!!!!!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Ang Lee's masterful rendering onto the screen of Yann Martel's 2001 novel by the same name to the screen.  An excellent parable about choosing to believe/not believe in God today.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|TED is a good movie... There´s a LOT of questionable jokes through ALL the movie, but if you got a open mind you can dig TED....
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Despite some great performances by Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren even Scarlet Johanssen, a surprisingly \\"flat\\" film about Alfred Hitchcock's making of Psycho.  Indeed, this film could offer something of a \\"case study\\" of how excellent individual performances don't necessarily make a great whole
B000001FSU|5.0|STATE OF EUPHORIA is another great THRASH HARDCORE METAL album from ANTHRAX!!!!! The first 6 albums from ANTHRAX are truly GREAT!!!! All the songs are great!!!!!WELL DONE, ANTHRAX!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|Despite some great performances by Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren even Scarlet Johanssen, a surprisingly \\"flat\\" film about Alfred Hitchcock's making of Psycho.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a very creative story that keeps kids and adults entertained throughout the whole show.  My kids watched it multiple times.  I want to keep watching it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Clearly in the Top Tier of entertainment series of all time!  Watch it twice and enjoy it 3X as much!!!!!!!
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|I love to read the English gossip.  I have a fan for many many years. and I am updated on that
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I liked the movie, some people might find it to be offensive towards very religious people, but in overall it's quite hilarious.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|No real character development.  Could not get into it.  Living through Jimmy Carter once was bad enough.  Obviously my opinion is in the minority or was Hollywood giving itself a pat on the back at the Oscars?
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read every one of his books and look forward to the next one.  His style of writing is always the same and easy to understand and follow.  Great Author.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had the opportunity to watch this in the movies. I did enjoy it and thought how much better to read the book. How right I was. So much detail that you never knew took place in the movie. It's a great book for teens and adults alike. I just know you'll never want to put it down until it ends.
1449325947|5.0|This is a great book for learning CSS. It teaches you all of CSS not just the changes that have happened since CSS3. It is exactly what it claims to be, a manual for CSS. It read easily, things are explained in more than one way in case you didn't get it the first time and there are tutorials that you download and work on because actually scripting is what makes it stick. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn CSS. You do need to have a working understanding of HTML even though there is a small HTML explanation in the beginning of the book.
0316010669|5.0|Great collection of interesting studies and insight.  Valuable information for everybody in the modern world.  Very well written - I definitely recommend it!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|What a great read. Real, live characters that you get to know and become old friends. Rich, carefully crafted scenery. Real emotions.  If you're expecting plain science fiction, you're in for a surprise. This is actually great literature, up there with Vonnegut, Twain, and Hemingway.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Game app well worth my money. I usually get apps free but the grandsons were here and requested the app and it's been played a lot. Well worth my money!
1454701250|5.0|This book is so wonderful to look at! It has loads of creative projects and beautiful photos. I have not tried any of the projects, but the author definitely makes it look pretty simple.Tons of inspiration that will make you itch to create something! I highly recommend it!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Our grandsons enjoy playing this game every time they come over so much that I have to set a timer for them to take turns playing it. Surprisingly, my husband enjoys the game also!
B004CURZFC|5.0|My granddaughter saw this online and really wanted to see it. After searching, netflix, verizon fios, and others I found this on Amazon Prime and I got extra grandma bonus points.  Made her very happy and she loved the movie.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Started out slowly but built to an incredible crescendo that finished with a bang. Well with the slow read at the beginning can't wait to start the next one.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Great game and all but it sadly only gives you like fifteen minutes to try it out so that is why I gave it only three stars.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Here's another Grisham novel that will prevent you from getting eight hours sleep.  Seamlessly well-written, as usual, Grisham takes us into the hopeless confines of incarceration, where a questionably guilty man plots a complex escape with the involvement of fellow prisioners and outside accomplices. The authorities and the reader are kept in the dark until the last pages of this compelling story.  Can you often predict the outcome of mystery novels?  Not this one.  Give it a whirl.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the book! It was a story that could be personal story for someone. I love books that do not make a fairytale out of real emotions! Well written!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is a brain tester it is so much fun. it is free 4 fun. u should fitly get it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another history lesson through the eyes of Ken Follett.  An absolutely absorbing book with wonderful content and a cast of very interesting characters.  Will we see a third book soon?  This was a fantastic read!  Thank you Mr. Follett!
B00992CF6W|5.0|build worlds and select createive or surviveal in surviveal kill zombies and kill pigs cows and chicken for food and kill sheep for whool let your imaganation run wild!
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Very funny story as long as you're not offended by some raw language and subject matter. The animation and voice over for Ted were great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is so awesome! I really like the new updates and can't wait 4 the others. I like it because I can play mine craft anywhere I want to now and they keep adding more awesome stuff so DOWNLOAD. THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this bag after reading the reviews of others and have found it to be a real gem. My camera and misc. equipment fit nicely and it has lots of padding to protect my investment. There is still room as I expand from a hobby to pro. :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Book was a non stop read.  I enjoyed it because it had more real life drama that could happen....very heart wrenching...made me cry :)
B001P1MZNI|5.0|What more do I need to say? This is a recording of one of his live acts. While it isn't studio quality music, it's Frank!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I know I'm in the minority on this but it didn't blow my mind or even impress me as a film that will last forever in the fabric of our culture.  I liked the setting and costume accuracy... that much was superb.  The acting?  Meh.  Solid work.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Though I found the this movie somewhat entertaining, I can't help but feel like something or a lot of something was missing. I felt the story line was ok, but I think for me, it was the lack of character connection that was missing. DKR moves swiftly to connect all the dots from the previous two movies, but it failed I think in character chemistry department that the other two had going for them. Alfred, the Commissioner and Lucius ....its like they never had a past with one another and lacked that energy and spirit that showed in the first two movies.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Music, alot of people, can relate to,.....then we get over it. I'm sure that all the money, Phil made, singing about, how heart broken, he was, over his divorce, had to help him heal!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|Oh this trilogy really revved up your imagination. Good job E L James. I hope the author writes something else real soon.
B000VXJMYG|5.0|Great music that continues to entertain, no matter, how old we get. These tunes come from a time, when &#34;political correct&#34;, was just a word and NOT a &#34;way of life&#34;. We should ALL, miss those days.......I do.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|The game might be fun if you could steer better. Tilting hardly works and tapping the screen isn't so great either. You will find you have very poor control unless you keep checking the brake, which is bad since it's a timed game. I played a few games and decided it wasn't worth my time. Grapics are nice and overall a good concept, but just lack of control. Oh well.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|So much individual talent, being coordinated and combined, to result in so much great music. It never gets old. Thanks
B0001ZXM54|5.0|Lots and lots of great tunes from the older ones to some newer stuff. I just like ZZ Top so it is all good in my book.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|love it<br />cant stop playing....I'm a big fish fan. will buy full version as have with all others...they let you try for free so give it a shot
B00377V6J2|4.0|There is a lot of instrumental on this plus a lot of talking, but the songs are great and both guys are masters.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|this had alot of  suspense and was totally creepy.. i liked it so much i had to watch it twice
B00BHMF578|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It's one I would like to own.  I was a young adult when these actual events happened, but I had never heard about this fake movie and the six Americans involved.  All I remembered was the embassy hostages, so this was very interesting.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Never saw the movie so I had no idea of the twists and turns. Very enjoyable. Looking forward to reading more by this author.
B002M9WW30|1.0|after receiving the collection i figured i would go ahead and have a rocky marathon.  i got throu rocky 1 -3 and then my favorite rocky movie number 4 did not work so i skipped it and sure enough 5 did not work and neither did the last rocky movie.  do not buy from this seller it was horrible
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This is a good album.Sure we all have other takes of this material, but dont dog this effort.It is the LAST one coming from Mr. Kramer.Sound is great and to those who are nitpicking............do it somewhere else, or go buy a Bay City Rollers cd.We all want commercially available stuff that hasnt been released. How bout the \\"acetate\\" recordings,johnny Winter/Taj Mahal recordings. These will probably never happen.People need to quit complaining and enjoy what the man did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!!! Love it lots! This game keeps you wanting to play with the powerups and the special characters you can play with. The best part of it is competing against your friends to get the best hi score. This game is a must download! Time goes by so qiuickly when hour having fun!
B0000X61VE|5.0|I enjoy working out to this video.  I always feel the effects of it. When I do this video every day for 5 days a week, I am healthy and fit. Highly recommended!!!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|One of Gary Oldman's best performances ever! A wonderful spy flick with great performances by others in the cast as well.<br />Not a feel-good movie, but really well done. I loved it!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This was a free app of the day when I got it ,which was great because I was looking for a good slenderman game app and this one is a good one.You move really slow in it and will make you think it lags.but all in all that boosts the fear.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|What a fun game, my kids love it. The graphics are very good and the game seems to be very realistic.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|was recommended by a friend, and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. literally I had to disappear into a bathroom at work to read it.<br />I love child genius stories, I love the political discourses and the alternate ways of thinking.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a good game If your the type of person who likes mystery hunting, searching for clues that sort of game. It will defintely help you past the time away.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I had been use this headphone almost 2 years, and it is now broken. The left ear is not working and the right ear have some noise too. I was expecting it can last longer due to the high review but for the price, I think it worth it. Really light weight but if you are looking for better sound quality, this is not the one you should get.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game is great for Memory and Entertainment, can sit down and an hour passes before you know it, you are hooked!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks.  I liked the character development of the herione.  I liked that he didn't make this character dependent on others.  Loved the twist at the very end!  Once I started I couldn't put it down.  Since reading the book, I have seen the movie.  I loved the movie, but the book (as usual) was better.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|I enjoyed this, a nice technological piece with a touch of doomsday and survival instinct...  looking forward to Daemon and the character development
B00338QENI|5.0|Very enjoyable, the human aspect and the learning.  The writer has done her homework and shows that she really cares about these people involved.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|The workds of at least the main two singles from this album are pretty thoght provoking, but I think the vocalist does well at focussing on the melody, leaving the deeper meaning to an engaged listener.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love John Grisham, there's always some humor in his books, and the ends usually justify the means.  This ending puts me in mind of another JG book a read some years back.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Breaking Bad (seasons 1,2,and3 are all I've watched so far)  is excellent....not sure how I missed out on this show the first time around.  I plan on watching through season 4 before the final season 5 this summer.  I like everything about it, the acting, the writing, the setting, the &#34;twins,&#34; the dark humor...the series is a winner all around!
B001PPLIEG|3.0|not a big fan of Daniel Craig as Bond.Get a new one and go back to the old bond with the gadgets and the girls
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I was able to install this application on my Kindle Fire HD easily.  I read news everyday wit this application.  It has so many kinds of news to read.  The format and the flip operation was so marvelous.  I love this application and the new content.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|IT WAS SUCH A GOOD BOOK AND I REALLY LIKED IT YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK and I love it.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|This thing was a little funky to assemble, but after that it's easy to use and compact.<br /><br />I recommend NOT using the little &#34;tapper&#34; hammer to break the glass. Alternating pouring boiling water over the score and then cold tap water produces a much cleaner final cut. I do this in the kitchen sink and get consistently smooth results requiring very little abrasive touch-up to the glass.<br /><br />You don't need to score hard or deep or repeatedly, but you do need to score the entire way around. Skipping any small spot will make an ugly break.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A phenomenal story. I never had any idea what was going to happen next, the authors kept surprising me. Absolutely amazing. Highly recommended
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Very enjoyable movie that would be fun for the whole family.  Fun inside jokes for gamers who grew up in the 80s & 90s
B00BBW16HW|5.0|If you want to see a movie that's inspirational, moving, and heartwarming, this is the perfect movie for you. This is now officially in my top 10 favorite movies. Great story, acting, and soundtrack. You will not be disappointed. If you're worried about the subtitles because it's a French film, don't be. They're easy to read/follow throughout the film. Hurry and watch it already!
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|The movie moved to slow at times. Too much panorama. I think the director was enthralled by the special effects. Was a good first try though.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I downloaded this book because it was in the number on spot in Waterstones and I was pleasantly suprised.  Often hilarious, and always unexpected it gives you a quick history lesson on the way.  A great read.
B0081L391C|2.0|Had a lot of unnecessary profanity. There were a some good funny and serious moments, though. Overall, I'm sorry I purchased this movie.
B001F6TXME|5.0|By all means this thing is perfect. I have a Nikon D3100 which does not have an infrared sensor so I have to use a wired remote. This thing is plenty long so you can take self portraits without using a timer. It also offers a feature that you can slide a piece of plastic over the button to hold it down so you don't have to stand there holding the button for exposures or rapid fire pictures. I bring it everywhere with me
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Interesting idea ... the whole premise of the lives of video game characters ... but certainly not the first, as we've seen with Lara Croft and so many others.  Even so, not a movie I'd sit through a second time.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great plot, supported the Bond Paradigm while introducing new (old) characters. Looking forward to the next 50 years of 007
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooooo much fun. I am so addicted y this game. But please add some more boards for girls. This game will not waste your time so I would play this game:):):):):):):):) :{) :p
030758836X|5.0|Whoa - George and Martha ain't got nuthin' on Nick and Amy!<br /><br />It has been a long time since a novel has played so devilishly with my mind, setting me up to like first one character and then the other and then despise both of them and then begrudgingly admire one and then the other . . . .<br /><br />I'm still hearing their voices in my ear.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is a great band and a great selection of music. It's folk music with a twist! LOVE this CD!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Fun to play and makes a very long bus ride seem a lot shorter then it actually is and keeps kids entertained.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is a laugh outloud movie! A movie for everyone that likes to laugh. You can relate to the characters! Hilarious!
B00BMCLCG6|1.0|....smells like someone farted in a cup and then put it over your face and then kicked you in the nuts while pouring hot coffee over head.
B00B1MHXY2|4.0|This CD is a true classic and will bring you back in time. Each song has a memory and you will remember where you were just like it was yesterday!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have tried watching Upstairs, Downstairs and I just never connected with the people or the plots.<br />With Lark Rise to Candleford, I felt the people and the plots were real.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|This movie has something for everyone! You can relate in so many ways and you see your own relationships. It warms your heart!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|last 5 minutes were very exciting, but l was expecting much more in the development of the script. sound editing was sub-par, it was very hard to hear parts of the dialog.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Was able to download the episodes and enjoy them while travelling. Great way to enoy on the go!!! Love it.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|My main criticism is the character/casting. The &#34;girlfriend&#34; is much to young & typecast, as are all the other &#34;unbelievable cast&#34;. John Goodman was such a stereo-type it was not funny, even when it was supposed to be. Maybe a 12 year old would enjoy the excitement of the crashing plane scenes, although the drug/alcohol content does not make this a suitable movie for kids. Was even bored w/Denzal's character. I thought it would have been a better movie but the script was so childish, predictable, & terrible. So glad I didn't waste my money seeing this at the theater. Maybe my expectations are too much these days-hoping for a great movie. Very disappointing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say...I was sorry when I ran out of episodes. This is a great way to enjoy it.
140123755X|1.0|What a mess of a story.  Everything but the kitchen sink has been thrown  iin!  Don't waste your money! Ugh@
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game on my compurter and was glad to be able to put it on my Kindle Fire; now I can take it with me. Tiles are bright and colorful. I'd recomend it to anyone who likes this type of game.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony's voice is always wonderful, but hs wonderful sounds really become enhanced when singing these duets.<br />Love the choices of the songs, and makes for great listening music.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|There are very few shows worth watching on TV anymore, but Castle is one of my favorites. I tell everyone to watch it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This iteration of Sherlock Holmes' adventures is beautifully written, acted, and directed with cinema-like production value, in my opinion. Each episode is filled with detail and suspense.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Couldn't wait until the next time I had time to pick it up and read it.
B00008WT49|5.0|Love the songs, good recording (not audiophile, even in DSD), I listen to it over and over.  I've fallen in love with Norah through this album
B0013D8LCW|5.0|The movie starts off a bit slow, and my first thought was &#34;why did I order this, what a waste of money&#34;... but as the story continued it completely sucked me in, I love the story line, the charecters, the entire movie!  Definitely one of the best movies of its kind!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I love listening to this album.  The recording quality is quite good, not excellent (for you audiophiles), but quite good.  I love that you hear JT conversing with Carol King, telling some old stories.  Can't go wrong with this.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Frustrating viewing as it was choppy, pausing only to start over.<br />However content of the show is great and enjoyable.
B00447L4KA|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT IS CUTE...YOU MAY WANT TO WATCH IT MORE THAN ONCE..I THINK THAT ALL OF US GIRLS CAN RELATE TO THE OVERBEARING FATHER IN THIS MOVIE AT LEAST ONCE OR TWICE..RIGHT GIRLS....I KNOW I CAN...
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I love the John Corey books. I feel that I know him.<br />This book is set on Long Island on the North Fork. Very real with real places. Super action, scary stuff and a great story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had been meaning to check out Downton Abbey for quite some time.  When I finally watched Episode 1, I was hooked.  I watched Season 1 in a week.  I watched Season 2 the following week, and Season 3 the week after that.  It was like a good book I couldn't put down!  My only regret is that now I have to wait until they release Season 4.
B0086449YA|5.0|Two-CD set by the master of finger picked Fender Stratocaster. If you like him, you will love this! Make the buy!
0823003590|4.0|I heard that some pupils of an art class was suggested to use it and I must say I can see why. Very good.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|If you are a Glee fan you will love this movie.  I rented not seeing the reviews, just recommended by a friend so didn't really check it out,  actually thought I was getting a baseball movie, but was pleasantly surprised. The movie is fun and hilarious and if you are in the mood for a light movie you will enjoy.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|I enjoyed book suspense an I could not wait to get to the last page I read the Racketeer in two days it is a very enjoyable book to read
B000P0J024|5.0|You can get much better that these talented guys.  I have really enjoyed the DVD watching these guys play and sing, it was like being there.  Great music.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The first season, in my opinion, is still the best but this is a great tv show for the adult audience.
B0000691U1|5.0|Probably the very best progressive jazz recording I have ever heard. These are considered the very best of musicians in their field recognized both jazz and classical aficionados.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Saw this flick at the theater and had to have it.  The Blue Ray/DVD is excellent.  The digital copy is great to take on trips.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Even though I ordered HD movie, it plays with black gaps on top and bottom of the screen.  So it was hard to appreciate all the special effects.<br /><br />It had some good moments, a lot of violence, but I didn't get much humor from it.  Adele's music was great at the start...
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loved this movie. Easy download and good quality of viewing. I will rent more movies.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|Sure I would check a few documentaries and the like on The History Channel... But never thought they would make a work of fiction with this quality. The major networks should watch out, History + MGM are making quality entertainment. One of the best shows on TV right now.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used the new adroid app for a couple days and after fighting with it to find what I wanted to see, I finally uninstalled it. It was so &#34;fancy&#34; that you couldn't read half the info - words on top of words,,,,,, I have a tablet so the size of the words wasn't the problem - just too much going on, rather than basic weather info. After uninstalling it I used Accu weather for awhile and then found out that the &#34;kindle&#34; version is what I had been using before and installed that. As long as I don't update this version, I can enjoy the weather channel again, but will not use the android version.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|This movie was a little confusing because most the details were from a sleeping point. You do however need to watch this because it really leads you into the others.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, my mom gave me the movie many years ago and i watch it at least once a year!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to understand. Fun to play. Wish it was easier to get gems. Can be time consuming. But overall great game. The horses and background look realistic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend these books to anyone. They're absolutely fantastic! I could not stop reading these books once I started.  I wish the author would continue the series!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Every time one of my friends asks me what they should read next, I say this series. The writing is top-notch and the story is great. I have read the Wool series and the Shift series that follows and have been impressed the whole time. You will not regret buying this book. It's so good I would buy it again just to give the author my continued support.
0061733199|5.0|Outstanding book all the info you will need for any situation. A must for preppers and back country enthusiastic people. just add ammo and you are good to go. He He He
B003Q6D1Z6|4.0|Though this film has been around for well over two years, I hadn't ever seen it until recently. Everyone I've talked to that's watched it has either loved it or hated it, and I find myself in the unique position of being in the middle. I found the first half of the film to be much stronger than the latter half, mainly due to the suspense and intrigue surrounding the plot. When the big reveal comes towards the two-thirds mark, I felt a little disconnected because I (and I like to think almost everyone else) would have acted completely differently than Nev does.<br /><br />The film is definitely a wake up call to everyone who immerses themselves in social media. An even scarier thought is that this took place almost three years ago; a lifetime in technological standards. The fact that someone could create this intricate web of lies with nothing more than an internet connection is truly frightening.<br /><br />I'm hesitant to believe the validity of this documentary. Either it's a great hoax that was well thought out and sincerely acted, or it's real and every little detail truly did happen, even if it does seem much too convenient. This is definitely an intriguing tale either way, and makes for an interesting watch.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|Andre Schiff's performance on his new rendition of Bach masterworks is quite spectacular.  Anyone who loves Bach will certainly enjoy and benefit by Schiff''s updated performance and his approach to this great work.  One should buy the score for both books so one can follow his fluidity and tonality in each piece.
B0053FANRC|4.0|If you like car races, this has the action you are looking for. It also has a little drama as well.
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|I have watched all of them and this was a disappointment. Sure wish It was a little bit more like Jason Bourne. I regret buying the movie.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I thought that it was a well done film. It was intriguing. If you are a sports fan you will enjoy. It was a clean film that didn't have anything really too racy in it. Overall great!
B008M7JODC|5.0|Very good show, different. Picks up a lot starting at episode 10 and the final episodes of the first season are really entertaining. Will definitely watch season 2, and hopefully the rest.
B007SXB498|5.0|This is my most favorite book my magnificent, wonderful, beloved Jane Austen.<br />I love everything about this story (though i have to admit that i don't like Marianne very much). How Jane Austen creates so many different and interesting characters is beyond me. Every character in her books is a seperate personalit, not just a carbon copy with a few lines. They all are so alive, so vivid. And the writing is absolutely delicious :)<br />I wish authors still wrote in this style.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|This game was cool. On my phone the graphics didnt looks so hot but overall i thought it to be a cool game.
B007ED9FIY|5.0|I loved this movie. I enjoyed watching George Clooney playing a real dad with real emotions. The relationship with his teen daughter felt so true that you forgot that you were watching George Clooney , which is the best complement you can give an actor. I will recommend this movie to all my friends!!
B008NABUU8|4.0|This game was cool. On my phone the graphics didnt looks so hot but overall i thought it to be a cool game.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Wonderful storyline played brilliantly by the main actors Francois Cluzet as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss.  Philippe is the rich benevolent quadriplegic who hires Driss - a young Senegalese from the banlieu of Paris.  This could be your typical unlikely partnership that flowers into friendship.  However, the actors play with such emotion and genuine camaraderie that the story rises to another level.  One sees that Driss adds color and adventure back into Philippe's life while Philippe helps Driss discover purpose and responsibility in his life.  An utterly entertaining movie worth watching at least once if not several times.
