0547848412|5.0|I avoided this book for a long time. Just didn't think it would be my thing. When I read the reviews and I was surprised at how many there were, I decided to take a chance. This was a great book and a quick read. I couldn't put it down. Try it!
1573225517|5.0|Great book! Very entertaining. Nick Hornsby is a brilliant writer. Humorous plot, believable, sympathetic characters, and some really great descriptive moments about life and relationships. Loved the walk down 80's and 90's music memory lane as well.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|A movie with great imagination based on \\"Time & Life\\".  I'm not one for watching movie's with far fetched idea's which is what I thought I was getting into before I watched this one, but I was wrong, this had just enough to keep my interest and made me wonder what it would be like if this was to happen someday. This was action filled, but with a \\"Creative and Imaginative\\" twist to it, unlike the usual jumping out of airplanes, hitting the ground and still getting up to continue your lunch date without even as so much as a scratch on you.  The thought of using \\"Time\\" as currency to live is a interesting concept. To be monitored in life by  \\"Timekeeper's\\" to determine how much time your clock has left. In this movie one must have \\"Time\\" embedded in their wrist to exist in life, to continue to live, to buy grocery's, to travel or to get to work, everything cost time.  The concept to live in a world which is programmed to  allow life to go to age 25, then one must borrow, steal, or gamble to get  more  time from somewhere or their  time clock will expire and they will die. Justin Timberland plays the role of a young man who lives in a poverty stricken area where TIME is of very little and  trying to survive another day is full time job. His mothers life is in jeopardy simply because she has two hours left on her wrist, her bus fare to get home from work has been changed from 1 hour to 2 hours, she frantically  runs through the streets hoping to find her son (who is played my Timberland) who has time on his wrist and can lend her some. What will come of that...hmmmm, take the time to watch it.  As the movie continues Wil<br /> (Timberland) sets out to attempt to change the World of Time the best he can . As he is out and about at a local bar having a few suds with some friends, he meets a man who has at least 100 years embedded on his wrist.  Fearing for this strangers life, Wil attempts to tell the man with that much time he will be killed by others if he allows peopleto see his wrist where the amount of  time is showed. Just as  Wil is explaining  this to the wealthy man,\\" Thugs of \\"Time Stealing\\" come and attempt to steal him of his 100 years. Wil now helps him escape and brings him to safety.  The wealthy man not wanting to have to live his life in constant fear and battle over the value of time, gives Wil all his times as Wil is sleeping  and allows himself only 3 minutes to live.  Wil now having over a 100 years shares his time with those not so fortunate.  Wil goes to the Casinos to gamble  his t6ime in hope to even get more time. His goal to share it with others.  It is there he meets Sylvia ( Amanda Seyfried) the daughter of the wealthiest man of time.  A love story now begins. I  give the acting in this movie  3 stars, the concept 5.  I'm recommending this movie, it makes you to think outside of the box.......... a nice  flick to watch... If you have TIME!
0156029065|5.0|Marvelously funny, and, for Eco, very accessible.  Of course, any novel that begins with a phrase in misspelled (and crossed out) Latin is going to whet my appetite for more.  I'm funny that way.  But Eco is even funnier in this book.  Especially since I was reading it during the run-up to the recent mid-term elections, the search for the kingdom of Prester John and the description of fantastic characters distinguished only by different heretical beliefs rang eerily true.  Ursula K. Leguin once defined fiction as a \\"pack of lies.\\"  \\"I write down this pack of lies,\\" she said, \\"and say, 'There.  That's the truth.\\"  Eco echoes her statement at the end of his book:  \\"You surely don't believe you're the only writer of stories in this world. [speaking to the character of the historian]  Sooner or later, someone - a greater liar than Baudolino - will tell it.\\"

Roth paints a vivid picture with his characters, which are likeable, believable, and flawed-I think many American adults would relate at some level to them.

0393064476|5.0|Dear Stephen,<br />  With \\"Will in the World\\" you directed me to the \\"University Wits\\",  William Shakespeare and the slippery Elizabethians'. Now, you have me ruminating about ancients Greek philosophers and my measure of \\"pleasure\\". Your output of great books should be legislated to a bare minimum-say one publication per decade. I, like so many Americans, am far too busy threshing out a living, to have this much literary genius at my disposal.<br />So in summary, Thanx for the great book(s), the deliciously subtle humor, the penetrating arguments, but your literary output is distracting me from the mindless, purgatorial grind I have been sentenced to endure.

However, you can give him a little salt..... and well you know the rest.<br />How do we our human institutions and work environments to work more cohesively and effectively?  Daniel Pink has written extensively about the changes in our world today.  This book tackles some internal issues on how to get individuals to do what they need to do.<br />In Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink, he does a good job of giving an overview of the literature and seminal work conducted on the science of motivation.<br />Seems the carrot and stick idea that seems so obvious really does not work. What we really want to reach what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi described as \\"flow\\".  Flow describes those exhilarating moments when we fell in control, full of purpose, and in the zone.<br />The book includes some steps on how to analyze yourself and organization and set you on a better path. The book also has a good list of resources and books that will add to this movement to motivate yourself and the people around you.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I really like Lana Del Rey. \\"Born To Die\\" is a solid album. Video Games is definitely kick a$$ song - arguably THE song of the year. It's one of those great pop songs that comes around once in a long time. When it came out, everyone I know that has heard \\"Video Games\\" loved it. And then it just disappeared. Title track is another incredible single. Some of my personal favorites are \\"Off To The Races\\", \\"Dark Paradise\\" and \\"Summertime Sadness\\". I played this CD a lot when it first came out. I really liked it. More than anything was Lana's distinctive voice ... Personally, I always have to like voice on the record for it to do something for me. Lana has unique voice. So about 9-10 months later I re-visited this CD and it is still solid. Tone of the album is cool. As the end of 2012 nears, Lana is on all kinds of lists of nominees for awards but NOT Grammy. In some ways, that makes her cooler and more mystique or whatever ... but there is something wrong with that. People on this web-site have responded very positively to her album. It looks like Academy has lowered the standards majorly. In the absence of Grammy nomination, in my book Lana remains the best BY FAR of all artists that came out this year.

Horton is the only one who can hear them and the movie tells of his journey to save the people from their world being destroyed.

B0041KVW2K|1.0|After all that was said about the painstaking measures that were taken to make sure this was THE collection of Beatles music to own on vinyl, I can't help feeling deceived. It's already been said plenty here in the reviews and responses to reviews, so I'm not going to carry on and on about the extremely poor quality control, poor handling, pressing errors, no-fill issues, static, distortion, sibilance and so on. I will just say that I too have received something that has not lived up to its name.<br /><br />I excitedly pre-ordered this set, but I am now on my third set, and I STILL can't make a perfect set out of these three. Most of the errors are identical or similar between boxes and albums, so I have little hope for getting individual album replacements that are any better. I have given up on this, I am done with the hassle. A very disappointing and upsetting chapter in my Beatles history. If I can't get a UK pressing as replacement, once I get my refund, I may consider purchasing the UK pressing, since the reviews are more consistently favorable, but I'm done with this extremely sub bar US pressing. The book is beautiful, and the jackets and extras are well done, but the sum of issues with the records overall makes this set a true disappointment, masking the beautifully remastered music hidden behind the surface noise and errors. That's what this box should have been about; The music. Not how shiny and pretty it was, not how it was available just in time for Christmas! It should have been delayed and done right.<br /><br />One of the most surprising issues with this has been Amazon's response. They are usually very good about issues with orders, and have been great about sending replacements, but when you ask for a human response, it's frustrating. I know the customer service folks answer calls and respond to emails all day, and that this is just another issue they need to resolve and then move on, but with something like this, I feel like there should be a more knowledgable response. This is the last response I got after sending them an email stating my disappointment and interest in a UK edition as replacement or refund:<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />\\"Hello,<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear the replacement for The Beatles Stereo Vinyl Box Set had the same problem as your first order.

0061122416|1.0|\\"The Alchemist\\", by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, is a short novel, written originally in Portuguese and translated into seventy one languages and sold in over one hundred and sixty countries. It was originally published in 1986, and was translated into English in 1993. It has achieved immense popularity, with over sixty five million copies being sold. \\"The Alchemist\\" follows Santiago, a shepherd from Andalucía, Spain, as he travels the world in pursuit of treasure and his destiny. Santiago has a recurring dream where he is told to seek treasure at the pyramids of Egypt. He sets out to do so and encounters many obstacles and people along the way, including a beautiful desert woman and an alchemist. He eventually makes it to Egypt, only to get beaten nearly to death and then learn that the treasure is truly in his hometown, under a sycamore tree near his old church.<br />Despite the many fans singing its praises, I cannot bring myself to recommend The Alchemist. The prose is poorly constructed, the tone is preachy to the point of condescension, and the message itself is, at best, questionable. Allow me to go into more depth:<br />The Prose<br />The writing in this book is terrible. This is not excused by the fact that it is an allegory or a fable. Coelho writes with a spare, bare bones style, and he fails miserably at it. He refers to his characters as \\"the boy\\" and \\"the Englishman\\" in a move that feels like a reproduction of Hemingway's signature style, but the effect is not the same. Rather than coming across as streamlined and distilled, his writing feels more like a bible story that's been simplified for children.<br />The Tone<br />And maybe it is suited for children, because Coelho does not even attempt subtlety. He forces his point down the reader's throat, and then, in case we're still too stupid to grasp it, he washes it down with dose after dose of repetition. Coelho water boards us with pseudo-inspirational nonsense until we cry in anguish \\"We understand! If we follow our dreams the universe will conspire to help us!\\" \\"The Alchemist\\" is written in such a way that, having read it, I feel distinctly condescended to. The wiser-than-thou diction does nothing to alleviate that sensation, with phrases such as \\"Personal Legend\\" and \\"Soul of the World,\\" all capitalized of course, in case we were too dull to catch the significance.<br />The Message<br />The central ideology around which Paulo Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" is designed is that \\"when a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person realize that dream.\\" This concept is the point that readers of this book either love or hate. I hate it. I hate it more, perhaps, than is healthy to hate something read in a book. I think this is a really harmful message to internalize, because it takes away personal responsibility for one's life. What Coelho is saying, then, is that if you fail at something you wanted, well that isn't your fault. No. It simply wasn't your destiny, or \\"Personal Legend.\\" Whatever it was you sought, well, it simply must not have been what you truly desired. This is a message that seems designed to prey on people who are already looking for a justification of that kind of thinking, and what Coelho provides is just that, like some kind of glorified self-help guru.<br />Conversely, it also means that if you do truly desire something, you must follow that dream at all costs. You must pursue that dream without considering realities or consequences, because, after all, the universe will make your dreams come true if you only follow your desires. Santiago pursues his dreams of treasure through the fields of Spain, the deserts of Africa, and the Pyramids of Egypt, doing things that really don't make that much sense. He sells all his sheep because a stranger told him to, goes off on a pilgrimage to Egypt, gives all his money to a stranger who steals it, leaves a lucrative job, and abandons the love of his life, all to find a treasure that was in his back yard from the beginning. But none of those questionable decisions really matter in the end, because they have all been based on his true desire for his dream.<br />In addition to the central idea being down right bizarre, the messages in the book are mixed. Is it we who control our lives, or is it fate or destiny, or is it God who controls it? Coelho vacillates back and forth in his claims.  In the beginning, King Melchizedek and Santiago agree that each person is in control of his destiny. Melchizedek says that the idea that we must, at some point \\"become controlled by fate\\" is \\"...the world's greatest lie.\\" Yet later on, this idea changes to the idea that the universe conspires to help you reach your destiny, as discussed earlier. Later still, Coelho implies that God is the one who controls our fate, for God is the one who leaves the signs that influence our decisions. \\"God placed [the omens and signs] along my path,\\" Santiago says midway through the story, and near the end he thinks of \\"the strange way God had chosen to show him his treasure.\\" In his desire to appeal to a wide audience, Coelho tried to represent too many possibilities, and only succeeded in sending several contradictory and confusing messages.<br />The Verdict<br />As I mentioned previously, I cannot recommend that anyone read this book. I would not subject anyone to the message contained within it, for the fear that they would take it to heart and start acting on it. I also wouldn't want anyone to have to struggle through the sucking mud that is the writing and plot of this story. I tried to think of anything commendable about \\"The Alchemist\\", but a pseudo-inspirational message, a band of millions of enthusiasts, and a knack for apropos symbolism don't constitute literary merit to me.
034580404X|5.0|books were new and looked great.would and have told everyone about this buy.A+++++++++++ i am going to read again soon
B0086700CM|4.0|My children and I pass the phone around (Galaxy S III) and try to go for the longest runs.  Simple enough for even the youngest!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that it is a great game because it has a bunch of games on that one game so you don't have to download so many games. Plus the games on there are really fun to play and in my opinion its like time is going by really fast.
B009G78EE2|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Immediate download, love this CD to death, thank you very much, truely amazing. Macklemore and Ryan are amazing :)
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I love this movie, everyone in the house enjoys it. My 2 year old actually sits and watches most of it with us when we do movie family night. My husband really likes dr. seuss (just learned that one and was kind of suprised considering he is not a cartoon guy), and my 9 year old son and I always enjoy chillin out and watching movies. Got it at a great price but I would have bought it for full price.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Well, this isn't Red Storm Rising or Hunt For Red October and it's not even The Bear and the Dragon (though it is set after it).  It's another spy/espionage/computer hacking snooze.  This story is bingo fuel.<br /><br />If you're looking for techno/combat action keep looking Tom Clancy doesn't seem to be into that sort of thing anymore.  It's almost impossible to find a good fictional war read/listen anymore.<br /><br />Additionally, I wasn't impressed with narrator Lou Diamond Phillips either.  It seemed like he was out of breath at the end of most sentences.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|People magazine mentioned &#34;Bared to you&#34; and &#34;Reflected in you&#34; as good reading if you liked the Fifty Shades series. I loved these two books and am anxiously awaiting the third which is supposed to be published next year.
B002H3T3TM|5.0|Love this DVD.  Of course, it helps that I simply love Michael Buble's voice!  Definitely a must have if you're into Michael Buble!
0307352145|5.0|Susan Cain did an amazing job in writing a balanced book for introverts and extroverts alike.  Truly a book necessary for CEOs to understand their top performing employees and what makes them exceed the company expectations.  Quiet helps me understand myself better and be a better employee, husband, father and person.  Very thoughtfully written.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|bluray set came extremely fast in the mail, im very happy with this product purchase, will be buying more soon!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found this book hard to put down. It really makes you understand that love can help to overcome so much.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another wonderful book. I cannot wait for the third one to come out so I can continue the story. This has Ben an awesome series.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I first played this game with my nephews and niece (aged 7-15, at the time). They love this game--though I must admit they are huge lego fans in that household. I bought this as a gift for my friend's 8 year old son and though he enjoyed it, it also seemed a bit challenging for him. We amended the rules a bit, which helped. It's a great game for stretching kids imaginations. Can be played as individuals or in teams. Most recommend it for kids who are familiar with legos and truly enjoy them.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|its like a Lord of the Rings for people with a shorter attention span. The villian was actually in those movies too.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I've been looking for the complete set of 3&4 for a while very glad ya'll had it, and i liked them.HOMMIII&lv
B000002KCV|5.0|Played this on cassette until it died, bought the CD and still love to hear the music.  Features Nicolette Larsen as well.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app is actually a very integral part of my life. It is responsible for getting me up every morning. I should give this app a low rating, as I hate having to wake up early, but it does its job fantastically. I have been using it for over a year and have not had it fail on me once. It allows me to use my own music on the phone, it allows for the option of gradually increasing the volume, so as not to wake you up with a start, and you can make it ask you math questions to shut it off (very annoying, but effective).<br /><br />Overall, this has been my alarm app for over a year and I am not making any changes any time soon! It's great, and getting to work on time is well worth 2 bucks anytime.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is a very good game. Super addicting game.  You should get it. If you don't like the game you are cray cray.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Love Earth, Wind and Fire.  Received this pretty quickly, and it was new as described and I have really enjoyed listening to it!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|What I most like from this watch is that you will never have to buy batteries, it is automatic and the canvas strap doesn't affect the health of you skin at all.  This is not a luxury watch, it is simple and practical.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to play. Different ways to play the game. Great graphics and sound effects. I have such a hard time putting it down.
B00004VW35|5.0|If you like Neil doing a little country this is the CD for you.  Also features Waylon Jennings on several tracks.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I got this game a while back just looking to kill some time, but I discovered a really entertaining and addictive game. What I really like about it is the achievements are hard, but not impossible. They also vary enough to keep you interested.It's got really great graphics and animations. The add-ons are not ridiculously priced, (You have the option to buy coins with real money, but its easy enough to get anything without spending money) and they actually have an effect on gameplay.<br /><br />Really fun game with a lot of replayability. Can't believe how fun it is for a free game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|fun game but I keep having to download and redownload. how do you fix this? its really annoying. please help!!!!!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Do not get this game, TeamLava has been slow updating the game for the Kindle, and its very frustrating.  I'm still waiting on the Christmas update.
B005CRQ4N8|3.0|I thought the stories in this book were a great addition to the Harry Potter books.  I think most of the people who were disappointed had unrealistic expectations going in.  This is not Harry Potter and should not be judged as such.  This is a book that the characters in Harry Potter read as children.  With that in mind, I think it is a wonderful little peak into their world.<br /><br />I think the cover of the US version is terrible though!  It looks like the first Harry Potter book and even says \\"Harry Potter\\" in big letters on the front.  I think this only increases people's skewed expectations.  As you can see from the Kindle edition, the cover of the British version is beautiful and looks like the cover of a small collection of fairy tales as it should.<br /><br />I did not purchase this book from Amazon.com, but rather from Amazon.co.uk!  I paid nearly as much for shipping as for the book itself, but I would still recommend it to anyone.  When it looks like a book of fairy tales rather than a Harry Potter book, it's easier to pretend you are yourself within Harry Potter's world when you read it.<br /><br />It is very small, I was almost disappointed at first, but I think it is worth it.  If you're willing to part with a few extra bucks I definitely recommend heading over the the UK Amazon and buying the British version!  It will look much nicer on your shelf.
B001QB9H10|5.0|What can I say this is the best way to watch one of Jason Statham's movies. Looks as if you can reach out and touch him.
B000P0J06K|5.0|I really like Michael Keaton as Batman. I think he does an excellent job. Really enjoyed Jack as The Joker.
B00005JKGK|4.0|Great movie. New in package and brought back all the great memories from when I saw it last time. Great buy
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Thanks for the fantastic deal on this Dr. Who Series! Cyber Monday was worth the wait to add this to my collection!
B003L77G06|5.0|Came quick and brand new, still wrapped in plastic so it was as fresh and crisp as can be. Way cheaper than anywhere else
6305428050|5.0|Yet another one of those 80's movies that should be a<br />must have for those that love the 80's movies. A bit quirky,<br />maybe not the best acting,not an oscar movie,but a funny<br />twist and turn action movie none the less. Cute movie and at<br />42yrs old I still love this movie. A good vs evil movie.
B009JZVT70|5.0|Our whole family (ages 12-45, 3 male, one female) loves this show! It's a bit dark at times, and younger kids might find some scenes quite disturbing. The storyline is amazing - using a well-worn framework of fairy tales, the writers have woven an entirely new story with some very unexpected turns in it. We find ourselves guessing who a particular character will turn out to be or whether they're &#34;good&#34; or not, but we're usually wrong. The story is a huge confabulation, but it's &#34;real&#34; enough that we can all buy into it. The acting is sometimes a bit weak, but that's easier than usual to overlook because of the story-setting (being overly dramatic is okay when you're the sweet princess or the evil queen, right?).<br /><br />Can't wait for the season to start up again, after the Christmas break.
B007GFDVEE|3.0|I have no idea if the product was acceptable because the condition of the box was so shoddy.  I had to return it unopened since it was to be a gift.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book is dark, twisted, and depressing all the way up until the shocking ending.  Every character is 'off' in some way ( not the good way either, there is definitely something wrong with the entire town).  Even Richard the ( for lack of a better term ) 'love interest' seems shady and gross.  But the plot is solid and keeps you reading.  As disturbed as I was reading it, I had to find out what happens at the end.  Just like after Gone Girl, I know this story will haunt me for awhile.  Not for the faint of heart, it is DARK.  I would define recommend this book to some who reads the psychological thriller.  It is a page turner.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Perhaps I should say &#34;distinct&#34; voice.  I mean, it's definitely a nice collection of songs, but Zooey Deschanel's sultry take on classic Christmas/Holiday songs is a welcome change from the otherwise pop-y sound you get on the radio.  It's the kind of stuff I want to listen to by a warm fire with a cup of cocoa.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Came quick and brand new, still wrapped in plastic so it was as fresh and crisp as can be. Way cheaper than anywhere else
B001EBWING|1.0|I can't believe people rave about this movie! I tried to watch it with my mother and stepfather. None of us were tired when it began, but we ALL three fell asleep. ZZZZZzzzzzz
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I really like the types of puzzles.  Very attractive.  Definitely keeps me interested.  Certainly glad I lucked into getting it as a daily deal.
0425263916|5.0|after reading the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy I had to search for more reading material  --- found the Crossfire Trilogy & I must admit it was just as good as the shades books  -----  a little bit cruder language (which I did not care for)  but a very good love story, with a LOT of romance & mystery from Gideon's & Eva's past!!!  Highly recommend these books!!!  Very disappointed the 3rd book won't be out until May 2013!!!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Love the story.  I got this on my Kindle so the shape of the book doesn't count.  Tom Clancy is a good writer.
B005HS00V4|5.0|amazing music - pays to have a nice Hi-Fi to truly enjoy the amazing arrangements and the genius behind it
B000FSBWQ8|5.0|If you loved FF7 the game you will absolutely love this movie. It has stunning graphics with a great plot and amazing action sequences
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I used to love this movie as a child! I still remembered all the words to every song, except that &#34;The Love is Gone&#34; song in the middle (we used to fast forward past all that junk). So glad I now have this on DVD for my daughter. I thought I would have to bust out the VHS and VCR.
0439023521|5.0|ive read each book and i must say its a great series for young adults, i liked reading this book.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The movies speak for themselves......great stuff !!!!!!  Watch these films on a cold, dark night with no lights on in the house and you'd be surprised on what you think you see in the shadows.......
1587672707|5.0|I bought this book for myself last christmas and it was worth every penny. I've been a huge it fan since i was just a kid. I first saw the movie when I was about 10 years old and I loved it. I think it's also cool how the movie came out the year I was born. I'm 21 now and am going to start reading this book again soon. It's a classic.
1400023343|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for and more. Not only does it describe the various ways of raising a bilingual child, it provides case studies with a wide variety of families, the basics of how a child learns language and it provides lots of motivation to stick with it. So happy I read this book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent book! A roller coaster of emotions! I have never  read a book like this before. I am starting the  second book now!
B008OJ291W|5.0|If you love the 70's this will remind you of better days gone by when you were younger and more care free.  The remix and sound is amazing.  You just feel good as you listen to it.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|The jist of the story is a rather intrigiung one- that your body is only designed to live 25 years and then a clock is activated on your arm, giving you 1 year to live. The wealthy can practically live forever, while the poor and downtrodden will have their clock's expire.<br /><br />Now I have a few gripes.<br /><br />#1. I'm a bit shocked and taken that Hollywood didn't do more with this film- it had so much potential. And Hollywood seems like they are absolutely preoccupied with youth, wealth and anti-capitalism. It would've done justice to depict what would really go down if time were currency, as surely the \\"ghetto\\" wouldn't be safe. Can young ppl under 25 whose clock hasn't started yet, buy and sell in the marketplace? They should've devoted alot more time to detail!<br /><br />#2. I feel that Justin Timberlake has outgrown his boy band persona and dog paddled in the actor waters, I do feel that Amanda Syfried dragged him down. I mean, I think he was pulling his role off excellently...that is until Amanda popped into the picture, then the story morphed into a Bonnie and Clyde type love story. It's truly a shame, as this film could've been so much more.<br /><br />With that said, I did enjoy it!
0689835604|5.0|My baby loves lifting up the flaps and seeing the peek a boo surprise behind the flap. We both enjoy reading this book. She sits and listens quietly as I read it to her. and also gets exciting about lifting the flaps. Good quality board book. Will buy more from the series
1569765677|5.0|I loved this book, Rubin Carter described his life in a way that makes you feel angry, happy, and confused(in a good way).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This keeps me entertained while I am watching Tv. It is a good choice for someone that likes puzzle games.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I wish they still made movies with as much &#34;meat&#34; as this one.  It's not completely digitized - good stuff.
B0089BSM70|5.0|Much more superior Bluray of H2. Amazing features and picture quality. Even has the tv version as an extra feature. If you don't own it yet, buy it!
B005I0DV4Y|5.0|Great film to illustrate the Maori cultural challenges in NZ. Excellent for academic or entertainment purposes. I highly recommend this film
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have this app on my kindle fire HD and hate (just like the rest of reviewers) that it only shows 10 or so news feed updates, I hope this gets fixed in the future!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very fun game! loved the different games. easy to follow. finished it in one day wish it was longer! on to the next g5 game!
B0001I561E|5.0|Classic Disney - and add Robin Williams, it's a dynamite, family friendly, fun movie night.  Even after the kids are grown and out of the house, it's a keeper.
B005M2A4D4|4.0|The show is great but why oh why did they revert back to the 90's with such bad packaging (it started with seasn 5).  They are DVD hard pages taped together as a flip book.  Really?  Four stars instead of 5 because of packaging.  Hopefully season 7 will be better on that field.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I thought this book was excellent.  Wasn't familiar with the author, but the sarcasm and humor in this eventful book was great.  It made you think that the events in this book could very well be real.  Frightening, interesting, and a great book!
B005HSL626|5.0|my niece downloaded this app and I am addicted....mindless fun.  Its also nice that it has three different versions of the game.
1409136612|5.0|What to say about Maeve Binchey?? I wish she would write a dozen books a year. I have read all of her books & every one of them was a lovely experience. I don't read \\"romance\\" books or many \\"girly\\" books, but I could read one a week by her & still wish for more. I have passed them along to many friends that I exchange books with & they were very skeptical because of the type of books. They all loved them too.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Who thinks of this stuff?  An underwater world with talking fish, mermaids and an evil Octopus - amazing.  Flounder and Sabastian are adorable.  Disney does a great job of getting memorable voices with the characters.  Very enjoyable movie.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|The show is great but why oh why did they revert back to the 90's with such bad packaging.  They are DVD hard pages taped together as a flip book.  Really?  Four stars instead of 5 because of packaging.
B00005ASOI|5.0|This will be brief.  If you love 70's horror you will love this if you don't you probably won't enjoy very much.
B001GS4RS6|4.0|Purchased the collector's first edition from amazon via bookstore in Georgia.  The novel is a great espionage story with interesting twists and turns.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I like this kind of visual puzzle game and every time I start playing my fiance has to get here for me to realize how long I've been playing. I think that means I'm very entertained with it. Haha now back to playing more.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Best movie of the year. Couldnt wait for it to come out on DVD. Now I will watch it with the surround sound all the way up!
B005529EI2|1.0|I am currently an Amazon Prime customer!  I am also subscribed to two other video services (Netflix and Hulu), and I find that on their best day Amazon falls far short in ALL categories.  Since movies consist  of images and sound, Amazon fails on both counts.  I have actually tested the Amazon sound with an identical movie on Netflix, and can understand every word on the Netflix version with the volume set at less than half of what I tried to hear the dialogue with  on the Amazon version.  THIS movie will takes forever to load, even when NOT HD.  I have never had a single problem loading High Definition movies with any other online service, but again Amazon seems to have a problem getting video to my home screen more often than not.  Amazon is the absolute WORST online video service I have experienced so far, and you can be sure they won't &#34;burn&#34; me in any more purchases from them!!
B009K45Y62|5.0|My husband loves the Dark Knight Rises with the Bat Cowl. The movie offers a ton of bonus footage which he watched multiple times already. Only downside- doesn't offer a real digital copy of the movie- just the Ultraviolet one which in my opinion, is kind of pointless...
B003ES5ZTG|5.0|If you do anything with HDMI? You want this cable... I kid you not. I bought 2 and I will buy more.  It fits just about every application and its uses are just about endless.
0307460444|3.0|Ist copy sent was a used copy. I wanted for a gift and sent it back  Received yet another used copy although in good condition. I wanted one new with no earmarks on pages and wrapped in cellophane. Its OK
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises is the best movie of 2012.  The film's image, sound, lighting, and composition are top notch.  The storyline is captivating.  See it.  Great movie.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|the album is great. the remastered recording is fantastic.<br />it comes better than the original release.<br />fully recomended for beatles fans.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Barbra is part of my life's soundtrack.<br />I hope she records a Beatle's Songbook CD.<br />She is such a great vocalist.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is a great pastime fun to play with your friends who also have this game have fun playing!
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I couldn't wait to continue reading the next one!  I got really involved with the story and wanted to know more about the characters.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Was so happy to find this on site!! I am member of Disney club and they didn't have it! This is such a classic and one I wanted my grandchildren to see. Price was so low, couldn't believe it, really couldn't believe I found it. Great selections!!!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It's Ad-Free. It's Angry Birds. Is there anything else to say? It's a good deal that saves my battery life since there's no ads.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Interesting read.  Good bit of humor mixed in with some decent fantasy. I haven't read anything with a druid as the main character before. Also very much enjoyed the inclusion of his Irish wolf hound, Oberon, and the mythic Celtic pantheon as well as werewolves, a vampire and ghouls.  All in all, a fun and fascinating book. Oh, and the narration is excellent! Some of the best I've heard.
B000B8QF00|5.0|Wonderful set of tracks.  All albums should be this good. !! This is part of the album collection. 6 CD package.Fabulous !
B009E3EY38|5.0|Great Quality sound, Blu ray is spectacular! This is the greatest concert of the new millennium, by the greatest Rock band that ever was!<br />I would Recommend this to anyone!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|The graphics are great. The story line is great. The characters are great. The puzzles are challenging and fun. I would suggest it to any one.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Bought this as a requested gift for my sisters grandchildren. They have not let me borrow it back yet. Oh well!
B004WR125O|1.0|My router, Medialink-N Broadband Router is practically in the same room as my TX-NR414 receiver. I should send it back, hopwe it's not too late. I tried everythng I could think of to get it to connect but nothing worked and tried what other's have suggested in their reviews.
B000002NAK|5.0|Exactly what I ordered and in excellent condition. Didn't want to pay full price and was pleasantly surprised. Not crazy about Madonna, however you have to admit she has incredible talent in the movie and music
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|fun and challenging to try to beat the clock.  One of the better games. Colorful graphics make the game fun to play. Even young kids can enjoy playing.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|Whats not to like about a free app that does what it is designed to do? Try it you will like it
B009YJEKJK|1.0|After review of this album This Christmas I find it leaves a lot to be desired. I always enjoy Olivia Newton John and John Travolta but this time I will have to pass because these days they should not sing together as they don't mess well anymore, it's just not that great of an album.
B000Q67876|5.0|This film is a classic, and I wont review it here, Ill just say, the digibook packaging is beautiful, and if you do not have this film on blu ray, Id suggest you get this edition.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|My family liked the movie, but the whole story was a little strange and pointless.  The acting wasn't all that great
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the best solitare E-games I have played.  Hard to win but neat vidio effects when you are successful!
B0063GORYU|5.0|a good spider solitaire app.  Has very little ads,  just one before each game. I like it so much I have it on my phone and Kindle Fire.
1594135851|1.0|This book has 2 chapters from Book 3 Mockingjay in the middle of the novel!!! The correct chapters for Catching Fire are not in the book at all!!
B009ZE27US|4.0|evrry one says its wronge but it even says its s gage  ... and if u dont know what that is it means like a joke! so far its amusing but not a great app i say 3 and a half
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Another good app for our Kindle Fire. The &#34;Daily Deal&#34; is nice to have. Easy to use like most Android apps.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The coin dozed game is lots of fun, trying to win the prizes, trying to get more coins, and getting to the next level. It's a very addicting game.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I listened to this whole CD on Spotify before purchasing. It's the best collection of his songs that I love. I watched some of the DVD on YouTube as well before purchasing. I can't wait to watch the rest of the DVD.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|all my life I have enjoyed angry birds very very much.I also loved star wars. angry birds and star wars is the perfect combination of game and movies

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use evermore on my laptop all the time and I like being able to access it on the kindle. the downside is that the screen is small and bakes it hard to compose messages (at least for the kindle fire) . I hope that the evermore team brings handwriting technology to evernote in the future: I'd gladly pay for that. until then, my title is my summary.
B000I9YXKG|5.0|I love Audrey,this movie is my favorite! I so recomend it because it's really good,great quality and also I had a great time watching this movie
B003YUQ4OE|3.0|I'm giving these three stars because my normal size was too small.  I could barely get my foot into them.  I still like the look of them, but I'm not sure if I will be ordering the next size up or not.  Have to thing about the expensive of s&h.
1451695195|1.0|As someone who has been in touch with the otherside my entire life, his experience sounded more like a comatosed dream state than a real connection. The Neurosurgeon gives way too much info about his life and his illness, making his story quite boring to the reader. I still have lots of unanswered questions such as how his brain could be deteriorating because he contracted E-Coli which should have left him in a vegetable state. Yet, he's not. I'm sure his experience was real from his mindly remembering. But I question if it was truly real.
B009ZE27US|4.0|ok. everyone thinks this game is bad because its inaccurate. its a game! its not supposed to be. its not as bad as everyone says
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really fun I would give a grade 100 if I could. I just love this game. THE BEST GAME EVER
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was a lot of fun. The puzzles were interesting and the hidden object scenes were good without being too difficult.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I really love this app. It is the best PDF reading app around for Android. I have tried other ones and while they work I prefer this one.
0307279189|5.0|WARNING!! If you read this book end to end you cant stop running.<br />I was decent runner in mid 30s had a pretty bad high ankle sprain 2 years ago, took long time to recover. Reading this book I do strongly believe we are born to run, and if<br />running is so common, running injuries should be common too, so should be bodys tools to repair it. So far in the past month averaging 20 miles per week. Planning for a marathon in 2013.
0307891372|5.0|Huge guide to an exceptional game. If you want to get the most out of this massive game its a must . Ordered a year ago and sill referring to it today. Purchased in the U.S. from Isle of Man in the UK for a 3rd of the price I could get it over here including shipping. It arrived in 4 days during the Christmas rush.<br /><br />Impressed NO, I was gobsmacked.
B00632HWOG|2.0|This is one of the worst apps I've used on my kindle fire. Doesn't even provide the basic function of syncing contacts. That's a must for kf users!
B0050R0XPA|5.0|Purchasing a Lego set for a grandson who loves ALL Legos is never a wrong choice. Every set that has ever been purchased for him has been a success. He asked for this set for Christmas and this is one gift he will get.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The perfect show, beautiful capture of a magical evening. They are in perfect shape! Let's hope that someday they will tour again.
B0098HGNGG|5.0|After owning this for a few weeks, this meter exceeds my expectations. Great carrying case, easy to read display, takes AAA batteries! I love that it isn't a rare battery in this thing.<br /><br />The menu system is a little clunky, needs an update. Pretty old school folder system, not super user friendly.
086571701X|1.0|This book is worthless. The entirety of the data and graphics in this book are copied and pasted directly from any website that would let it happen. The impact of this is a book with no real educational value or coherent flow of useful information or lines of thought. People who have valuable information, generally want royalties when someone takes it and sells it on. The result is a book with no information of value.<br /><br /> If you want a sneak preview of the author's laughable inexperience with the subject matter, she has a page on You Tube. Makes for a good comedy show if you have not already laid down the cash for [questionably] her book. Watch her take 6 minutes to attempt to fillet a tilapia fish with a chef's knife and then try to pull its skin off with pliers as if it were a catfish. (Spoiler: I think the cooking in her house is done by the 'help')<br /><br /> I honestly don't think this person does any gardening, fish raising, building, or cooking. It is already clear that she doesn't do any book writing of her own, and has no beginning of knowledge for the topics of this book.<br /><br /> One more thing I must stress about this book because I feel it's very important. There are no plans, full explanations, details, or instructions on how to plumb the system, how the system physically works, or anything that you can follow to understand and build your first system. This is the core failure of the book. This book is made entirely of the fluff that fills out a marginal book, and the part of the book that you absolutely need for it to be of any practical use is not there.<br /><br /> The review by Delmarva is much more thorough than I can be, but the gist of it is don't waste your money on this book. Go watch videos and read web pages on the internet because that will get you off to a start. This book will only take your money before you do just that. Also, don't waste money on this person's training course. She seriously does not garden, raise fish, or write books... The only thing she's qualified to teach is that books are a pretty costly source of used paper.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Like his writing. Enjoy some books (mystery, drama, thriller) by foreign authors. Find it takes longer to read as their style is different from American writers. I can't read the books as fast but that is okay with me. I liked the series that Jo Nesbo did. A friend got me started on them as this author is a favorite of her father's.
B004CS7R70|5.0|They shipped much faster than we expected and were received earlier than estimated.  A wonderful product for the visually challenged.  Really magnify TV screen.
B0043D2LAC|5.0|Handy little utility bag well made, of good components. Attaches securely and easy to use, weatherproof reliable and n to mention
B008M721MS|5.0|I was just given Kindle fire  HD as an early Christmas gift and I can already see that this will be among my favorite apps!!!!!I love it!!!!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Very functional, colorful storage.  Holds Barbie jeep and more dolls that I expected it to.  Makes for easy clean-up.  GREAT BUY!
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora Locke is a bloody, entertaining book. Lamora, a thief with a soft heart, is one of the most engaging and clever protagonists whose adventures I've had the pleasure of reading.  He almost immediately zoomed to the top of my elite and discriminating list of favorite characters.  The dialogue was wicked and consistently laugh out loud *funny*, the plot twists caught me, an experienced and jaded reader, off guard, and the characters were fully fleshed and 3 dimensional.  The story left me gasping, cheering, and chewing my nails in anticipation.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's relatively minor especially in contrast to the immense delight I feel about this book, is that the foreshadowing structure was a little too clunky.  Whenever the Gentlemen Bastards reached a crisis, the flashbacks, particularly in the first half of the book, to the lessons from Father Chains and the thieves personal histories, provided convenient resolution to the situations they faced.  And the flashbacks heavily telegraphed what was going to happen.  Don't let that quibble deter you from picking up the book though.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was very interesting and kept me guessing. The different sections and many puzzles never let Me get bored. The map was a big help.
1400052181|5.0|Great book. Great writing. A very thought provoking and important story. Should be required reading for all high school students.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the twists in this novel.  The characters are well developed and the dialog is so real, both self and with others.  The ending was just perfect.  I won't say more for those who haven't read it.  Very interesting and pertinent story.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Excellent video and story! And so many lessons in the weaving of Jane Austen't Mansfield Park. Love it !! I highly recommend this version of the story !
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Good variety and beautiful music overall.  Love all of the bands on this CD.  Even if you're not a Twilight fan, you'll love it.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The old blokes still have it! (At least they did in 2007).  The highlight of the show is No Quarter, one of the greatest songs ever written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but it needs an update with redstone and armour. other than that its amazing. its worth the money.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My kid got the original Perpluxus as a gift and loved it.  Now we have two and she wants the others.  I think this is a great &#34;toy&#34; as it make you think as well as use quite a bit of manual dexterity.  Adults will find this really fun and challenging too!  Needs no batteries and can go just about anywhere!  Highly recommended!
B0083EM24C|5.0|Never get tired of these guys.  This CD is just as good if not better than their last.  They have a great, unique sound.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is definately your best. I love how interactive and friendly it is. I love that friends can give you gold. make another game like this! make one about.....dinosaurs. IDK!!! make another interactive game with animals or other creatures. maybe make one with legendary creatures like a Pegasus or... other things.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Anyone interested in young adult novels.  This series is a MUST!  The entire Maze Runner series has so many twists and turns.  It keeps you guessing all the way through to the end.  I would rate this even higher than The Hungre Games series.!!! If there were a 10 star rating, I would give it that!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|my son was given it for his 11th birthday.He loves it so much it didn't last till christmas he built the figurines in a  few days
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I love every song on this CD.  We all know that Phillip sounds like David Mathews so fans of his music would love this as well.  However, he stands on his own here.  Great CD.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I love this movie
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Everything was fine. If you want me to review, don't require so much.  I don't have time for this everytime.
0547848412|2.0|If you enjoyed the movie Cast Away featuring Tom Hanks without feeling anxious (or that the story could have unfolded in half the time), Life of Pi is not bad. If you have a vested interest in eloquent literature, I would let this one float on. Not a bad book, not a bad story, very simple read. I found the exposition of the story to be the most entertaining aspect of the book. For a story of courage and endurance, Life of Pi was bland, in my humble opinion.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I'll try not to spoil anything here, but I loved this movie, I loved the series, but I absolutely HATE the fact that there isn't going to be another movie. When you see it you'll understand.
B005VOXQFQ|5.0|I like this guy but he is smaller than I expected a &#34;giant&#34; panda to be. It's still very cute and good quality, but I should've read the dimensions better. I still love it.Schleich has the BEST replications and life-like quality of ALL &#34;toy&#34; animals.

B0030T0VE8|5.0|This little raccoon is just as life-like as all other Schleich products. I got this one, another walking raccoon, and the little pups playing, and they make an adorable set.
B00A3YTC6Q|5.0|great movie. I think that the flash mobs were awesome, possibly my second favorite of all of the step up movies.
B0016OMFO8|5.0|My friend was having her 66th birthday and this was a present for her, we listened to it on her birthday and had fun
B009A9BF5G|4.0|Yet I do have some reasons why I could not give 5 stars. One, this whole film in blu-ray is very grainy. I know better can be done so I can only think they wanted a retro look? Second it is not a concert. It is the tour at different venues even (which is nice) yet there a real lot of bantor between songs that is nice but you only need hear once. Then the 2 set this seems unnecessary. If buy you know what I mean there. But the performances are 5 stars!  And a bit of a different line up of songs than the last few years. Nice. The shows are the tightest ever and are Awesome
B0036MDN80|5.0|As with all the Schleich products, this tigress and cub look VERY realistic and I absolutely love it! The quality of the paintwork is very impressive.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|A little odd at first, but if you just want a good laugh with a little bit of a cheesy love story then this movie is the right one for you. defiantly worth renting.
B009ZE27US|3.0|Come on now its just a gag to prank people with so just try it. They try to guess it by your fingerprints.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Best investment ever to any fans DVD collection.  1 Word says it all about this series and owning it on Blu-ray.... SHINY!!!!!
B000MRX2DI|5.0|I've said this a million times in the last month since I discovered Schleich, but they make THE best life-like animals ever. The only thing I would've done differently with this one is to put a bunch of them standing in a row like they usually are. My son LOVES meerkats when you see a bunch all standing up in a row. Oh well, I bought the little pups, too, and he is getting them in his Christmas stocking so I'm sure he'll love them just the same!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|kids are crazy for this silly game and have left angry birds!  Even their dad has fun playing this game
B005M2V2K8|5.0|My mom in law takes care of a stray cat out side that is all white, she wants to take her in but can't because my mom in law already has a jealous in door cat and.... it wouldn't be so pretty if they met face to face without the screen door being between them :x<br />Since she loves collecting stuffed animals, I decided to get her another one to add to her collection.<br />Came across this, reminded me of her outdoor kitty and had to order it for her.<br />Hope she likes it, I sure do. :)<br />No rips, tears, beads/stuffing falling out.<br />Great condition mine was when I received it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|It was very interesting.  There were parts when I didn't want to stop reading.  I loved it very much so.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great comedy movie! A must see each year at Christmas time! Would buy again, good price when on sale here.
0307292134|5.0|I had no problems with the bindings or with pages. Everything is top notch and I do use them frequently. I enjoyed the built in bookmarks and the backing colors are beautiful. They are nice quality and they contain a wonderful world I enjoy visiting over and over. They are a hard fit into the case though.
B00AFEY354|3.0|I pretty much know before even writing this review, that it will likely have a critical reception. But that's okay, everyone is different. Personally, however, I wonder whether the movie may have ruined the beautiful scenery this book had planted in my mind. I am really hoping not. Furthermore, I really doubt I am the only one who feels this way. I haven't read the book again since watching (a little over half of) the movie. I don't mean to seem like a prude, but I could not finish it. I know it's the affect of \\"Hollywood ruining books and stories,\\" so to speak. There seemed to be many additional details and subtle inaccuracies in many of the scenes. It was very apparent, in my opinion, that this book is either not meant to be a movie, Chbosky just didn't quite pull it off with the producers/his directing, or maybe his vision or intent being depicted didn't match up with my interpretation of how the imagery was described in the book. The actor playing Patrick wasn't anything like I had imagined the character in the book (Many scenes involving him were kind of uncomfortable, kind of like \\"Nooo, Patrick isn't like that!\\") Emma Watson is gorgeous and I do love her, but she is no Sam. Although I do enjoy seeing her face and talented acting, regardless. Dylan McDermott as Charlie's dad? No...just, no. Paul Rudd as Bill? I couldn't take him from \\"Role Models\\" and \\"Our Idiot Brother\\" to an intellectual character in one of my most favorite childhood books, if not favorite books of all time. I have to say, though, that in my eyes the most inaccurate character of all may have been Charlie. A 20 year old Logan Lerman playing 15 year old Charlie can hardly pull it off. I can say that his shyness was on point, at times. But over all, a grown man playing a teenager just wasn't working.<br /><br />With all this said, I completely understand that the author cannot read my mind with regard to how the characters look or act, and neither can I read his. I can only read his work and interpret it as my imagination allows. And in all honesty, had I not ever read the book, or had I even watched the movie first and read the book later, I still would have likely loved them both. I suppose you could say I'm a bit hardheaded or overprotective over the experience I had gotten from the story thus far. In general, it seems to be the type of movie I would love, with including the actors I enjoy watching.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you have not read the book [[ASIN:1451696191 The Perks of Being a Wallflower]] then I can say you would likely enjoy this film very much, assuming it's of interest to your age bracket or preferred genre of stories. It really is a captivating, emotional story like no other. In fact, I waited for roughly a year and a half in anticipation ever since it was announced (especially excited considering the author was directing the film, himself!) If, however, you have read and cherished this book as many people have then I would say to watch it with a grain of salt and an open mind. Be thoughtful of the reality that you may never read the book the same again. Or if, as in my case, you are not able to do so then consider skipping watching it altogether.terpret it as my imagination allows.

B000JIHP88|5.0|This toy is great for little ones, my daughter had been wanting it for a while now, so we got it for our little  five month old grand daughter for Christmas. It was a good price too.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have the free version but it is still great.  Will buy the upgraded version because if the free version is any indication of the quality of the product.... it will be worth every penny.
0307891372|4.0|This guide has lots of things but a good index isn't one of them. Good luck finding things when you are on the move from place to place. I only was able to use it effectively by sitting down with pen and paper. It is full of useful information but sorting it all out really could have used some upgrades.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Very good. Interesting background and colorful setting. Stong story with cool plot twists, diverse characters, and a well thought out presentation. Great acting and a funny crew of characters. Perfect mixture of levaty and drama.<br />Over all: this series has a ground breaking concept of combining the syfi and cowboy western drama style into one fast paced action drama. Really innovative.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Language was unexpected and unpleasant.  Prefer the action and suspense shows I watch to have a less profanity  in them.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Cute story, nice acting. Enjoyed it very much and will probably watch again in the near future. This type of movie is always great to relax by.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Reading a Pendergast novel I  like a visit from your favorite cousin, you can't wait for it to arrive and hope it never ends.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|The movie &#34;Drive&#34; is one of my five all time favorite movies for all time. Really, really enjoyed it. Alot.<br />The movie &#34;Dirve&#34; gets a lot of its power from its amazing soundtrack. The sounds and music in the movie are moving, really beyond what most other movies can hope to accomplish.<br />This soundtrack is golden. Every song is beautiful and fits well with all the others. Evocative is the one word I would use to discribe it. Feels like the eighties but without the flash, pretense, and masogeny that made us all glad to leave the eighties behind. That being said, and in the interest of full discloser, I was only alive for two years in the 1980s. It was more than enough for me though.
1439102724|5.0|This was an unusual book.  Didn't know what to expect at first.  But, I enjoyed it very much. In fact, I have read it twice.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use. Being new to apps, I found this one self-intuitive. Now I can see what's going on where my children live and travel for business.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Worth spending the money! Even better than I expected to be, very good investment. I would recommend it to anybody.
B006ISJQ26|4.0|Very violent. Great acting. Well concieved story line. Very violent. Liked the cinematogrophy. The filming had a very real feeling for me, watching it anyway. Having never been a gangster I feel that this movie captures what I imagine life might be like for a gangster who hits the edge. Very violent. Shocking plot twists keep you on your toes the whole way through, and yet there are many gentle scenes that depict a tender relationship between the main character and his protective charge. Very violent. Liked it alot.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I found this movie to be very entertaining.The storyline was really good,and it had some intresting twists.I've heard other people say that this movie was a bit boring,but I disagree.I thought there were alot of great action scenes.Bane was absolutley menacing.I thought his voice was really cool.It had such an eerie way about it,that went along with the character.The fight scenes with Batman and Bane were absolutley amazing.Unfortunatly,there wasn't enough and should have been more.Hathaway as Selina Kyle/\\"The Cat\\" was both sexy and sassy.Bale was great as always.Ending was good,but Batman fighting during daytime seemed a bit out there,but I managed to overlook that,and still enjoy it.There was no mention of Joker anywhere in this movie at all,and I think there should have been,as a way of honoring Heath Ledger's great performance in the last film.Overall,this movie is good,but I personally thought that \\"The Dark Knight\\" was better.Although,I do think this was a good way to end a great trilogy.
B0095J0AL6|4.0|It came when I wanted it and it was in it's original packaging. Will shop again with you in the future!
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yeah, this is pretty bad and sad. Don't know where it took a wrong turn but it needs to get back on the road. The upgrade is bad, I'd prefer that it go back to the way it was before it was upgraded. Sometimes people, not all things need a change
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Liked this movie a lot. Decent acting. Realistic concepts for the senario of a tier one naval/littoral engagement. Top notch syfi action. Reanna is awsome! She is really talented.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a nice game. The graphics are good and there is a good variety of layouts. None of the games I have tried so far have been too difficult.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|Me gusto mucho este CD! Gracias Cher lloyd...<br />Tambien fue entregado a tiempo . . . . . . .
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Fits perfectly, like the color. Seems to be well-made, though I have only had it for two weeks. Thank You
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Lot of twists and turns, but raises some hard issues about our &#34;criminal justice&#34; system.  The ending is very surprising, but rings true.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|ive been waiting for this to come out on the kindle for quite a while now and I am so exited that it came out cant wait to play
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Awesome watch! Pride itself with great watch tradition. I grew up with Seiko 5 around in my family. Like the style, fusion of classic and rugged look.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one. So many things happening all the time you can't help but keep reading.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Have read a couple of times, alsways fun and interesting. The triology can be read as one very long book.
B000001GQY|5.0|what more can I say, this was a gift but I am familiar with the recording ... ... ... !
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The movie is slow to get into with a lot of info being thrown at the audience who have not seen previous movies, and the ending is abrupt (leaving it open for the next chapter), but overall, I find this my favorite out of the four.  I like the relationship with Aaron and Marta much better than Jason and Marie.  And after three movies of a man not knowing who he is, it was nice to see one who volunteered, and to know why he did so and why the program is so important to him.  Renner, Weisz, Norton and the rest of the cast are excellent in their parts.  I am looking forward to a future movie now that the universe has expanded and it's not all about Treadstone.  The movie deserves a shot, and it better on the second viewing, as many are, since you know more about what's going on.  I recommend giving it a try.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Definitely a must see for a girls movie night!  A little predictible but who cares when the boys are such eye candy!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Can be read and reread.  I have it loaded on my Kindle to have available in case of emergency.  What a great story.
1936608898|4.0|Great easy to understand and to follow blueprint to change the way we look at what goes into our bodies and the impact that food has.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a very passionate love story.The best that I  have  read in a long time.The sex is great but the under lying story is the love that developed between Christian and Ana
B009NPKTN6|2.0|The only good thing about this movie was the music which definately took me back to some fun times!  Tom Cruise so over-acted in this movie that it was almost comical.  The direction of the Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand characters was confusing and just not necessary.  This movie could have been so much better.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Scandanavians seem to producing some great proceedurals and mystery stories.  They are page turners and this is a fine story.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is great and on my Kindle very portable. Lots of fun! Plenty of challenges at all levels. Give it a try if you haven't yet. You won't regret it!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game! It can take a bit to grasp all the rules and strategies but that is half the fun. You are always learning new was to play. It is a great game!
B0099114WO|5.0|Anyone looking for an uplifting and hopeful outlook on creating or re-creating a relationship with spouse.<br />Brilliant performances from them all.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Read a couple of times, always fun even if I do know how it will end.  Understand there is a 4th book, hidden away because of dispute between heirs and life partner.  Do your heirs a favor, get a will properly documented.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|What a great package - DVD and two CDs - I saw this in the theater and it's really nice to have at home
B008ZDC7M8|2.0|I'm giving this film 2 stars, as the first 2 DVDs are interesting and informative.  Unfortunately, the remaining DVDs are not.  While the inclusion of global films is excellent, I was looking for a series that covered \\"the history of world cinema\\" and instead ended up with Mark Cousins rather limited personal opinions.  The first 2 DVDs give a history of film and how techniques and concepts were originated by one film maker, and then used and varied by those who followed.  The remaining DVDs, while on occasion make mention of film techniques and ideas, generally are used to reflect Cousins personal views and politics, as if those are the factors which determine the historical or artistic value of a film.<br /><br />I had purchased 2 of these sets - one to watch and the other as a gift, but after watching the entire series, I opted to find something else to give as a gift and tossed the extra DVD set, as I did not want to waste my friend's time.
B004RUF9DC|3.0|The Re-Make made it Soo Bad(Picture quality wise!). I thought Blu-Ay would enhance it,but instead instead it too so much away. Made it look like it was filmed on a &#34;Super 8&#34; camera from the 70's & 80's. I was watching it on a 50&#34; LED 1080p 120ghz TV btw.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this movie at first, but it was so great I ended up watching it twice! I love how it incorporated both old and modern. The music was great, the acting was great. I have not one bad thing to say about this movie.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I don' t know how I would get along without this.  Very handy, always works and can be used for a variety of things.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|this is a pretty awesome game. great graphics and very user friendly controls. action packed fighqting and pretty tough bosses as well.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises holds truer to the original concept of Batman than the  earlier movies.  This was action packed and watching it on a large screen High Def TV really brought the characters to life.  As usual there was room made for yet another movie in the series.  If they hold true to the original concept, this could well be a good thing.  Time will tell but it looks like Batman may well have truly risen to his rightful place.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Hey  Everyone;  This  Cd  of  all  &#34;Covers&#34;--was  not  worth  the  21 year wait.<br />Don't  get me wrong--Jeff is  in  Great voice  for this  cd,and  the  Production  is  fine.<br />But the  Drums  sound the same as they  did  for  &#34;Armchair  Theatre&#34;--in  1991<br />Hopefully  the  new--Cd of  &#34;ORIGINAL&#34;--Material  will be  worth more ot  the  wait.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|Never Say Never Again is neither the best nor the worst of the James Bond movies. It is definitely a film which follows a commercial formula, but so do all of the \\"official\\" Bond films. I enjoyed it.
0307346617|4.0|This was a good book and a fast read.  I really liked the individual stories though I must admit I liked the stories that took place in the U.S. the most (since I'm American).  The descriptions are so vivid that you imagine exactly what the speaker is describing.  This is still a scary zombie book but a bit different since it describes a lot of military responses across the world when the zombie outbreak happens.
B008IZYWXU|5.0|Kudos to all who were involved in the making of the masterpiece which is Barcelona.  Freddie would have certainly approve!
B008RTE08E|5.0|I  forgot  for  a moment--just  how  bad this movie is,  But  it  is  nice to have on  Dvd,<br />and of course the Music is  Great.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. kind of addictive. add me as a neighbor 82much2day. you will enjoy this.?
0307951529|5.0|I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this book, but I won't. What I appreciated most about the $100 Startup is that Chris gave specific and actionable advice! There is nothing more frustrating than an author that speaks in theoretical but never gives a practical application. I am a big fan of Chris' work.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed it so much I bought a second copy to give to a friend. Chris easily delivered 10X the value over the price of this book.
B009DH372Y|5.0|Excellent concert which captured the full excellence of QUEEN.  Freddie, John, Roger, and Brian in full form.  There will never be another QUEEN!
B00917IQFY|5.0|Hey  Everyone;  If  your  lucky  enough like  me  to be able to catch  Graham  & the  Rumour  to  promote this cd and<br />songs for the  film &#34;This is  40&#34;--your  in for a  real  treat. Hopefully-they  will do some more shows  in the  begining of<br />2013.  Great  Cd  as well.  Writing/Playing--etc
B008JFQKMU|4.0|Great album but not as good as uno! And better than tre! I loved it its better if you have the set of 3
B00608HMFW|5.0|My wife will be getting these at Christmas. She has been a huge fan since the first time she saw the show. I also ordered Season 7 so she will have every released season.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|Having recently finished watching all 15 hours, I can honestly say that this is a fascinating documentary. Don't listen to the other reviewer who complained about Mark Cousins' narration. His Irish accent is extremely pleasant to listen to. Buy it and you won't be disappointed :)
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This is a great carrying case for little legos.  I bought this for my 4 year old grandson and he loves it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|A very complex, timely and powerful story. All the characters were thoroughly detailed to the point that I felt that I knew them all personally.
B002BWP49C|5.0|got it in no time and  i  love this movie..plays very good cant wait for part 2 to come out
B000001GQP|1.0|The audio is terrible.  At first it's so soft you can't hear it, and when you turn up the volume, the next section is too loud and you have to turn down the volume.  You shouldn't sell this item.
B004FCEFUK|4.0|Seventh Wonder is a progressive power metal band hailing from Sweden. They’ve mostly flown under the radar until recently, when their lead singer Tommy Karevik joined the more popular American power metal outfit Kamelot. When Kamelot’s latest album Silverthorn was released in October of this year it received great critical acclaim, a lot of the praise focusing on the new singer. Some said that as good as Tommy Karevik performs with Kamelot on Silverthorn, Seventh Wonder is still a better band by comparison. That’s where my interest got piqued and what led me to look into Seventh Wonder’s latest album called The Great Escape.<br /><br />The first song on the album, Wizeman, blew me away. The guitarists provide a twisting and constant barrage of chugging riffage while Karevik somehow manages to sing catchy melodies over them, all the while showing off his impressive vocal range. Karevik immediately stands out from the rest of the band and though some of the instrumental breakdowns are impressive, the music just doesn’t carry much weight without him.<br /><br />For the most part, Karevik wisely avoids the lyrical cheese that is so prominent in this genre. But there are a few exceptions. Exceptions so devastating as to nearly destroy the entire package (but not quite).<br /><br />The second song, Alley Cat, comes in naturally and seems to keep the catchy progressiveness going. There’s nothing better than getting a new CD and finding that each song that plays is as good as or better than the last. And at first glance that is the case with this track…until you hear the lyrics. I’m a fan of power metal, I can handle some cheese, it just comes with the territory, but this goes beyond acceptable.<br /><br />This album suffers in a weird way. There are six stand alone tracks and one thirty minute epic track at the end. It feels like Karevik excised all the cheese from four of the tracks and then crammed it all into the other three. Having to skip songs on a CDas you listen is an album killer for me. My solution was to delete the three offenders (Alley Kat, Long Way Home, and Move on Through) and take in the album once more in its new abridged format.<br /><br />What a difference! The album went from fatally flawed to sheer brilliance. And it still clocks in at fifty-two minutes with three songs cut out. Unfortunately, not everyone picking this album up is going to be as brutally proactive as I in carving it up into the masterpiece it should have been, so that has to be weighed into the final verdict.<br /><br />The Great Escape is an exceptional album with a couple of glaring flaws that nearly destroy the whole thing. If you’re not a power metal fan to begin with, this isn’t going to win you over. However, if you are into this genre or can appreciate music for what it is within its own genre, then I highly recommend you give this album a listen. Just skip the audio abortions mentioned above and you’ll be left with candy and roses.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Few too many but I like the fact that they're local.<br />Keep up the good work. Less frequent ads would work for me.

B000J1AGQI|4.0|I've seen \\"We Were Soldiers\\" quite a few times and actually watched it again yesterday. At the time this movie came out 9/11 was still fresh in the minds of the American people an a lot of these \\"American Hero\\" war movies started flooding the theaters. I like we were soldiers as a war flick but it also suffers from lacking realism. It's somehow a portrayal of realistic events with a non realistic story line. It's obvious certain things were \\"Hollywoodized\\" in the film to give the movie a sense of glamor but it made the movie feel cheap in certain places where it wasn't needed.<br /><br />The movie starts out following Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore who undertakes the responsibility of bringing troops to the first battle US Army battle in the Vietnam war. Before any of the soldiers arrive you get to see how they live before hand. They all live picture perfect lives in on base Military neighborhoods. They are all family men and dedicated to their wives,children and their country. I honestly could not stand this part about the movie. It's too whitebread and an unrealistic portrayal of actual soldiers, even in that era. Army bases are made up of people from all walks of life and they all have their reasons for joining. It's a very diverse place but there is a strong bond of comradely because everyone is there to serve the same purpose. You never get to see that part of military life because you're only shown their personal lives from the point of the \\"Army wives\\" really. It makes the impact of really understanding the battle hard because your not connected to the personal stories of the soldiers. Their backgrounds are either never introduced so there's no real reason to feel for them if they are killed or their background has been hollywoodized into the \\"Great American Hero\\" story. In a film that's supposed to bring impact about what these soldiers went through it's hard to connect with them without knowing who they are so you can relate to them and that's very important to establish in any war movie. Instead of seeing a group of soldiers that have come to know and bond with their platoon so they have each others backs during war, you just see soldiers and faces you hardly know. It makes certain scenes seemed forced or out of place when someone risks their lives to save someone like their best friends but you never even heard the soldiers name before. Something always put me off about this movie and that was pretty much it. It's a Vietnam movie based half about the lives of the soldiers, and then the war and their sacrifice. But, the first have maybe only the lives of 2 soldiers are ever presented. What about the others that don't live in houses and have a wife and kids? (Of course their story is told at the end of the movie, the people that come home to no one there to greet them\\").<br /><br />I do think the movie despite that issue does give a good emotional insight to how the army wives felt finding out that their husbands had been killed at war. Although I found Lt. Col Hal's wife and her friends good deeds to be mostly out of their own selfishness more than anything.  The battle portions of the movie of course try to add shock value and throw drama on you as much as it possibly can. However, it suffers from the \\"Invincible Hard-ss\\" syndrome. Where top ranking men can walk through bullet fire and not even have to worry about \\"carrying rifle\\" or \\"ducking\\" to avoid fire. It's almost as if through the movie Mel Gibson's character has somehow figured a way to have bullets bounce off of him, as he doesn't seem to feel a need to duck,dodge, or try to avoid anyone's fire at all. Although his role is acted well, it takes away from that realistic aspect that the movie is trying to bring where in one movie soldiers are dying left and right and then in the next scene bullets just seem to bounce right off of one man. I don't care if you're Chuck Norris himself, if someone is firing a 50 caliber machine gun at you, YOU ARE going to duckfor cover.<br /><br />The other problem with the combat is that the movie makes it seem like the Vietnamese army just popped out the ground and started charging at people Civil war style. The Vietnamese were not that sloppy and knew how to make good use of Guerrilla warfare. Their ability to sneak up on their enemy and overwhelm them was their greatest strength. The movie doesn't go into much detail at all about that but just shows swarms of Vietnamese running out the ground like ants and into American rifles. Some points of the movie show their war tactics well like when Mel Gibson's character tells his men to fire 3 shots at anything they thing is strange and then they squad fires and all of a sudden out of know where you see all these Vietnamese troops rising out the ground. That was very good scene.<br /><br />Overall the movie is about a 3/5 when it comes to a war movie. I just never could adopt to the idea of a \\"Realistic\\" war movie that's been \\"hollywoodized\\". \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down\\" are also films that suffered from that effect.<br /><br />What I loved the most about this film were the choppers. The Hueys really steal the show and this is the first movie I've ever seen that showed the true importance of their support in the war. They are literally the lifeline for these soldiers. I always loved the Huey and every scene they have in the movie is like heaven to watch. The scenes with them are amazing, especially the scene where Snake flies in and delivers his personal thoughts to the Vietnamese via, his machine guns. There's just something about the Huey that's amazing. There is one thing I wanted to note about the film, and that's that no one ever has a reaction to the wind from the propeller force of the Huey. If you've ever been on a huey or right up on a huey when it's taking off than you don't know. It's almost like a tornado it blows wind and kicks up anything around it pretty hard. I found some scenes funny when the helicopter would land and Mel Gibson would just be standing without so much as his jacket even waving in the wind.for cover.<br /><br />The other problem with the combat is that the movie makes it seem like the Vietnamese army just popped out the ground and started charging at people Civil war style.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Read some of the previous ratings. They are pretty much on the mark. My concern is that late teens and older naive women will believe that this form of sadism is okay and go into a relationship with someone hoping to change him to live a happily ever after. I would like the editor to reprint a new one taking out all the Oh!s and especially the \\"Oh my\\"s. Neither sex nor BDSM doesn't belong in Kansas. For pure entertainment, it is very amusing.
B008X6N1OA|4.0|i love ice age series and so does my 4 year old son.<br />it's very funny and i will highly recommend all to watch prior ice age series before watch this one (so you can understand some jokes better)<br /><br />only thing that i didn't like was too many new characters in this film<br />when we watched it at the theater, i couldn't remember all the new one's name!<br />i bet my son was having much harder time to get to know all the new characters<br /><br />yet, it's very charming and it didn't disappoint us. i will recommend this movie to everyone

B00ADS98FC|5.0|If you like the show Glee, then you will love this movie. Anna Kendrick is amazing (funny and a great voice!) Great comedy throughout, with a cute love story as well. It's definitely a cute movie. Worth the money and I would watch it again and again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I wanted a fun game for my kindle. I got what I wanted and its a fantastic game. This game is so addicting. which also makes it fun

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Wonderful product has all the designs of a great artist and more would advise everyone to check it out for their own opinion
B00AO2P3GA|2.0|the game is sub par to MC3.  After playing MC3 for so long I expected the same quality out of MC4 but on steriods.  MC3 has better graphics-sound effects-realism and overall better play and environment. After playing this I quickly went back to MC3.  If you're looking for a new campaign its prob ok but if you're an on line multiplayer like myself stick to mc3 and save th $7 def not worth it.  I should of waited for more reviews myself.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book (all five in this collection, actually) is one of the best stories I have read in a long time. Character driven by an author with an imaginative voice. If you like Sci Fi and dissidents read this book!!!!!
B0053O89RY|5.0|We just love this show! The French Bulldog who can't swim is hilarious. The teenagers are so true to life, texting away. Just funny. We enjoyed lying in bed and laughing!
B005GSVFAK|5.0|This is and excellent movie and I was pleased to see that the story was very different from the other 2 toy story movies.<br />The 3d also makes this movie kinda fun and different.
B00006LFGD|5.0|If you like BARBRA STREISAND this CD is BRILLIANT there are so many lovely songs with so many different male singers, who would have thought DON JOHNSON (from MIAMI VICE) had such a good singing voice
B008S4YZCO|5.0|the characters are really cute and it is fun battling other people with my own monsters. I highly recommend it. Yay!
0385536828|3.0|It takes awhile to get into this book but it is interesting just a little slow in action at first.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|I liked the movie but It felt like the movie took an eternity to watch. It was just a slow moving storyline. Lots of action and suspense.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|AND an excellent movie to watch in general. Who doesn't still feel like their world has been turned up side down whenever they realize Edward N's character is Tyler Durden.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|3D does this movie a great service, the actors and story just pop out off the screan to make a great viewing adventure
0812993357|2.0|For perspective, please note I have no particular interest in fashion but Coddington stood out as an interesting and sympathetic figure in the documentary film, 'The September Issue'. I was hoping for lots of juicy gossip and some intelligent insight into why fashion matters. Instead you get lots of details that don't seem to matter, no real dirt and no perspective at all on the incredible era she lived through and the work she has done.<br />Most irritating is the style, or lack of style, in the writing. Rather than tell stories, she just lists things that happened to her. And she likes to present her past as if she were a passive player and the cards fell as they did. I just can't believe she'd have the career she did if this were true. And it's hard to believe that Grace Coddington, who seems to have been involved with some great things, is really this bland.<br />I wanted to like this book but it was a disappointment.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|not the best movie but I have been wathcing &#34;Once Upon a Time&#34; and I love Charlize Theron so I had to watch this
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have read (and own) several study Bibles.  This is by far the best out there.  The introductory material provides a great resource for understanding the big picture of the Bible.  The commenters are well-established and Biblically accurate in their analysis.  I find this study Bible to be a great resource when I need a quick understanding of a topic or a verse.  The ESV translation is both an accurate translation and easy to read.  Also, the kindle edition is easy to navigate and makes it simple to read the Bible at night without disturbing my spouse.  Finally, the price was exceptionally reasonable considering the breadth of material provided.
0395389496|5.0|we love this book. we have read it atleast twice every day since getting it. it's a fun story to read during the Christmas season.
B005HSL626|4.0|The game is fun and easy to play. It can be quite addicting. There is another game that is a lot like this which is SushiChop.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  As far as im concerned it has a great story line, great production quality, and a good cast.  If you are into action adventure science fiction this movie fits the bill.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I changed the settings so that its not open /running all of the time,  and it stays on my city.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My boyfriend first introduced this game to me and I thought it looked silly. But after playing it the first time, I can honestly admit that this game is very addictive! I love it! The object of the game is to slice as many fruit pieces as you can without hitting any of the bombs. It gives opportunities to gain extra points and buy bomb deflectors. After passing so many points you are rewarded with new things, like different blades to slash the fruit with. Its pretty cool to use when you have to wait in line, waiting room, etc...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game its really addictive. This game reminds me of the arcades. I could play for hours and not even know it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Paid $0.99 for this game and its sooooo worth it (and more)  My daughter (5 yrs old) and I love angry birds and this is just as good as the others :)
1936594641|4.0|This one is a classic, and it comes with a review from some other professor that takes up a good portion of the pages. I liked it though, for that because it made me feel like I got through it faster because I got to skip a bunch!
B003H9MSPG|4.0|We got this for my brother. It's a totally sweet gun but we were kindda bummed that it doesn't pack much punch when shooting. Some of our other smaller cheaper guns can go farther are more usable and cheaper. Hopefully with a few modifications it will shoot better.
B006O6EOII|4.0|This item was for my Neice for christmas.  I can't rate the product until she has time to play with it.  lol<br />Item arrived in great condition and looked very cute.  Can't wait for her to open the gift.

B0067EKY7M|4.0|A zillionaire Yemeni sheik likes fly fishing, so his British aide (Emily Blunt) enlists the help of a fisheries expert (Ewan McGregor) to bring 10,000 salmon to his desert country.<br /><br />This movie is heavy on talk, light on action, and feels like a true story (but isn't).  McGregor and Blunt make a good, low-key couple and Amr Waked is excellent as the kindly sheik.  Kristin Scott Thomas steals the show, however, in a small but witty part as a Ministry official; she gives her trademark sarcastic performance and injects much needed humor into an otherwise tepid story.<br /><br />This is a sweet, but slow and predictable story (I wouldn't call it a romantic comedy) that would be of particular interest to fly fishing fans. 3.5 stars.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|i felt so bad about this story. main question is \\"why didnt Chris get her help?!\\" icouldn't put it down though
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Granted I did not have the opportunity to read it (or any large portion of it) in any one sitting but even considering that it was one Lee's slower reads.  I will try to find the time sit and read it again at which point if my opinion changes I will definitely re-evaluate my review.
0547884591|5.0|Really amazing, Tim did it again and took it up a notch. Must read for anyone claimong to be a man!
B00000IWVS|5.0|I don't know Chopin; couldn't pick him out of a line-up. I do know what I like and I like this. I find great expression and fire coming from Argerich's keyboard. I like to be excited by piano-work. Don't listen to the purists; DO listen to Martha. She is confident, sensual and demands your attention.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my 10 year old son who has all the other Diary of a wimpy kid books. This was suppose to be a Christmas gift but he couldn't wait to read it. He read it in two days and loved it. As with all the other books, this had him laughing throughout the book. I know he'll probably read it again before the year is over.

B00991TCOG|5.0|Each track is excellent and my favorites are Transcendence and Shadows.

0553288105|5.0|Somente alguns conhecem toda a verdade - um cientista da Terra, um alien&iacute;gena rebelde habitante de um planeta &agrave; beira da morte, um humano intuitivo morador da Lua e que pressente a eminente aniquilação do Sol.<br /> Eles sabem a terr&iacute;vel verdade - mas quem os ouvir&aacute;?<br /> Esses poucos seres, humanos e alien&iacute;genas, são os guardiões das chaves da sobrevivência da Terra.<br /> Uma surpreendente descrição de uma sociedade alien&iacute;gena, Despertar dos Deuses &eacute; dividido em 3 partes, cada uma delas, uma est&oacute;ria em separado, sobre o mesmo tema.<br /> A primeira parte conta a est&oacute;ria do Dr. Peter Lamont, um f&iacute;sico que estuda transferência energ&eacute;tica entre universos com diferentes leis da natureza.  Lamont acha que a \\"Electric Pump\\" pode destruir nosso sistema solar e ele tenta interromper o processo.<br /> A segunda parte conta a est&oacute;ria de Odeen, Dua e Tritt (um trio alien&iacute;gena parte da mesma fam&iacute;lia), que vivem em outro universo, onde a \\"Electric Pump\\" atua, como resultado dos eventos da primeira parte.  Asimov cria uma raça alien&iacute;gena cheia de credibilidade, apresentando 3 sexos e habilmente lidando com os rituais de acasalamento, de forma bastante sens&iacute;vel.<br /> A terceira e &uacute;ltima parte, soluciona as duas primeiras e conta a est&oacute;ria de Denison, um cientista que tamb&eacute;m aparece na primeira parte, e que, como resultado dos eventos acontecidos naquele momento, muda-se para a Lua.  Nesta parte, Asimov nos apresenta a Selene - uma forte e feminina protagonista.<br /> Fiquei um tanto decepcionada, pois a primeira e segunda partes não se resolvem sozinhas - somente ao final da terceira.  Não ficamos sabendo como os protagonistas reagem aos acontecimentos.<br /> Asimov usa uma citação de Friedrich von Schiller, \\"Against stupidity, the Gods themselves contend in vain\\" (Contra a estupidez, os pr&oacute;prios Deuses lutam em vão), como t&iacute;tulos dessas 3 partes - adequadamente a cada uma delas.<br /> Este livro ganhou os prêmios Hugo e Nebula.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Great product - light weight and still holds 2 drinks, and snacks/cell phone in the middle!<br /><br />Love the adjustable velcro straps as I can put it down lower on the stroller so my son can munch on snacks while I shop, or I can put it up higher to keep Mama's coffee out of reach ;)
030758836X|1.0|I couldn't wait to read this book because everyone was raving about it.<br />The beginning was dull, the middle was wtf?, the end was stupid.<br />It was overly dramatic, extremely contrived and neither character was developed<br />enough for me to be interested in them.  They should have both died at the end.<br />Don't waste your time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|good app for this seasons thanks for free apps.in this time the app for angry birds christmas is  very interest and funny.

B0032JTV6U|3.0|My mom bought this. It came pretty quickly, and works well. No damage to the discs, and for a Glee fan, it's perfect.
159562015X|5.0|I took me 30 minutes to take the test + another 30 to read through the detailed results. I've been committed to ongoing self-improvement for several years now, but I've learned more about my strengths and how to maximize them in this 1 hour than I have in the last 10 years combined!!<br /><br />Enough said.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Now I have nothing againest smart phones by any means, but minecraft for tablet's is so much better than on a phone.  You have more control on what you mine and etc.  and it just looks better in general.  I also highly recommend this game overall.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|CD was received very quickly. Will buy again. Price ws reasonable. Receipt came enclosed in the box. Very cut and dry business.
B0043D2L9S|5.0|makes live a lot easier when you are caring more then one camera and it take all the pressure of your neck. I love this harness.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|very fun game. addictive game. matching 3 items in a row with added puzzle games at end of levels. thanks
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Great movie, super effects.  I liked this one just as much as the 1st.  I love Will Smith movies! I can't wait to see it again.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|So var its very good I tried it. Some time it is charging my mobile 3 times. Some time two. I think it must charge my mobile more than 3 times at least. Because my mobile battery is 1600 MA
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book is packed with action, twists and turns. Really the first book I've read out of this genre in a long time, and I'm hooked!
0547848412|5.0|An awesome read: it has a fascinating and hilarious protagonist and a fantastical story, but told with such realism that it feels like it's on the edge of being possibly true. Or atleast, I wish it was true. The book embraces the power of stories, religion, and belief and it's important role in our lives. It is also the best book I've read on how to handle the stuck-with-a-tiger-on-the-same-lifeboat situation. Can't wait to see the movie :)
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|This game is a decent hidden object game. Similar to most I've played.  It is still rude to beg for praise every other level. That's why it only gets 3 stars.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|While I though I wouldn't really need the ethernet port on my new Mac, I quickly ran into two situations where it came in handy.  First, was when I got my new Mac.  In the past, I've used firewire to transfer all my settings and files to the new computer, but the newer models do not have firewire anymore.  So I started to transfer over the wireless.  It was going to take a few days to transfer everything.  I order the Gigabit ethernet adapter and started the transfer again and it ended up only taking 2 hours.  The other situation was in setting up my router and my networked printer for the first time.  So for anyone wondering if they need this, its definitely nice to have when these situations crop up.<br /><br />I would be nice if it was closer to $20.
B00846F1YW|2.0|I got the free version first. Was enjoying it so much I bought Mysteryville 2. Was Really Enjoying it, but at level 13-1 it just goes off. Cannot play anymore.  I deleted it  and downloaded it again  TWO TIMES.  Still cannot play anymore .  I am not happy about this and it  Will cause me to think twice before buying another game.  Cannot get my money Back, cannot get a new game, can or will it be fixed? Not a happy customer. Would have gotten 5  stars if it worked.
0425263908|2.0|I am only going to continue on with the series to find out if there is any meaningful story here or not.  The author wrote in the love scenes with the intent to shock...very obvious.  I related to the main female lead in 50 Shades, much better than this female character.  I was exhausted with their relationship, but hoping there will be more in the second book.
B000H5U832|5.0|This is another classic movie for Pixar that can be enjoyed both by children and adults. Recommended to all persons.
B0001MLMKY|5.0|very easy and clear to read, durable, can bathe with it any time, never need to get it off my hand.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|There is an annoying trend in cds these days--duets. Everyone has a track or two on their cd featuring somebody.  Save them for movie soundtracks or something. The 2 duets on Red should have been the extra tracks and the 3 studio tracks on the 2nd cd of this set should be on the main cd.<br /> The extra 6 tracks on this cd are beautiful. The acoustic version of \\"State Of Grace\\" is sublime.  I bought this version, sequenced my player to delete the duets and added the 6 tracks = 20 gorgeous songs sung beautifully.  I played them over and over for 4 days straight. That happens when I love an album.<br />  I'm sure you can still find this much cheaper. It's a Target [the retail store] Exclusive.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love it, it will be a great gift.  It is what I expected and the price was right!  Enjoy, enjoy!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|i dunno, there's just something nice about having silver paste in a squeeze injector. I may try and use it to replace my fillings too.
B009GYSQV6|3.0|There was a period in my life where I lost interest in CC after seeing the types of people that showed up to their shows and experiencing Alice's horrible live vocal performances, so I didn't leap on this when it was released.<br /><br />This album feels like a departure from their previous releases.  I'm not sure that it's a more mature, sophisticated, or even more of a conceptual sound.  This album felt, on the whole, as a sort of Euro-Arena-Trance-Electro-Nighttime-Driving sort of record.  There isn't much to be said about \\"concept\\" on electronic records, but the music does seem to have a through-line that is evident through most of the songs.  That being said, a lot of them do sound awfully similar.  The music ends up sounding a bit flat and is takes you though the same loops and riffs over and over.<br /><br />It did grow on me since the first listen, which left me pretty disappointed.  It's the sort of thing that I could get into just having it playing in the background while doing something else.  I think it would be a good \\"night driving\\" record for your car.  Not sure that this record has a lot going for it though.  No real stand out tracks, and not entirely memorable.  Sorry, CC.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love listening to this CD!! Very nice selections of songs... and Susan sings them perfectly!! I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this CD to anyone who loves musicals as I do.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Since Apple discontinued Firewire ports on the new MacBook Pro models, an adapter like this is a necessity if you want to keep using peripherals you already own.<br /><br />Speed seems pretty good, kept up with Firewire 800 on my iMac according to my rough speed tests.<br /><br />Will not power some devices the old Firewire 800 port built into the Mac would power. It was okay with a single 2.5\\" SATA disk in an external enclosure but the Apple user forums mention problems with Firewire-powered audio devices. Definitely do not turn up at a performance depending on a Thunderbolt to Firewire 800 adapter and no other way of powering your devices.
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|This movie starts off a little slow, but it picks up quickly and will take you through a range of emotions. I feel so badly for the people involved in this true story. It brought tears to my eyes.<br />Everyone, especially teens should see this!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Cristian had the body and the swagger of a very believable Bruce wayne. I would have enjoyed more Ann Hathaway in the cat suit. I know that the next actor will do a good job but he will not be the one I consider best.
B008220C56|4.0|Director Joe Wright certainly knows how to bring the best out of Keira Knightley in this, their third outing together.  Knightley glistens as Tolstoy's Anna who is married to a Russian aristocrat, Aleksei Karenin (Jude Law).  While their marriage is by all accounts happy, Anna also knows she has never known true love.  Although she doesn't search it out, it comes to her in the form of Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a rising military officer in the Imperial Russian army.<br /><br />Wright's take on this often filmed story combines and unusual setting of a stage production with characters traipsing across stages, sometimes in front of theater audiences.  Then as they head to the countryside, so does the camera.  At first this was a bit unsettling, but after a while I actually liked the concept.  I'm sure there is a subtext to it all.  I'm guessing it has something to do with the \\"acting\\" many of the upper crust society must play.<br /><br />The photography is beautiful and ranges from dark inner plebian bedrooms to opulent palaces to the white frozen landscape of 19th century Russia.  My biggest issue with the film is in the casting of Taylor-Johnson who was so good in \\"Savages,\\" \\"Nowhere Boy\\" and other films.  Here he is miscast as Vronsky who is portrayed as the most eligible bachelor.  His wispy blond mustache is a distraction in most of his scenes.  While Knightly gives it her all conveying an agonizing love for Vronsky, Taylor-Johnson isn't overly interested.  Perhaps I'm giving this too much attention but for me, the chemistry just wasn't there.  And after all, that is the point of the story.<br /><br />In a more interesting subplot, the scenes between Domhnall Gleeson as a rich landowner named Levin who wants to meet and marry young Kitty (Alicia Vikander) who is initially smitten by Vronsky.  She is the younger sister of Anna's sister-in-law.  In the only scene that caused my eyes to mist, Kitty who is now on her honeymoon, comforts Levin's dying brother because the innkeeper won't allow the brother's common law wife (and former prostitute) to be there.<br /><br />Over all, this is a film full of eye candy and fresh in its approach to a classic story.  More like a Baz Luhrmann film without the music than a straight forward drama.r because the innkeeper won't allow the brother's common law wife (and former prostitute) to be there.<br /><br />Over all, this is a film full of eye candy and fresh in its approach to a classic story.

0609610570|4.0|I've read this book now twice and I come back to the real value of designing your leadership skills to make \\"executing\\" easier. Not that there are many original ideas embedded in the pages but there is some useful ideas about priorities and advice about focus. I specifically enjoyed the author's view of really rewarding the individuals that get the right things done. Too many times we overlook this simple advice and revert to the mediocre. In summary, there aren't any true monumental or shocking thoughts in the pages but it's a nice refesher to help you remember one of your most important roles as a leader.. to execute upon plans.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This is a typical hidden item search game with some really fun puzzles thrown in along the way.  The only complaint I have is that you have to zoom in on most scenes to find everything, and then you get penalties for random taps while moving around the screen. Fun but slightly annoying at times.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This offers the right sound that is not disturbing. I use this for travel to help drown out the sounds of the hotel.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This case is designed for the 8.9\\" Kindle Fire, and it fits perfectly. It's everything I wanted in a case:<br />- Good protection with a soft, non-scratchy lining.<br />- The Fire is firmly held in place in a hard plastic shell<br />- An elastic band which holds the case closed and slips out of the way when it is open.<br />- Looks nice, with a good color choice.<br />- Rotates 360°, and is easy to rotate.<br />- Holds the Fire securely when standing whether portrait or landscape.<br />- Cutouts in all the right places; nothing is blocked.<br />- Very well made; will probably last a while.<br /><br />It even came with an instruction sheet. Highly recommended!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books in one....a great buy and I read them all in 2 weeks.  Anyone who has not read the books yet get them
B009IA3O2O|5.0|Despite the change in lineup, this album really stays true to Kamelot's sound, and is a great collection of songs overall. It's great to get another concept album out of Kamelot, and Silverthorn doesn't disappoint. Some songs are a bit on the slow side, but the great ones make up for it.
0307887960|4.0|DH and I lost over 20 lbs each on this diet.  I love protein, so it wasn't hard.  I was surprised at how much protein I could eat throughout the day / diet, and lose weight.  Most of this info, the gist of it anyway, can be found online.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|My daughter needed this book for school.  great book teachers children alot about how a children detail with the Holocaust
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Jessica Lange is incredible, just as she was in Season One, and Lily Rabe is holding her own! I would definitely like to see more of them in future seasons of AHS. I'm amazed at the top-notch actors, both seasoned veterans and unknowns, with which AHS fills each and every episode! I love the way they have woven some of my favorite actors from Season One seamlessly into this new storyline. I'm hoping to see Alex Breckenridge, Taissa Farmiga, and Connie Briton in an upcoming episode! Although I do like this season's storyline, it is a far cry from last season's. This season's &#34;aliens&#34; and &#34;frankensteins&#34; are just a little too far-fetched for me... I prefer believable horror, something that could actually happen to ME! I also like suspense and psychological thrillers, and that is something that is NOT lacking in either season! It keeps you thinking and guessing as you piece together the subtle hints and clues from the first episode to the last.
B004J64QSI|5.0|In this 25th anniversary edition of the beloved musical Les Miserables, I have learned so much about the background of it, the creators, the original actors, the politics behind it, etc. etc. It's a very good insight into the creation of this musical.<br />I recommend this edition to anyone who loves Les Miserables as much as I do.<br />You will gain new appreciation of it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Second favorite book it has alot of detail and alot of history.  It will make you think alot about family
6304100507|5.0|I bought this for my little brother. He gets so tickled watching it, and I get just as tickled watching him watching it :)

B00005KARK|5.0|Great movie and one of the best Disney movies ever.  I gave it to someone because they had never seen it.
0141326093|5.0|I envisaged book 1 `Beautiful Creatures' being this years bestseller, hence likewise I feel that many readers will feel compelled to continue reading this remarkable series. This is a hauntingly delicious dark fantasy story with a creepy, spinechilling twist that will have you sat on the edge of your seat in suspense. Character-driven this magical, extraordinary world is brought brilliantly to life, as you are swept away by the mystery, the romance and the danger that is lurking beneath the shadows. Totally bewitching and spellbinding, Ethan Wate and Lena Duchannes powerful, deep love is just magnetic and which makes this tantalizing tale one that you will never forget. Mesmerizing, captivating and hypnotic this romantic Romeo & Juliet love story touches your heart and soul; as Ethan and Lena are two characters whom really stand-out in fiction as being unique & memorable.<br /><br />Some lovers are meant to be. Others are cursed...Every kiss is a curse. Ethan's next heartbeat could be his last. It is their curse now.<br /><br />One night in the rain, Ethan Wate opened his eyes and fell instantly in love with Lena Duchannes. His life would never be the same again. Continuing their passionate and thwarted love story, Lena learns that being a Castor comes with obligations. Her family is locked in a supernatural civil war and since making that terrifying choice on her Sixteenth birthday, she now must live with the consequences - the consequences that haunt her dreams and flood into her subconscious during every waking hour. As he seventeenth birthday is approaching, Lena and Ethan must face even greater danger as a Castor and a Mortal being can NEVER truly be together...<br /><br />This is a unique, epic and totally addictive read that will leave you breathless, and render you speechless; as all I can say is WOW once again, for book 2 is just as brilliant as book 1. The phenomenal characterization combined with exquisite detail really makes the story come alive, and the prophecy and the history is fascinating. Their deep love story becomes even more intense as imminent danger increases in potency, so that you find yourself entangled within the most gripping and exciting drama EVER. Will they risk everything for love? Can a mortal being and a Castor truly be together or will the enemy and danger that surrounds them, threaten to pierce their hearts so as to destroy their love for each other? Lena and Ethan are pushed to breaking point as their relationship is tested to the very limits and which tugs at the heartstrings so that you end up bleeding inwardly, crying out in pain for the hero and heroine.<br /><br />This book is incredible and I am so impressed by Garcia and Stohl's imaginative creation, which is so beautiful and affecting that it really does remain with you long after you have read the book. I definitely would recommend this as Ethan & Lena have stolen my heart, being a series that I predict as a bestseller, epic phenomenon and something that is soon to grace the big screen on film. It is a new edition to the YA genre and which will be equally as much loved as Twilight saga by Stephanie Meyer, Harry Potter by JK Rowling and Fallen by Lauren Kate; this is something that you will PLEAD and BEG for to be on your bookshelf!<br /><br />* I would like to thank `A Dream Of Books' blog for hosting a book giveaway of the entire series, with book 1 being Beautiful Creatures and for the publisher Puffin*<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]y is fascinating.

1449410243|5.0|Personally, I think the poster of warning signs alone is worth the purchase price.For anyone who owns a cat (or is owned by one, as the case may be), the poster let's you track your cat's activities, and lets you know when you had better darn well make sure you are getting his favorite food, and not skimping on petting time!<br />The rest of the book is equally hilarious, with literal LOL moments (so be careful where you read it, lest people think you are slightly bonkers).  By far my favorite cat book of all time.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This light is great! I bought a Nikon 3100 to take pictures of our newborn, and this flash works awesome! I can keep the shutter speed fast enough for no blur and bounce the light off the ceiling so I don't get weird flash photos. Make sure you get some good batteries (Eneloop)!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good and entertaining game before going to sleep :).This is one of the best card games in the world. I suggest to everyone.

B00006AG5N|5.0|If you are looking for a great Elvis CD, this is it.  It has all of his hits and then some, including many of his earlier hit songs.  I could listen to this forever.
B000L53D4O|5.0|got this for a child for Christmas; it appears to be of good quality and beneficial to child.  I will be pleased to give this as a gift.
B0091SRL36|5.0|First off, after reading all three books, and viewing the film numerous times on blu ray, I decided to &#34;upgrade&#34; to the steel book.  There is no additional material within the case.  You are essentially buying the case.  This is pretty much the way it is with steel book purchases.  It's a neat collection piece.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It's hard to pin this one down.  It's a story of several characters whose lives intersect in most interesting ways while also being something of a fable with a more expansive meaning.  It's very well-written with nary a clumsy sentence or wayward tangent.  Even the supernatural events are described so poetically well, it is like Albom is beaming the scene directly into your mind.  And you can't read the first chapter without following it through to the end.<br /><br />I guess I would call this very good literature and forget about boxing it into a genre.  Well worth the read.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is cleverly written and a real page turner! You think you have it figured out and then &#34;bam&#34;! The author does a good job of embedding details and setting up the clues to mislead you along the way! A great read!
B008PUXMP2|5.0|Love this set.  It's a nice overview of Amy's singing, without being encyclopedic or overwhelming.  We'll enjoy it for a long time.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|please update now!!!! great game just glitches ever since the last update.<br />please fix this game...... I love it. will play again when it gets an update.

0786868694|5.0|I never tire of reading about her way of expressing her love of cooking.  This is the third book  I have purchased and along with Jamie Oliver her books have become the ones I enjoy sitting and reading cover to cover.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|When I saw the title, I thought \\"oh, this has to be a cool book\\".<br />Megan wakes up completely hungover and not remembering the man he married last night. Ready to get a lawyer, he tells her \\"I don't want a divorce\\".<br /><br />So they give it a try.<br />The book has many funny moments and gets you to love the characters, but they still don't seem to be real.<br /><br />Connor's dad out of the picture. and his mother dead, he convinced himself he isn't capable of loving. That he can start a family without the need of love.<br />Megan's mother married seven times, and seeing this, Megan promised she would never fall in love. That she would start a family by herself.<br /><br />The morning after they meet and marry, she doesn't remember who he is, how they met. why they got married. But it takes him a few hours to convincing her of giving it a try. It doesn't seem real that someone would try to stay married to someone they don't remember - at all, not even his name.<br />But they do.<br />She moves all the way from Denver to San Diego to live with a man he doesn't know at all. What about her job? Her friends back home?<br /><br />Megan's character needs way more developing that it has. Not only not one friend of hers is mentioned throughout the whole book, someone to call and ask for opinion, but the only other persons she talks to in the book are her mother and her cousin Gail and the two annoying best friends.<br /><br />In my opinon, the author's idea for the book was pretty good, but then wasn't able to turn it into a good novel.<br />However, if you are in need of a few hours of fun without expecting a best-seller book, this might be a good option. Funny, entertaining and easy to read.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I like this whole albumn, because Rod Stewart's voice is so different.  It shows a completely different side of him and the songs he sings are all classics and very enjoyable.
0446580848|1.0|I bought this book on the premise that it might be a thrilling read about anti- terrorism. I recalled reading earlier books by de Mille and finding them quite exciting.<br />Alas! I was very disappointed indeed. I almost gave up after 100 pages but soldiered on and I sincerely wish I hadn't bothered.<br />The book is poorly written (made blindingly obvious by the fact that I had just finished a le Carre shortly before picking up Panther - what a contrast!). It also focuses on what must be one of the most annoying characters in any novel I have ever read. John Corey,  the counter terrorism agent, with his constant inane asides and bloated sense of self importance and paranoia about others,  really put my teeth on edge. He is really irritating and unbelievably sexist. His wife is little more than a cypher.<br />Even more surprising is the lack of any real sense of suspense.  You would have thought that tracking a terrorist responsible for the attack on the USS Cole might have had moments of nail biting suspense but instead many chapters go by without anything in the way of thrill or suspense and what should be a thrilling conclusion was clunky and routine and utterly predictable.<br />I honestly cannot recommend this book to anyone. One can only hope that de Mille will kill off the main character a.s.a.p.

B008YWY0HK|1.0|Totally can't believe I received two damaged DVDs in an order.  Imagine my shocking disappointment, not only was the picture split into two screens, the color was off.  And the redhead characters were blue!!  Movie night ruined.  Does not deserve one star.

B004LP3AYI|3.0|While the storyline continues to be very good, the number of bad grammar and spelling errors were quite distracting. By book four, this seems to be corrected to a large degree.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena is a story about demigods, half-gods who are trying to stop Mother Earth (Gaea) from destroying the gods and human civilization and letting all the monsters in Tartarus (the underworld) loose. Percy, Annabeth, Leo, Piper, Hazel, Jason, and Frank are the ones to stop Gaea. These seven were prophecized to answer the call, the prophecy went like this: Seven half-bloods shall answer the call, to storm or fire the world must fall, an oath to keep with a final breath, and foes bear arms to the doors of death. We still don't know exactly what this prophecy means from this book, but I expect I'll find out when the next book comes out in 2013.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Again a great read, exciting and routing for the underdog is always the best book, I can't wait for the movie, Thank you
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I watched seasons I and 2 on PBS and am awaiting this shipment. Much as Tolstoy's novels described the life and times of the Russian nobility, this series gives us a glimpse into the British aristocracy.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Very interesting, meticulous research.  Ended with some personal family history, which I loved.  My only criticism is that it seemed to end abruptly.  i don't know if it was because I was enjoying it so much or it was a crash landing (pun intended).  I highly recommend it and have been quoting from it since I read it.

B008LCRAC0|1.0|Beware if ordering new from Amazon. They send you the slim line case where all the discs are inside one dvd box. Not individual cases. It's cheaper that way and if you have slip cases it won't look good on a shelf. They need to change the description.

B009NOVCTM|2.0|All these great reviews for this money grubbing cd . Let's see (A) hot rocks 1 and 2 , (B) Big hits high tides and Through the past darkly and (C) Sacd 45's box set . All much better cds including even 40 licks .  All the people complaining about shorter versions  Paint It Black mono 3.50  paint It Black  Stereo  3.23 . Take your pick and download the one you want. CD 3 of grrr is comical compared to when they were actually a band and not a corporation . Why don't they put out the stereo versions of songs that are on the mobile fidelity hot rocks cds . Satisfaction and Play with Fire sound cool in stereo.

0231161166|5.0|I am writing as a person with a graduate degree in Bioinformatics with a special interest in epigenetics, and I can confidently say that this is one of the clearest introductory presentations of epigenetics that I have encountered.  The book is written at the undergraduate level, but it is not simplistic.  It hits all the high points of epigenetics and pulls together the latest in research into this fascinating area of science.  Anyone with a rudimentary background in genetics should have no trouble absorbing the concepts articulated in this book.

0446401307|3.0|a short book and not as good as his others in the Bosh Series.  This was his first case since he left the LAPD's Open Unsolved Unit for the prestigious Homicide Special squad.  Harry was called out to investigate a murder which involved national security. A doctor with access to a dangerous radioactive substance is found murdered in the trunk of his car. Retracing his steps, Harry learns that a large quantity of radioactive cesium was stolen shortly before the doctor's death. With the cesium in unknown hands, Harry fears the murder could be part of a terrorist plot to poison a major American city. Soon, Bosch is in a race against time, not only against the culprits, but also against the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI (in the form of Harry's one-time lover Rachel Walling), who are convinced that this case is too important for the likes of the LAPD.

B006R1T40I|5.0|If you like Bonnie Raitt, you'll love this album. It has everything you've always liked about her music.  Her slide guitar work is better than ever.  There are some great solo licks on this album.  Her singing is also top notch and brings the emotions out of the songs. The songs run the gamut from slow, hearfelt ballads to some real rockers.  I listened to this CD daily for the first two weeks after I received it.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Picked up this movie for a great price.  I looked it up again and the price has gone up.  Brand new with bluray, dvd and digital copy.  To get the digital copy, you have to sign up for some kind of subscription service and put in the promo code.  It's  free but I wish it was just the file.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Ok I got this app for. 99 and I know some of you were talking about how excpencive it was but maybe if you idiouts would wait a while you could get it for cheaper but after the 2nd level it got BORING and I feel sorry for you idiouts who are not thinking but again I feel sorry for you and I have to say this app is worth less than 0.00!!!!!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'd heard a lot of buzz on \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" and decided to purchase the EBook on Amazon.com.  The initial courtship and bedroom encounters of Anastasia and Christian were interesting enough.  However, the characters and plot become increasingly farfetched. I struggled to finish the book, coming to loathe both of the main characters - Grey for his moodiness and Anastasia for her naivety.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning - my expectation reading this book was for an erotic or possibly 'soft porn' narrative.  In fact, the S&M world explored by author E.L. James was actually rather hardcore, and this might surprise or disgust new readers.<br /><br />I will not be reading subsequent offerings in the trilogy.

0887307280|5.0|I have been immersed in the small business arena for many years.  As a Business Broker, I help to facilitate the sale of small businesses.  As the owner of my own small business, I understand the challenges faced by small business owners.  The EMyth Revisited was presented to me as a gift from my ActionCoach business coach.<br /><br />Gerber's book contains many break-through concepts that help an owner work on his/her business, rather than merely working in that business.  On page 41, Gerber cautions that \\"if all you want from a business of your own is the opportunity to do what you did before you started your business, get paid more for it, and have more freedom to come and go, your greed - I know that sounds harsh, but that's what it is - your self-indulgence will eventually consume both you and your business.\\"<br /><br />One break-through concept that really got me thinking was the idea that it is better to build lower-cost talent from within who will share your company's vision and learn a system, rather than pay up for professional management who come to your company with bad habits.<br /><br />The writing style, which features a conversation between Gerber and the owner of an overwhelmed pie shop who is on the verge of losing her business (and sanity), is an interesting way to present the material.  While the prose felt chopped up at time, overall I enjoyed the presentation and felt that it was an effective method to teach the material.<br /><br />Many of my business brokerage clients would benefit from the lessons of this book, improving their quality of life and maximizing the value of their businesses for re-sale.  Built incorrectly, a small business is no more than buying a job, and there will be no residual value upon that owner leaving the business.  Built under Gerber's suggested franchise model, a business becomes much more than a job or the personality of the owner.<br /><br />The EMyth Revisited is one of the best business books that I have ever read.  I highly recommend it to any person involved in the small business arena (owner, banker, consultant, family).  It could change your life for the better.d.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|My son and I both absolutely love this game.  My son loves zombies so we have almost every game with zombies that is available for kindle fire.  This one leaves them all in the dust.  Its actually not just the best zombie game, its the best game ive found for my fire period.  When you start the game you get to choose whether you want to play as the heroes or as the zombies.  I loved this game back when there was only one mode, so I was thrilled with this new way to play being added.
B0000062Y2|3.0|I still have my original LP of the 1970 London Cast recording, and remember every word. I have a CD version of that album. I've seen it preformed on stage with some of the original cast. I own at least four other versions of stage and CD productions. I also love the movie, so I thought I'd order the movie soundtrack CD.  I've listened to it several times through in my car (which has a really nice sound system) and I'm disappointed.  It's not the voices, it's only sort of the recording quality - it's that almost every singer is doing that thing where they are not with the music in order to try to be more dramatic.  I have sung and accompanied many musicals so the musician in me hates this - it's hard for me to listen to and sing along with when they don't keep up with the timing.  The overall quality of the music and singing just isn't up to the original standard - and maybe since that's what I've listened to for 40 years that's what I think it should sound like.  So be aware that the soundtrack is just not the same - it's not necessarily a bad thing, it just is.
0316069434|3.0|I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly in general (let us pass quietly over the execrable Nine Dragons and move on...) and this book is not a huge let-down.  The disappointment for me was the banality of the original crime which led to the murder.  I was hoping for something a bit more conspiratorial. A pleasant enough way to pass a couple of hours while travelling though...
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I can understand how some may have been confused by what was going on but I loved the way the author was able to intertwine and weave these stories together. Great story about numerous triumphs in the face of defeat

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I picked up this book expecting a primer on how to get my kids to perform better in school. The author gives so much more. He gave me a much better understanding of the challenges facing kids who live in poverty and other desperate circumstances. Most interesting were the points about the difference in development between kids who were nurtured in infancy vs kids who were not, and how caregivers, mentors and educators can actually help reverse the adverse effects later on. It did also make me realize how the \\"successful\\" kids in my orbit take the safety net their parents provide for granted, and how their success, in relative terms, is almost guaranteed. It has made me rethink my narrow definition of success for my children and, as a result, a much more optimistic outlook on their future.

B002WY65VU|4.0|As the typical viewer will tell you, this is not a movie for children. I probably could not show this to someone under 15 or 16 even with parental supervision, but I'm a bit old-fashioned in that regard. LOL. Zombieland is a movie about individuals living in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-ridden world - where the characters are each named for the town he or she hails from. There's blood and guts, but also a heaping helping of humor from a very serviceable cast. Woody Harrelson steals the show, as well as a cameo by Bill Murray...I can't really say the younger actors are amazing, and I still prefer Shaun of the Dead due to its wit. Some of the lines here are great (\\"Double Tap\\", anyone?), but I can't help but feel it's almost too lighthearted. In Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg realistically mourns the loss of his loved ones; here, we only get a glimpse of that from the main characters. And even with that glimpse, it's almost a parody of itself, which is a little weird for me.<br /><br />Of course, this is still a movie worth owning, or at the very least renting for a nice night with friends or a loved one who has some tolerance for gore. I still think Assassin in Love, Shaun of the Dead, Death to Smoochy, The Big Lebowski, etc. are all better dark comedies, although Zombieland is not far behind. Perhaps I just did not connect with the characters enough to warrant 5 stars and feel like there were certain things with the direction that could have been improved on. Maybe we will see a sequel in the near future, and hopefully they will delve further in the characters so that I can care a little bit more about their fates.

B002GHHHP6|5.0|I have seen a lot of Mel Gibson movies over the years, and along with Braveheart, I firmly believe this is him at his best. He's a very different character here - a sly con artist and card shark. However, with a strong supporting cast and some very witty lines, this movie comes together very nicely. This is not your typical short comedy, and it has a lot of plot mixed in with sub-plots...James Coburn, Jodi Foster, James Garner (the original Maverick, for those of you who do not know about the classic TV series), and Alfred Molina provide depth and an amazing cast. Paul L. Smith has a funny appearance as \\"the Archduke\\" (I recognized him from Haunted Honeymoon right away) and Graham Greene, who was in Thunderheart (one of Val Kilmer's best) and played a cop in Die Hard with a Vengeance, has a memorable role as a 'friend' of Maverick's.<br /><br />The dynamic between Foster and Gibson is excellent, as each cares about the other, but is similarly (or seemingly) most interested in winning a championship poker game - with its own hefty buy-in. Coming up with the money for the entrance into said tournament leads to a lot of funny scenes, and everything just clicks in this movie. The writing, directing, soundtrack, etc. are all very good, and this movie is sort of its own niche. There are not a ton of western comedies, to my knowledge, and this movie is just oozing with charm. Foster has seldom been sharper, save maybe Silence of the Lambs, Gibson has seldom been funnier, and the supporting crew is definitely one for the ages.

0880796863|4.0|For those who are more receptive to lighter coloring, this a very pretty deck. Unless you're going to be analyzing the colors in your readings, I do not see why the coloring matters outside of anesthetics. I've only used the deck a hand full of times over my (medium sized) illuminated deck but I love the detail that comes along with the size of this deck.<br /><br />However, it's the large size of the cards why I do not use them very often. They're a lot bigger than what I am accustom to (and I have rather large hands for a girl). If you're one that likes big details, and size in cards, and are also not bent on the differentiation of coloring, go for this deck! :] I went after this one specifically because I liked the colors. Google images of this deck of cards before you buy so you don't end up with something unintended!

B004T0E2S8|2.0|this app isn't nearly as good as the iphone version. WHERES THE PRO VERSION?? I love this app because it has one, but since it doesn't I'm gonna go cry in a corner.  PLEASE MAKE A PRO VERSION.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love this very traditional Christmas CD. Takes me back to growing up when the world was a little more simple, loving, and kind.  Thanks Rod Stewart for preserving the \\"sound\\" of Christmas so many of us remember.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Game says it is free, but you have to pay for more gems to continue. Therefore it is not really free at all.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I looked at it and it will be great for her, will love it.  Her daughter picked the color for her.
B000B7W01E|5.0|If you are an EST fan, a GD or PM fan or you like contemporary jazz music, you will love this two CD set. The MP3 deal is a tremendous value. The music is half studio, half live and all brilliant. Great variation in style and composition...I could go on and on but I don't need to because it's all in the music. Buy it, you won't regret it!<br />Addendum: The approximate 3 minutes of silence in the last song on the first album is  performance art, by a trio that specializes in the use of silence, space, and unique sound effects not unlike improvisational Grateful Dead jams or Pat Metheny Group songs such as Half Life of Absolution. What makes this compilation so great is having the live versions of some of these great tunes as well as the studio versions.
020530902X|5.0|This book has condensed spelling, grammar, and usage into a great reference.  It has been around for a long time.  I give copies to new administrative assistants and young professionals.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Everybody knows someone who's going through it, this book helps you understand the science, the journey,  and the history of cancer. Its an easy read that also delivers a TON of knowledge and insight. This book is brilliant; written like a story but an Encyclopedia of cancer at the same time. Genius!
1451695195|5.0|This book, made me think about alot of things that I never thought of before.<br />Very believeable trip to Heaven.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I was curious about this movie after I saw the trailer. The rent price was affordable and so my sister and I watched it. The movie was great including the hero, heroine, and the horse. The adventure and plot were on for a disney movie, and the ending was great. I would highly recommend this movie for the family, especially for Maximus (the horse).
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Rather than rehash how awesome the model is. Let me give you a few ideas and notes from my TWO experiences building the Death Star. Yup, I built one that didn't survive a home move - so, I've just rebuilt it.<br /><br />The Build<br /><br />Build it with a kid - hopefully your own. My 5-year-old and I built the second one. With guidance, he's able to actually be helpful. And, he asks a lot of questions about what parts are and why they are important. I love telling the stories as we build and watching a few clips.<br /><br />The Presentation<br /><br />A model like this deserves a great presentation. My first build was done inside a BiOrb (aquarium) and it was a challenge, but turned out really cool. The second build was displayed inside a terrarium from Exo-terra. The terrarium worked out much better. It has doors for easy access and interaction, and has space for the most important thing... A display turntable. Get one that can support about 7-10kg and has an AC adapter.<br /><br />Add-Ons<br /><br />If you have a little extra space in your display, the current christmas ornament mini models are a great scale and include a minifigure too! They can easily be suspended using fishing line. If you want a little ground display, I really like the Jabba's Palace and Desert Skiff remake. They don't quite fit in with the Death Star scenes, but they do compliment them to capture the best scenes of the trilogy.<br /><br />Minifigures<br /><br />Sorry, you're gonna have to shell out more cash to really make the most of your model. Get these: 4-6 more Stormtroopers, more imperial officers, an extra Luke and Han in ST disguise, an extra Leia and Darth Vader, and a few others that you like. I added about a dozen more. Be careful that you get minis that match the style of 10188.<br /><br />Protection<br /><br />Don't let your pride and joy fade. Keep it out of direct sunlight. If you go the terrarium route, you'll get some UV protection from the glass.<br /><br />Enjoy! (I'll post pictures as soon as I can)t pictures as soon as I can)
B004JN1D2I|4.0|These books are absolutely incredibly written but having them altogether is slightly annoying. It's disheartening feeling like you've read for a really long time and seeing that you've only moved 1% of the way through the books. But I've just stopped looking at that % thing and I really can't complain.

B0025KVLS8|5.0|Love this!  I have it on record, but can't play it.  The CD rox and I love the pics inside.
0316227706|5.0|If you are a pet fan or a photography buff then this is something to take a look at...  If you enjoy both... It is a must buy.  I purchased this for a coffee table book and got a lot more than I expected.<br /><br />I was introduced to the book on one of the morning shows and thought it was an inventive idea, and had to look into it.  The faces of these animals shows a range from frighting to side splitting laughter.  But what I was not prepared for was the elegant photos that the author included.<br /><br />Some of the photos of the animals fully submerged were just breathtaking.  I will leave it at that and allow the new reader to see for themselves.<br /><br />This is a read I would encourage people to take in...
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I received this just in time for the concert in Columbus, OH.  Boy, was I excited!!!  First album in 11 yrs to be all new recordings.  They even played some of these songs at the concert.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I am going to add this book to my list of books that I must go back and read from time to time. Former girlfriend has been trying to get me to read his books a long time ago and I regret I did not read them sooner (I can be a stubborn fool sometimes).<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recall the story much, but I do remember this is one of those books that is going to make you sit back and think/reflect on your life. Pair this with The Alchemist and you got your self some great weekend reading.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is great to play just about anytime. You can do only one or two levels while waiting in line for something or for an appointment, or you can do multiple levels for hours. The wide range of difficulty is really nice too. One thing that does bother me somewhat is the hint availability, though. You start out with three hints, but considering the fact that this game has well over a thousand levels that really doesn't make sense. Of course, you can always get more hints, but only if you pay for them. I would much prefer getting three hints for every set of levels, or a system where you could earn more hints for every few levels you solve or something.

B000WTXCZO|5.0|I've loved listening to the original release for years, and this manages to improve on what I already thought was the best live rock album ever.  Favorite feature of this version:  the continuity between Whipping Post and Mountain Jam. On the original album, the fade out of Mountain Jam always struck me as a particularly cruel tease.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The world is really f*!ed up right now. And the problem is that was are too addicted to entertainment that is too brutal. I don't understand why people and children aren't more drawn to stories like [[ASIN:B009Z311TM Witch Lessons (Witch Lessons: Book I)]], where there the children are taught to better themselves and then the world.<br /><br />The point of the hunger games is not to be entertained by reading about children who are used as a death sport, and to stand back and say -\\"wow what an exciting story\\" and to condone this behavior. The point I see from this book is that we should not exploit humans in this society for the purpose of entertainment.<br /><br />So, I vent.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|Used to like her a lot, but with this album, her third stinker in a row, I'm done with her. DK used to do jazz and seemed to have a sense what works with her limited range, but the only word in the title of this album that needs to be changed is Glad to SAD. That's how I feel when I remember how good she used to be.<br /><br />Now, she is totally adrift from what she used to do so well and only sinks deeper in a sea of poor career choices. I am glad to have left Diana behind, and now when I want to hear a singer who touches my heart, I listen to Stacey Kent or Patricia Barber. They get it and have stayed true to their roots. As for Diana Krall-she is clueless about what originally made her so appealing. So sad.

0307387178|2.0|In the book \\"Into the Wild\\" Christopher McCandless leaves home to go into the Alaskan wilderness alone. As a hitchhiker on the road he worked many different areas, from McDonalds to the mill.As he works he meets strangers who help him on his journey and offer advice which in turn he ignores. After saying good bye to the last human contact he had he died alone in the wilderness. What stands out in my mind is although many know his trip is essentially a death wish they stay quiet and support him. I like that the boy completes his dream and reaches his goal to make it to Alaska. This reminds me of teenagers that do not know what life has in store for them,it is a lesson about reaching for your dreams no matter what others say. I did not like that he chased his dream, fulfill his goals, and then dies in the wilderness alone! The author is trying to convey to the readers that no matter where your from you can change your life by simply taking action and doing what you want to do. It is never to late to chase your dreams. I would recommend this book to people who think that they can not change what their life is now, people who think that no matter what they do they can not get what they want, and people who think their dreams are too hard to pursue. I would not recommend this<br />book to people who have lost someone in a tragic way.

B007STXHTM|4.0|Love the camera, hate that that there is no display to review the photos you are taking!  It takes awesome photos though, so<br />I can't complain too much and I think there is some type of LCD display you can attach to these now...
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|Once again gameloft screwed me out of gyroscopes control. And with no double tap this game is pointless. Just not going to bother with this company's games anymore. Deadspace and Badcompany are playable on kindles. Everything lags reguardless, but its wrong to downgrade a game just because its not on itunes.
B0028IDXDS|2.0|Just recieved it today and fell in love with it even more...In the picture provided by amazon it doesn't show just how beautiful the brown is on this cute little monkey...The only thing that is really disappointing is that the pacifier doesn't detach so when its time to replace it I'll have to get rid of the monkey as well :(

B005K17RU0|4.0|Using on a Kindle Fire 8.9. Looks great on a kindle.  Easy to navigate.  Main display provides a concise, complete overview of the current weather.  Only negative is that weather for current location fails.  May be a kindle issue, but if it is on the market, it should work.
B007CMD5AQ|4.0|I originally ripped this as 'Nowhere close to the quality of their [[ASIN:B001SGEUNI Halestorm]] debut, one of my favorite female rocker albums ever.'  But after multiple more listens, that may have been too harsh.  I was just expecting better after their awesome debut.  If not compared to that & just taken on its own merits, it's not bad.  But I still think they have better stuff in them.  Hopefully they'll combine the best of their 1st 2 for #3.  I also still recommend the \\"Deluxe\\" version for its 3 nice Bonus Tracks.

I have no idea why it is called Lorax, if you just remove this Lorax guy from the movie, there is no difference at all.<br />I have to say this is the worst animation movie I have seen for the last 10 years. Maybe just okay for toddler who is no more than 5 year's old.

B000002KHH|5.0|Out of the industrial sludge of Birmingham, England came the birth of a new monstrous musical genre.  [[ASIN:B000002KB8 Black Sabbath]], the bands eponymous debut was just the tip of the iceberg.  It would prove to be a harbinger of the heavier things to come.  Sabbath's sophomore effort, Paranoid, would become the break out record and put the original line-up on the map as well as pioneer a new flavor of rock music.<br /><br />To really appreciate Paranoid, one must consider the musical landscape at the time of its release.  Flower power pop, and psychedelic freak outs dominated the airwaves in the US.  Heavy rock music was still in an embryonic state.  Then from across the sea comes the gargantuan British goliath stomping its way along, demolishing cities in its wake, and converting fans to lifelong devotees.<br /><br />Being a metal fan is like being made in the mafia, you're in it for life.  True fans never outgrow it.  I first stumbled across my older brother's beaten up vinyl copy of Paranoid in the spring of 1988 at the age of 14.  Even then, two decades after its release, it still managed to blow my tiny high school freshman mind long before I would experiment with alcohol or pot.  I was instantly hooked.  It was intense and heavier than most of the hard rock I'd heard at that point.  The lyrics weren't all about partying and getting laid.  It was much deeper.<br /><br />War Pigs begins with all the subtlety of a fierce kick to the crotch.  The message of this song still resonates today as it did back when it was released at the height of the Vietnam War.  \\"Politicians hide themselves away.  They only started the war.  Why should they go out to fight?  They leave that up to the poor.\\"  Tony Iommi's doom laden riffs give way to a stunning guitar solo with Geezer Butler's fat bottom bass and Bill Ward's percussion work making for a killer middle section.  War Pigs was supposed to be the title of the album, but executives at Warner Brothers shot down the idea as they felt it hit a little too close to home with the war and all going on.  That would explain the guy on the album cover in the pink suit with the sword and shield.  For a long time I used to think it was Iommi dressed as a \\"war pig\\".  The cover art is the only weak point of the disc.<br /><br />Reportedly written while stoned on reefer in a matter of minutes to fill some space on the album, the title track, Paranoid, would become the band's signature song.  Paranoid's lyrics' are all too familiar to anyone who has ever repeatedly indulged in the heathen devil weed.<br /><br />Fire up and dig the groovy bongos as you blast off for the stars and join the Planet Caravan.  This mellow (dare I say soft) atmospheric tune is about tripping through the galaxy with your lover.  Osbourne's heavily flanged and reverbed voice sounds nothing like the Ozzy we know today.  Tony stretches out on the solo and shows off his jazz chops.<br /><br />What can I write about Iron Man that hasn't already been said?  The first riff every kid learns when he picks up an electric guitar is Smoke on the water...  The second is Iron Man.  Why?  The riff is simply legendary.  I used to think it was about the Marvel comics' super hero going bad, but that is not the case.  Sabbath's Iron Man isn't wearing a suit of armor.  He's transformed into an \\"iron bloke\\" by a magnetic field and decides he's hungry for a cold dish of vengeance.  Tony Stark is too busy counting his money and getting loaded to harm innocent civilians.<br /><br />Remember the cold war?  Ever think of what would have happened if Russia or the US decided to push the button?  Bassist/Lyricist Geezer Butler believed it would all end in an Electric Funeral Pyre.  \\"Turns houses into sty.  Turns people into clay.  Radiation minds decay.\\"  These are some of the most haunting lyrics about nuclear Armageddon I've ever heard.  Iommi menacingly mocks you with his wicked wah wah pedal driven lead.  The players embark on a frantic race to the grave as Ozzy chants, \\"Electric Funeral.  Electric Funeral.\\"<br /><br />What would rock music be without drug use?  It would be awfully boring.  Hand of Doom addresses what would become epidemic abuse of Heroin in the 1970s.  None of the members of Sabbath are known junkies.  We know they were big into marijuana, alcohol, and later, coke.  However, they had to have been around plenty of people that liked to \\"Push the needle in.\\"  A mellow Butler buttermilk bass line underscores this cautionary tale, and then the rest of the band comes crashing in like a wrecking ball.<br /><br />Rat Salad is a two minute and thirty second instrumental that features Bill Ward's acrobatic drumming.  This guy is seriously underrated in the pantheon of great drummers.  Moon, Bonham, and Peart all get their props and recognition; but Bill Ward deserves some serious consideration to be on the Mount Rushmore of awesome rock drummers.<br /><br />\\"Salad\\" serves as the entr&eacute;e for the final dish of this masterpiece.  The title, Fairies Wear Boots, refers to a gang of Doc Martin wearing skinhead a-holes that the band and crew brawled with at a gig.  With the exception of the chorus, the lyrics have nothing to do with said title.  Did I mention that these guys liked to smoke a lot of dope back then?  I digress.  Iommi jams out the intro while Butler and Ward provide a cool swing beat.  \\"Fairies\\" concludes the album with a piercing arpeggio fade out.<br /><br />There it is folks.  War, insanity, space exploration, revenge, nuclear fallout, and drug abuse....that's what Paranoid is all about.  If you want uplifting songs, go spin up some Abba.  This is music for real (mostly) men with problems that have a hard time seeing life through rose colored glasses.  I still love Paranoid all these years later because it is a timeless classic.<br /><br />Paranoid is an absolute stone cold must have for any metal fan.  If you want to hear where it all started, then you need to add Paranoid to your collection.he grave as Ozzy chants, \\"Electric Funeral.  Electric Funeral.\\"<br /><br />What would rock music be without drug use?  It would be awfully boring.  Hand of Doom addresses what would become epidemic abuse of Heroin in the 1970s.  None of the members of Sabbath are known junkies.  We know they were big into marijuana, alcohol, and later, coke.  However, they had to have been around plenty of people that liked to \\"Push the needle in.\\"  A mellow Butler buttermilk bass line underscores this cautionary tale, and then the rest of the band comes crashing in like a wrecking ball.<br /><br />Rat Salad is a two minute and thirty second instrumental that features Bill Ward's acrobatic drumming.  This guy is seriously underrated in the pantheon of great drummers.  Moon, Bonham, and Peart all get their props and recognition; but Bill Ward deserves some serious consideration to be on the Mount Rushmore of awesome rock drummers.<br /><br />\\"Salad\\" serves as the entrée for the final dish of this masterpiece.  The title, Fairies Wear Boots, refers to a gang of Doc Martin wearing skinhead a-holes that the band and crew brawled with at a gig.  With the exception of the chorus, the lyrics have nothing to do with said title.  Did I mention that these guys liked to smoke a lot of dope back then?  I digress.  Iommi jams out the intro while Butler and Ward provide a cool swing beat.  \\"Fairies\\" concludes the album with a piercing arpeggio fade out.<br /><br />There it is folks.  War, insanity, space exploration, revenge, nuclear fallout, and drug abuse....that's what Paranoid is all about.  If you want uplifting songs, go spin up some Abba.  This is music for real (mostly) men with problems that have a hard time seeing life through rose colored glasses.  I still love Paranoid all these years later because it is a timeless classic.<br /><br />Paranoid is an absolute stone cold must have for any metal fan.  If you want to hear where it all started, then you need to add Paranoid to your collection.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I was really hesitant to purchase this album. I saw her poor performance on SNL and had no interest in her at all. Then I read a review of her album that mentioned how it's more of a cinematic sound than a regular album. When I kept this in mind, I really enjoyed her album. Don't listen if you are looking for something you'd find on the radio, listen if you're looking for something atmospheric.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game for all ages love the ease of playing the cards and the colors are bright and clear also lots of options
B00280LYIC|5.0|The book was amazing! Well written and addictive. I couldn't put it down. The use of old stories and the modern world to create such a unique tale was captivating. I can't wait  to start on the next book.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I would recommend this case. It is lightweight and fits perfectly. It is easy to put on the kindle and is very sturdy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|the game was fun and had great graphics.  the puzzles were cool and made you think.  I would highly recommend this game
B00005JM02|5.0|I love this movie as does my three and four year old sons.  A great story and the animation is superb!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|It is nice that the movie comes in both the colorized and original black and white versions so people can make the choice of which one they would rather watch.<br />I still prefer it in black and white over color any day, this is one of my favorites!
0811879542|5.0|This book was recommended to us by an librarian.  My three and four year old boys love this as its simple, and interactive.  A good gift for a preschooler.
B008NR91NO|5.0|Vision divine is largely under rated.  I prefer their albums with Michael luppi as he doesn't have that strong accent that Fabio has.  That being said this is one of Fabios better performances.  I think his work with kamelot has improved his pronunciation.  This is another concept album this time going towards a scifi story line.  Not as good as 25th hour, Stream, or Perfect Machine but interesting enough.  Check out Kamelot's new one \\"silverthorn\\" for the concept album of the year.  Anyway this is definately worth getting if your are into this type of music.  Pick up their back catelog as well if you haven't already.  Also Michelle Luppi is now the singer for Secret Sphere \\"Portrait of a Dying Heart\\" which is quiet good as well.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my parents who love Tony Bennett and easy listening songs.  This is a great CD that anyone would enjoy.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I love this movie! Used to watch it with my mom all of the time when I was younger. Haven't been able to find it, but it came right up on here!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I'm not sure how you can not give The Lion King a five star rating?  This is a classic, liked by all, and truly a great film.  The animation is superb!
1419705849|5.0|My son loves this whole series, so we had to pick this one up too! Price was well below that of our local stores, would highly recommend ordering from here instead.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this show. So glad to now have it on video.<br />I would recommend this show to anyone who likes<br />series.
B0015FML06|1.0|I'm sure this package is brilliant. The album always got thrashed at parties back in the day. I've heard good things about the DVD. In fact it was all the good things I've heard that prompted me to order it. Good price too. I've been waiting since October (arrived). Everyday as 11 o'clock tick tocks by I wait for our postie Gloria to make this delivery. How long, how long must I wait for these songs? Then, I can't believe the news I got today, an e-mail from Amazon.com asking me had the item come my way. Could I review this product. Did it meet my requirements. Is that all?. Well that sent me out of control and I had a cry for a few seconds and as it nears twilight here I guess the answer would have to be, with a shout, an emphatic and resounding NO as I still haven't been sent the album I was looking for. It's Christmas too, a time to rejoice, but not here, no U2 to play on Christmas Day, much less New Years Day.  Boy, do I feel like throwing a brick through a window. Maybe it will come Tomorrow.
1933771690|4.0|I have finished reading this small book (224 pages) by Robert Lanza for the second time, and I thought it was an interesting read (and quite an easy-to-read at that!), but it contained no original ideas/thoughts as basically what the author was saying is nothing new, so to speak. It is written in a first-person perspective (Lanza's, I'm just not clear where Berman is involved).<br /><br />I've sought out this book after reading Lanza's article, \\"Does The Past Exist Yet? Evidence Suggests Your Past Isn't Set in Stone,\\" on Huffington Post a while back as I was quite looking forward to reading his book. But, the experiments that were discussed in this book - I have read elsewhere, especially Double-Slit Experiment and the observer-observed phenomenon to which the author built and based his theory on. Lanza proposes this new theory called \\"Biocentrism,\\" which basically revealed a view that \\"life creates the universe rather than the other way around\\" by placing biology above all other sciences. In this book, the author use this theory to offer insights or to make sense \\"of aspects of biological and physical science that are currently insensible\\" (p. 195).<br /><br />In his theory of biocentrism, Lanza gave seven principles, which were discussed in detail with many examples/experiments, and it also included background stories from the author's personal life. In his last chapter, Lanza proposed for future experiments to either support or contradict his \\"theory.\\"<br /><br />The book is a fascinating read and thought-provoking, but there is nothing new in this book in regards to scientific experiments. I think the author could have conducted his own experiments to prove or disprove his own theory rather than having someone else to do it for him, or so I thought.
1401322786|5.0|Dear Amazon,<br /><br />This edition of The Time Keeper was in excellent condition. I enjoyed reading it from cover to cover. Thanks for allowing me to delve into my love for Mitch Albom through literature. Thanks.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Jade
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only see the first 10 posts and the rest are in a weird format also can't scroll to find older posts and no option to choose most recent or top stories.  Very annoying
B0096CDG0O|5.0|This game is just like yatzee except you take turns with your friends or a buddy they connect you up with.  Its easy to stick with this game especially when you don't have a lot of time. Your turn is quick and doesn't require a lot of thinking which helps to move it right along. If you like to play yatzee, you will like this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story was amazing,heart wrenching,one of the best books I've  ever read. I am completely hooked an  can't wait to see what the next book holds with katniss and Peta an  gale.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have had so much trouble with this app since it updated. It is worthless to me now. I am no longer able to check email on yahoo with my Kindle Fire. It wont delete in bulk at all and wants to &quot;foreclose&quot; halfway through and email. I have tried to delete and redownload and it repeats the same thing. I loved the old app and had no issues. This is beyond frustrating. PLEASE FIX THIS YAHOO!!
B005VPRF0M|5.0|Thanks for a great product at a great price. I purchased this for my grandson's Birthday and it was delivered as expected and he loved the legos.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I really enjoy the dark knight rises movie. The disk and everything else seems to be in perfect working order.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|this is one of bbc greats' actors are wonderful not one is out of place in this series.would have been intersting to live in this era
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I did not get past the first 3 chapters.  This book was so slow to start.  I was so looking forward to this book.  It sounded great in the synopsis.  This was not the case very boring and long to get started, then I gave up.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|GOOD ACTING GREAT CAST CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT SEASON NEVER HAD SEEN THESE ACTORS BEFORE SURE WAS GALD MY SISTER TOLD ME ABOUT THE SHOW
0877180121|4.0|If you are a piano teacher then this book will help little kids learn. If you are a parent with little music knowledge this will not help you teach your children the piano.  I can read music and bought this to help teach my daughter.  It helped me remember notes and play songs but it did not help me explain it to my daughter.  She needs a piano teacher!!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Although this is my least favorite season, there are some really neat parts that make it totally worth it, and the dvd itself came in great condition.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is quite fun. It's very similar world of warcraft give or take a few things. There are a few glitches such as not being able to move forward after crafting a few items but it's easy to make these glitches go away. This game has only crashed on me once so stability is decent. Can use some optimization, but is pretty good for a full fledged mmorpg on a tablet device. Five stars from me.
B007PPE086|5.0|This came in perfect condition and was a really neat piece to add to my collection. I'd suggest it to any MH fan.
0307742997|2.0|&#34;The Snowman&#34;  was much too gory for my taste. If you can suffer the sadism depicted in the book, you will find a well constructed murder mystery novel.
0439334632|5.0|It was just how I remembered back when I originally got it as a kid at Border's. The book was in great condition and a fun read.
0307386171|5.0|This novel is about love ruined by polite, prim manners and a lack of communication at a time when the sexual revolution of the sixties was just beginning. Being born around the time the protagonist were born, I can relate to that time. Beautifully written.
B00447L4JG|5.0|good product and fast shipping
B000S6MF7M|2.0|I believe I was looking for something different. This book did not fill my expectations. The studies that were completed were not the type of studies I expected from this book. I had to makes notes and take very short  tests and answer questions. Not for me. To involved; I felt I should have been in a classroom taking this as extracurricular for credits.
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|The vinyl collectors have to have one! The quality of vinyl and the quality of songs in a perfect compination.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I absolutely love the son &#34;The River&#34; which is not played on many radio stations.  So happy to have my own copy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun app.you need to get it to have fun.I would surely recommend it to all of u.fun fun fun
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This is just as good as I thought it would be! I'm very impressed. I'm looking forward to more from Phillip Phillips.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to say that I get to read some pretty amazing books, but every once in a while I get to read something that really grabs me. You know what I mean? The kind of book that you can't stop thinking about for days, weeks, months. Yeah, well this is one of those books for me. I can tell you that HOPELESS is in my Top Five favorite books of this year. I can tell you that Colleen Hoover has written yet another heart gripping story. I can tell you...that you will want to read this book.<br /><br />Now, maybe I had a disadvantage, I don't know, but I watched the story come to life. I got to fall in love with the characters as they were written. It's such an incredible process to watch. Sky and Holder quickly became a part of my life, my heart, and my mind.<br /><br />For me, Sky was the kind of character that I immediately liked. She's funny, sarcastic, intelligent, and strong. Gosh is she strong. I understood her and the way she thinks. Now as the story developed, my heart broke for her. However, her resilience was inspiring.<br /><br />Dean Holder...be still my heart. I'll tell you what, Holder is without a doubt one of the best book boys I've read about. Holder is complex, loving, temperamental, and selfless. He's a fixer, a problem solver and is very passionate about those that he loves. When Holder entered the scene, I knew right away that there was something special about him. He comes off a bit gruff at first, but as you get to know him, you see the truly caring person that he is.<br /><br />I almost can't write about Sky and Holder individually, because they truly are a couple. In every sense. They compliment each other well and the connection they share is undeniable.  Holder respected the boundaries that Sky had. He knew not to push her too far, but he also pushed enough to help her get through. Does that make sense? Watching them discover Sky's past, well...I was a mess. I mean, I was snotty nose crying. It was tough watching Sky reveal the truth about her past, but Holder was by her side every step of the way.<br /><br />This is a hard review to write because I don't want to give any clues, hints, or tips about what happens in the story. Just know this, it's intense, highly emotionally charged, steamy, and breathtaking. I cannot recommend this book enough. Colleen Hoover is without a doubt, one of the most truly gifted authors that I've read. HOPELESS will forever be ingrained in my heart.st, but Holder was by her side every step of the way.<br /><br />This is a hard review to write because I don't want to give any clues, hints, or tips about what happens in the story.

B0034G4P7G|1.0|I ordered it for a group event. However, after reviewing it, realized it would be inappropriate for professional use due to language.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is one of the most informative documentaries I have ever seen. All of my questions about what happened when it happened how it happened and whose fault it was, were answered. Any misinformed fox veiwers should see this movie.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|I love the movie There Will Be Blood. i purchased this and i could not be happier with the short time it took to receive the movie. The price was fair and the quality was wonderful.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Aside from the premise, there's not much of a plot.  On top of that, it's a lot of two characters saying they want one thing (badly) and clearly meaning something else.  There's no tension, romantic or otherwise.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Not very useful, it was too big when plugging a decent headphone port. Next time do not buy a recommend portable amplifier.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this for my kindle fire and I absolutely love it. The graphics have a nice fluidity to them and I really enjoy the one-click option they give you in the settings menu.  I have also downloaded spider solitaire from this developer and I am happy with that as well.  I definitely recommend the download.
B008I15774|3.0|Here is another victim of computerized copying of LPs. Schuricht's rendering of Bruckner's 8th symphony with the Vienna philharmonic is one of the most beautiful on record. One of its assets was how he exploited the beauty of the sound of the Vienna philharmonic. In this rendition most of that is gone. The previous EMI rendition had kept part of the beautiful sound but took out the sharpness and violence of the interpretation. Clarity was replaced by cotton. In this rendition the sharpness is again intact but the beauty of the sound has gone, it has lost is color and roundness. The sound has even become dry and harsh, and has lost most of its light. It nevertheless remains beautiful music. A wild and soft, anxious and violent Bruckner.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Cant paste but still okay when u put pictures it dosent put it in on the note it puts it at the very bottom of the note
B00A861QMM|2.0|There is SOOOOOO MUCH dialogue,  which usually doesn't bother me. However,  the spoken dialogue does not match the written words!  Very distracting. And there is SO MUCH OF IT!  But the game itself is not good. I didn't buy it,  just played the free part,  and I really have no idea of the storyline!  Plus,  the items do not always respond.  Needs complete overhaul!
B008S80OU2|5.0|At last,a complete set of Cult albums beautifully presented.The big selling point is that they are re-mastered,much needed on some of the albums,particularly Fire of Unknown Origin,which always had a dull production sound.Everybody has their particular favourite album of course,mine being Cultosaurus Erectus.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Great graphics,  and you can choose to play a &quot;match game &quot; instead of the hidden object games. Perfect for me (hate HOG!)  Also like the little helper,  Miles the monkey!  I recommend this game. Enough help if you need it,  but can be played without it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Replaced my tablet for an e reader so glad I did. The fire does everything I need it too even browsing the web and editing documents. Way easier to use, and with my prime membership I get a free book every month, along with movie streaming.<br /><br />Only complaint. They give you the USB to charge it but no charging block. I had to use the one for my phone.
160774273X|5.0|Like others here, I am also a disciple of Peter Reinhart, Jim Lahey, Pascal Rigo and Carol Field. There is so much to be gained from all of them. Yet, no one ties it all together more succinctly, clearly and walks you through the bread baking process as throughly than Ken Forkish in, \\"Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast.\\" His directions are easy to follow and if you are left with the slightest confusion, take a look at the online videos where he sensibly demonstrates and elaborates on the steps. I have been a devotee of Ken's Artisan Bakery since he first opened in Portland and am thrilled that this book illustrates how to create such fine loaves at home. This is no ordinary \\"cook book,\\" as the background information is essential to understanding the process. Ken Forkish presents an appropriate measure of understanding ingredients, materials and technique to properly enlighten the home baker. After cracking this book and getting my hands into the biga and dough, I was amazed at the results with my first attempt. Follow the directions and you can't loose.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|There are so many more interesting premises that could serve as the core for a sci fi movie, why this?  I am not usually put off by science fiction, fantasy and/or violence, but the absurdity and evil of randomly selected teens to fight to the death every year for 75 years in some futuristic totalitarian society's version of the Roman coliseum was too over the top for me.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Great album.Can't wait for part 2<br />Taylor has everything from song writing to writing of books.<br />Pantera is my all time fav. band but slipknot & sour are next.
B00632HWOG|1.0|The app continuously crashes.  Can't read my mail. No problem with the old app. This app is aweful. Hate it.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|and that is what I got.  I don't like watching any of Seth Mcfarlane's tv shows, but my bf loves them,so based on that and the few previews I did see made the movie look pretty funny, so what the hey, right?  Well, just repeating a lot of what I saw in the other reviews, all the funny parts are in the previews.  It was an ok movie, but I think it could've been a lot funnier.  The scenes (and I don't wanna spoil it) where they meet the hero of their childhood was pretty good, but other than that, just kinda blah... Btw, the bf who, again, is a huge Seth Mcfarlane fan,also didn't think too highly of it either, if that is worth it to any other SM fan, who is trying to decide whether to buy/rent this movie.
0671502484|5.0|This book was a steal for how big it is and that it was a hard cover! I started reading it in the library and since it has so many requests on it I haven't been able to finish it. If you have any interest in the history of oil this is a great book and told in such a way as to not completely bog you down in the nitty gritty details. The photos in the middle sections of the book are great too.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Really a well-done 'he-dunnit - but will they prove it' mystery. Hopkins was amazing. It made my flight from Dallas to SF painless!
B0087DIEGE|5.0|Works perfect. Should have been a part of the camera, but since not this add on does the trick. Would not want to be without it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Absolutely absorbing, kept my attention all the way through. I loved the ending, it makes you think about the human mind. What would you do in the same situation.
B00003CXRM|5.0|My husband had never seen &#34;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&#34;.  His sister and I are always making movie references.  He loved the movie and gets our references now.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Got this cd for my girlfriends mother and i hope she loves it because she is in love with this cd
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|the best thing out of this transaction is the person who shipped the DVD to my house - inclosed came a personal note of thanks and a phone number to call if there were any problems - it was good doing business Randy's DVD Place - the personal note with his phone number was really nice to know. Thanks
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I thought this game would be cute as it required forethought, planning, and creativity. But it takes up too much time and memory on the device. I don't have time to return to the game repeatedly to feed the animals in order to win points to move on. So I deleted it.
0525953728|2.0|was not especially a good read - sounded more of a political agenda type book - Military person should be able to see right through this - some of the information may be true but I am sure not totally accurate - but I do understand how frustrated my brothers can be with some of the reasoning for what you have been set out to do - but if the reasoning is to make money for the families who have suffered, this is a great book to buy because the proceeds are to go to the victims family and that right there makes the book right as rain - and that is only if the families get the money and not down the rabbit whole of no return
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I enjoyed the amercanized version but this original import is lightyears better in the acting department. The deadpans and hilarity of the doped up character are funnier than in the americanize version. :)
B008602KQI|5.0|I initially read the books because my daughter asked me to.  I didn't expect to enjoy the series or the movie, but I found a lot to appreciate in both.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I didn't go see this in the theatres when it was released back in 2005.<br />All the TV previews showed all the supernatural shenanigans and I judged it based sorely on those thinking it was another silly Exorcist rip-off.<br />This isn't The Exorcist or some other cheap knock off. It isn't even about horror or gore or some supernatural spectacle. This is more of a court room drama with some fringe creeps that makes it unique. The performances are pretty good all around and the film does have a few good creepy moments. It surprised me how effective the unseen creepy parts crept up on me. You'll know when you get to that moment, just be sure to grow some nads and watch it late at night. Enjoy!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I mostly use these exclusively for gaming on my PC. The surround sound is noticeably better than the standard speakers on my monitor. Unfortunately, I do not have a previous surround sound setup on my computer, nor a previous PC headset to compare sound quality. Nevertheless, I've been satisfied with the sound.<br /><br />When I am gaming online with my friends and family, we typically use TeamSpeak for communication and this has performed as expected. Others can understand me without difficulty and I have no problem hearing others during our TeamSpeak sessions.<br /><br />Comfort-wise, they are a little tight on my head compared to my [[ASIN:B007W5J0S4 Turtle Beach Ear Force X41 Gaming Headset - CA1714]] for the xbox 360. On the other hand, it's snug enough that I can look down without the headset falling off my head whereas the X41's will begin to slip as I look towards the floor.<br /><br />The auto mute when the mic is up is a nice feature and makes me wish my X41's could do the same. Other notable features include a notification beep when battery is low and continuous usage while the headset is charging.<br /><br />My only disappointment after a year of owning the G930 is the lack of a storage stand like the X41.<br /><br />The logitech software for the G930 is decent, it displays the current battery status along along some voice morphing capabilities. Honestly, I haven't felt the need to use the voice morphing aside from some amusement during some downtime in games. This is also where the three buttons on the left cuff can be assigned a predetermined function specified from a drop down list, but I have yet to find a decent use for them based on the available list.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase and I do not have a problem recommending this to any of my friends or family. For me, the G930s meet the standards that I've come to expect from Logitech.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|I remember seeing this film years ago and it giving me the heebee jeebees after watching it. I lived out in the wilderness/country during that time. Watching it recently it still does have some creepiness to it but it does leave quite a few unresolved questions.    *Those aliens must have been really bored to take the time to fly millions of lightyears through the vacuum of space just to come and poke some guy's eye out. Unless there was some unspeakable horrors that took place after the eye poking incident.    **And just to be clear, I never read the book that was written by Travis Walton. If he wrote in that book about being ass-raped by Aliens than yeah.... it was horrific.\\"
1579128149|5.0|This is a stunning book...beautiful photos...well done.  It is a Christmas gift for a young man that is enthralled with the periodic table.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|what the hell is there not to like about south park, and now in a monopoly version. HELL YESS is what i have to say to that.<br /><br />And the delivery was really fast which makes it a plus
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The Ice Age Village app is soooo amazing!!!! I am truly addicted to it!!! Play it day and night!!! If u don't have it, get it!!! NOW!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I purchased this book for a recent trip and really enjoyed it.  It is fairly light reading, but interesting enough to keep your interest for the rest of the story.  Liked it a lot!
B009YJEKJK|1.0|John Travolta can't sing. All he does is talk and slightly change pitch. How this even got on CD is beyond my understanding. Maybe for comedy?
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great Movie!!  It's funny and the kids loved it too.  I would recommend for any age to watch this movie.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The facebook pop-ups are annoying. If I wanted to be on facebook, I would be. Stop asking me to log in.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I really like this app. A huge help keeping my life organized. I would give it five stars but it would be nice to have undo/redo buttons when formatting text. Also, I couldn't find a way on how to password protect my notes on my desktop and Kindle. I was only able to lock the app on my smartphone.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|I'm a relative newcomer to The Gaslight Anthem after discovering them back in January. It didn't take me long to purchase their entire catalogue and wait with anticipation for this album. The wait was worth every second and the result is a mature, sophisticated record that will hopefully give this group the mainstream attention they deserve. Why \\"45\\" wasn't a massive summertime hit is beyond me, and the rest of the album is equally incredible. Brian Fallon is quickly becoming one of my favorite songwriters and here he trades the storytelling of past records for a more personal viewpoint. It gives new life and heart to these tunes, especially on the tracks \\"Handwritten\\", \\"Keepsake\\", and \\"Too Much Blood\\", where Fallon paints a vivid picture of his life and experiences that we all can relate to. This is where The Gaslight Anthem really shines: they're ordinary guys like the rest of us and their working-man mentality makes them instantly relatable and likable.<br /><br />Handwritten features a heavier dose of southern rock and blues than previous releases, yet their punk roots are still firmly in place with the tracks \\"Howl\\" and \\"Desire\\". \\"Here Comes My Man\\" finds Fallon writing from a female perspective, making it one of the most unique and effective songs he's ever penned. The closer \\"National Anthem\\" is gorgeous and haunting, not to mention that \\"Mae\\" is a hidden gem that will likely go down as one of their finest compositions.<br /><br />This album is one of their best to date and certainly a strong contender for the best record of the year. This is a terrific band in peak form and I can't wait to see where they go from here. I'm just thankful they're allowing us to go along for the ride.

B00846REIS|1.0|Poor attempt at copying Fifty Shades.  Language is insulting and story has too perfect characters who make it equally unbelievable.  Truly poor writing.
1419701533|5.0|I purchased these books for my first grade student after his teacher said that he was reading well ahead of his grade level. He loves them! He has now read every single one of these books and I just bought them not too long ago! Very pleased with this purchase.
B0013ANMWY|3.0|Theme has been done several times before and with more suspense and less gore. Movie strayed completely from original work it was based on (which was, wait for it: a book, not nother movie)
1400052181|5.0|This book is fascinating and heartbreaking all at once. I don't read much science/technoloy books just occasional articles on the topic that interest me in the Economist. I've never heard of Hela cells but I am very interested in the ethics and consequences of biotechnology such as \\"designer babies\\" etc. This book explores the ethical ramifications of biotechnology through the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. This books is about science, history, race-relations in America, and ethics of technological advances in genetics, etc. The author is a great story-teller and does an excellent job of explaining biotechnology to reader who don't have science backgrounds. She's brutally honest about the family history and their ordeal over the past few decades. I highly reccommend this book, in fact, I couldn't put it down and I would like to read more books like this.

B004QWKIYQ|5.0|Doo-Wops & Hooligans performance was outstanding.  The band know how to connect with the audience as well and Bruno voice, well let me say this &#34;embrace yourself.. You will be more than impress with this CD. Yes I would recommend it for you teenage daughters as well.  This CD set the stage of what his next CD will be.
B007RTAR64|3.0|Ordered this doll along with a few other items (all presents for others), and I opened the box to find everything stacked haphazardly on top of each other. The Katniss doll looks pretty nice (though there's a weird, though subtle, mark on her face that must have gotten there before she was packaged in her box)... The main issue was that the BOX itself was torn and bent where it reads \\"BARBIE® COLLECTOR BLACK LABEL\\" on the bottom and looks awful and cheap as a result.<br /><br />This might not matter to most people, but I bought this Barbie for an avid collector who has no intention of taking her out of the box, which means it's important that the box look as pristine as possible. The plastic of the box is also scratched from interaction with other items during shipment, and is covered in fingerprints as well.<br /><br />Come on, Amazon. Please put a little more effort into how you package grouped items. I'll be returning this and PRAYING that I can get another one in better \\"boxed\\" condition, since it'll be the only item in the box.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|This film was engrossing from start to finish. Michael Shannon's acting just blew me away, and the rest of the cast did superb as well. The special effects of the ominous swirling storm were incredible as well. I have recommended this movie to every friend, coworker and family member I could, which is something I rarely do!!!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This cover is attractive, functional and perfect for my needs.  Love the cover and the Kindle Fire. I highly recommend it.
0446580848|1.0|Whatever happened to the talented Nelson DeMille?  The Panther is by far his low point having begun at the heights with masterpieces such as Word of Honor and The Charm School.  Then it seems he realized that he could do what others did - create a \\"character\\" and start a series.  The problem is that John Corey is a rude, insipid boor with a cynic's brain and minimal ability to act with any maturity. I regret having paid money to be harassed by what I'm sure DeMille feels is \\"wit\\" but is embarrassing and adolescent.  This book is wanting in every respect and fails in any definition of literature. I'm certain it plays to an audience which applauds insolence and cynicism and that at least will assure DeMille of food on the table - but there must be other things he can do to eat.  What a shame about Nelson DeMille's passing - from excellence to mediocrity.  Save your money!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|simply awesome!!! so useful, easy to use and share info.with my spouse ( like honey-do lists etc) we both love it. highly suggest using evernote.
B0059XTU1S|3.0|I am not a huge Tolkein fan or Jackson fan. I didn't read the book and only saw LOTR twice in the last ten years, so this is a Jane Q. Public point of view.<br /><br />My first impression of the movie was that it was beautiful. The settings are eye popping, lush, interesting, well lit, well costumed, and over all well done. Each scene looks like a piece of art. The colors found in the movie aren't found in nature. They are crafted to set a tone. The effect is beautiful, but not at all lifelike. But it's a fantasy, right? So who cares?<br /><br />Then you sink into the story and realize that there isn't that much of it. There are a LOT of characters. With the exception of Bilbo, Galdalf, and Gollum, they have very few lines so you don't get much of a sense of who they are. There is no reason to root for them or care about their journey. There is a lot of fighting, running, and more fighting. Not a whole lot actually happens in almost 3 hours.<br /><br />I had heard that the book is fully of singing and silly dwarfs. This isn't really portrayed in the movie. I was hoping it would be. There is a scene where they are in Bilbo's house where they sing and are goofy, but then they aren't. They were rude, loud, and ill-mannered before that and fighting after that, so it seems disjointed.<br /><br />Not being a hard core fan or purist, I liked the inclusion of the people from LOTRs. I thought it gave the stories connection and continuity, but that was also a con. I thought the two were too much alike. They looked alike, the action was similar, the characters were similar. It felt like watching LOTR all over again. I realize that that will be a plus for some people though.<br /><br />Is the CGI overdone? I have no idea. I thought it all looked fine and realistic. Is the 48 FPS a hit? Again, I couldn't tell you. The outside scenes look realer than real. You can almost see each blade of grass and wouldn't be surprised if the wind hit your face. But, there are times when the movement happens too fast for my eyes to see. I wouldn't say it's blurry exactly, but it looks different in an ineffective way.<br /><br />All in all, it was okay. I watched some of the \\"making of\\" shorts that Jackson put out as they were in production. I wanted to love it. I wanted it to live up to its hype, but after seeing it, I can see why it wasn't nominated for awards the way LOTR was. It wasn't horrible. I don't think anyone will hate it, but it's probably more of a thrill for Tolkein fans.<br /><br />UPDATE: The DVD improves with viewing. The first time I noticed the stellar acting from Serkis and the Freeman in particular. I noticed the scenery and visual beauty. The second time I was already familiar with that and could focus on the story. Not a lot happens, but having a story makes everything else that happens more enjoyable. It's still long, but hearing Richard Armitage sing the Misty Mountain song is a good way to kick off an adventure.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Versatile case. Very secure, the best part is that you can charge and listen with headphones without struggling with the cover access points to the ports.
0330419080|5.0|It is wonderful.  What is not to like about Jeffrey Archer's work!  Haven't ever read a book I haven't enyoyed; and I have read them all.  His writing is constant and stories always thoughtfully written, keeping you wanting more.  How much better does it get than that.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|The only case to buy. Completely worth it, you never have to remove the kindle case to charge, listen to music, or anything!
030758836X|2.0|Gone Girl is about a married couple, each of whom narrates part of the story. As you'd expect, each tells a story that is favorable to him or herself and casts a somewhat negative light on the other spouse.  The problem is that even when put in the best possible light, neither are characters with whom you would want to spend much time. Unreliable narrators can add interest to mystery, but unsympathetic ones, not so much.<br /><br />The first half of the book which introduces the couple and their families in great depth is moderately tedious.  The second half, in which the mystery is revealed and the plot starts twisting is quite a bit livelier, and has some clever comments about how the media circus that surrounds certain personal tragedies warps the lives of those affected.  In the end, however, I just didn't care whether these characters lived or died, or more precisely, I would have preferred if all of them had died together in a spectacular car crash.  No such luck.  The ending has no real resolution, leaving open the lamentable possibility of a sequel.

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This book is amazing! I Recommend that you read this book. Get this while it's free! You will love it!
0446580848|2.0|As a long time fan (read all but one previous novel) I am really sorry to report that Nelson's 600 plus pages was a waste of time. The story was about 200 pages longer than it needed to be. The plot of searching for the mastermind of the attack on the USS Cole was plausible enough but after that it implausible almost in its' entirety.<br /><br />To begin with there was way too much repetition. Other than John Cory and his wife who were more developed characters in previous books the cast were superficially described.  I understand this is fiction but DeMille has been much more believable in the past. There was little real intrigue here. The story development had few surprises and the couple that may not have been expected were so unforeseeable and ridiculous all you can think was &#34;No Way&#34; that would have happened like that.<br /><br />Actually I am really surprised this was such a poor effort. The end was anti climatic and provided no closure for two &#34;bad&#34; characters.<br /><br />In conclusion there are better offerings in this genre with Vince Flynn, Brad Thor and Tom Clancy if you haven't read those.<br /><br />Best Holiday reading wishes!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was fascinating from the first chapter on.  Jacob pulls you in with his &#34;teen angst&#34;, and softens you up with his relationship with his grandfather.  It is full of unexpected twists and turns, and the photographs add an extra mystery to the whole plot line.  Want to see more from this author!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|After 26 live shows, all the albums and hundreds of bootlegs I admit this is not his best of all time. However the guy is in his 60's and along with Leonard Cohen are still much better than 90+% of the male vocalists out there. You won't be disappointed in Van's music.

B007FRHZ4A|2.0|Today 17 12 2012, the UPS bring me the box. The toy is perfectly but the box is broke. Sad.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It has been a long time since I read a hard science fiction story that was a page-turner. I had a few very late nights of reading as I just did not want to put the book down, and there were no really dead spots that made for a natural go-to-bed location.<br /><br />Weir does a great job of inserting real science into this novel. If you've ever read about Robert Zubrin's \\"Mars Direct\\" plan for how to go about getting exploration missions to the red planet, it appears that this was used extensively for the core technologies in the book.<br /><br />The stranded astronaut, a botanist and mechanic, figures out some quite ingenious inventions to survive. It was much more interesting than the old movie \\"Robin Crusoe on Mars\\" (which I really liked!) and without any aliens or annoying monkeys.<br /><br />There also were tremendously funny lines throughout the novel, and I found myself laughing out loud at many points.<br /><br />Others have mentioned that there was too much profanity, but that didn't bother me at all. Who doesn't curse when something goes horribly wrong? It didn't diminish my enjoyment of the novel, but if you are very sensitive to this, be warned. The expletives are mild and standard, but they are sprinkled liberally in the text at some points.<br /><br />I am definitely trying an new novel Weir comes out with in the future.

0547995660|5.0|Imagine you lived in a world without any pain and fear. Everything occurred like clockwork and everyone seemed happy and that you knew no different, this seems like a perfect society.  Welcome to the world of The Giver. I have loved this book since I was first exposed to it in college and it has been my favorite ever since. Why? I guess it is the innocence of the parties involved and the way they come to terms with new knowledge as their eyes are opened to their world around them. I also like the fact as I read the book over and over again; I always find something new or find deeper meaning in the book.<br />Every year, the children in this utopian society get awarded a special gift until their 12th birthday. On their 12th birthday, the children receive their Assignments. These Assignments are their jobs which the Elders have decided for them and which the children will be trained in and will do for the rest of their lives. Jonas has been elected to be The Giver and this highly prized job is not something Jonas planned on being and he does not know what is all involved in this occupation as this job is not highly talked about.  Jonas has some advantages to being The Giver but struggles with some of the other issues of being in this position. Why was Jonas chosen for such a tasking assignment?  The current Giver must pass onto Jonas all these memories as he is aging and these memories must be transferred to someone within the society.  These memories include wonderful times but they also include pain and suffering which take a toll on Jonas.  What Jonas does with the memories is unprecedented and what Jonas learns in his new position, has Jonas thinking about his life in hometown differently.<br />I can't say enough about this book.  The characters are so real and the story moves so quickly, it is never a dull moment. This book is for readers in 5th grade or higher because of some of its subject matter
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is awesome. I was hooked on it from the first time i played it. Brings back memories of sim city and i love it. GOOD JOB
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This series is awesome! It's scary, suspenseful, exciting, intriguing, surprising...I could go on & on, but watching it on DVD is even better. It's like watching a super long sensational horror movie. Jessica Lange is such a great actress. The whole cast is actually very talented. The actor who plays Tate, Evan Peters, is one of my new favorites. Most of the cast returns in Season 2 playing all new characters. Since this is being considered a mini-series, they can change up the entire story. It's like a whole new ghost story that's just as good as the first. Highly recommend!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very fun game. It is quite a chalange to try to get as many coins in a row for a long push.

B003SI605K|4.0|This book is about the lives of Chinese women immigrants and their first-generation American daughters. We learn what it means to be Chinese through the eyes of both the mothers and the daughters. From each different perspective the reader learns how their lives have shaped how they think and view the world. When I read from the perspective of the daughters I felt like stomping my feet and screaming like a teenager over how their mothers treated them. Later when I read from the mother's perspective I was ashamed and also heart broken. I loved learning more details about the Chinese culture and experiencing the heartache that came with seeing the next generation lose some of that culture. This is an amazing read!
B006CHML4I|4.0|When I first started wearing this watch, it was not keeping the time or date set. The more I wear it the more I can switch between my other watches and I don't have to reset the date and time. I love the look with the blue face and band. I bought this watch because I was looking for a casual watch that I did not have to replace the battery. The cost was great. I never owned a Seiko. I think I want the other colors. Great with jeans, khakis, or slacks
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was mind blowing in the way the read each characters thoughts and feelings! Especially Kevin's insanity!!!!!! But overall it gives you a little hope in love and it wasn't your typical love story! The ending was the cutest unexpected thing!!!!!!!!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I love this series as much as the Soprano's and now have to wait till Season 3 comes out on DVD.  This series is a keeper if you enjoy watching the men that made America in a way that really existed and still does today.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had the amazing fate to meet Colleen on a cruise and through our conversation, she invited me to read her book. I was blown away! I was already a huge fan, based on Slammed and Point of Retreat, and was eagerly awaiting her standalone. Hopeless is amazing. It is heartbreaking, and hopeful...sweet and devastating. The content is incredibly heavy, but it is unfortunately a relevant topic in our society.<br /><br />Sky has lived a sheltered life, but thanks to her best friend/neighbor Six, she knows about boys and is heading off to public school after being homeschooled her whole life. She already has a reputation, but she has such a strong, resilient personality that she just laughs it off. Enter Holder, a boy with a reputation of his own. From the first time they meet, there is something between them, and he feels the need to protect her from her reputation. The relationship they share is so special, and they will soon discover why.<br /><br />I will not put anymore here, because I want you to see for yourself. Colleen is such a talented writer and tells such a sad story in a beautiful way. My words cannot do justice to Hopeless. I am in awe of this book. Thank you Colleen...for ANOTHER great read!

B009S8PEHY|5.0|Great album, but I can't say much for the delivery from Amazon - it was more than a challenge to get this onto a computer where I could play it and I still can't get it to my iPhone.  But when I do get to listen to the album, it's worth the effort.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Our 18 month old is obsessed with this movie. The calm music and fun story keep her attention like nothing else does.
1439170916|5.0|A crackling good read. Hard to believe, this &#34;biography&#34; of cancer, as if it were a real person, is a page turner. The author is himself a physician and oncologist, so there's no pseudo science nonsense. The author can tell a compelling story.
0062082353|2.0|Let's just say there's a reason Chris is a sniper and not a writer.  This book is a chore to finish; Mr. Kyle's writing style consists of short, nondescript sentences with a story arch that follows no discernible sequence of events and jumps between bar fights, training sequences (Buds) and missions at will.<br /><br />If you're looking for a big dose of right wing politics and ignorant world views, this book may be for you as well.  There are numerous historical inaccuracies concerning the history of Iraq and middle east, US involvement with Iraq and a lack of general understanding about how cultural and religious influences (as well as the British) shaped this country.  Chris is convinced of US moral superiority and the Christian world view, so much so that he tattooed a red crusader cross on his arm in between tours in Iraq, stating, \\"I wanted everyone to know I was a Christian. I had it put in red, for blood. I hated the damned savages I'd been fighting. I always will. They've taken so much from me.\\"  There are numerous references to the \\"savages\\" throughout the book; Chris seems to forget who the occupying army was during this conflict and how the US was allies with Iraq in the not too distant past (i.e. how do we know Saddam had WMDs?  Because the US still has the receipts for them).<br /><br />Overall, I don't want to take away from the sacrifice that Chris has made for his country; he's not a politician and has no say in where he went or what he was asked to do.  I wouldn't recommend this book; it adds nothing to a person's knowledge about the war in Iraq or, in all honesty, the story of Chris Kyle.  It's so poorly written that you will have no better understanding of Mr. Kyle's actions because he devotes no more than a couple of pages to battles that raged for days...some men have written books on singular battles.
B007UXT6T6|2.0|We enjoyed the movie well enough, but the download to our Tivo box took well over three hours. We ordered the movie and then had to wait until the next night to watch it. Not good.

076115678X|5.0|Here's why, the author was my hairdresser for 15 years in NYC.  She's awesome and believe she's quite passionate about this subject as she herself has naturally curly hair.  So, it's great to see this update to her book; it gives more detailed information than the first and includes other information that wasn't.  I'm no longer in NYC  : (  hoping to go back some day soon.  But, in the meantime I am able to find many stylists who have taken her courses and know how to cut curly hair the same way she does.  In between cuts, I get to care for my hair myself and this book is a must have for any curly haired person.  Would highly recommend.

There are so many different characters, and so many facts and descriptions. He is going to love reading this! It's a good buy for the Star Wars or Lego nerds in your life :)
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I jumped right into this one after finishing No Easy Day and loved it. Though a little familiar with the training process for SEALs, it was great to read about it from another perspective. The detail in description of the battle is amazing a I could stop turning the pages.<br />I felt a little torn about his hatred for the media. I work for a major news organization so felt a little insulted, however I'm a veteran first and the time period the book takes place was when the major news outlets failed us all so that needs to be remembered.<br />Above all, this is a monument and tribute to those who fight the fight especially those who fought beside Marcus. To those who put fear in the hearts of the beasts that go bump in the night. A must read.

At first I was put off by &#34;mom&#34; but enjoyed her silliness more as the book progressed.  She gave a light component to an otherwise heavy story.

B004LWZWGA|3.0|Received DVD before X'mas... Plays well, good pictures. Will be uploading to cloud for easier access. Storyline is as we know it, Fantactic.
B005QUQP76|4.0|*** I bought mine for GW2 but use it everyday for all games and general computer use ***<br /><br />First of all most of the very negative reviews are do to a rocky launch of the device firmware/software. Apparently there was quite a few problems including one that would brick the mouse. Pretty bad stuff really and I think we all have come to expect more from Corsair. Still as their first foray into gaming peripherals this mouse is still a solid entry. I had no such issues as I updated the firmware/software before I got started.<br /><br />Tracking is buttery smooth and the building materials are of good quality. Weight is moderate and IMO pleasant. The coating is a good balance between \\"grippy\\" and smooth. Tracking wheel has a nice rubber coat and you can feel each bump as you scroll. Even the cord is well made and covered in a woven fabric mesh. Top to bottom build quality is fantastic.<br /><br />OK. So,meat and potatoes.  Software package is OK. Not too fancy or intuitive. I had to run a question through google and then it was off to the races. The buttons on the side were for me a bit of a miss. They are a little hard to press but it is not really a problem. It's better that I don't press them on accident so it's OK. However, I am a slightly smaller than average human and the buttons are sometimes awkward. The last three buttons on the top side of the arrangement that comes to an L shape are a bit of a stretch. I have to change my grip for a moment to make sure I press the right one. The rest are fine and after a couple of weeks it feels natural. (Learning curve). The cluster at the back (6 buttons toward the rear of the mouse) are in a good position and the island in the middle is nice for everyday use. The button behind the scroll wheel is way far back and should only be bound to a function not used often as I have to abandon all other buttons for an instant.<br /><br />So, in summary. I feel like Corsair used quality components and it shows. The ergonomics were an inspired departure from the Naga (which I have not used) but it feels like it was made with someone else's hand in mind.I thought they would be more closely clustered and easily depressed so that I could sort of roll my thumb around to the buttons. The spacing and force needed to press them, as a combination, makes this impossible for my size hand.<br /><br />I payed $50 for mine and I feel it was worth it. I probably would not pay the asked for price of $80. It is a solid mouse worthy of it's gaming moniker but awkward button placement has left me wondering if the Naga or the G600 would have been a more intuitive button arrangement.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|This film is excellent; 5 stars in its original form. As it is, \\"The Love IS Gone\\", a pivotal plot moment and excellent song, is cut from this version. SO LAME. BRING IT BACK. Will not be purchasing for this reason.
0425238091|5.0|Bought for my daughter to read before entering college as she wanted to be a nurse. Was originally given to me by an MD friend when I was considering med school 25 years ago.<br /><br />Classic but brutal accounting of what it is really like to be in the healthcare field.<br /><br />Awesome read!

0529064847|1.0|I order the New American Bible and thought I was getting a new copy.  Not only was what I received used but badly used and very personal to the previous owner.  It was a gift to him and the giver had written a very personal note on the inside cover.  Personal names were there and the front cover was torn.  I was so surprised and disappointed.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I've been an ITM fan for a long time and I feel this is the best music they have released so far!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I was skeptical about purchasing this cover just because I really wanted it to look as beautiful in real life as it does on the website. It exceeded my expectations! The leather is soft and the handmade craftsmanship is absolutely beautiful. It is not flimsy like I was half expecting it to be and the magnetic close is great.
0345529057|5.0|The serie is just amazing, it's written in a way that makes you want to read more and more!<br />The product arrived in time! I recommend it!
B009NTNHJU|5.0|the album is great takes me back to 2007 when i first started listening to nicki, she has outdone herself in this album
B00005MP58|5.0|From time to time the wife and I will sit down for this movie and it's a great story! This version is probably my favorite I really enjoy the actors and how they take on the roles of the characters.
B008RYN44U|5.0|i like this album it's a little more modern then what they did before but they have great music and a good style to the songs.
B00021R7CG|5.0|A very realistic portrayal on how easy continuity of Government is affected during nuclear fallout. should be considered to be a lesson of dysfunctional Gov't control...
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|i love my kindle fire however there are very few cases out there for it like the IPAD has, however this case is perfect
B009JBZH54|5.0|How could you not want this? $27.98 for all three Nolan Batman's on BluRay, plus the special features. Love the Batmobile documentary. Amazing deal...
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I not sure i would like it, not my usual type of reading, but I was drawn in right away. I enjoyed the characters and felt like one of fairy tales, I loved as a child
1934030554|5.0|I refer back to this book again and again. I am coached by a professional, and reading this book helped me to understand the 'why' behind everything he tells me. If you are new to using a power meter, have been using one for years, or are considering getting a power meter, GET THIS BOOK. There is an entire chapter dedicated to helping you decide which power meter is right for you. This book, in combination with 'The Cyclists Training Bible' by Friel, provide the serious cyclist with more information about training than they could ever hope for. And it's all broken down in digestible bits that are easy to understand.
0307987647|5.0|I recieved the CD's and have had no problems whatever.  I'd do it again.  Of course, I'm only on the 7th CD and there's 30... but so far it's all good.
B001YV502C|5.0|For my money this was one of the most provocative films released in the last ten years. I still can hear the ringing from the bombs as if I was there when it happened. I saw it in theaters twice and every time I pick a movie for a date I always pick this one and nobody ever complains. The sets were great, the acting was great, the story and plot twists were great. The originality of the story was the best part though and it really made me think after the movie was over and discuss it with friends and family for a great time.<br /><br />If you want an add on gift then buy this. At near $10 I would buy it every time. You can thank me later and if you want me to be the best man at your wedding then email me.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Amazing Amazing Amazing CD. I would recommend this album to anyone. I have zero cons. Package arrived in pristine condition.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|Ok, yes, it is based in high school and yes, none of these people look like teenagers but it was a fun story about undying love with other nice twists. Check it out on Netflix though if you can. Last I checked it was streaming on there.
B004YESKU0|5.0|very best box set and great song<br /><br />i like system of a down<br /><br />I recommend Chop Suey! B.Y.O.B Question! Lonely Day
B0017JKEL8|5.0|This is a story of a man who on the surface has everything but at his core he has nothing and knows it. To speak about the details too much would reveal too much but the great reception of this series should be an indicator for prospective buyers. Years later I still can feel the show. The series has lost its greatness in later seasons but they produced the two best seasons I have seen on television in their first two. Warning: the show is addictive. Four episodes at a time hardly satisfied me. Second warning: I admit to buying martini glasses and drinking midday to this show.<br /><br />Favorite episodes:<br /><br />The Hobo Code<br />The Wheel<br /><br />Peggy's story arc was particularly great. My favorite moment, if you could call it that, was when she was recording the audio for the ad campaign in the wheel. Just watch it and you will understand. I still can remember how it made me feel even years later.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Got this on sale for .99 cents and it was a great buy, the photo booklet was a perk too!
1466401885|5.0|I bought this book and have loaned it to three people which all have also loved it and I can't wait for book2.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|THis was everything & more... I hear the reviews of Downton Abby & I was not disappointed.  Watch both seasons in 2 days.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I absolutely love this album. Every song is awesome but my favorite would have to be Mountain Sound but you really cannot go wrong with any of them.
0394492196|5.0|This was an amazing read. It is very well written, with twists and turns appropriate for a spy novel, and characters with depth and stories and abilities that make them relatable and fantastic at the same time. The book arrived on time in good condition, I would definitely recommend this seller as well as this novel.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love the concept but I don't find it very user-friendly and I'm technologically savvy and have no problems with other apps. I don't really use it because its a hassle. Shame though it could be great.
1416972250|3.0|The third book in the Mortal Instruments series picks up right where the last one left off. Clary is still yearning for her `brother' (gross even though we all know they aren't, but the fact remains the same: they don't...). Simon is still a Gary Stu vampire, and big daddy Valentine is still on the loose. Only this time we finally get to see the proverbial Oz: Idris.<br /><br />I liked this book, more than the other two at times, but it still had its issues. For starters, Jace kept treating Clary like a child, trying to control her actions for her `safety', even though they have only known each other for about a month. Sure, he's worried about her, but it was also an opportunity to learn about her super special Mary Sue powers.  Speaking of which, if I could make portals, I wouldn't waste them going to Idris. Paris here I come, baby!  Why not have a little fun with it? Instead she whined and rushed off and got everyone else in trouble. Better yet, she should have treated Luke to a nice vacay somewhere; he sure as heck deserved it! Also, werewolves keep their clothes when they transform?? I know this is a YA book, but come on...<br /><br />The author persists on keeping the whole brother/ sister thing between Clary and Jace going for as long as she could. To the point where it just got more and more gross. It's not cute, it never was, and quite frankly I got tired of reading to the sound of banjos and the taste of bile in my mouth.<br /><br />The worst offender of these books, however, is how the characters always seem to voice exactly what they are thinking, unless it is convenient to the story for them not to. They also seem to repeat, or say out loud, the things that have happened to them to the point of ad nauseam. We just read about it, we were THERE, the characters don't need to dissect it down to the bone for me to understand what's going on. *Spoiler* Ex: The epilogue, just shut up and make out already. The tension that had been building up almost the entireseries was ruined by talking. Blah... Lame<br /><br />To me this book wraps the series up nicely. Everything is solved and they are all happy-go-lucky. I can't imagine why there is a need for two more books after this one. I really don't think I can bring myself to care enough to read them. So, yay! This series is done! On to the next one!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|2 stories unfold in this original book. One tells the past of this centenarian and one his present incredible adventure. Fun read.
B000ZHCQ5U|4.0|I am a fan of Stanley Kubeck. 2001: A Space Odyssey is arguably his best work. Peter Sellers and George C, Scott are magnificent!
B0084AXZK0|3.0|It was ok. Liked it because it was a pretty interesting story, and it was short. Psychology in it made it good.
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|Of course I am a fan of Gary Cooper regardless of the role he plays. This is a bit of history along with great acting by all cast members.
0060191325|5.0|Actually my husband bought like 10 of these when it first came out.  He saw Dr. Grey during a TV interview.  He said, &#34;Hey, this guy hit the nail on the head!&#34;, and then I started to watch and he was right.  The good Dr. Didn't say much to surprise me (I was raised with many men in my life and few women) but my husband too was raised with very few women around.  He was struggling to get  'it'.  This  book was incredibly helpful for both of us.  And like I said my husband bought a stack of them and handed them out to guys too stuborn to get it themselves.  We bought this one for our newlywed daughter and son-in-law.  By the way, my husband is a 'man's man'.  Played hockey more than 12 years, has a professional degree and after almost 30 years is still my best friend and the best man I know.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Just love this tape. Wish I had got it in a video..<br />Rod is just the best!!!!<br />Just to get in the holiday spirit.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|I do love it, so much that i bought the remaining 4 books. In fact I'm 17% through the 3rd book - &#34;City of Glass&#34;
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|It wasn't the best game I've ever played but a time killer just the same. Not really worth $3... Keep them coming though.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Brilliant and quite engrossing! Over time, I have learnt about each individual characters in over time as I progress, and it's getting more and more interesting
B00899F0G8|5.0|I downloaded whole season. It's nice to be able to finally watch it somewhere. I love amazon and it's products!
B000002A46|5.0|Make fun of Mariah all you want, the girl can sing!  I listen to this every year and I love her versions of the classics as well as her own &#34;All I Want for Christmas is You&#34;.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I had wanted the complete series for so long. And when i finally got it, I was excited to discover that there are little snippets of stuff in the dvd episodes that are cut for TV, so it is like watching the series brand new again!
B000002LND|5.0|This collection is better than anything on the radio right now! It has some of the best songs of her early/middle career. Vogue!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this book but I was not disappointed. The more I read, the more I found myself drawn into Connor and Megan's tale and how they were going to resolve their issues on their journey to love.<br /><br />I really liked these two and the wonderful moments of connection between them. There was a strong sense that they were right for each other but would not be able to fully reach that particular place of acceptance until they addressed their difficult pasts and resulting personal issues.<br /><br />I enjoyed how their story unfolded and how they dealt with their inevitable conflicts and found their way to moments of necessary truth and each other. I found myself chuckling a fair bit along the way and agree with other reviewers who found it funny, romantic and smart. I'm glad I read it!
B00004X01U|4.0|Ok, so this is really only good for the 2 big singles on it.  But I feel that it's still worth buying.  Madonna was so ahead of the curve with the first song &#34;Music&#34; and I think it still sounds new and fresh now!
B000002J09|5.0|Snaps me right back to the seventies hippie days, when life was so fun and simple. No bills, just rock concerts.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I really enjoyed all of the characters, but obviously Fat Amy was awesome!!! She made the movie! Also the dude from workaholics. What!
B0013USZHG|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is an excellent and exciting album. I'm relatively new to classical. Not a novice, but by no means a well seasoned listener. As your enthusiasm for classical grows, you start realizing that the conductor/orchestra combination really makes a difference in how the music is presented and interpreted. Gustavo Dudamel is one of these rare conductors that bring joy and enthusiasm to the music. By all means, if you're thinking of buying this CD, do so. You will not be disappointed.
B00846REIS|4.0|This is like Fifty Shades of Grey but the characters have a little more depth and there is a plot line past &#34;he looked at me with hooded eyes, so I bit my lip.&#34;  Unfortunately, because it came after the Fifty Shades series, it seems like this was just a Fifty Shades v.2.  I will finish the series, but it's hard to get past the rich, handsome twenty-something with a sexually abusive past wooing a sexy young girl ...
B00785P2QC|4.0|I've been playing this game ever since I downloaded it last week I'll be playing this&nbsp;game for a good while

B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app daily for outdoor temperature quick reference and Radar. Always a good thing to have available.<br /><br />Don't start an out project without it
0385535147|4.0|If you are as avid a Grisham fan as me, then you will love this book. It is as others have noted, a deviation from his norm, in that while the plot itself is very believable, some of the twists are quite un-so. That's okay, though, for I picked up this book to be entertained, and that I was. I happen to like the fact that he keeps you wondering about the characters and where this is going, and he surprises you with a new twist in nearly every chapter, keeping you wondering what unbelievable twist will happen next. Also, while the main character is a former lawyer, it's not based in the courtroom, but instead revolves around the prison system, a slight deviation from his norm though still heavily connected to the legal profession.<br /><br />I personally can't wait to see the movie that's sure to come.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a treasure, and everything he does is worth a look, but this is his greatest work.  A tale of an America where the gods and folk traditions of other lands are brought to our country as part of the immigrant experience, American Gods sees a world of Gods and sacrifice in the everyday experience of our lives.  While the plot tells the story of a conflict between the new gods of technology and the old gods of tradition, the most powerful parts (which can be read almost like short stories) describe the harrowing tales of immigrants, slaves and raiders who came to this country still in need of the help of gods of their forefathers (and mothers) and who are willing to trade important things for their survival.  Exceptionally clever, dark, funny and moving, I can't recommend this book highly enough.  Oh, and it will soon be a series on HBO, so read it before actors become too associated with these amazing characters.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|love gaga and love this album me and kids jam to it in the car. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
B0091LS07E|5.0|The entire album has great music, you will be happy you purchased this album! And I can listen to Girls on Fire over and over again!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|my husband could not hear me in it, i did a test call as soon as i put my iPhone in it :(
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I want so badly to award this more than 3 stars. On the one hand it kept me engaged and entertained, but on the other hand I found several aspects of the plot quite difficult to stomach (no need to expand on this since a few of the 1-star reviews have thoroughly covered this). Fans such as I are now prisoners of this duo. I cannot help but purchase and read any new release within the first week and devour it within a day or two. But over the past few years I have found myself steadily lowering my expectations. Even so, like a good addict, I will eagerly swallow the next dose as soon as it arrives...

B00992CF6W|5.0|the free version stinks but this version ROCKS this game is about using your imagination to create any thing you want out of blocks.With this you can play with two people or just yourself.With two possible modes one where you have an infinite supply of blocks and no hearts another mode where you have to survive by creating weapons like swords to defend yourself it's an amazing game and I LOVE IT!
B003TU16BA|5.0|These are the best!  I love them.  I enjoy walking and living my day with them on.  The order was on time.  Best buy I made this season.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Our six year old son's birthday is close to Christmas so we always shop for deals -  he was so excited when he got this - great addition to his other sets - well worth the small price we paid.
B005XOPEOU|2.0|Like most of you, I hate buying an entire album to get 1 song. I heard this album before I bought it and liked some of the song. After about an hour of listening I decided that I really only liked 2 of the songs, which I could have downloaded just those 2 instead of the entire album. Waste o' money...
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I just purchased a Kindle Fire, and I can see the small lens of a camera at the top right-hand corner... so where's the camera application that SHOULD already come with it?  I understand this HD camera app is for the Kindle Fire HD, but still...  I'd purchased a Kindle instead of the iPad because I consider myself a loyal Amazon customer... and this is what it does?  Ridiculous....
B0058YPILY|5.0|I love the characters and their interactions.  Each brings a certain element to the show.  Writing is good and so is the acting.
0345803507|2.0|Ok I enjoyed the first two books and got through them pretty quickly but the last book is dragging and becoming VERY unrealistic!!!  Nobody can have sex that much without getting a bladder infection or having some kind of issues - she keeps telling him to give her space and then she changes her mind and gives up what she needs cause she feels sorry for him being so messed up - not the basis of a good or lasting relationship..... I am not even half way through and I have started calling the book - fifty shades of stupid....  I want more story - more about the guy trying to kill them - more about Mrs. Robinson and how she went off to lick her wounds... more about his mother and what she did to mrs. robinson when she found out she's been sexually assaulting her son since he was fifteen..... fifty shades of stupid...

B009O07NBQ|5.0|They say you can never go home again, but that's not true for Howard Shore, the multi-award winning Canadian composer of the music for The Lord of the Rings. Prior to the release of the first LOTR film, The Fellowship of the Ring, in 2001, Shore was a respected but generally little-known composer, best known for writing a series of dark, brooding scores for director David Cronenberg, and thrillers like Seven and The Silence of the Lambs. Even when he was first announced as the composer for Fellowship, many commentators questioned whether Shore had the thematic strength to write the broad and expansive music the films required. Fast forward a decade, and Shore is a three-time Oscar winner and international film music superstar, with impressive album sales, sold-out concerts, and massive critical acclaim. When director Peter Jackson announced that he was making a new Middle Earth trilogy based on JRR Tolkien's book The Hobbit, it was never a question of whether Howard Shore would return to score the films, but whether the music would stand up to the massive hype and sense of expectation that inevitably came with it's release. For better or worse, the Lord of the Rings scores have become some of the best-loved of the new millennium, and for many fans whose first experience of film music came through those films and Shore's now-iconic themes, there was bound to be an unimaginable sense of anticipation. So does The Hobbit continue the trend of excellent music in Middle Earth? The answer is yes and no, but not for reasons you might think.<br /><br />The Hobbit takes place 60 years before the events of The Lord of the Rings, and essentially tells the story of how Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit of the Shire, came to be in possession of the One Ring which acted as the catalyst for the action of that trilogy. Jackson has split the book into three films, with this first installment, subtitled `An Unexpected Journey' being followed by Part 2, The Desolation of Smaug, in 2013, and thefinal part, There And Back Again, in 2014. The plot concerns Bilbo (Martin Freeman) being visited in his home by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and effectively coerced into accompanying Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and a company of 12 dwarves on a dangerous journey across the wilds of Middle Earth, towards Erebor, the ancient home of the dwarf lords. Generations before, Erebor was overrun by a vicious dragon named Smaug, who claimed the city's vast treasures of gold and left the dwarves essentially homeless. Thorin, for his part, has resolved to kill Smaug and restore the dwarves to their rightful home. Along the way, Bilbo and company visit Rivendell, the home of the elf king Elrond, are menaced by trolls and goblins and an especially nasty tribe of vengeful orcs, and encounter a curious creature named Gollum (Andy Serkis) deep beneath the Misty Mountains, from whom Bilbo acquires a mysterious golden ring. Not only that, but the company begin to realize that a darker power is emerging in the form of a nameless necromancer, whose shadowy presence begins to affect everything in Middle Earth...<br /><br />The issue of the score is complicated, because the score you hear on CD and the score you hear in the film are markedly different. For issues that can only relate to last-minute editing, there are scenes in the film which contain leitmotivic thematic statements that are wildly at odds with what's going on on-screen, while significant portions of the music heard on the soundtrack album do not feature in the film at all. It's frustrating, because Shore spent so much time in Lord of the Rings carefully crafting an elaborate musical tapestry of interlinking ideas that connect characters, locations and concepts so specifically, that when (for example) you hear the Nazgûl theme from Fellowship in a climactic scene in The Hobbit that has absolutely nothing to do with the Nazgûl, it sort of destroys the point of Shore taking so much care and attention to the structure of the music the way he did. This is one of several examples the clear-eared will be able to notice during the film, and to be perfectly frank it spoils the effect a little. The majority of casual listeners and cinema-goers will not notice, or care, but for those of us who do it makes it an exasperating experience.<br /><br />On CD, however, the score really shines. As one would expect, An Unexpected Journey inhabits exactly the same sonic world as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, with a full symphony orchestra augmented by various instrumental soloists, unusual percussion items, and vocalists carrying a vast array of interwoven thematic ideas, new and old. A great deal of the score is familiar and comfortable, with multiple performances of multiple themes Shore originally wrote for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, although Shore does take care not to simply re-state themes verbatim, instead hinting at them, re-orchestrating them, or playing around with different tempos and counterpoints.<br /><br />The idyllic Irish-inflected themes for The Shire appear in much of the score's opening, notably in \\"My Dear Frodo\\" and \\"Old Friends\\", and there is a rambunctious re-worked version later in \\"The Adventure Begins\\" that echoes the \\"Shortcut to Mushrooms\\" sequence from Fellowship, where Frodo and company's adventure also began. The mystical theme for the elves of Rivendell, complete with angelic voices and harp glissandi, appears in a beautifully lush setting during \\"The Hidden Valley\\", and is joined by Galadriel's elegant theme in the low-key but complex \\"White Council\\" sequence - listen for the almost subliminal single performance of the brass line of the Isengard motif at 2:15 when Saruman makes his presence felt! A soft woodwind performance of the \\"In Dreams\\" melody from Fellowship appears during the first half of \\"Over Hill\\", and there's even a quick blast of the Lothlorien motif on low brass towards the end of \\"Warg-Scouts\\", before the familiar snake-like theme for the One Ring makes a cameo appearance during \\"Riddles in the Dark\\", illustrating to the audience it's malevolent influence over the pathetic life of Gollum.<br /><br />The enormous Gothic outbursts of orchestral and choral power that accompanied many of Lord of the Rings's battle scenes are also very much in evidence here, from the Erebor flashback sequence in the second half of \\"My Dear Frodo\\" - which has more than a hint of \\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dûm\\" to it - to the overwhelmingly dark \\"An Ancient Enemy\\", the loping and muscular \\"Warg-Scouts\\", the dramatic \\"A Thunder Battle\\", \\"Under Hill\\", and the enormously exciting conclusive trio, \\"Brass Buttons\\", \\"Out of the Frying Pan\\" and \\"A Good Omen\\". Shore regularly goes all-out in these battle sequences, pitting beds of screaming brasses and dissonant string phrases against relentless, pounding percussion rhythms; \\"Out of the Frying Pan\\" stands out especially for its astonishingly complicated and ferocious trombone parts, and its soaring performance of Thorin's theme in its most heroic setting yet.<br /><br />Shore also has fun in setting up what you think is going to be a performance of an existing theme, playing maybe the first three or four notes, or a familiar chord progression, before taking it off into a totally different direction. \\"The Hill of Sorcery\\", for example, threatens to head off into a rendition of \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" at one point, and I lost count of the amount of times this happened elsewhere, but it's all very much in keeping with a great deal of the film itself, foreshadowing themes, characters and events from later in the overarching story's timeline.<br /><br />The score's main new theme is the Misty Mountains theme, representing the heroism of the dwarves - although, ironically, the theme was not written by Shore, but by David Donaldson, David Long, Steve Roche and Janet Roddick, who have worked together as composers and songwriters in the Wellington, New Zealand music scene for over 25 years under the collective title Plan 9. The theme's first appearance is as an acappella song sung with hymn-like solemnity by actor Richard Armitage and the cast of dwarves in \\"Misty Mountains\\", before becoming an orchestral leitmotif for the dwarves in the underscore proper. In the film the fanfare version of the theme appears at several opportune moments, usually when Shore wants to capture the nobility and bravery of the dwarves in action, but on CD the appearances are more frugal: it appears in its full form in just three cues - \\"The World Ahead\\", \\"Roast Mutton\\" and \\"Over Hill\\" - with \\"Roast Mutton\\" placing it into an action setting with a flurry of accompanying brass as our heroes attack the aforementioned gastronomic trolls, and \\"Over Hill\\" providing the most majestic performance, complete with accompanying brass triplets and a broad, spectacular mountain vistas on-screen.<br /><br />Several other new themes are worth noting. \\"Radagast the Brown\\" has a frenetic, tempestuous theme that captures his scatterbrained and slightly dotty demeanor with high strings, ticking percussion and a children's choir, but it hints at the strength of his wizarding power underneath it all during its second major appearance in \\"The Hill of Sorcery\\". A secondary, more thoughtful and restrained brass theme for Thorin Oakenshield appears in \\"Axe or Sword?\\", an ascending scale which becomes a recurring element as the score progresses and the weight of Erebor's history and the enormity of the task begins to take its toll on the dwarf's psyche. There's a playful new theme for Gandalf's mischievousness which appears in both \\"Old Friends\\" and \\"An Unexpected Party\\", which sounds like a refugee from Shore's Oscar-nominated score for Hugo, all stuttering phrases and fluttery pizzicato effects. Conversely, there is a much more brutal motif for the film's main antagonist, Azog the Pale Orc, which gets its most prominent performance in the vicious-sounding \\"The Defiler\\", during which thebrass section plays evil-sounding chords at the lowest possible reaches of their register. There are more fleeting, more elusive thematic markers for the dragon Smaug, and the mysterious Necromancer, but their musical identities will surely be explored further in the next two films.<br /><br />The score concludes with a performance of \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain\\", an updated and re-jigged version of the Misty Mountains theme performed by Neil Finn of the New Zealand rock band Crowded House. The new age vocals of Enya, Emiliana Torrini's insidiously emotional Gollum song, and even Annie Lennox's \\"Into the West\\" all contributed positively to the Lord of the Rings trilogy's end credits sequences, but Finn's contribution here is massively out of place. With it's grating \\"ay-yi-yi-yi-\\" chant, hand claps, and pseudo-rock guitars, it feels about as far from Middle Earth, musically, as it's possible to be, and single-handedly knocks a half star off the rating of the album as a whole. It's the musical low point of the entire franchise to date.<br /><br />As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, the music for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is slightly frustrating, and likely to be divisive, with those who loved the music in the film wondering where all the grand performances of the Misty Mountains theme are, and those who loved the music on CD first wondering where all the new themes are in the film. In the end, I have to review the CD as a standalone product, and on those terms the score is a surefire success. The score for An Unexpected Journey fits confidently within the pantheon of Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings universe, regularly alluding to the existing themes, manipulating them once in a while to keep them fresh and interesting, and blending them seamlessly with the half dozen or so new musical identities specific to this film. Anyone who enjoyed the music of original Lord of the Rings trilogy will find a great deal to their liking here too, as its layers, depths and complexities reveal themselves more and more with repeated listens.<br /><br />Note: This review concentrates mainly on the `standard' 2-CD set of the score, but mention should also be made of the special edition expanded version, which contains an additional half an hour of music, and features extended and in some cases alternate versions of \\"Old Friends\\", \\"An Unexpected Party\\", \\"Radagast the Brown\\", \\"Roast Mutton\\", \\"Moon Runes\\" and \\"The White Council\\", and a new dwarfish drinking song entitled \\"Blunt the Knives\\", as well as four bonus cues: \\"A Very Respectable Hobbit\\", \\"Erebor\\", \\"The Dwarf Lords\\" and \\"The Edge of the Wild\\".

B003VANOFY|5.0|This is a great headset for playing PlanetSide 2 but was really painful to get working initially. Had I done a little research first I would have found that the G930 is notorious for issues being recognized by Logitech's gaming software. Word of advice when you purchase these, do no install from the disk, but install the latest software from the website. I am using Windows 8 and was able to get these to install successfully. Also, there is an issue with adobe flash on websites making these headsets play from only one side of the headphones (pretty lame for YouTube). Spotify sounds great and these headphones also work with my Retina MacBook Pro (though there is no driver support). As for the quality of the headset, the build is decent, though the G buttons feel a little cheap and in my opinion are useless. I really appreciate the auto-mute microphone positioning feature and really see no use for the voice pitch changes unless I was 9 years old. The 7.1 is outstanding and a real plus in gaming! They aren't kidding when they say you will hear them before you see them and it has saved me several times; especially with cloakers in PS2. Overall I would suggest these with the warning that you may run into issues getting them to work 100%.<br /><br />Edit: I've since updated my computer to a new motherboard and i5 processor. The headset works stellar so I am giving it 5 full stars. Perfect on YouTube now as well, no issues with only a single side playing.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is the classic trilogy of Chris Nolan's Batman films in perfect blu-ray video! It comes with a nice excerpt of the art and making of the dark knight trilogy, 5 discs, and a nice box embossed box.  All three films have loads of special features to look at as well!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The story is an excellent read! I got it on my kindle and it was an easy read. Sometimes I felt there were too many details surrounding the story that didn't add anything to the story and sometimes I felt there weren't enough and that took away from the story.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|What a great movie to share with your family! It really makes you appreciate the great life we have today!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Man, the Killers are good!  Admittedly, my favorite Killers albums in order were Sam's Town, Hot Fuss, and then Day & Age.  Battle Born might even be better than Sam's Town - only time will tell.  But my point is that this is a perfect album start to finish by an amazing band.  The tracks range from slow (Here With Me) to pulse pounding (Flesh And Bone, Runaways).  We even get to hear a companion piece to one of the Killers' best songs (Mr. Brightside) in the song Miss Atomic Bomb (and they even throw in some of Mr. Brightside's music in the song!).  What strikes me most on this album are the feelings of nostalgia as Brandon Flowers looks back to his youth of lost love, found love, regrets, etc.  As a #1 fan of The Gaslight Anthem, nostalgia always strikes a chord within me.  And this album is dripping with it and it goes perfectly with Brandon Flowers voice, which is flawless as usual and emotion-filled.  As another reviewer said, the lyrics paint a picture and it is one that you can see clearly and instantly relate to it.  We get some nice keyboard moments in many of the songs (Flesh And Bone, The Rising Tide) and as usual, Dave's guitarwork is intricate and under-appreciated.  The album compares quite nicely with Sam's Town with clear inspiration from Springsteen.  Well done, The Killers.  You have pleased a lifelong fan.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|The special effects were great. The beginning was amazing, but this movie was awful. It just wasn't believable. The people didn't act like they should have given the circumstances.<br /><br />This group of supposed experts travel to an alien world where they take no contamination precautions. They trample through unknown black goo, infect each other and in general show zero common sense.<br /><br />SPOILER:  One guy sees an alien worm crawling in his eye and doesn't bother to tell anyone, \\"HEY THERE'S A WORM IN MY EYE!!\\" You'd think that would be something a person would mention.<br /><br />Then there were ridiculous characters, like the security guy. He tells them all gruffly, \\"I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to protect you.\\" Then he's the first one to run in a panic and get himself killed by the aliens.<br /><br />The big moment we've all waited for is when the group meets one of the original Creators of life on earth. We can ask him why he created us? Is there a god? But, no. The robot brought specifically to translate the alien language doesn't bother to. We aren't let in on one word the robot and the Creator say to each other.<br /><br />I'm a huge Aliens fan of all the movies, and this was a huge disappointment.
0061733199|4.0|Very informative, would also like to see real pictures of the plants to be able to distinguish better. Other than that it's a good book for reference.<br /><br />I hope I never get to use it.
B005LAII12|4.0|Take the children's story premise of a kid wishing his teddy bear were alive.  Now go 20+ years into the future where the kid is now in his mid-30s and the teddy bear is still alive, rendering them both overgrown frat boys who enjoy booze, pot, and [[ASIN:B0038ZITIE Flash Gordon]] way too much.<br /><br />I was one of the extras in the nightclub scene where John meets Lori for the first time, and never would have guessed this was Seth MacFarlane's first major foray into live-action: he was very efficient, very on the ball with every take, and got all the mistakes out of the way right at the beginning.  It plays like an extended live-action episode of [[ASIN:B000083C6V Family Guy]] (Ted even insists he doesn't sound like Peter) without interference from the network censors with demented inserts and flashbacks (Ted winds up fighting a duck named James Franco) but the laughs keep coming.
B009O07NDY|2.0|Please hear me out, I don't hate the music on this CD, the problem is some of the music of this album is UNRELEASED MUSIC, SOME OF THIS MUSIC IS NOT THE MUSIC HEARD IN THE MOVIE!  We are treated with music that Howard Shore did not use in the final cut of the film. This is very disappointing because some of the best orchestrations heard on the movie did not end up on the soundtrack. Tracks like: &#34; out of the frying pan&#34; and &#34;a good omen&#34; are not the tracks used in the movie. There's also unfinished music throughout the soundtrack for example the heroic theme heard in the trailer can only be heard for a few seconds on the track &#34;over hill&#34; when in fact this theme plays predominantly throughout the movie. Now we have to wait for Shore to release the complete recordings in order to hear it all, very, very disappointing!
B009O07NDY|5.0|It could be said that like the dwarves of Moria Peter Jackson may have mined too deeply with his latest film treatment of J.R.R. Tolkien, \\"The Hobbit:  An Unexpected Journey\\" and its two sequels to come. One thing is clear, however, doing three long films to tell the story of \\"The Hobbit\\" on screen gives composer Howard Shore a rather large canvas, three actually, to make musical magic for, and in \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" he does  so on a magnificent scale.  To say that this is a much anticipated film score would be a great understatement.  When the brief tidbits of the dwarves' \\"Misty Mountain\\" and orchestral treatments of that main theme first appeared in the initial trailer earlier this year fans were agog.  But to wait almost nine months was a trial indeed.  The wait is now over and no one should be disappointed.  The film is here and so is an extended score recording in deluxe form (but not the full score).  Shore has produced another fine score, well worthy of Middle Earth, beginning with familiar themes for the hobbits and the Shire, Shore adds new levels to his musical interpretation of Tolkien.  Of course the main thread here is the vocal of \\"Misty Mountain\\" which provides the early main theme for the journey with other motifs and themes for Gollum, the ring, orcs, goblins, elves, trolls, and the dragon Smaug.  Even while revisiting themes from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" Shore presents a great score with wonderful new music for the screen and this recording.  This is a production worth the wait, and it promises more to come.  Nicely produced and packaged by Water Tower Music.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|IT was an excellent CD, and the bonus DVD was interesting and entertaining.  I recommend this for any fan of Avril
B006HGXGWU|4.0|This is a modern-day Noah type of story with some significant gaps in full character development, but the story stayed with me and made me think.  The leads, Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain, are particularly enjoyable talents.  Worth watching and ruminating over the possibilities.
B0063IH60K|4.0|works well,easy use, works just like the app on my iPhone so found it easy to play immediatley and easily
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I enjoyed watching two veteran, high-quality actors dig into material so familiar to long-married couples.  Steve Carrell was perfectly cast as the therapist--he seems to always understand so well how and when to appropriately limit character material.  Still, I had a very hard time (as someone much younger than the protangonists) watching the &#34;love scenes.&#34;  No offense, as young adults think most people over 30 are, well, not sexy and those who are 30-40 don't relish watching 50-60 somethings get romantic.  It's just they way it works.
0425166805|5.0|Chariots of the Gods Review<br />Scott Prinz<br />This nonfiction book was truly mind opening. The author will take you through human history and examine some of the many mysteries of our past. Within the last 5,000 years, unexplained phenomena have occurred on almost every continent on Earth. Instead of trying to prove why these things happened through science and historians, the author takes an unexpected path. He is a believer in ancient aliens. He is very passionate about explaining his theory. He believes that ancient aliens were an extremely important part in our past. The book will take you through many ancient cultures and look at the oddities. Everything from ancient buildings, to religious stories, to the origins of humans is discussed. If you are not a believer in aliens, this book will really help change your mind. The facts are astonishing and eye opening. Reading this will give you a whole new perspective on Earth's history, and will leave you with a passion for finding out the real truth.

B006IDG2T6|4.0|I chose a four star rating, because I found this book highly informative about the perspective of free will as an illusion.  I liked how Sam Harris was able to demonstrate the illusion of free will without sacrificing the legal system. I wish there was more talk about David Hume and the philosophic foundation for causality in relation to free will. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick read on the position of determinism.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The story line was of course fun and once in a while, you need a little escape from reality.  This book certainly gives you that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love how this book is similar to twilight although I didn't read twilight. This book made me believe that everything happens for a reason. I guarantee that after reading this book, you'll start looking for Mr. Grey. Yes, not Mr. Right.

B005GK6Q6G|5.0|I wasn't sure about this at first. I played the first few tracks and because it wasn't Genesis circa 1973, i dismissed it and left it on the shelf for a few weeks. Then I decided to give it another chance and put the whole thing on in the background while i was reading a book (Spring Snow by Yukio Mishima) and the music just came to life. It is a modern recording but don't let that put you off. it is wonderfully melodic with some incredible guitar technique (as you would expect). It reminded me a bit of On An Island by David Gilmour, only more varied and interesting. The whole album kind of reminds me of a travelogue and kind of whisks you off on a trip around the world. Mine has the bonus CD too, although I find this less interesting, with one track sounding identical to Peter Green's Supernatural (was this a cover? who knows?). Any way, if you aren't sure if Hackett can still Hack It, then think again and listen to this wonderful slice of prog!

0062082353|5.0|Great book!  Kyle is a good story teller – a humble hero.  This is a much better read than “Lone Survivor” or “No Easy Day”.  Kyle isn’t the arrogant type; he gives tons of credit to other Warfighters of all branches and admits that although he is “very good” – he was also lucky and blessed.  I highly recommend this book: former US Army Ranger and Sniper.

I understand the fit of Crocs varies with style, but based on other reviews thought size 8 would fit me in this pretty style. I was wrong. When I tried them on, they were way too big. The return procedure (which I've never tried online before) worked well except it cost me $7.50 to mail them to the return center but was reimbursed less than $6 for return shipping.

B006TVQTHW|4.0|I bought this case in November 2012 for about $58; items I installed include a Gigabyte GA-Z77X-D3H Z77 motherboard, an MSI 670 graphics card, a Corsair CWCH80 (120 mm fan) CPU water cooler, an optical drive, a 3.5\\" hard drive, a 2.5\\" SSD, a Corsair CX600 PSU and three additional 120 mm case fans (one venting behind the motherboard, two blowing into the case on the front).<br />All items including the long graphics card fit inside, though the water cooler blocks direct access to some connectors on the motherboard (CPU power, one fan connector; be sure to hook those up first!). The cable routing is excellent and the tool-less 5.25\\" and 3.5\\" bays are convenient. All steel edges are properly rounded, presenting little danger of cutting oneself, and the overall quality of this case is very good. The included fans (1 x 120 mm, 1 x 140 mm) work well so far (1 month after purchase), and the front connections (USB 3.0, audio) have not presented any problems.<br />All in all, I'm pretty happy with the price, features and aesthetics of this case, but I do have the following concerns / suggestions for the next generation of this case:<br />1) The SSD mounts need at least 5 mm more clearance from the bottom of the case (or motherboard tray in the case of the mount there) as it is impossible to mount the drive properly (4 screws) and connect a SATA cable with the current clearance (at least with the cables of the power supply I used).<br />2) The 140 mm fan would be better located closer to the center of the case. As it is, in order to prevent the 120 mm water cooler fans from having to compete with the 140 mm fan at the top of the case, I had to direct the airflow from outside the rear 120 mm fan opening through the water cooler and up through the 140 mm fan; the cooler blocks about 15% of the area of the 140 mm fan. The obstruction would be a non-issue for a slimmer water cooler or a regular CPU cooler, but fans would still compete, both drawing air from the top corner.<br />3) Fan opening filters should be installed on all openings. They are only provided for the PSU opening (on the bottom of the case) and the front opening; the side openings (one just above the PSU / over the PCIe x16 expansion slot on the motherboard used here, the other below the CPU) do not have filters.<br />4) The number of included 3.5\\" bays (six) is excessive for most applications. Changing this to at most three 3.5\\" bays and adding at least two 2.5\\" trays would reduce materials cost, increase are flow from front fans and eliminate SSD mounting problems.<br />5) Instead of / in addition to grommets for mounting a user-assembled water cooler over the 140 mm fan at the top of the case, some type of opening that would allow the tubes of a pre-assembled unit to be routed out of the back of the case to externally mount a water cooler of that type over the 120 mm fan opening of the rear of the case would be useful.<br />6) The fan cage design (stamped from the cage and somewhat raised on the exterior rather than a detachable grill) may interfere with mounting a fan or fan filter outside the case (I have not yet tested this).<br /><br />Additional suggestions for potential buyers:<br />- I strongly suggest purchasing a 3.5\\" to 2.5\\" adapter bracket to mount any SSD in the 3.5\\" drive rack (probably about $10).<br />- If you intend to mount fans on the side openings (especially above the motherboard), I suggest getting fan extension cables.<br />- This case is larger than one might think based on the listing's picture alone, one should take note of the listed dimensions.
B000002AGN|5.0|Para recordar muchas veces a Dave Brubeck y sus cuarteto del oeste. Una grabación para disfrutar de algunos de los clásicos del jazz.
B004BLTNJI|4.0|I like this movie more and more every time I watch it.  My twelve year old niece really enjoyed the funky corky story line of Caroline.  Great movie!
B00000I8UJ|5.0|Un jazz suave de un saxofonista poco conocido. Dexter Gordon es el gran abanderado del jazz clásico. Hay que escucharlo.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Still to this day, it is so true about the kitchen life. I need all my 9 to 5 friends to read this to truly understand.
067144901X|5.0|Such a cute little book.  Sandra Boynton is a fantastic illustrator and author.  I've never come across anything by her I haven't liked.  I have never run across anything in her books that could be considered offensive or unsuitable for children or anyone else.  Boynton' s books are always a good, safe, and adorable choice.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|The movie is an exceptional one and who could argue its Whalberg. The item was in great condition and is brand new.
B006JTS5WQ|5.0|I am an \\"original\\" old-school fan of The Muppets.  When I saw that this movie was being made, courtesy of Jason Segel and HIS retro love of The Muppets, I only hoped it could be as great a product as the man himself,  Jim Henson, produced.  I was not disappointed with the result.  The story line was good and solid, and most of the Muppet characters were present for the comeback.  Walter, the new main Muppet character, fit right in.  I really can't rave enough about how good this movie is.  Great choice for the old Muppet fans as well as the new.  Kudos to Jason Segel for not letting The Muppets fade into oblivion.
B0091CWYQ6|3.0|After reading a few glowing reviews, I decided to give this a try since it was pretty cheap. The build quality is excellent, and it really feels like a high quality product.<br /><br />When actually using it, however, it fails to impress. There is a noticable boost to the bass, but it doesn't really fill out the otherwise rather flattish music that an iPhone 4S can manage.<br /><br />Also, I tested it using both the A-jays Four and an Altec Lansing M50. The controls on the A-jays got disabled and overwritten by the Fiio, but it's good for the M50 as the headphones didn't come with controls.<br /><br />I suggest going to a local store to try it out before you actually buying it. And if you are used to your own controls, there are better bass boosters out on the market.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|Got this for my bf as a Xmas gift. The set looks amazing. I preordered it before it was released and it turns out Amazon dropped the price after I already purchased it so they emailed me and notified me that they would reimburse me the difference which they did in a matter of days.  This is what I call outstanding customer service.  Thank you Amazon you guys are the best!!!! :)
B0053KWDES|4.0|First, what I am using it on. I have iPad 2, headphones Bose Quiet Comfort 15 and for music source Pandora and Rhapsody. Second, it takes three hour to charge and it does not work while is charging. I don't know how long it will last on full charge(10 hours according to manufacturer), I have some doubts.<br />One thing I would agree is that it increases the power-volume of the sound and the base, NOT the quality. When I listen in low volume I can not hear any difference.<br />Now. I am not expert or audiophile, I just like to listen music. I see a lot of people gave Fiio great ratings that is possible due to some of them having higher impedance headphone(more $) and this amplifier can power up to their full potential. Mine is going back for refund.<br /><br />Update:<br />I decided to try E11 on set of non-isolating headphones and Bam-Wam there is the magic. I used V-moda LP and together with E11 made my ears hurt. Yet the headphones itself have enough power, at least for me. As a result I changed the rating from 2 stars to 4 stars and I am still returning it but for a different reason.<br />Those of you who have active sound isolating headphones(Bose QC15) would not benefit from it and for the other \\"freaks\\" out there who love real clear and bass boosting music with professional grade headphones ENJOY-Just keep in mind it could hurt your ears.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I watched this in the movie hall when it came out in '56, scared the life outta me. Box set comes w/ Robbie the Robot 4&#34; model. Also comes w/ The Invisible Boy DVD, this is the greatest!
B0084I9QLY|5.0|The quality of this picture vinyl is amazing. I love it and have it displayed in my home. I actually play it on my record player too. Bad is one of my favorite albums from my favorite artist of all time, the late great Michael Jackson.
B00A77II0U|5.0|wonderful story kinda creepy but was fun couldn't stop playing it. wish they were all this good. I have bought others that would freeze up and not let me complete the story. this one did freeze a few times but would come right back up.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Confessions On A Dance Floor placed Madonna back into the limelight with a stunning album of front-to-back top quality synthpop that merges the sonic and lyrical ambition of her club-fueled 80s' anthems with a street-smart euro-dance concept by the hands of English DJ / producer Stuart Price. The album's pristine production and compositional values stand proudly among the works of synthpop maestros like Pet Shop Boys and Kraftwerk (while paying occasional tribute to them on the samples), if not being brought down by occasionally infuriating, semi-consistent bursts of pretentiousness from the pop diva in either lyrical ('I Love New York') or musical ('Isaac') clusters that evidently go beyond her scope of expertise.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|although he is kinda single minded at times i get hooked into his personality,  although this wouldnt be a show without jesse
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this book because I already have read the other 2 books in the series and I thought this book was just spectacular. It was a thrill ride at every turn.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|This is a great movie that is way under-rated! We have seen this and will definitely watch it again - it is a keeper!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|very odd - had to uninstall - just seems like some kind of joke - plenty of good reviews - I have no idea why this app didn't work
B005J6LKVI|5.0|One of the best movies - we have watched it twice already (and have seen it prior to buying this blu-ray/dvd).
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|First saw this on TV and had to have it. The DVD was great. When we saw the Blu-ray was available we had to have it. Its worth every penny! The scenes are sharp and the detail is unbelievable. We are enjoying it immensely.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|One of the year's best movies! Hilarious and touching all at the same time. We will watch it again and again!
B0075564A8|5.0|This is my favorite! I love the documentary about Blond Ambition tour!  I  would recomend this DVD to every fan! Must be in their collection!
B0043H9VTM|3.0|Unfortunately, when I made the purchase, it was not that clear in the description that this was for a different playing region and the DVD was in Italian. I normally pay attention to this kind of detail but I felt that this was unclear in the description. Otherwise, it was received in a very timely manner - unfortunate that I now have to pay for shipping back for my refund. Sellers of items like this should make clear in BOLD TYPE what the playing region and language are. The seller did respond quickly with regards to an RA (return authorization).
B00005T7I1|3.0|I don't like this kind of movies.  Just bought it because I wanted to see Madonna. he is not the best actress, but I love the ways she sings!
B009G7WUME|5.0|The album is great. It is not new, so no need to review the album itself. The majority of those looking to buy this album on vinyl have already listened to it many times.<br /><br />This 2012 vinyl release sounds pretty good to me. I am listening to it right now and I am really liking what I hear. It is a single 180g LP in black, cut from the original ANALOG master. So far no defects in pressing noticed. Much recommended.
0385536828|5.0|How do you marry postmodern sensibilities with conventional narrative and storytelling? Sweet Tooth pulls this off with great style.<br /><br />Acutely self-aware as a work of fiction, with numerous stories within stories and with countless authors, readers, and documents of all kinds, this is nevertheless a warm, wonderful tale beautifully told. The plot resolution, given the \\"choices\\" the author offers in his many nested stories, is an echo of the redemption in his novel Atonement, and is entirely convincing. It's sweet. In some ways it reminds me a lot of another favorite of mine, Fowles' The French Lieutenants Woman.<br /><br />But aside from all the clever tricks, this is a straight-ahead great novel, beautifully written.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Excellent music from an excellent singer. I have always loved the voice being Evanescence and some of these songs are some of my favorites in the whole genre!
B002VECM6S|5.0|If you need a good family night movie, for kids say 10 and up, then this is your film. There's mention about drug sales/use in the depressed inner-city area where Michael Oher came from but it's not shown or glamorized. At the end of the day, it's a film about one person/family doing what they could to change the circumstances they saw directly in front of them...not the entire planet...it's about responsblity and compassion. I love this film and bought it for the youth center where I work. Another good film, similar themes is &#34;Forever Strong&#34;.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Soul surfer was a very good movie.  It caught my attention right away.  I am soo happy with the ending.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Worst book ever. So annoying I had to skim over pages at a time. The texting/emailing drove me CRAZY. The sex was boring. I have NO idea how this book became a phenomenon.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|My wife played this till 3 am the other night. Good fun game but would recomend playing it on a tablet. Probably pretty hard on a phone
0007466064|5.0|Ecxellent read, especially if you have read the previous 4 books...sad that it didn't come with all 5 books so one could keep reading..Game of Thrones arrived with all books in one purchase..I would have desired that presentation
B007JWKLMO|3.0|Huge George Harrison fan and couldn't wait for this DVD to arrive. However, it does drag on a bit. Must be a huge fan to truly enjoy every long minute of this movie.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|An excellent review of historical U S A..love Oliver Stone's movies..this book was an amazing recollection of the United States
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Great graphics and good story but everything else is lacking. Game was shorter than I expected it to be and the hidden object scenes too easy. Not many challenging puzzles either.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Bought for my daughter who loves Tinkerbell and once again Tinkerbell is a hit at our house!  A great story for little ones!

B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Loved the movie.  One more addition to a burgeoning blu ray collection.  Everything came promptly in the mail without any damage at all.
1443413798|3.0|Having enjoyed The Angel's Game, I readily picked up Carlos Ruiz Zafron's novel, The Prisoner of Heaven, another part of his series of an uncertain number of books set in Barcelona involving the Cemetery of Forgotten Books . Zafron's prose is highly descriptive, and for readers of the earlier novels, the characters are immediately familiar and recalled. Zafron sets this novel in two time periods, 1939 and 1958, and he develops more fully the characters of Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres, David Martin and Daniel Sempere. When I finished this novel, I considered reading the earlier novels again, expecting even more pleasure from them all. Readers who like novels in which the setting and time period come alive and descriptive language dominates in creating a realistic atmosphere, are those most likely to enjoy this novel and the others in the series.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Excellent read I would recommend to anyone. Great plot and characters. Very hard to put down, can't wait for the next book.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Due to the radical climate changes ocuring in the United States during the las decade it is very important to have instant access to the weather forcast. The \\"Weather Live\\" app is a potential life saver.
B0015DRPJU|3.0|I feel obligated to finish this mildly entertaining series since I have already read the first few books. It's a nice &#34;filler series&#34; until some of my favorite authors release new books.
B008LSVLZG|5.0|This is the best live concert DVD I have ever seen or heard! Speaking everything. Powerful musicianship, songwriting, visual light show, etc. with only the possible exception of Pink Floyd during the Obscured By Clouds/Dark Side Of The Moon era. I have been a Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree fan since 1998 when I was first introduced to their music by a girl that I knew from Germany. He has really made his mark in the world of progressive/creative music, proving that by recently working with and remastering several of the King Crimson albums working with Robert Fripp himself, not to mention his remastering of some Jethro Tull albums as well. His own music projects with Porcupine Tree, No-Man, Blackfield, Storm Corrosion and Bass Communion have also deepend his insights and broadend his reach upon the masses. Here he shows himself to us without the use of another band. This is HIS band! All hand-picked by Steven. All songs are written by Steven. And he has chosen long-time Porcupine Tree artist Lasse Holie to help create the visuals as well as film the entire concert. The DVD title is exactly as stated. Steven has my highest regards as being one of the best in the world of music at present. So I must give this DVD my highest rating of 10 stars!!!! It just doesn't get any better than this!
