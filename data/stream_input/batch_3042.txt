B008RA3X5E|5.0|The graphics are clear and easy to see at a distance. I like that I change the brightness. I also like that I can change the alarm tones. I allows me to wake up gently., instead of be startled by the alarm.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|I love this movie, in part because it's great comedy with great characters, but also because I'm a software engineer so I can relate to the main characters.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|I thought it would be a good sci fi flick.  But I thought the person who wrote this must have been on drugs.  Don't waste your time.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I love this game. great little build game. good to kill time. no need to spend real money. great replay value
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|Another gift for my son....he loved it....as I have stated he loved the CD Pink Floyd is his favorite band....and he is trying to get all their songs on CD to add to his collection....
B00151HZME|5.0|The whole album seems great to me. I'm no music critic, just a guy that likes what he likes and this album I like quite a lot!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I love it....However I did not know it was about zombies...,,,but Brad Pitt my favorite......I recommend it to all the folks who like The Walking DEAD....and zombies movies.....as you know zombies have a better approval than the United States Congress....LOL
B00EKJWS1Q|4.0|Very rseful for email retrieval.  Lite version just right fir quick read, maybe not for more complicated activities...  Got what I wanted and glad I did!
B008G12ERC|5.0|A gift sent too my son....He love it....He is a fan of Muse and is trying too get all of their CDs to add to his collection...So I help him out when I can....
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Installed this app on my [[ASIN:B00E0EY7Z6 ASUS MeMOPad HD 7-Inch Tablet ]] as it works only in Portrait mode. The App worked okay (No crashes) and clearly proved my brain was severely underutilized as I was not able to get any concentration on the first try as my score was well below 50%. The choice of screen text was difficult to read the questions. The touch swipe responsiveness of the falling objects in the Ninja Game was poor thereby me failing in reflex tests. After about 1/2 hour of testing this app my brain started to hurt and I stopped using the App.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is worth a try hence 3 stars. But needs a lot of tweaking from the developer to make the screens more readable by changing the color of the text and may be have some choices for people like me who can start slow and progressively get difficult for the brain function to gradually catch up with the app.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|A lot of fun to watch.  Never a dull moment.  A few implausible moments like the plane crash but for the most part worth the time.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Normally I steer away from Stephen Kings books, but he was on the View to promote it and got my attention. I liked it particularly the gritty characters
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Heart warming film about two 14 yr old boys who find a man wanted for murder on an island. If you can forget about some of a couple of ludicrous scenes, the story is pretty compelling. Besides the main plot about helping Mud( Mathew McC.) get off the island, it really is about a fourteen year old learning about love and its complexities
0062059963|2.0|I really enjoyed the first book \\"The Selection\\".  It was new and refreshing.  But this book was just a drawn out debate by America on who she loved.  She would make up her mind then change it again 2 pages later.  Over and over and over.  It made me so disgusted with her character that I didn't want her to win Maxon anymore...let Kris have the guy.  Go home already.  The third one better has some kind resolution OTHER than who she truly loves or I will go nuts.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Loved this movie. Thought it would be depressing but was pleasantly surprized. Attracted to everything Maggie Smith does. NICELY DONE MOVIE!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|But i certainly liked it. It gave me freaking shivers when i read it and i am sure i will be reading it again. And, possibly, will contact Mr. Gaiman to ask for his permission to make a translation to Russian. It's not a full-size book, still, that's a masterpiece, no doubt.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This is a solid kids flick and it's really what you should let your kid watch instead of some r movie. It's not cynical and it's just a straightforward film about good guys in big robots fighting big alien monsters. It's a popcorn movie all the way.  what is really good about this movie is that unlike many cynical films the military people are the good guys!.  there's NO traitors or such crap or soldiers going mad instead it's just a solid flick about good military guys battling aliens. It's not a deep movie with great acting , nor was it intended to be.  Your kid will love this film and unlike gang rap crap or such he won't get the message that good guys are in fact the bad guys etc.  The special effects are very top notch in this movie!; as this was a very big budget flick. However if you want some kind of deep movie with deep characters go somewhere else.  This looks very good in 3d and I would say , watch it that way if possible. If you just want a feel good film about good versus evil then this movie is for you. This is not a great movie but it's a pure fun movie that is simple and very safe for kids and for adults who like all kinds of flicks, people like me, and I even  watch the sinister giallo movies  and that's not the type of films that kids should ever watch!
B008EL25LE|5.0|I USUALLY DO NOT WRITE REVIEWS BUT THIS ONE I MUST. THIS WAS A FREE OFFERING ONE DAY. WOW IT IS GREAT. GRAPHICS-MUSIC-CHALLENGE-FUN! OUTSTANDING. I USE A SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 WORKS GREAT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. IN FACT, IT IS WORTH BUYING
B009BJAPLK|4.0|More a comment on the series than the specific episode or season: was skeptical at first but really think they've managed to put a great spin on the old classic stories that makes them different and interesting without losing connection to the original. As an example, the last episode is the &#34;Reichenbach fall', an obvious nod to Conan Doyle's famous finale yet very different. And I love Sherlock and Moriarty, a couple of crazy and unpleasant geniuses with an uncanny bond between them.
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|I love these HOG games and this one isn't bad. As a 54 year young woman , I use these to keep  my mind sharp and to challenge that grey matter that's settling in. So far this isn't a bad one and can be a little challenging when it comes to locating some of the objects but that's what I like. So it's not bad at all, I'll probably replay it again when I'm done .
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I really enjoy the Longmire series and never miss an episode.  As I was reading I couldn't help but see all the characters in the series.  I will definitely be reading more of these stories.  I highly recommend, especially if you watch the show.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great plots<br />Each episode stands alone , but like to  follow each session<br />I highly recommend this to my friends
B001TH16DI|5.0|I've loved these movies since I was a kid. Glad to finally have them in Blu ray. Really great buy.
B009YQJ322|5.0|i loved it. i rented it from netflix and LOVED it, i just had to own it! i would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone! followed the comic books series and hope for a second. 1000 time better then the original
B001HLZMUE|5.0|this is a family tradition at halloween. too many young people don't see it anymore! download a script and sing along!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I can't decide if I lke this or not.  It is quite challenging but makes you feel good when you figure ti out.  currently stuck on one fo the floors but hoping to figure it out soon.
B002J2PB10|5.0|but if you grew up watching b movies in the 70's this will definitely take you back. It is hilarious and vindicating
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this go available for my Kindle Fire.  Love this game.  Am currently stuck on level 70 so I will be there awhile.  A little frustrating but fun!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great filler game between or waiting on appointments. Would suggest this to those who do not want to get very involved with a game.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|I've always loved this movie.  It is a great kids movie with a lot of imagination.  My 6 year old boy even enjoyed it.  It has drama, action, and comedy.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|We loved it and finally finished the series. Now were on another series. Both my husband and i really enjoy watching these series now that were retired.
1439192812|5.0|I bought this book for my teenager grand  daughter. The science explanations are very well done and represent quality scientific thought. The integration of myths and their potential origins is quite enjoyable. The writing is extremely readable. The explanations avoid overly complex aspects and terminology.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|I loved this the first time through, was totally addicted, and completed the game. I even recommended it to friends. However in going through it a second time, it is now stuck between week one, day six and week two, day four. When you finish that is takes you back to week one, day six; over and over again. It will not progress any farther, even though I've restarted the game a number of times. Too bad, I would have given this five stars.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Reading it to keep up with the Ken Follet books, but it is awful reading, about the holocaust, and the terrible treatment at the hands of the Nazi's.  He is a wonderful writer and I  will plowthrough the book.  Everyone should know what went on in WWll.  Ferne
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book gripped me from beginning to end and rocked me for weeks after i finished reading in a way that very few books have.  give it a shot!
B00005AREQ|5.0|I had &#34;Blow By Blow&#34; on vynl long before cds existed.  when it became available I owned it on cd also.  That was untill<br />my house fire.  I lost around 900 cds & a bunch of vynl.  I will soon have a copy of &#34;Blow By Blow&#34;.  I'll never own 900<br />cds again but I will own &#34;Blow By Blow&#34;<br /><br />  for sure<br />  Tim V<br /><br />  Tim V.
B005USZML4|5.0|Theo is a wonderful new series that deserves more.  While i enjoyed the hero, the story line is so easy to follow and a pleasure to chomp through 30-40 pages at a time.<br /><br />Am going to get the series for my 13 year old grandson who may see Theo as a hero and show that kids can contribute to society.<br /><br />High marks for a great story teller.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire HD! I haven't had any problems with it yet. Makes it so easy to do anything, search, buy, sell, pay for items, etc. It updated just now so I haven't tried it with the new update but I'm sure it's good. We'll update this post if not.
B009FAQ9JW|5.0|One of my favorites list!  Must see If your a western drama fan this is a great choice. Brando is that original tough guy!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved it. This one is a page turner. It was hard to put down to go to work. Characters are maturing.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|This well-acted story is a compelling cautionary tale of the quicksand beneath our economic system. Put your money under your mattress, folks. It's the only safe place!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Awesome!  Bing watched both first and second season!  Love it!  Excited for the Coven!!!  Debating if I should wait for it to be available in DVD or watch on cable!
B005HEPS6A|4.0|Good season, not the best.  Looks great in HD.  Beverley is back which takes a lot of the drama out of the stories.
B004A2V3K0|4.0|This CD is a must have for any Bon Jovi fan who wants a collection of his greatest hits music.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I am amazed every time I read a Brandon Sanderson book at how different they all are! What an imagination he has! I enjoyed everything about this book. His storyline is well thought out and, of course, new. His characters are well-developed and diverse. Thanks for another wonderful story! Can't wait for the next one!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I would I've it no stars as I am nt even able to load it to my device. Unfortunately the application needs more storage space than what I have. Even though I have no other apps but two on my device. But it still will jot down load. Oh well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on Kindle, I love it, and now my hubby is playing Candy Crush. I can play on break at work, in the car travelling. I'm so happy when I hear &#34;Sugar Crush&#34;. Its a win win for Kindle Fire.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I'm usually a slow reader but this series has kept me hooked, I saw the movie first and loved the idea and plot behind it so much that I NEEDED to read it.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|Did not like this app, does not work for me. Kindle only takes front view pictures and that does not work for me.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun to play. variety of animals is good too bad there are so many that cost acorns that either have to be bought or very slowly  earned.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I became an A7X fan about 4 years ago.  I had heard some of their music but had never payed them much attention until I bought their self-titled album.  After that I was definetely on board.  I like the Nightmare album but I find it to be a little loose.  Hail to the King is different in that the sound has a lot of energy.  The members have said in interviews that they worked together as a group on this album and I for one believe it shows.  I have no desire to get into disecting the record.  I cannot stand all the self proclaimed visionaries of what rock is suppose to sound like.  At the moment, my most listened to record.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book moves fast. At first you cannot figure out how the pieces of the puzzle fit, but it all comes together well.<br />I really enjoyed the first person narration and the way the main character takes you along for the ride.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|It's simple- if you like Facebook, you'll love this app. The only difference is that, if you want to play Facebook games, they need to be Kindle friendly. All other functions are availab. Thanks.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Yes, it's scary, but good scary! This story is so interesting, and you didn't have to read or see The Shining to appreciate it.<br />I loved the main characters Dan and Abra's relationship. All the elements of the supernatural, were like nothing I have ever read. I did not want this story to end.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This movie was so bad, I wish I could give it ZERO stars.  I didn't get the weird accents & the sister tie-in didn't make any sense. I wish I could charge Will Smith for the time I wasted watching this movie.
B009RX7IX8|3.0|I loved the two part episode featuring James Brolin as Castle's father. That is the reason I purchased this set. It is nice to have the 100th episode which paid tribute to Rear Window. Other than these, Castle is not a great series, merely watchable to pass the time. The discs themselves are in good shape.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As always King is a masterful mind mind at weaving intriguing stories. I could not put this down. I read all of his works. This was an exceptional story.
B00CL151G4|5.0|I enjoyed the series its first season and these discs are helping me appreciate it even more. A few discs are not playing well and will probably cause me to have to purchase a set again, but that is how  much I love this series.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|This was an entertaining movie. Good action and what I have come to expect from the series. Definitely worth watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great entertainment but the time outs are a pain.  I would rather buy it out right as I won't do the pay for extra lives bit.  Won't take long and I will loose interest in the game because of the time outs.
B000AP04NI|5.0|Great musical with nice tunes,... funny how some songs sneak back into our lives several years later?????: e.g.. orange & mango juice ad ( &#34;Oh What a Beautiful Morning&#34;)
B001EBV0NU|4.0|Was perfect to watch while we had the Government shutdown - can't we ALL get along?? AK AK....<br />Great comedy and what a cast!!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I might not know exactly what I am doing, but I can pretty much limp my way through anything, but I could not get this up and running for my kindle fire hd
B00AW57L96|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Liane Moriaty's books and this was no different.  I would recommend this book to anybody looking for something a little bit different from the usual chick lit..
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I liked the suspense in the movie and the message to fathers to spend time with their children. Great overall movie.
B007G92QGO|5.0|Can't really say much except WOW!  Really enjoyed this book.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys reading.  I don't know what category I would put it in.  Hard to define, but definitely recommend this book!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I would say (and my husband too) that this is the best Iron Man yet. My teenage son didn't think so although he did like it.<br />I recommend getting this one.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I enjoyed The Final installment of this series. Although there were a lot of negative reviews regarding the ending, I don't agree with them. You can't always have everything fluffy and wonderful. I felt it was a nice little twist that no-one saw coming.<br /><br />Does it ruin the series for me? Of course not. Each book told a part of the story, even if there were some flaws..it's fiction. Does it ruin the outcome the upcoming movie as some people have commented? No. For me, one has nothing to do with the other. They are rarely the same anyway.<br /><br />Were the characters naïve? Yes! That being said, I liked that Tris evolved from the emotional mess she was in Insurgent. I liked that Four Had doubts about everything and faced an internal struggle. I also liked finally learning what was beyond the fence and that the world existing there wasn't a total salvation.<br /><br />Thank you Veronica for a great series. It was nice to step into your world for a while.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is first time playing candy crush now I see what everyone  was addicted to. Love this game  I play all the time now can't get enough of it.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|When my husband first brought this home I didn't even think I would watch the first 5 minutes. Even as he started it, I was doing something else. As it played in the background I was drawn in bit by bit. Then we watched the first season in a week. This show is so much more than motorcycle clubs. It's about family, friends, loyalty and trust. The cast is amazing! We were hooked right away! It's a show that keeps on giving.. humor, drama, sex..all of it! Thanks FX!!!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I have now read 13 Jack Reacher stories and I find them all interesting and entertaining with good story plots and lots of action.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|In my opinion there was absolutely NO chemistry between the two actors portraying Anne and Wentworth. I didn't find it believable that they shared this deep, profound love. It was almost painful for me to watch, I wanted to fast forward through it. I was hoping for more. Although this version was closer to Jane Austen's novel, I actually prefer the other version.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I heard a lot about this game so I was tickled to death to finally get to play it on my Kindle Fire.  The music and graphics are just silly fun and I'm enjoying it immensely.
1476712042|5.0|I started reading this as an alternative to all the vampire/ werewolf/ demon fiction currently flooding the market. Sure the characters aren't perfect, they are flawed. Human Nature. Realistic Fiction at it's best. I love Travis and Abby! I actually know a couple similar to this in my life...and they are an absolute train wreck..but don't people generally slow down, and take a look at the wreck? This is one of my faves of the year!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'd heard a lot about this game from friends that play it on their iPhones, and I was happy to see it finally available for the kindle fire. It's pretty addictive, but honestly I think I enjoy some of the copy cat games better. Having to wait to play (or being asked to pay) in order to keep playing after losing a few lives is ridiculous. Maybe other people that were used to playing this game are used to this rule, but I don't like it at all. If an app is free it shouldn't constantly prompt you to pay just to play it. One positive thing is that the graphics are really good on the kindle fire and it's easy to play on this platform. Glad it's a free app because I would never pay for this. I think I'll stick to Fruit Drops.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|Once Upon A Time..this was a fantastic show. Season after Season I have loved watching Dexter try to balance his family life with his \\"Dark Passenger\\". Sadly though this last season was very disappointing for me. In my opinion the final episode of the series was an epic fail. Perhaps it's better that the series has ended.
B00C2C637I|3.0|Interesting style of writing. I had heard what a great writer Ray Bradbury is but I just could not get into it. His narratives are confusing though beautiful writing.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This show is refreshing! I love this show, it is my newest obsession! I am hooked. It is Sci-Fi, Drama, and a little Twisted, all rolled up into one awesome package. The characters are interesting, the storylines are well developed. Well written series that only gets better each episode. In the midst of Reality TV it is fantastic to have a good quality show to watch.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Great movie my 3 year old can't get enough! It's also fun for adults to watch. I've seen at least 5 times at this point!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This came on HBO and I thought, well it's not necessarily my thing but why not? It gives an insight from the soldiers point of view into the US invasion to Iraq in 2003. I thought it was more realistic portrayal compared to others I have seen in this Genre. The casting was excellent, it blended actors with actual soldiers who took part in the invasion. I have to say, it totally sucked me right in. I watched the remainder of the episodes AND then I bought the series. Time well spent!!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|All of our family loves Il Volo from the kids to the grandparents, we have every CD they have ever made and followed their career from the beginning. We feel like they are part of our family.  Their  unsurpassed super rich voices with all their wonderful nuances are one of a kind.<br />Now we have this superb new Christmas Album.  I love that they have retained their Italian accents, I hope they always do . Their heritage is part of what makes them special and we never want that sound to change.  Each song on this album is a classic Christmas song and Piero, Ignazio, and Gianluca, as always knows whose voice is fitted for each phrase or song.<br />Each of these young men's voices is showcased evenly on this albumn, some of these songs are on their previous Christmas CD - but my favorite part is that they do Christmas just like they do all their music with all their heart and soul. The song \\"Mis Deseos/Feliz Navidad\\" which includes the sweet, clear voice, of Belinda is a real stunner on this CD, beautiful harmonies and voice arrangements, if this song does not hit Christmas chart toppers I will be surprised. The rendition of \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" has some fun modern instrumental music that adds a refreshing feel to that old classic. The \\"Christmas Medley\\" is wonderful, and \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" made these young men sound like they were young enough to remember that joyous anticipation of maybe seeing Santa sometime between  going to bed on Christmas Eve and getting up on Christmas morning.<br /><br />Thank you boys for a wonderful Christmas present and we know you have worked so hard, you are an exception to the exceptional, we love every syllable that comes out of your mouths.
B004LROMSO|3.0|I love this era, King Arthur and his knights. For me the choice of Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur would not have been my first. His acting is weak and I find he does not draw me into the show. Eva Green on the other hand, excels at playing the evil Morgan who is constantly trying to regain her rightful place at the throne. Joseph Fiennes is good in the role as Merlin, even though he can do magic, he regrets it everytime he does. Overall the show is ok.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was such a disappointment. It had so much potential to be a great ending to a wonderful series. It is a great book until the end. The ending was ridiculous and completely unnecessary. I understand the author wanting to be realistic, but she is a writing a dystopian novel for teenagers. We don't expect or want realism. We expect a happy ending for our favorite characters and that is not what we get. Overall, this final book left me with a horrible feeling and a desire to delete the entire series from my kindle. After so much waiting and anticipation for this series ending, I could not be more let down and disappointed.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote. I use it to remember everything. Any kind of information I need to keep track of goes into Evernote. I really like like how easily it syncs between my Kindle Fire and the Web version. I am constantly thinking of new ways Evernote can organize my life.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Enjoyed these characters and plot very much. How great it was to read about finding your first, true love many years later. I felt sorrow and happiness reading about their relationship and what an ending. Wow.
B004JMY312|5.0|This has become a cult classic! Hocus Pocus is on my family's &#34;must see&#34; list for the Fall Season. We love the fun and feel of the movie.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|Love it this movie is a classic I could watch it over and over  I highly recommend this movie 5 stars
B001O8D47S|4.0|While I prefer the original, I really enjoy this updated flick. I also appreciate the references back to the original.  Its a great story line and I love how you go through the whole movie, and never once miss all the men!
B0031RS4V6|5.0|One of the best I have read in the series so far.  Couldn't put it down in  places.  Don't read if you wish to go to sleep early s its fast paced.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I give this game a big thumbs up. Game makes you use your strategic thinking. Sometimes you have to put it down and come back it it...but you do come back.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really happy kindle finally got the real game. I read some of the other reviews and I don't understand why they would need a power up for level 23. I think they just did not want to keep trying. Either way works great for me.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Love this movie! It's funny romantic and suspenseful! It can be a good movie for girls or guys and I can't wait till the new movie comes out in November
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is very exciting and fun. Keeps my eyes glued to the screen all day long. I love this game a lot and I believe I always will.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time..playing it on my galaxy note was killing me. And I love this game. Thank you Amazon..You've finally done something right. I know my kids will beat me to the punch but ha ha I got an account already.
B00F6HI8CO|5.0|Love it! Can't stop listening to it!!!  Drake keep out doing the rest and going beyond his panorama!  Nice melodies along with the flows. Did I say I love it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A+<br />We love this game.my 3 year-old plays it all the time. Keeping him busy for hours. A great game.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's a good game if you're into medieval fantasy games, takes a while to level up but after that it gets fun.
B008PZZYB2|5.0|A very, very funny spoof on the fashion industry and fashion models. Ben Stiller and his father at their best.
006202406X|1.0|Last month, I read Divergent and Insurgent for the first time and was immediately hooked. The books had fast and unexpected plots. The story line was intriguing. The dystopian society was creative and compelling. The relationship between Tris and Tobias was real. They had their ups and downs-- but they always ended up working out their problems. Always.<br /><br />I was beyond excited to read Allegiant, until the unthinkable yet predictable happened. Tris died. The author audaciously had the protagonist die. Tris went through wars, revolutions, wounds, fights, simulations, serums, and everything imaginable... and ended up dying by a gun? A silly gun by a weak guy? I was crushed not only by the situation in which her death occurred, but how death broke the main, crucial, solid and unwavering relationship between Tris and Tobias. This relationship provided a foundation for the development of the plot and of other characters. When Tris died, the relationship died. When the relationship died, the story died. I cried. And cried. I was sad. I was mad.<br /><br />Ending the protagonist's life was without a doubt, a stupid move. Especially in light of how developed the character of Tris had become. Tris was a symbol of passion in the story, of bravery. Being killed for something she strongly believed in was an absolute act of bravery, but was this act necessary to this trilogy? No. Not at all.<br /><br />Overall, I am severely disappointed in the ending of this series. Katniss Everdeen did not die. Harry Potter did not die. Percy Jackson did not die. Frodo did not die. So, why, may I ask, did Tris die?<br /><br /> It was absolutely unnecessary.<br /><br />On the pages of the book, Tris is dead. But I can not accept this. So, in my mind, she is alive, because, as we all know, Tris is a character. She is not real. Death can not affect a fictional character. So, she lives on in the minds of all readers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play solitaire on my computer all the time.  I did not know it was available on my Kindle until my granddaughter told me I could get it for my Kindle.  I LOVE IT  It was  FREE but if it cost money I would gladly pay for it.  Only downside  --  I am spending too much time playing it while watching television.  Thank you and I love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is challenging from start to finish! I enjoy it. Never boring and I have recommended this game to my friends!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun, addictive, challenging and frustrating at times.....love this game!!!!! I hope they keep making more and more levels and challenges.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a great game cool graphics realistic game play slow motion shots. Overall one of the best hunting games I have played in a long time.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|we are totally addicted to this series.  love the fact that we can watch from start to finish.  It's a very cute and funny series
B0089LOG02|4.0|Good story but sad and depressing as there are some really bad people in here.  Different, so that is good.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Best show on TV, can't stop watching it wanting to see what happens next.  Will be sad when they end it at season 7.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|Just found this series...actually, didn't know it WAS a series.  But so glad it IS...I fell in love with Lexy, the baker and her Nana...can't wait to find out what they get into next.  So glad there are more to look forward to.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Have the rest of the &#34;Diehards&#34;  so I bought this one.  It is O.K.  Not as good as the first four.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Funny and clever. Easy way to spend a night in, but not a weekend night. Not funny enough for that.
1400097029|4.0|Death. Does it wash over the sick, the dying, and grieving like The Sea? Does it take each person on a journey whose end no one can predict or control?<br /><br />For Max Morden, the protagonist in John Banville's The Sea, the death of his wife and the haunting memory of childhood loss disturbs his mental foothold, and like a tidal undercurrent, takes him off balance. But was Max ever in-balance?<br /><br />Banville's language is densely poetic. From the very first line, \\"They departed, the gods, on the day of the strange tide,\\" we embark on a tidal emotional journey. With hints of imperfect characters, aren't we all, and perceptions of god-like humans reduced to ordinary fallible beings, The Sea reminds us that only our imaginings of places, people and things are perfect. In reality, we are all flawed, and to presume otherwise provides disappointment, even depression.<br /><br />Morden, an art-critic, is haunted by waves of memories that wash over him. Instead of washing away his inequities, the undulating waves of memory torment him. Are Morden's memories accurate? Are they fair? He questions the accuracy of these recollections himself. His mind isn't what it used to be. There is a reason for this. The sea is a painful place for Max. Yet it is to the sea and a town, Ballyless, where he spent his childhood summers and met the Grace family, which Max Morden returns to in order to grieve the loss of his wife.<br /><br />The grieving process is complicated; it stirs up memories of the distant past, painful memories. Max is a man who has difficulty dealing with pain, and using his own specific method of pain management, causes pain to others.<br /><br />Will Max land on his feet, \\"as if nothing had happened?\\" Is life so cruel that it coerces us to live on as if nothing has happened, even though loss has washed us over? Is it better to swim with the current, or against it?<br /><br />The Sea, is a poetic and painful reminder that life goes on after loss, whether we want it to, or not.it to, or not.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|As I say, &#34;they actually paid people to perform and make this movie, while there are real people who could have used the money in a basic job&#34;.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Maybe it's just not new anymore but I liked this the least of the three.  A lot of action but story was just okay.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|I like the variety of puzzles to put together. Sometimes I have trouble grabbing a piece when it is close to the = sign to expose the go back and home buttons.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|I purchased this for my niece's Kindle Fire that I bought her and the quality is just rather suspect.  The stitching seemed loosely held together and the material scratched very easily.  I imagine that over time her 4 year old was going to do a number on the Kindle, but I don't know that I would lend much reliability to this protecting it.  If you need a simple cover, probably ok, protection, not so much.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Really, really disappointed in the ending, but the magic components and actors were awesome!  I would recommend this movie, but do not expect great things from the ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I only use a few apps on my Kindle Fire. I was extremely disappointed when I noticed I couldn't play Candy Crush on my tablet. But now it's finally here. Nice to play on such a larger screen. And it's clean and crispy! FINALLY!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Watched first three seasons on my Kindle Fire HD... love it! Good storyline and not predictable.  Gives insight into the division of classes.
B002RI90WM|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed living a dogs life.  I wonder how appealing this book is to non dog owners?  Nevertheless, I recommend it and so does my 90 year old mother!
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I always loved Carole King and this album had many of the songs I loved the most.  I built a Good Memories Playlist and this album was quickly added to that.  Could anyone ever sing &#34;You've Got A Friend&#34; the way that Carole King did?<br /><br />My recommendation...buy it!  You won't be disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app helps me do my homework when I am stuck on  math answers on the paper that is why I love this app
B008Y212PI|4.0|This was the first flip pix game I tried. I enjoyed it very much. I would have liked a lot more levels for my $2.00, but that is my only complaint.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I absolutely love this show!!! The actors are great and are the perfect team. I recommend it to everyone. Give it a try and you will be hooked.
B005OZE9SA|1.0|1st review:<br /><br />The first one had issues on low level volume. Only the left speaker works then the volume is low. While I'm working on a song suddenly it shuts the right channel off. Then out of nowhere it mutes itself. Then after 5 seconds everything is back to normal. Then this repeats. On the headphones when the volume is low this time only the right headphone produces sound.<br /><br />So I asked for a replacement. The replacement arrived, just now! I just took it out of its box. Plugged it in. Guess what... This one is not even working. The 48v light turns on when you click the switch, but the tiny green light next to usb sign is not on, and the computer is not aware that a wonderful sound interface is plugged in.<br /><br />I asked for the 3rd replacement!<br />I'm sure this is a great product! And I'm sure on the 3rd one, I'll be able to work properly with this device that has killer reviews.<br /><br />I'm using a 2012 15\\" MacBook retina with Logic Pro X with KRK Rockit 6. Mac OS X 10.8.4<br /><br />2: Update<br />Amazon didn't sent me a 3rd replacement. And I'm really glad they didn't. I ended up saving a lot of money and buying [[ASIN:B00BB2QBLI Apogee Duet Audio Interface for iPad & Mac]]. After using Duet, I can tell you that any sound interface priced between 60 to 200 are the same thing. You may as well buy the simplest cheapest sound interface instead of this show off failure.<br /><br />I am very very VERY surprised about how many stars this product has.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|setting this up was so easy. Works great. Using youtube and netflix is super fun and easy.<br />doing the cast from chrome takes care of pretty much everything else.<br />great device for everyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad they finally made Candy Crush available for the kindle! Very fun, challenging and addicting game. Love it!
B00F56AZK4|4.0|This is a nice app it just needs more free puzzles there is like 5 or 6 free puzzles.  Overall this is a well established apps but could use some improvements.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The best game ever invented totally addicted! some times i can't get any work done until i run out of lives<br />the need to add lives faster.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|It has been a long time since I liked every song on a CD the very first time I heard them.  This CD is amazing.  Keep them coming Sarah!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Simply amazing! a must see series love the setting ,love the characters .<br />hopefully the writer won't take away any more of our favorite characters
0679731725|5.0|\\"The Remains of the Day\\" is a masterpiece that quietly yet surely impacts you logically and more so emotionally.<br /><br />I appreciate the variety and flow of the sentences and words.  Reading the book is like going down a winding river on an inner tube.  You will experience quick turns, ups, and even dreadful downs.<br /><br />The movie version was fantastic with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.  Yet, the book is the supreme masterpiece that can only be captured by reading it thoughtfully and in retrospect of one's own life.<br /><br />Pascasio (JR) Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I upgraded my older finis to the Neptune, it is much easier to use . i had a problem with one but customer service was very polite and sent me a new one quickly. just used again today and look forward to swimming tomorrow.<br /><br />i have moved my audiobooks and music from i tunes, overdrive and windows  no problems. customer service has been great<br /><br />i have since bought 4 swim goggles from finis, an ear plug and nose clip.  really good quality.  Gave a pair of goggles to my brother and he said its the first pair he ysed that don't leak
B00BKZUVGM|2.0|Don't buy this book! I was so excited but was disappointed Immediately. BORNING! Its like reading insurgent all over again! Also, the ending left me in utter horror and shock. These was absolutely so resolve at the end of the book, and what was very unsettling, is that what she did at the end added nothing to the story line, only left you disgusted. It ruined the whole series. If you really want to read this book, only borrow from a library or a friend.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's list is a beautiful film that shows a different perspective on the horrendous acts of the Nazi party. Simply breathtaking and heartbreaking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! Keeps you trying ways to reach goal and get those three stars!<br /><br />Yeah for this fantastic and wonderful  game!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is absolutely addicting &amp; I'm glad it's finally available on kindle! now I can play it even more haha
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a pretty good game and my so sister found it and I have been looking for it forever!!!!!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fresh and different.  Love the characters.  Finally a show my wife and I can really get in to.  First two season free with Amazon Prime!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read a lot of YA books, and after you read a bunch of them they all start to sound the same.  They follow the same plot and you can sort of see everything that is going to happen.  Whenever a book deviates from that and surprises me I'm usually really happy.  I think that really is impressive on the writers part to break out of the mold and tell a really new story or have a really different perspective.  So, part of me really wants to commend Veronica Roth for breaking out of the mold and for not giving me exactly what I wanted and expected.  But, in truth, there is a reason I keep reading this genre.  I like the happy endings, and I like the break from reality.  I like to see people persevere through difficulties.  At the beginning of the book I felt like Four and Tris' relationship was awkward.  It wasn't the way I remembered it, and I didn't like it.  I did like getting inside Four's head and seeing the difference in how the two of them saw the world.  But, their relationship was sort of weird.  So I skipped ahead to see if things worked out, I know thats awful, but I just like to know that the ending will be worth it. IT IS NOT.  I don't think I'm going to keep reading and I'm so mad about it.  I wish I had not seen what happens,but now I have and I don't think I can worth through the rest of the book.  I wish that I could praise the book and I appreciate the risk the author took.  But I WANTED A HAPPY ENDING and I feel totally unsatisfied.  I wish I had waited a days and read the reviews.  I wouldn't have bought it.
1848507836|4.0|This book made sense out of experiences I have had. I thank Anita for writing it and for going through the painful experience required before her near death and true healing. I recommend it to all thinkers with open minds.
B005GIS1WA|3.0|Rio was cute. It had some good points and was very sweet. Not much of a fan of Carnival though.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|None of the nuns in my school - junior high or high, looked like Audrey Hepburn. Heck- they didn't even look like Katheryn!! They were more along the lines of Ruth Buzzy, but without the sense of humor.<br /><br />Overall, this was an excellent movie that I had never heard about until a reviewer of my fantasy book series pointed me in the direction of this movie- by me seeing what else she had reviewed.<br /><br />I'm nosy that way...
B00FJTYDKK|1.0|This movie was really strange. We got half way through and decided to watch something else because the story was getting more weird by the second and we felt for being half way through it wasn't really going anywhere.
0451197879|4.0|wife's happy so i'm ha happy man, thanks. not what i thought but i get what i paid for. thanks again
B001EBWINQ|5.0|An enjoyable timeless classic! Picture quality was excellent.  Very easy to download, a pleasure to watch and included captions in different languges.
0451197968|3.0|again you get what you pay for , but wife's happy. so i'm a happy guy, i cant say anything else about this book
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|On the edge of my seat! Love watching it marathone style. Can't believe there's an end season in sight. Love those boys.
B001IKKMCW|4.0|it's a great movie, a lot better in blu ray then dvd, and the surround sound is a whole lot better, thanks
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it from beginning to end. Two people recommended this book to me and now I will go thank them.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|How was this an oprahs book club selection? This shallow author took the journey of a lifetime, wrote about it and never questioned a higher power or the meaning of life.  Her focus is permanently inward, trapped inside a narcissistic, selfish filter.  Her character is at once unlikeable and I spent the rest of the book hoping she would redeem herself with a mind blowing epiphany that never happened.  If you want a good read about adventure, comedy, life epiphanies and a little historical and geographical research, read a walk in the woods by bill Bryson.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The Husband's Secret is a compelling beach type read-think Jodi Piccoult or Chris Bojhalian. Although the situations are a bit like a Lifetime movie, the story does move along, and one is compelled to keep reading. This novel will definitely pass the time on your next long flight or doctor's office waiting room.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I loved the cartoon as a kid and loved this trilogy.  I never tire of watching it.  Highly recommend it.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|In Season 3 it seemed like most episodes centered around the character of Rodney McKay.  That seemed odd until I realized how his character was developing, and then it was interesting.  Meanwhile, the visual effects are great and some of the sci-fi ideas are interesting.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun but sometimes overly complicated  as far as finishing tasks and progression also, I wish that the game didn't require so much once you open up the first 5-6 rooms
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Luv the movie! There are no love stories, sex or vulgarity. I enjoyed watching the movie with my kids. Definitely a movie to watch in October. Trick or Treat!
B00E5N8E6K|5.0|This is why they are the best rock band ever. Very tight and thoroughly entertaining. Def Leppard have proved themselves over and over again. Magic!
B005N4F48Q|5.0|Great depiction of several of the key leading officers for both the South and the North of a key event in the American Civil War.  It illustrates the utter devastation of war for all who participate...and probably the shear stupidity of war itself.  The music is beautiful and at the same time haunting.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Like the other Sherlock episodes, this episode is well written and the production quality is excellent.  The acting is very good and brings the characters to life in a modern way.  This episode is humorous and full of mystery, or course, and will leave you guessing until the very end.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like it its pretty awesome and I think that it couldn't get any better so play this game at your loacal apps
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I loved reading the experience but thought the rest was a bit redundant but then it got interesting again with the question s a d answer portion.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|What a joke!  This is a terrible script, bad acting, and total waste of time all rolled into one painful ball.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show and Justified are my favorites, and are both just awesome.  Kurt Sutter is brilliant.  I've been watching since season 1, and it's still great!
B00915G6MG|5.0|Awesome show!! I LOVE  it.  I have every season.  I can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.
B000002RXS|5.0|This is my favorite Carmen, period. In fact, when I first got into opera, it was the first recording I ever listened to...I immediately fell for Callas. Callas is not the most \\"perfect\\" opera singer, but her voice possess a unique quality that make it simply unforgettable and irresistible. Try the arias \\"Pres des ramparts de Seville\\", \\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\\" and you shall see. I think the role is made for her (so does Norma). 1964 was slightly over her prime years - but, I found no sign of vocal fatigue in this recording.<br /><br />Pretre's Orchestra de Paris is also very well done.<br /><br />Bravo !!
1452126577|4.0|I love Grumpy Cat, so I knew I had to get her book.  I just think she is so cute!  And I love sarcasm, so this is just a quick, silly, fun read.  Something to grab when you want a quick pick me up.
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|Wonderful...can't wait to see them this Dec 6th, 2013.<br /><br />Love them love them<br /><br />Best songs.....Future Days & Sleeping By Myself
B00F52YOPA|4.0|this is my type of game i just wish it was a little easier to see the objects and also sometimes when you tap with your finger it is slow to respond,but yes i will continue to play it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|WTF...Pre-ordered this book after waiting months and months for it. I had to work today so I haven't had a chance to read any of it yet. Imagine my complete surprise when I went to see the reviews. I was shocked. I was so sure that I would be reading reviews about how great this book was and how worth the wait it was and instead everyone hates it. WOW. What the hell happened? I read each and every review to see why everyone disliked it so much. Even the ones that revealed the spoiler. I know how pissed off I was when I read Taking Chances and she killed off my beloved Chase and that was only one book. I swore I hated that book and it took me like a month to get over it. I don't know what to do now. I guess I will read it since I have waited so long and now that I know what happens on the dreaded last page I can be prepared for it. Thanks everyone for your reviews they have helped me knock my expectations down since they were so high for this book. I have been talking about it non-stop for weeks. Now I just feel let down. Will continue my rant after I actually read it maybe it wont be as bad as I think
B009MYARIK|5.0|I've read a lot of Sophie's books and I always enjoy them.  I love her British humor and the books are fast moving.  Her characters always goofy and lovable.  Wedding Night is fun to read and keeps you laughing and wondering what will happen next.
B00F88H5K2|1.0|I checked this out of my local library. Glad I did because it was horrible. The picture quality looked like something from a 1975 video movie. The script was horrible and the acting wasn't much better. And its not that the movie was about a gay icon that made it so bad. The production value just wasn't there and you can't fake that kind of stuff.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book to pieces, I am so excited about the movie too! I hope more people read this book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this on my kindle. It great on the bigger screen!  This game is so addictive, I love it.
B003ZA0C5U|4.0|Great airplane scene in opening. Interesting concept. Well executed. Enjoy it for what it is. A few fun surprises make it worthwhile.
B000001E8P|5.0|After the death of Kurt Cobain, I lost interest in music for a short time.<br />Helping a friend at his record shop, I heard Suede's debut album and got hooked into Brit music for the next 7 or so years. Although Suede was my favorite band of the era, this Pulp album was the best.<br />An absolute masterpiece, the lyrics captured the mood of Britain- especially Common People which illustrates the hopelessness that so many feel.<br />Get this album now, young regret it.<br />Well your bank account may regret it as it'll turn you on to so much great music that never got the chance in America
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great for zoning out and doing something mindless but fun. It's also challenging and can pull you back to concentration. I also liked the addition of the bridges section.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Great humor and style. Addictive and fun. Cartoon strips give a hint to the puzzle with a funny flare. Find secondary items and your buddy ferret to get all three stars. Hint button solve if you get stuck or just can't fined it all. Very cool hope there will be more to come.
B00C4QD5IW|5.0|Loved the story line of  both the heroine and the father.  While surrounded by disappointments and heartbreaks, the characters fight through while usually trying to do what is right, but not always succeeding.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|im soooooooooo happy candy crush is available on the kindle.....and its free!!!!!!! i would definitely reccommend this app to any one.....kid or adult. it is highly addictive... but worth it!!!! get this app please!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been waiting forever for a candy crush kindle ap.  game looks and feels great!  The only thing I would change is being able to see how many lives I have on the game screen.  I don't know that I'm out until I get to the &quot;Oh No&quot; screen.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|The most eye-opening moment in this book for me was when the author explained that there are class of problems where forecasting the event is almost impossible but the probability of the event can be forecasted quite precisely (e.g. earthquakes). I also enjoyed the book's very pragmatic approach that makes Bayes' theorem quite accessible.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|To get the full enjoyment out of this move you have to see it in 3D. It is spectacular.  The animals and sea life really make a big impression in the 3D format. Boy, talk about a story coming to life. If it is possible for you to watch it in 3D I highly recommend that you do. I can only imagine, since I have not seen the regular version, that the range of emotion you get from watching the images become bigger than life has to be superior over the regular DVD. The beauty of it will take your breath away.<br /><br />p.s. Didn't go into the story line in general, there is enough info and speculation on what this story is about in other reviews. Hope this doesn't tick you off that I just wanted to talk about the 3D version.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|This LCD BacPac is handy, but I just wish the protective case for the back fit the front case that the new Plus editions come with?!?!
193700788X|3.0|This has been one long series. Most of it a very fun read. You really get to know and love, or hate the characters. It would be difficult  to wrap a series like this up.  I think there will be readers who would have liked to have seen there favorite character win out in the end. Me for one. But it isn't our story it belongs to Charlaine Harris and this was her vision. All in all it is sad to see it go. I was surprised at who Sookie ended up with. I don't remember her really every having a strong romantic hook up with this person. To me it was always a one sided thing. I am disappointed that Bill was never able to make his way back to her. Eric was hot, but Bill was the first to win her heart. I think he always loved her.  Poor Bill. Any ending would be a let down since it is the end. I felt it here, maybe it should have gone out with more of a bang. It just kind felt like a weak ending.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|For many readers and reviewers thus far, it seems one of Allegiant's mistakes lies in its realism. I'm not bothered by the absolutely brutal realism that Roth gives us in the ending of this book, but I am bothered by the context it's been thrown into... and the places where that realism is abandoned, where the plot loses its sense in an effort to resolve what the author has deemed not worthy of properly solving. With the dual perspectives, we are given dual endings. One half serves as shock value, and what many are referring to as \\"preachy\\" as Roth hammers in the themes she has stretched over the trilogy. The other half serves as an oversimplified (to the point of being illogical) solution to one of the problems brought up in the series. It almost felt like the one half was intended to be so shocking that Roth expected readers to not realize that the other bit of what was going on really made no sense at all.<br /><br />In Divergent, readers were given action and character development throughout the book. With Allegiant, things felt slow (though rushed towards the end) and disconnected. Readers are taken out of their comfort zone and into much more boring territory, where what lies outside the fence is revealed to be completely uninteresting. Complications in the plot, which eventually led to the entirety of the book not making much sense, were often petty problems that took up time that could have been better spent. Ultimately this book was a disappointment, and it was not that Roth did not give us our perfect ending - it's that this book did not have the magic of Divergent.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Even if you have seen the original a million times it is so much fun to watch the 3D version. You can't help but enjoy it when the dino's pop out at you. Very exciting and fun.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|I barely laughed.  I loved the first one so much, and the second one was entertaining, so I thought I'd give this a chance.  It wasn't even that it wasn't funny, it wasn't even that entertaining.  I was waiting for it to be over.  The only funny scene is after the movie is over and they have an additional scene.  If the movie would have been like that, then it would have been great.  If you get the movie just skip to the end and watch the additional scene and save yourself the money.  Very disappointed.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|it can take everything i throw at it and still take more, i dont use major process hogs like editing software so the biggest spike in usage is when i play games on the machine
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I have two other DVD's of his and this by far is the most romantic of all. The setting in Italy is magnificent. Play it twice when I got it.
B007R21JJK|5.0|it has the chip-set that allows for better integration with nvidia cards and has a eSata port on it, that's all i wanted
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that King.com decided to allow Kindle Fire owners to purchase Candy Crush Saga.  Love playing it on the Fire!!
B0093QHWLC|4.0|I didn't know anything about the movie before watching it.  It was suspenseful and kept your interest all the way through.  Acting was very good.  Surprise ending.
1476734941|3.0|I thought the book made the case for this approach to fasting for weight loss and better health. My husband tolerated the approach better than I did. My hot flashes returned, which was unexpected and I had trouble sleeping on my fast days. I looked for research fasting and menopause but never found anything that explained my experience. I finally decided that, since I wasn't overweight and was already relatively healthy, I would leave the fasting to others. I did learn from the experience that it's ok to be hungry for a while.
B00ECLTYOG|1.0|Not even worth watching, I was so very disappointed... think they really needed to stop at Hangover II and call it good.<br /><br />:(
B008BLBUDQ|5.0|My daughter needed this for one of her AP classes. She had a whole packet to complete before school even started. It arrived on time and in great condition.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Another great season from what is becoming my favorite television drama! Julianna Margulies gives another stellar performance. The plot thickens.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Pretty good, considering Brandon jumped on the YA wagon. Dark enough that I forgot a number of times. overall: short and fun
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show, neither heavy or light in plot content, the characters are great and Julianna Margulies gives a wonderful performance as Alicia Florrick. Highly recommend.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great follow-up to The Shining. As usual, Stephen King draws us in and won't let go. Great read! Don't miss out on the fun.
B00E95ED32|5.0|Album is a breath of fresh air in music; creative lyrics with unique blend of instrumental including country music - amazing!
B0091WNK8M|4.0|A great, fun and classic movie!  Funny and good for almost the whole family (there is some cussing and words, so be careful about too young).  Rented via Amazon Prime direct to TV.. the sound was a little low and muted.
B00AJF87QU|5.0|I have heard all the songs on the radio and wanted to share them with my daughter who lives in USA but hails from South Wales.  She loved the album.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I've used AVG on my computers for years, so when I got my new smart phone it was a forgone conclusion that I would install AVG. It works well, runs without interfering with your phone. A periodic email asking you to upgrade to a paid version is the only intrusion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great tool for bible study.  You can change versions with a touch of your finger.  I love it.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|This game has some really good storyline.I am looking forward to playing more,even though hidden object games are my absolute favorite games to play.
006202406X|1.0|Who kills off a main character? Even Suzanne Collins had enough sense not to kill Katniss. Roth just surpassed Mockingjay as being the worst ending ever. I have no idea what Roth was thinking. Did her editor skip sections? Killing Tris was not necessary and shows a deep disrespect for her fans. This book ruined the series. I'm sorry I read it. I won't be going to the Divergent movie - too angry.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I really enjoy the show.  I was a little disapointed the 2 major scenes were missing ~ not sure why.  Can't wait for Season 4 to come out.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|having heard several people comment on how much they enjoyed this game I decided it was for ,me.  Put it on my kindle and<br />find it hard to put down.  Am only on level 8 at this time but can see where this will be a challenging game to have.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|or want it for that matter.  This application presents pdf files clearly and quickly.  I have one other application that I use for viewing pdf files but my preference is for this one.  I have Adobe disabled.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this game is both entertaining and challenging.  quick reflexes required.  found it  a little confusing in selecting which game to hunt but once determined, it is a gzme worth having
B003E8P9G0|5.0|The book is really good I read almost every book by Rick Riordan I like his books I think they are the best
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Extremly fun and challanging. This has many levels and is full of mini games, so it never gets old. I must sat im addicted.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I got this based on other reviewers comments and  was initially disappointed thinking I'd made a mistake but after the first few chapter the book builds momentum and is a great read . Good story and good character development which sadly seems to be missing so often I writing these days
B005PK56TA|5.0|Some people just never get a chance to enjoy their own house .....or do they? Great thriller series with a knockout cast . I'm going for season. 2!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I read all of the current books in this series. The first book does a lot of building, so it moves a little slow, but each book just gets better and better.
B004LWZW24|1.0|Poorly written, poorly edited, bad cinematography, and badly directed and acted (Patrick Wilson is usually always good even in poor material); they clearly didn't know what to make of the nonsense in the scripts they were given to perform. Not scary, not eerie,  and almost impossible to make heads or tails of since three quarters of it is in near total darkness. And the plot? What there is we've seen  many, many times before...with a surprise????!!!! twist at the end...hardly. You can practically figure it all out in the first fifteen minutes. Insipid, insane, the only thing insidious about this is that people had to pay to watch this crap!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|We enjoyed it. Plenty of suspense and twists. Different plot. Good acting by good actors. Worth the rental price tonight.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have only used this version a few times. I can say that it has not frozen are quite responding like the other app. that I first recieved. I will keep them both to compare against each other.
B00EO4SBSG|4.0|First off let me say that Trivium is my favorite band. My top 5 are Metallica, Avenged Sevenfold, Five Finger Death Punch, 10 years. In my top 10 resides, Deftones, Killswitch Engage, Sevendust, Chevelle,and All That Remains. So this gives you a idea of what I like and what I expect out of a band. With that being said I am not disappointed with this CD by no means but, Im not estatic either. I really was hoping these guys would continue to be one of those few bands that would have 8 minute long songs that go all over the place and take you on a heavy musical rollercoaster, with screaming, growls, killer riffs, solos, slow it down, speed it up, and less singing, with more music. Unfortunately they are headed in the more mainstream direction. The signs were all there, Draiman producing it, the initial songs released on you tube (Strife and Brave this Storm), and the time for the tracks. Both my favorite bands A7X and Trivium have went to this more mainstream approach! Not a happy camper about that! The more I listen to this CD the more I like it though, my top tracks are (No Way to Heal,At the End of this War, Through Blood Dirt and Bones, Inceneration:The Broken World, Wake(The End is Night), As I am Exploding). So I cant give it a 5 star because of this. But, it is a solid 4. They dont need help with production from Draiman, they are far better than Disturbed will ever be. The bad thing is DOWN With The Sickness will out sell and be more popular than anything Trivium could ever put out!LOL
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this app! It is always very accurate and it gives specific detail! I hope this review helped you decide I whether or not to download this app. ;)
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I really loved this double love story that is anything but a chick flick. It's heart pounding violence one minute, and funny the next.
B000K3M1VI|5.0|I have always wanted to see this movie. Don't want to say too much, but as a mother, it was gut wrenching to watch. There's no other way that this movie could have ended.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have been a fan of the divergent series since it was first released. I have to say that while I find Ms. Roths writing to be exceptional as ever I have some very strong and negative feelings about this final book. In fact, I wish that I had not read it at all so I could have gone on in blissful ignorance and drawn my own conclusions.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I read this book in 3 hours! It&#34;s that good! Steve is straight up about what it takes be a creator and live from heart by overcoming the resistance of complacency and mediocracy.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This movie is a vehicle for showcasing the emerging but wanting talent of the son of a very popular and talented superstar.  There are enough liberties taken with the suspension of reality that this science fiction movie could be called STupid and was not worth the $5 rental.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|This game isn't bad<br />To me it is awesomely awesome and exciting at some point it make my day wen I'm bored
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and it has finally become available for my kindle fire.  Play this game everyday, every fun and addictive.  Best game ever!
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|This is a great book that help you understand how to reprogram your mind in every way. You want to success in life, love, career, wealth and everything. This book could guide you to success in everything that you want. But the most important thing is you have to believed in the power of affirmations. If you ask me, yes I believe. Well, Good Luck! :)
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I love the show. And I like it even more when I getva good deal on it like I did from this shiper was exactly as well as described and very well taken care of with the shipping.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I never cry after reading books. I never do. (Well except for Harry Potter when Dumbledoor died.)  Let me tell you something, I cried after reading this book. Yes, it was really sad in the end but is I can say one thing, I gave it 5 stars for a reason. This is now one of my favorite books! I absolutely love it! I'M an eight grader and I found it right at my reading level. I highly recommend this book! Thank you so much John Green for writing this amazing novel!!!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is an incredible unexpected journey filled with love and sadness. Surprisingly enough I enjoyed this book more than the fault in our stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a fun game for all ages I love how the theme changes every. So often I am pleased to rate this app 5 stars
140006922X|5.0|it sure enhanse my knowledge of history. it was a book about history that the average person do not get .sure recommend it
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's an ok game, a bit tedious after a while, but not bad. I would recommend adding more features and maybe a connect between all devices it's on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I always play this on my parents I phones so I was dying to get and now I  Elvis that I  is the best game ever you should get its AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|The Great:<br /><br />*This book was written in such a way that you could feel what the characters were feeing. I really loved Eleanor and Park's love story - I totally agree with another reviewer on here - their handholding scene was ADORABLE. They were so sweet and cute, I could just gush about their story.<br /><br />*The author is SO good about putting you in the character's shoes. You will feel their pain, awkwardness, hope, and every other emotion. I definitely cried when I finished this book - if you are at all sentimental, you probably will too!<br /><br />The Not-So Great:<br /><br />*One word - language. I could have done without the shock effect of the language, and that is the only reason I voted it with one less star.<br /><br />Thank you, Rainbow Rowell for writing such a lovely story.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This  is an awesome app a lot of people should..try it this game is easy-hard but eventually you will get  it
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|This game is upsetting! ONE plays for awhile. Then it FREEZES UP  at random times!  And , I very much like  Match 3 alike items!--games.  ...Reluctant  to buy  anymore games from same maker!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, addicting and competitive for yourself and with others.  Definitely beats the old &#34;solitaire&#34; games we're used to playing.  Love it!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|The only thing I didn't like about it is that the alarm isn't loud enough. I would have to have it next to my ear to hear it. To be fair though I do have some hearing loss.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was so exciting all the way to the end! I loved Percy Jackson in this book especially with Annabeth at his side! The quest was so exciting with a lot of twists and turns! Rick Riordan best book yet! Can't wait until the House of Hades!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in years - I was a huge fan in the 80's and early 90's but some of his later books just didn't deliver with the endings and I stopped reading because of that.  I bought this one with trepidation; like many, I found myself wondering what happened to Danny Torrance once he left the Overlook on that snowy evening, barely escaping with his life.  This book gives you that answer and much, much more.  I've always thought that King wrote characters and people like no one I'd ever come across - his combination of folksy humor and bawdy commentary has been a hallmark of all of his books and the reason he hooked me from &#34;Carrie&#34; on.  I was hesitant to recommend this book to anyone before finishing it and having a chance to digest what I'd read but if you're coming back to King as I did with this book, you will not be disappointed.  Buy it, read it, and enjoy it!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I like this very much but the streaming kept searching repeatedly.<br />This was my first attempt at using amazon streaming. I will try again.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I hate games that suck you in and then ask you to pay to continue... This game does that and I have no use for it or those sort of practices.
0765337541|5.0|I read Ender’s Game for the first time over ten years ago. So, I wanted to read it again, to refresh my memory, before the film released.  Knowing the “big reveal” made some of the wonder lessen. But I still thoroughly enjoyed reading it again. Maybe even more than the first time. I found myself reading slower and taking my time to understand Ender a bit more this time. And since I knew what was going on, a lot of the back-and-forth between those in charge made a lot more sense. Also, having read all the future installments, I can appreciate the journey of Ender and Peter a bit more.<br /><br />Ender’s Game is a true science fiction classic, in my mind. I’m glad it’s finally coming to the big screen, so that it can get a wider audience. It’s a coming-of-age story set in a science fiction adventure with unforgettable characters. Though bred to be humanity’s savior as a brilliant soldier to fight the aliens, Ender is just a boy who wants love and acceptance and to do the right thing. Whereas, Ender’s brother Peter is jealous and cruel with scary psychopathic tendencies.  And as Ender trains at Battle School, he fears he is becoming more like his brother – and a killer. This is a brilliant piece of fiction that is a must read for any science fiction fan.<br /><br />*Review previously posted at SciFiChick.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Followed a formula. Very predictable!  Special effects were mediocre. Not good. Not bad!  If someone were to ask me a year from now if I had seen it, I probably won't remember.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Good game graphics and is great for those outdoorsman and hunters. I think it's a fun game that all ages can enjoy.
0316113514|5.0|This book has positively affected my personal life and my life as a health care professional.  I've bought a number of them to give away and recommended it to hundreds of people.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I bought this app to deal with an overly quiet apartment. The assortment of sounds and the ability to layer them at varying volumes as desired is great. It really helps with getting to sleep and dealing with stress.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I plan to read all of Mr Albom's books<br />I find them very original and entertaining<br /><br />This book  was very thought provoking, and, made me stop and think about  &#34;My Time&#34;<br /><br />I am looking forward to his other  highly rated selections to see if this is &#34;His Style&#34;<br /><br />I sure hope it is
B00E5N8E2O|4.0|Def Leppard is a great band. Their first albums were very good, but they truly found themselves with Pyromania and then dominated the charts with the masterpiece Hysteria. All these years later, the album holds up incredibly well, as does Def Leppard's ability to perform it. The main show is of course the band playing Hysteria in its entirety. The band is in outstanding form (amazingly, Joe can still hit those high notes), and the recording is crisp and clean. If the timing and worked out right in my life, I certainly would have gone to see them in Vegas. Alas, I could not, so I'm extremely pleased that they released this.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't call this an essential album, but I do think it's a great companion piece to the recent Mirror Ball live album, and the DVD puts it over the top. Def Leppard will never surpass the greatness that was Hysteria, as it is not only a great album but also came at just the right moment in time, but they are still a vital, tremendous band. The Yeah! album proved they still have what it takes in the studio, and this recording, along with Mirror Ball, shows they are a force to be reckoned with as a live act.<br /><br />This may not win them a new audience, but so what? This is a treat for the fans, the next best thing to having been at the Vegas show.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|Jimmie, Cary, and Kate!  What more could you possibly ask for?!  Technicolor, I guess... yes, that would be nice. But even without it, it is a must see.
B004GYY714|5.0|So many apps for Kindle, iPad an other tablets dont works as advertised. This one does. Once I found my favorite stations put them in lists, I could not be happier with this app. To bad most apps do not work as well as this one.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|very fun as much as first one I played all levels of first game and started over its so much fun now I can play both.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|The first part of the movie was the better section of the movie. Too many unexplainable scenarios trying to bring different parts of the world into the zombie apocalypse.  Trying to do too much in action and message in a short time frame. It was not going to work well.
B00DMM3WVM|3.0|My brother in-law showed me this one it is kinda addicting at first but gets old. Its still free though.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I have to say after watching this... Does anyone today even know this fairy tale or care about the genre in general? The special effects are well done, and overall the acting is o.k. but I found myself watching the special effects, not the movie... Sadly depressing for a lifelong sci-fi / fantasy fan.
B00640UICA|2.0|I got this one for free to but it is to kidy for me. It might be fun for kids though.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a great product and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this product to all of my friends and family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad I could finally get that game I have been waiting for you to offer Bejeweled Blitz and farm pet hero's<br />I am very happy with it!
B006CUDDUG|5.0|This is a great product and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this product to all of my friends and family.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|I love all of Baz's movies--- this one is right up there with the best of them....great cast, great production, great movie!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It makes you really appreciate what these guys do for us. And how hard that job is now because of all the rules they are required to follow. I wish we could just send them out there and know they would do the right thing. Marcus Luttrell is a man of honour. We need to teach people to be more like him!
0440237688|5.0|I love this book so much. I read it in 7th grade, and that was when I first introduced to the wonderful world of dystopian novels. Since then, I feel as if it is my favorite genre, fantasy coming in a close second though!<br /><br />What I love the most about The Giver is how real it feels. I know some of the aspect seems a bit far fetched-only seeing in color, controlling the weather, the lack of freedom in the government system-but once I got passed all that, I could understand why the citizens would choose to live in this world. It's safe, and predictable-there are no wars, no real threats, and most importantly, everyone is the same-there are no social classes, there aren't people who get more while others get nothing. The idea that everyone is equal, is the main ideal that keeps this society function and if you really think about it, is that so bad?<br /><br />Of course, what also intrigues me about this story is how rich in symbol it is. The fact that everyone sees in black and white, links straight to the way they live their life and how they see the world around them. The citizens are told what to do, and they never question it. They see everything as black and white, right and wrong and there is never any gray. In this sense, it makes them the perfect citizens, but it also makes them the worst kind of humans-the ones that waste and wither away until they die. Jonas and The Giver are the only ones who can see color and see that in life there are moments of golds and yellows, but also moments of black and gray as well. It really makes me wonder, what human beings would give up in order to be safe and secure. Lowry constantly demonstrates through Jonas, that as a reader we must also not go into this book seeing only black and white. Do not view this world and its people as idiotic and foolish, but think why this system works and the benefits of it. After all, all dystopian societies stem from the hopes of being a utopia.<br /><br />I've read so many novels throughout my life, and this one always sticks with me as being a favorite. It's written in such a simple, yet beautiful way and it isn't a very long book, but there is so much to learn and take away from this story. A story that appeals to all ages, not just for the young.The Giver is a story that refuses to be forgotten once it is read, and there are very few books I can confidently say that about.
B004YRBULS|5.0|If you are a baby boomer this movie is a must.  It recalls all the music and friendships of the late 1960's and early 1970's.  The cast is amazing and the story line poignant.  I watch this movie every 5-8 years and always enjoy the nostalgia.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very good story line. Plus, the beautiful, elegant business attire and distinct personalities of the characters makes it pleasurable to watch over and over.
B00E9P959O|5.0|First off, huge Rush fan here.  Vapor Trails was my first album that I purchased by Rush, so this was an exciting and unexpected re-release.<br /><br />The remastering/remixing of the tracks has done wonders to the original work, and given the songs new body.  It's been a true pleasure rediscovering the soundscapes the guys created on this album, and remembering the raw emotion in the lyrics (read Neil Peart's Ghost Rider for the full story of dealing with losing his wife and child and his journey (metaphysical and physical) through despair and depression to a triumphant return with love and happiness).<br /><br />Now, as someone who really enjoyed the original release, even with all its flaws and &#34;muddiness,&#34; I miss some of the harmonies that were removed and guitar tracks.  I know things were removed, or brought forward from original recordings, and this does the lyrics, melodies and even bass lines justice, but nostalgia is a hard mistress to tame.<br /><br />All in all, this is the album Vapor Trails should have been.  Everything is much clearer with the re-release, allowing seasoned listeners to discover new things that originally were buried under over bearing, and sometimes harsh riffs.<br /><br />Pick it up, you'll love it
B002DOSBMK|5.0|You have love these books, they're amazing reads, I highly recommend them to anyone that loves a really good story
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is awesome and hilarious. I recommend it to all of you who like books that can cheer u up
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm happy to finally have this game on something other than my phone. I love this game, it's challenging  and addicting. AWESOME...
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This app should not be free the graphics are good and the gameplay is awesome it is very fun u should totally get it
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Kind of has the &#34;scandal&#34; feel to it, suspenseful and still very well written. I would love for there to be a more popular person in the lead role.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game! I had it on my tablet, but the dumb android wouldn't work!!! So I'm glad that I have this kindle!
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Best album released in the last couple of years. PJ is still rocking after all these years. They still put on great shows
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|I have loved Little Mermaid since I was a kid. It is great quality on my kindle! Happy to share with my kids now!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|We purchased this movie when it was $9.99! Score. :)<br /><br />My daughter, 4, and I absolutely love this movie. We watch it a few times a week.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Another great BBC production. I enjoyed the photography and the actors performances. Good quality dvd, great to see the old clothes, buildings etc.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I should have had this wisdom available to me at a much younger age.  It would have saved me from myself and the storm I put myself through.  A very well written book, concise, and a fast read.  I purchase this book through Kindle so that gives me the benefit of highlighting important thoughts.  I'll keep this book on my favorites shelf in the Kindle for frequent reference.  I may even purchase a hardcopy to keep right by my side.  Eckhart has a way of making clear, the truths that for so long seemed vague to me.  For me, this book has been transformative in that I now see a more peaceful path before me.  Thanks Eckhart for shinning a light on the path ahead.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Seriously this is an awesome book, i loved it. I did not put down my kindle from the moment I downloaded it.<br />I highly recommend it. Read this, and forget about that terrible movie.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|So i just watched this stunning movie and it did exceed my expectations, I actually felt like helping the avatars fight for a quick second lol. I think i was with patrick living under a rock when this was released.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A compelling coming of age story, albeit the journey of a much older man, with poignant insights into life, marriage,and friendship.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that I have the real thing on my kindle now.  I was reading through other reviews and see many do not understand how to continue without paying money.  I'm on level 217 and have never paid a penny.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|For anyone seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the perils of today's American diet and the potential for related health problems, this is good choice. Dr. Perlmutter made it easy to see why so many of us are being made seriously ill by the foods we select day in and day out. His guidelines reinforced my commitment to a new way of eating.
B0011Z1BQK|5.0|Page's guitar and Plant's vocals are great.  But what really makes this album rock is the powerful bassline held by Jones and Bonzo.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting for this - love it - have played it on my laptop - more furn on my Kindle -
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Harry bosch and jack reacher are both great series books. And his first name is definitely an original.. he is slways thinking outside the box
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love/hate this game. It's like golf - you play against yourself...and drive your self crazy. It's a good thing you run out of lives or I'd play for hours.
1451695195|5.0|Our world is filled with uncertainty, stress, and worries.  Just knowing that God is always there to guide us is very reassuring.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Ah, such a good film. The actors are well appointed to the characters, story line is attention holding, and the cinematography is captivating.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Doesn't take long to learn the game.  It is easy to pick up while waiting in some line for something.  I like the brightly colored buttons.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks for bringing this App to Kindle Fire. Candy Crush Saga is a very relaxing and challenging game. Everyone should get this App and enjoy.
B00821PCJS|3.0|Falling Skies was fun for casual entertainment, but generally was not as captivating as Lost or 24.  And the believability of the plot was lacking in places.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read fifty or sixty pages of  this book and it's a straight-up hot dog book.  I'm not a prude, but y'all can have it back.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game was fun loved the challenge of each level.  Waiting for new rooms to explore and figure out the clues.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My granddaughter loves to break the sets as she calls it. Hours of fun in this game. Easy to understand and easy for her to play. Great Game
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After reading Divergent I fell in love. I immediately purchased Insurgent and inhaled it. I thought that those books had been written just for me I loved them so much. After finishing many trilogy's with disappointing endings, I had absolute hope and faith that this one would be different, and he third book would not be a flop like others have been. It gets very frustrating spending your time and money invested in a series for it to end up saddening you with its closing.<br /><br />Instead, this book set a new record for bad final trilogy books. I, like many other reviewers have said, wish that I had never even started reading any of these books in the first place. After finishing it, I can say that not only the ending but the entire book does not have the same spark in it that the other two did. It doesn't feel the same, and the switched POV'S just don't work for it. The author was reaching for it to be something meaningful but instead it was just sad and badly done. The characters deserved so much more than what they got.<br /><br />I can no longer recommend this trilogy to anyone. I will never be able to read the first or second book again without sadly thinking about what happens in the third. I will not be purchasing anything from this author again.
B001XUIBNO|3.0|I'm not much of a movie person but remember that this movie was highly thought of at the time so I gave it a try. It was interesting to see Jack Nicholson as a young man. But the plot didn't hold me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic Stephen King,,,, I was drawn in,,, and attached to my kindle for 3 days,,, every chance I got to read I was.<br />Was sad to see it end!!! Anyone who loves S.K., you gotta read this book!
B007EC27QM|2.0|This app does not have any added value compared to other calculator app. It's not worth the money but I got it for free so 2 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|omg..glad it finally got put on kindle..fun and challenging....can't wait to  get to next level.........waiting on chuzzle now...popcap games rule
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|A great book that was a perfect conclusion to something borrowed. I would definitely recommend this read to anyone who enjoyed something borrowed. Nice easy read that read like you were right there with Darcy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game, I like it a lot. Haven't play to far in to the game, but it's a fun challenge to get a perfect score
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game. There was just enough difficulty to keep me playing. I may have wished for a hint once in a while... but I made it through. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy seek/find games &amp; strategy.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|Metal Gear Solid Legacy has almost every single Metal Gear game besides Portable Ops, The Twin Snakes and the Acid! series.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ All the best MGS games are here! 8 in total.<br />Of course if you are reading reviews for this the chances are you have already played at least one of the games so I wont say too much, but all of them are superb.<br /><br />+The digital graphic novels<br />Not seen the second one yet but I do like the artwork used for the films. The first was previously on PSP and the second was previously unavailable.<br /><br />+ Countless hours of gameplay<br />In paricular Peace Walker has lots of side missions as well as some tough boss fights which will keep the game lasting longer. The second game has some extra Snake missions and the third game has the arcade ports of Metal Gear 1 and 2 from way back in 1987. All of the games here are at a satisfying length.<br /><br />+ The HD games look great<br />Both Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 from PS2 games look stunning and really polished. And very little has changed with the gameplay. The camera from MGS 3 is changed to play like Subsistance and I definatly preferred this to the origional. The PSP port of Peace Walker looks great especially considering it was made for a small screen. With a second analgue stick the controls feel much better for the PS3 in my opinion.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- MGS1 is download only!<br />This is really disappointing because I really feel this should have been on disc. The VR Missions is also a download.<br /><br />- Double dip!<br />This was released far too soon after the HD collection. If already own the HD collection and MGS4 this adds very little. Metal Gear Solid 1 is available cheap on the PSN.<br /><br />- The art book is nothing special<br />All it really shows is promotional art from the games and honestly I think pictures are way too small.<br /><br />-The menus should have been clearer.<br />It took me forever to find Metal Gears 1&2 (which as I mentioned earlier is a part of MGS3) and as well as the Graphic Novels (which is under Video on the XMB menu)<br /><br />Overall 8/10<br /><br />While the set is not perfect its still a fantastic buy overall and I would definatly recommend picking this up if you don't own the HD collection or are new to the series.
0789211440|5.0|I'm old enough to remember seeing Norman Rockwell pics on covers of magazines and in other places.  This book brought back many memories.  It's a BIG HEAVY book, but it's great to see the paintings in large print and with the index in the back that gives information on each one, along with a thumbnail pic for reference.  Great book!!!!!
B00BCX2F66|2.0|Besides the fact that the case looks cool and adds a look to your phone of professionalism. It has zero protection, when I got it looked so awesome I went to put it on my phone but it would not even snap in place, I could put the phone facing down and since it was not snapping in place my HTC One would easily fall out of the case. It fits loose that debris, or lent from my pocket would sneak on in through the loose ends and get behind the phone and on the corners. So if I didnt remove the case for a cleaning everyday the body would begin to feel rough, which are signs of scratching my phone soon. The red on the case looks nice but for those that have sweaty palms when you opened to text or call you would little by little begin to see the red start to get dirty and brown. To use the stand it means you are willing to have an ugly crease on the back of the phone after closing, let me tell you that if you so much once use it. The crease is already there, the flip part does not stay closed. They say lay it face down for a few which did work but there isn't a permanent solution to that either. So I dont hate it because it looks cool adds a flashy look and it adds some color. However I do not like it because of the flaws over powering the simple look of the case.<br /><br />If you dont care about the above listed then go for it, if its looks that you want, just remember the red will soon turn to brown and the crease will increase to make it ugly, If it was cheaper maybe I would not mind buying it but for this amount its not worth my hard earned cash. Otter box the Defender series here I come. I also recommend the commuter hybrid series. Good Luck
B00821PCJS|4.0|I'm not much on watching tv, but recently started watching this and i liked it a lot. Watching it became my nightly treat because season 1 & 2 was free on prime. I thought it had a good storyline and plenty of excitiment. Love the main characters,<br />Weaver and Mason.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I was able to get a really good deal on this set and it's really a set most families can enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can finally stop play on my iPhone and getting distracted with it. I can now keep it on my Kindle and be fine!
B00ECAXMLI|4.0|I love a novel that takes me away and absorbs me in another world.  Treasure Island did that. A classic that will last forever.
1476753024|3.0|I bought this book as gift for my grandmother and when I opened I was super bummed to see that when the person shoved it onto the packing box, they had ripped the outside cover by the butterfly. Very disappointing!! No I have to give it to her with no cover.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game...if only I can get past Vector and his weapons...<br />It's a good game for smaller kids as well as adults.
1250038820|5.0|Bought this book because its unique and full of life. I wanted to support Mr. Stanton's work so that he may continue to provide the world with interesting quotes from all different kinds of people from New York.<br /><br />This book is life, character, and each picture tells its own story.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One of the best shows to ever hit the screen. I don't think they could have found a better actor to play Vic Mackey.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|It was very good. It kept you on the edge, and it was an easy read. Did not want to put it down.
1476727651|5.0|The minute I got this book ,I couldn't put it down. I'm on the last 50 pages but I did have to take time to do dialysis. I do need to take time to for God. But I will finish it tomorrow.I need to find out what happens to Danny. For Now!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I disagree that the book was 'bad'--it certainly wasn't. But it's freaking heartbreaking. I get the whole 'not wanting a perfect ending... but I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth. I dunno, I don't think I would have gone the route she chose to go but I still enjoyed her thought provoking story-telling. I certainly had an emotional response... to say the least. Now, I'm gonna go watch some happy shows to get the Hell out of this depressed mood. :P
B00FX8EY60|3.0|There are a few good songs on her album (walking on air, dark horse, roar). Otherwise, her album was really lacking when compared to her two previous albums. When I bought her first album, I was happy with all of her songs. The second album was the same: I loved all of the songs. But this album I felt like I just had to buy a couple of songs and be done with it. Normally, her lyrics are pretty creative and her content was more diverse. Anyways, I am still a fan of Katy Perry, but I don't feel the need to purchase the whole album. Every artist get a dud and I think the fact her third album was her first dud album was still pretty good.
0316247545|5.0|this book has pretty much anything you could possibly want to know about my little pony friendship is magic, period!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The game was fun before all the problems started. If I'm lucky enough to get the game to open I can only play for about three minutes then it freezes up then shuts itself down. Gone to far to delete and down load again just to end up with the same problems.
B00FG1Q5J8|1.0|Addictive as hell. But I found a crazy looping bug. After a battle I was repairing my ship. Then I got a &quot;game over&quot; screen. Apparently I didn't have enough engineers. Well I went to resume and it resumed literally a few seconds before the game over. Now I lost everything I saved!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I highlighted many parts that were very thoughtfully written.  It is about teens with cancer so it was a tough read for me as a parent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids LOVE this game.  They fight over who gets to play it.  Even our 4 year old likes it.  All of my nephews play it.  So it seems to be a great game for kids.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Game is really fun, keeps you intrested with the different levels but you only get 35 levels and then they want you to pay to continue or play quest levels to continue. Well that's not even so bad but then once you complete one of the three quests you have to wait 24 flipping hours before going on. So it ll take 3days before you can even move on to the next stage of the game!<br />It was just published two days ago that the developers of this game are making $268,000 per day!<br />When are people going to wake up?<br />If everyone would quit playing these games that expect you to pay to play or pay to continue for a week or even couple days they'd change these games pretty damn fast! Sadly people just like helping the rich get richer!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and also Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed . It took me two weeks to read all three books. It's a true page turner.  It had drama, erotic romance, I love this book. I bought it in paperback and when I finished reading the third installment Fifty Shades Freed, I bought it on my tablet and listen to the book on immersion reading. I hope who ever get this book and the other two books enjoy it. I can't wait till the movie come out. To bad Charlie Hunnam won't be in it, but still I can't wait to see the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's both frustrating and addicting.  You just have to keep trying and eventually you'll get it.  I love this game.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be so funny, but my husband convinced me to watch it. He does make some good decisions.
B000HF0IIC|1.0|Christopher Nolan assumes the audience is intelligent.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher assumes the audience is dumb. This is why Batman Forever is offensive.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|When this show was originally aired, I was not impressed. Since watching it from the first episode on, on Amazon I have thought it is great. I like the characters, the acting is very good, and the stories, while frequently weird are very entertaining.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|action from start to finish with some of my favorite stars.  A must see for marvel fans to watch and enjoy
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wish I could find others that play but not through Facebook.  It's a fun game.  I seem to get stuck on certain levels and have to wait a day for more lives.  So sucky
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really like this game but get frustrated by the lack of free candies.  bombs are the worst part of this game
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|I liked it but its not her best work-a lot of the songs sound the same and all she does is bash men and sings every song about how shes a woman!!!!
B004661J04|4.0|I saw this film in the theater when it was new. I remember it being dark, but not THIS dark.  As a fan of breaking bad, I'm used to dark and graphic and it has occurred to me that Seven may have been a sentinel film for this genre. The acting is good, the cinematography is effective, it's a gripping film and I'm sure there are deep subtleties that I'm not smart enough to catch.<br />So, if you rate a film by its after effect - ie you think about it for days and have less hope for humanity, then it's a five.  I guess I still like movies that show us a little hope.
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|Doesn't live up to his better works.  Often hokey and unsophisticated -- somewhat disappointed but not terrible.  Still a BS fan.
B0055D3EOG|5.0|I love scary stories, and this one didn't disappoint.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Highly recommend.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can not wait wait to read the third book #excited reader:-) I hope everything ends well in the next book
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|This little girl can sing and that's all I have to say about that. &#34;Almost Is Never Enough&#34; is on repeat in my bedtime playlist right now.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's a fun game to pass the time with. Controls slightly sluggish but no complaints other than that. Play and have fun.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I learned so much about music and sound. David Grohl is amazing, so glad he put this movie together. Awesome movie for anyone who loves music.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The games good but the movement stick thing is buggy and jumps around slightly I would recommend it because it's a good game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game it is defiantly for all those horse lover out there! I recommend on using this app!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. So happy I can finally play it on my kindle. Just wish you didn't have to use money to get lives, boosters etc.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Finally a book that gives you concrete applications to help grow your faith and to finally have proof that everything we have been told about having faith and asking for anything, really, truly works. I am finally living without fear, stress or apprehension. Everything I have wanted to manifest in my life, I have.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Enjoyed the story and would read the rest of the series it they was for free. Somewhat predictable but very enjoyable
B000066JLO|5.0|\\"Waltz for Debby\\" is the companion disk to the first live release of, \\"Bill Evans Trio Sunday at<br />the Village Vanguard\\". Why this album is not called, Volume 2, etc, is an unknown to me. If<br />you want the apparently complete performances buy both discs. They are also available on<br />the Milestone reissue \\"twofer\\", The Village Vanguard Sessions (M-47002). Well worth it.<br /><br />\\"Waltz\\" is the fourth and final album by the trio, recorded live, in June 1961, just days prior<br />to Scott LaFaros highway accident that took his life. There are 3 alternate takes included<br />and thank goodness the alt takes are not programmed one right after the other. They are<br />included at the end of the original 6 song performance. I much prefer this way of including<br />extra tracks instead of having to listen to same song twice in a row.<br /><br />There are alternate versions of three of the six original songs: 'Waltz For Debby', 'Detour<br />Ahead', and 'My Romance'. The other three were only played once that day so no alternates<br />are available. Also included is 'Porgy (I Loves You, Porgy)', originally omitted due to lack of<br />space on the LP record.<br /><br />Granted, the songs are performed quite differently and generally those who decide which<br />'takes' to include, pick the better piece. Of course, you can decide for yourself if the original<br />take or the alt take is better. I find that they both can be enjoyable and usually there are<br />only seconds of a time difference between the two takes of the same song.<br /><br />The performance swings and this trio cooks it up fine. This is not Be Bop but more on the line<br />of Cool Jazz. I love trio work in any genre of music. One can hear the interactions so clearly,<br />and the intimacy that is gained in this trio is sublime, especially on this SACD DSD disk. I owned<br />the original Stereo CDs and the SACD DSD disk has more openness and feels more alive to me.<br /><br />Bill Evans essentially created a new school of jazz piano. He was at first thought of as playing<br />elevator music or lounge music. His sparse, seemingly laid back style, was not originally seen<br />as innovative. Watch for this man's name on other great jazz album of the period because he<br />worked with a lot of recognized great jazz players of his time and for good reason: he knew<br />where to put the notes and the spaces like no one else.<br /><br />I would call this 'beautiful music' and that is high praise as far I am concerned. People who<br />understand jazz also call this 'great music'. Sure, all I know is, it is some of the most enjoyable<br />music I own and repeatedly play 'Waltz' and 'Sunday' together in the player. Lovely Sunday<br />morning music served up swingin' and with great style.eated a new school of jazz piano. He was at first thought of as playing<br />elevator music or lounge music.

B0049P1N3K|5.0|I've read The Secret five times and each time I received a lot more and was blessed with something extremely different.  After being on such a high afterwards, I had absolutely no choice but to continue on by reading The Power. What an awesome book that kicks things onto another level. Now that I've completed The Power, I'm extremely motivated to continue on my high and now read The Magic. Only I know what goals I've set and what I intend to accomplish.  For sure, Rhonda Byrne's writings and knowledge will be a huge part of my success! I exude LOVE to her and all her associates.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Loved it.  Alan has taken on a new genre and has excelled in every aspect.  This Cd is just really good.
B001T72DJE|5.0|I read this book years ago and wanted my daughter to read it I also was low on cash Amazon gave me the option to buy used and that was great for me I bought it and my daughter was able to read the book in only a few days because of Amazons prompt delivery ...<br /><br />Thanks again Amazon!
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|This CD has a very interesting group of musicians which all seem to work.  I especially liked the blues part
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome! Yeah! Love it! I am finally glad it is available on Kindle! This app game is one of my favorites.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This series just seems to get better.  There are so many twists and turns, and you wonder how she will get out of them!
B000JPRPAO|4.0|The story line is interesting, although somewhat implausible at times.<br />The acting is first rate and the action scenes are exciting, kudos to the stunt personnel.
B00DJZR4A2|4.0|I am torn on this effort.  Some of the songs are classic Elton, but others are just middle-of-the-road.  It does not reach the level of vintage Elton John.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This movie kept me interested and guessing the entire time. It's a great one with an ending you have to see to believe.
B00G24KKAS|5.0|I am feverish with this show ;) Why does it have to end so quickly! anti cable, watch what u want
B00BGV0XL8|5.0|It is better than the first CD....there are not as many ballads....plenty of guitar solos !!!....good hard rock songs...great vocals...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have had fun trying to escape the different levels, good game to pass the time<br />,I would recommend this app to anyone who's looking to just pass the time
B0031KE9C6|5.0|I had forgotten how wonderful this series is! I am enjoying every minute of it. The plot is intriguing and the interactions of the characters amusing. And such a strong, intelligent, and savvy woman lead!
B00C5R8364|4.0|This book was very good reading, and timely.  With the information about the NSA that recently surfaced, it seems as if this was written last week.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad they got the app for our kindle.  Now I can play it on the go. This game can keep you busy for hours with friends and playing. Sometimes it drives you crazy on a level to complete. But over all a game I will play for years!
B004GYY714|1.0|I downloaded this to listen to the baseball playoffs on my Kindle, the sound was almost undecipherable. If this is indicative of how it works it is useless.
B001NZ3DY6|5.0|All of her best songs. I love it. I was sad when she left the music scene and am glad to have this as a part of my music collection.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was such a GOOD book, a heartwarming story told of a time in our country where we thought we were helping innocent children. Sadly it wasn't always the case. We relocated over 200,000 orphaned and abandoned children to the midwest, hoping families would adopt the children, if not as true members of the family, as farmhands. Siblings were separated and many children were used and abused as basic slave labor by their new &#34;families&#34;, of which there was no screening or accountability process whatsoever. It was rather a heartbreaking situation. This book is a fictionalized account of an orphaned girl sent off on the train, told in a flashback form. Extremely well written and interesting. It's short, about 300 pages, so a quick read, but will definitely be a book that's hard to put down! This would be an excellent choice for a book club.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I am not a writer. I am areder and I greatly enjoyed the way Mr. King put his prose together and revived his character.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|There was so much hype about this movie that I was extremely skeptical. Plus, zombies have been 'done to death' so to speak. Yet, like true zombies, they keep coming back. I'm also not a big Brad Pitt fan. With all that said, I was very surprised to like this movie. There is one scene between Brad Pitt and a zombie, in a lab, where the action is close up and minimal and yet it scared me simply with sound effects (I'm not going to spoil the scene here). Picture this: I live in the woods. Pitch black at night. Nearest neighbor a mile away. I am used to dealing with bears, cougars, and eccentric people who wander through. I am well versed in using a shotgun. Not a shrinking violet type or easily scared. But, after the scene in the lab, I had to go lock the door, and then get under the covers to watch the rest. I love a movie that makes me react. My only slight disappointment was that the ending was predictable. Once we got to the lab, it was clear how things were going to end. Still, great ride though.
B005544V6A|5.0|Very witty and well written The actors  playoff each other very well excellent show one of the best shows out there
0765337541|5.0|My twelve year old son just read this book and loved it!  We were going to buy Speaker For the Dead, but heard that might be for an older reader.  I just got him Ender's Shadow as a follow up book, and he loves it just as much.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it! Have it on my phone and now on my kindle and it's so much bigger and brighter! Great time killer app!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Such great acting and writing. I love the costumes, characters and setting.  It's the only tv show I watch. Cant wait for season 4!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins made this story so that it is believable.  It seems to be possible that this could happen and while you are reading, you are completely swept away in her story.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Class and style.  Downton Abbey beats any reality tv shows.  There is nothing else like it.  Love, love  this series!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|If you liked the movie, you probably won't like the book.  I was fascinated to learn more about the characters and the thought process behind the protagonists.
B00CCX9DUG|4.0|Well written, great historical base, well rounded characters and very authentically based on the period.<br />Would read other novels by this author.
B004G606K8|5.0|Not only a tremendous opening for such a Saga, but also a very fine piece of art by itself. Kudos.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A continuation of the first novel more than a sequel, The Wise Man's Fear carries on with every bit of the imagery and imagination of The Name of the Wind.  The story is a mixture of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings - but that description doesn't really do it justice.  I was sorely disappointed to find that the third in the series has not yet been completed.  I loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|We have sever a l devices in our home and everyone of them have this calculator on it.  Easy to use clear to read!  We love it!
0205313426|5.0|This book was one of several recommended by a writing class.  I have had many  books of this type over the years, but this one meets my criteria for short and to the point answers.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Jim Carey has never been funnier, the skits are remarkable, and in the end the hero gets the girl. It just don't get no better than that.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Fun example of massive firepower vs good guy.  Not a great movie but I enjoyit.  A fun mindless romp into a sad future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE playing this game &amp; now I can play on a bigger screen my kindle fire hd instead of my Samsung galaxy 4 which I love but I have been waiting to be able to play it on here since I play most my games on my kindle. Thank you
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie, I  loved the LORD OF THE RINGS series; this was right up there with that movie theme. Thanks, Ann
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I like to watch YouTube since I cut cable and this makes it easy for me to get it on my TV since my TV doesn't have a built in app. I prefer to search for videos on my iPhone or laptop anyway. I've also cast entire tabs from the Chrome browser, but I can't see myself getting much use out of that. My kids love to watch cat videos on YouTube now. I really like playing HD surf videos just for something pretty in the background. I did have to use the WiFi extender that came with the device. I also plugged it into my Yamaha RX-V473 receiver and it works fine. When I switch to that input the ChromeCast then connects to my network. You do have to restart the Chromecast app on the laptop or iPhone if you have rebooted since the last time you used it. Overall I'm happy with this.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I chose only 3 stars because the game has a good concept and graphics, however, it seems to take to much energy to get anything done. It doesn't seem that it was made for hours of play, only a few minutes and then you have to come back more often (I am guessing that was the goal, to have us come back more often).I do like the game, it is user friendly, but there needs to be a way for us to get extra energy without having to pay cash for it (some people, like myself are on a very tight budget with no extra cash left over.Thank you for the game. I will continue to play when I can...Blessed Be!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|So refreshing to find out what happened with The Shining. Written like only King can write. Very enjoyable for faithful readers.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The guy that does these voices should get some sort of reward..he is hilarious to say the least.  At the beginning of the game it has you put in your age level...I put in my grandson of 9 years...since you cannot change it at a later date.  So, I plan on him playing it but I could be able to if I wanted since his level would be better than if I put in my actual age..or was that an error?  Maybe if I said I was much older it would give me a break more than a nimble fingered 9 year old.  Curses!!  Funny things throughout and a kick to play.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|when I play on my phone it crashed I played in my kindle fire and we took it to best buy to un freze it<br />DO NOT GET IT
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Wow another 100 million dollar plus Hollyweird turd , even that bozo Jon favreau has a role in this uninspired 2 hour crapfest , what a dive the series.took not that.it was going anywhere.with Favreau but at least.the first film was entertaining enough,  the.second was decent at best , but this third film is just trying to cash in on all the bozos who paid to see it
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|so far I've played for free for a few hours not to sure how long that will last but great objectives to reach and goals along the way
B00DB97LCM|5.0|Excellent collection of the previous films. Nice to view them all back to back. If you're a fan, this one is a must have.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|But was ok...don't watch it thinking it's going to be something great.  Disappointing since Morgan Freeman is usually awesome in everything he does.
B00EH49DXA|5.0|Love it! My favorite song of her's so far!! The video is awesome to! My girls slso love Katy Perry!!
0553385461|4.0|What I love about this book is that it's not overly complicated so the average person can understand it but it's detailed enough to satisfy your interest.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Although not as scary or addictive as It's predecessor, still a great book for &#34;shining&#34; fans.  As a standalone novel (for people who haven't read the prequel) it is just OK.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the simplest solution to getting Netflix on your TV. No remote, no box, no hassle. Just plug it in, set it up, and use your phone, tablet, or computer as a remote.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't go to bed at night without getting my Crush on! Five lives is not enough. Keep them coming.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Shows so much strength of character of the children--really pulls out their adaptability. Makes one realize there may be so much stories behind the actions of a person.
B000002AGN|5.0|Dave Brubeck was a musical genius. &#34;Time Out&#34; is his defining classic moment. The exploration of rhythm, time signature, harmonies, and improvisation keep the listener involved and always surprised. This was the music that brought me to listen to jazz and appreciate it as such an important musical form. Brubeck is one of the most innovative and important practitioners of the art. Anyone who likes, loves, or is simply interested in jazz must have this recording.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Very good SYFY doomsday movie with a twist. Very good special effects. The movie was visually stunning. Tom Cruise is a very good actor and does most of his own stunts.
B0033WRUN2|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because it wouldn't play on my dvd player but the movie ended up being great....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't usually subscribe to games but heard of this by following comments by Facebook friends.  They were having so much fun and healthy competition that I felt compelled to giving this game a try.  Well, I'm hooked!<br /><br />I like the fact that should you not succeed in passing a certain level you can try over.  You have a choice of paying for advancing the level or you can just keep trying over.  So far, the levels have been fairly easy and quick and I feel as if success has been easy to obtain.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was glad to finally see Candy Crush Saga on Amazon. I have been playing for a while on my iPhone and really like playing it on my Kindle.  Thanks.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is my first experience with this author. A real unexpected gem of a story.The author is brilliant in the character development. The story falls before you like a huge jigsaw puzzle,then slowly the picture starts to come together and its a delightful surprise.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|Super sweet and funny movie for the older (age 7) kids during the holidays . Some talk about being a virgin that lights the candle. No biggie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are flow is really good on the kindke. I really enjoy playing it. Pretty addictive too.
B00DQZQSNO|5.0|I bought my daughter a kindle fire hd and the cover is beautiful color. very happy with my order thanks
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed!  I liked the intertwining tales of three families and how they come together in a gripping apex. Fabulous!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch Rapp gets called to Afghanistan to locate a kidnapped CIA operative. If the missing agent fell into the wrong hands, the information he possessed could cost many lives and set the U.S intelligence organization back years in the terrorist-infested region.  But the agent had staged his own captivity to deflect attention away from his funneling of CIA money intended to buy influence and power in the region into his personal Swiss account.  He'd also set up Mitch to take the fall.<br /><br />Flynn takes Mitch and the reader through a labyrinth of geopolitical forces and the competing motives of those with a stake in finding the missing agent.  Mitch fights through them all as only \\"the last man\\" in the CIA with the skills and experience required to take on this complex assignment could.<br /><br />Flynn's knowledge of his subject matter was never more pronounced than in this book, but I found the story difficult to follow at times. Changes of scenes and characters seemed to appear with each new chapter as acronyms and job titles continued to accumulate.  But action, suspense, and intrigue filled the final pages of this novel as the story came into focus, and as with other Mitch Rapp novels, I didn't want it to end.  Unfortunately, it did, and with the untimely passing of Vince Flynn, Mitch Rapp has been on his last mission.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I read the book years ago and really liked it. The movie was OK, I still hope she does a sequal to this book I felt it was left open to do so.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank You. Finally the ease of a big screen with the portability of my Kindle. I love it and have been waiting for this to become an app on Kindle for over a year. Clear big and bold...
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I liked this book very much. I did the experiments, they did not all work out but some did. The real value in this book is that it makes you think differently and question what you consider to be the norm. I will continue to use the exercises in this book and in time I expect to produce better results.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Really enjoy this game.  Lots of variety with bingo and slots.  Even some free play.  Have had game freeze at times.  But overall lots of fun.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|The jumperoo is much more bouncy than other jumpers we have used. My baby loves it! It's also got enough to keep her entertained while I do house work or cooking dinner. Very pleased with our purchase
B00004TA41|5.0|This was one of the last things Coltrane recorded before his death in 1967. This music is not very accessible the way albums like Blue Train are, this is not background Jazz. This is very intense free jazz. Basiclly it's just John Coltrane and drummer Rashid Ali play some very intense music.<br /><br />Coltrane's saxaphone screams and roars with a lot of very heart and feeling, as if Coltrane is screaming to the heavens in his final days. The music is passonite and very raw. So be warned,
B00CATSONE|2.0|There is one good chapter providing a brief overview of Tesla's amazing work and productivity.<br />Also several chapters on author Patrick's views on genius.<br />So if you're looking for a bio of Tesla, this isn't it. But the price was right.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A great series of the prim and proper days of old.  Love the parties, big beautiful dresses, men in tuxes.  Scenery is beautiful.
B008LXZEYU|4.0|&#34;Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy&#34; embodies how ridiculous TV (especially local) news can be! Add this one to your collection for sure
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm total a Grisham fan.  But, that set assigned I found myself reading instead of working. I couldn't wait to get my questions answered and as the mystery unfolded it was totally satisfying. Thanks John!  Another stellar job.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|A good movie to watch over and over . Good story with a lot of great songs to sing along to.
B004U8VX2M|2.0|This series is a bit outdated, but entertaining anyway. I've watched all of the Downton Abbey series and this pales in comparison. It is a typical British production:  sketchy dialogue and slight overacting.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I enjoyed the original game so much that I had started over at level one before receiving information on the second version.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|This game puzzle is so addictive and the higher levels are very challenging. The graphics are good although I keep the sound low.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I missed some of the episodes in season 3, so wanted to catch up. Reception on the Kindle Fire HD was crystal clear with beautiful colors and wonderful sound quality.
B00FPH6A70|4.0|Very scary! This film was a lot scarier than first thought, although it follows typical demonic/exorcism storylines, it still surprises and scares.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Yes, I gave this game (Journey) a 150/10, that's how good it is. Flower and Flow are amazing little gaming experiences in and of themselves, but the star of the show is Journey. This MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! But I'll try not to. Please, play Journey the first time signed off of the PSN, so you can experience it alone. It's amazing both ways, but if you go it alone first, you'll be able to see everything with new eyes. The second time, sign into PSN so you can travel with an anonymous friend! Journey is an amazing immersive gaming experience like nothing you've ever done. Its beautiful world and amazing music and really amazing untold story are so innovative, I never thought I'd see a game like this, but it feels like this is the kind of game I've always wanted to play. It's like nothing you've ever seen in gaming before. Very unique and amazing. And I've played-through probably twenty times now, so yea, the playability and re-playability are freaking fantastic. I always find something I missed before. It's very fun, but very emotional. Powerfully emotional. I've cried several times reaching the end. And it can be even more emotional with a pal. The story follows the arc of the monomyth or Joseph Campbell's \\"Hero's Journey\\". Please, buy this game, it may be even more worth it for the $18 it costs than the $65 for 60 hour campaign games. Seriously. ThatGameCompany, y'all are my heros.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|The Toy Story 3 box set is a wonderful addition to any home with small children.  The creativity is amazing and ends up being enjoyable for children and adults both.  This is a wonderful set to add to movie collections and enjoy over and over.
1454704225|5.0|I love the examples in this book!  They're so fun!  My 8-year old stepdaughter even doodled right along with me!
034580404X|5.0|I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS READ TO FIND OUT WHAT THE HOOPLA WAS ALL ABOUT...WAS COMPLETELY SURPRISED TO DISCOVER A LOVE STORY AND NOT SOME TRASHY NOVEL.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|No complaints from me!  AWESOME movie and you can't beat the price for a DVD, Blu-ray AND a digital copy!  I'm very happy!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|So, I wasn't expecting much to be honest, but my book club chose this selection so I tried to go in with an open mind.  I was really surprised at how suspenseful I found it.  I actually stayed up too late reading and then couldn't fall asleep thinking about the plot.  The reason I didn't do 5 stars was that I found a few of the supporting characters reactions to the central figure's reaction as unbelievable and a little too neat at the end.  But I still recommend Into the Darkness Corner as a good read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. You need to come up with several more. I also play Pet Rescue.  These are very addictive.  Spend a lot of time on them. I do wish we could earn lifes faster or get more at one time. Thank you and keep up the good work.
B009GX69RK|5.0|loved this, I had finished the first season on Netflix and I was dying trying to catch up before Season 3 started. It was SO easy and convienent that I was able to purchase on line and it was instantly available over my Amazon Prime app on XBox! Started watching instantly and was caught up in time to start Season 3!
B00BDAP66E|5.0|This is a great way to help me with my business page. I use it all the time.  Thank you.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I love this movie. :) I had good quality playing and always enjoy watching over and over! a must see, and read, the books are awesome too!
0060987464|4.0|The book, just like Marilyn Manson himself, defines the true definition of creepy & always gives me a hell of traumatic experience - and still, I'm drawn to it for some reasons. It everything but ordinary. I don't know what's with all the weird sketches and photos of organs here and there but it certainly works in giving the true Marilyn Manson experience. It's different and worth a shot! (p.s.: anyone who read it should never that it too seriously... please - if you didn't want to get crazy cause it can easily get into your head!)
B008JFUUIA|5.0|love everything about this movie. It's been all over cable, netflix, etc...but I needed to own it so I can watch it again and again.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I would guess most folks who read this book will know something about North Korea, but I will point out just in case that I was grateful for having some background on N Korea when reading this book.  Here are some things I've read/seen:<br />1. Essay by Pico Iyer in the collection &#34;Lonely Places&#34;<br />2. Documentary &#34;Crossing the Line&#34; about an American soldier who defected to N Korea (and is still there).  I suggest some googling after the fact b/c there are some facts that the filmmaker wasn't able to confirm before release.<br />3. Documentary &#34;A State of Mind&#34; about young girls preparing for the Mass Games.<br />4. 60 Minutes (google &#34;60 minutes North Korea&#34;)<br /><br />The book was one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've had in quite some time.  I'm an enthusiastic David Mitchell fan (which leads me to compare things to him, even when inappropriate), and this book feels like it comes from a similar universe as Mitchell's best work, although here the bizarre world of North Korea provides the fantastical, not any supernatural or sci-fi elements.  I came into this book knowing nothing about it, and I think I enjoyed it more for that.  So I will say 5 stars and leave it at that.  Read it!!!
B004CFAWK2|3.0|This is the first time a book has dissapointed me more than the movie! It has been very hard to connect the two!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|For one thing, this book was just boring. I struggled to get through it. Insurgent wasn't as good as Divergent, but it was still a good book and worth reading. I don't typically like it when an author switches from first person point of view to include others, after they have established a first person POV in previous books, and it doesn't work here because both POVs sound the same and it got confusing. (Obviously, now we know why it was done considering what happens. Ugh.) But I found myself skimming through paragraphs because I was losing interest less than halfway through it and that is not a good indicator of a 4 or 5 star book. When they finally get outside the fence and learn about the GPs and GDs and what was really going on, it proved to be anti-climatic and contrived, in my view. All that buildup and it just wasn't very exciting.<br /><br />Four was irritating to me, I didn't feel any sympathy or investment in his character, or in their relationship. There were too many new characters introduced and not enough with the characters from the previous books, like Christina. (Not like there were many left from the other books that she hadn't already killed off. Just about everyone is dead by the end of this series, it seems like.)<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />Sorry, but you don't create a whole world where everything is told and shown by the main protagonist/heroine and then KILL her off in the last book. We hear everything from Tris's POV from day one, we are invested in HER, emotionally, and then you have her die? Gimme a break! Horrible choice by the author. I don't think I can ever trust this author again. I had my faith in an author crushed earlier this year and now it happens again. Ugh. This will be the second Kindle I return this year. So disappointed right now.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Purchased Fruit Drops and loved it......then saw Part II out and had to have it!!  Challenging; works your brain and just plain fun!!  Love it!!!!!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I am excited to watch this movie but I can't open and watch cause it's my baby Christmas gift for granddaughter ....
B00005M989|5.0|Package showed up sooner than indicated. Package showed up in good puffy packaging. No damage was made during transportation. CD Is used but it perfect condition. Some wear and tear on the plastic case but that doesn't matter. The disc is what matters, and it's perfect. I highly recommend this sender.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am always on this game. I love it. I have it on my phone and tablet and x box. I am so glad I got the x-box version. IT has so much more stuff.its minecraft city peeps.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I wanted to LOVE this book. I so enjoyed the first 2 and the relationships of the characters are the best part not the where or what. I can see why your knee jerk reaction is to give this book 1 star.  She ruined the characters ending for crying out loud! BUT this is a well written story, a smooth continuation from the last two books. Did it loose some of the excitement and the page turning need to know more.....yes. For that give it 3 stars at worst.  I gave it 4 stars because it is a good book even if you wanted to throw it against the wall. It lost the 5th star because there isn't an incentive to ever reread this book.  I reread books all the time and it is a huge thing for me to admit I won't reread this one.  To lose a main character like this was pointless, the point could have been made differently.  So yes read this book but brace yourself.
B008Q00PHY|4.0|It didn't bore me, it kept my interest.  Obviously, there was no attraction between barbarino and the girl.  Choose a better match next time, mr. producer!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great!  Good follow up tp the Shining!  Good twists and turns which made for a good read.  Stephen King doesn't disappoint.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|I have watched this movie about a dozen times and it is always good. it's a classic and really never gets old. Best thing about it was being able to stream it free from Amazon Prime Videos. If you're not a Prime customer, you should be, it's a great service.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am so upset. I can't believe it ended the way it did. I was so excited to read it and now I am upset I did. It ruined the whole series for me. I can not believe she would do that to the book...
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great action and lots of violence.  Even though I'm not a Jamie Foxx fan so much, he, and others, played good roles and the movie has a great story line. If you're not into violence you probably wouldn't like many parts of it.  A typical Tarantino movie.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Of course it's good.  Maybe it isn't oscar worthy or anything like that, but you know what you're getting with an iron man movie and it doesn't disappoint.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I am glad we took a chance on this book. We are fans of Neil Gaimon, Terry Pratchett, E. Nesbitt, JK Rowling and this book did not disappoint. The writing is top notch. The story does not slow down like some others that get bogged down in little details or tangents when you just want to get on with the story (I am looking at you JK). My sons are 7 and they listen while I read it aloud at bedtime.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|What's there more to seeing a clean family fun movie on a Sunday afternoon?<br /><br />Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is one of the classic Dick Van Dyke creations, and is eternally awesome to all ages..
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I purchased the American Heritage Dictionary 3d. on my other android device. This app is free and still shows word origins and alternative spelling. There are several definitions per word. Very useful.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I am recommending this show to just about everyone I know.I thought it<br />was great.I watched the whole season in a matter of days.Once you start<br />watching it's hard to stop.I also watched season 1 which was great also.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Finally a movie that doesn't use blood and guts to scare the pants off of you! A definite must see.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Twists and turns throughout. keeps you guessing. Didn't care for the ending. Kind of took me some place and then pushed me out of the car and left me there.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire has always been hard to beat, but I enjoy it so much. I try not to use the star easy button, because I want to win on my own.  I love this game, but I also want to win more. I would give this a rating of 5 stars.<br />Ruth
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I read this on a whim after it was recommended by Amazon and very much enjoyed it. If you are looking for a quick easy read I say go for it.
1451696191|5.0|Perks of Being a Wall Flower is what we needed for school.  Hassle free.  Ordered and received in perfect condition.  Thank you
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addictive can't put it down. Took me forever to start playing after thousands of invites I finally played can't stop now. Can be frustrating at times.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Watched with my 12 year old - she loved it!!<br />It's a total classic - so funny & appropriate for all ages!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's like heaven but in a game it's that good! I love when you get to a higher level like 10 then you might unlock something.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|UNIFORMLY EXCELLENT STORY OF LOSS AND MORE LOSS.  ACTING SUPERB.  WORTH IT JUST FOR THE PERFORMANCES.  STORY IS COMPELLING.  THIS IS A MUST SEE FILM.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|So I've been reading the other comments and would like to know if I have to purchase the other levels after 35? I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't let me get any farther. Now I'm not happy as I feel Amazon just scammed me! I was loving this game until then!!!
B0002V7O3I|4.0|Growing up as I did in the late 1970s-early 1980s, I was awfully fortunate - being already a science fiction-fantasy geek - in the films that were starting to dominate the multiplexes at the time.  I suppose a lot of these efforts, from \\"Labyrinth\\" and \\"The Neverending Story\\" to \\"Wargames\\" and \\"The Philadelphia Experiment\\" look a bit cheesy to younger folks today, and there's no question that they didn't have the giant budgets (even when adjusting for inflation) or attention lavished on them that today's superhero & sci-fi films do - but given that geek-genre stories weren't automatic hits, they also I think tried a bit harder.  I saw most of the big ones as a kid or young adult, but one that passed me by for some reason when new was this strange mix of Disneyesque adventure and somewhat adult satire from director Joe Dante. It starts out very much along the lines of \\"E.T.\\" or \\"Goonies\\" in the sense that it's about a group of adolescents who, without any real help from (and only minor hindrance from) adults go on a wild fantastic adventure. In this case, it's three boys - solemn German-American computer genius River Phoenix, picked-on sci-fi geek Ethan Hawke, and poverty-stricken outside Bobby Fite - who stumble on the secret to creating a bubble of force, which they find out they can expand to a globe large enough to encapsulate them, and cause to move through space whichever way they want to.<br /><br />It's all rather silly, but played for the most part straightforward - until the boys are drawn to a giant spaceship out...somewhere...and run into a couple of very strange aliens, who have been monitoring earth for years and absorbing our culture. Here the film turns from adventure to satire, and I'd have to guess that this fairly sudden change of mood is part of the reason that Explorers wasn't a mega-hit (though it didn't do all that poorly). Director Dante gets to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes - simultaneously mocking and celebrating American culture, particularly the era (the 1950s) he grew up in, and the film gets to say some rather interesting things about what we value in our society, and whether we're actually going forward. It's a bit muddled at times, and the humor just a bit over-the-top for my taste, but the production design of the aliens (sure they're rubbery & kind of fakey - but that's the point isn't it?) and their ship is great, the three young stars are terrific, and Jerry Goldsmith contributes his usual \\"stellar\\" music. Why'd I miss this in 1985?<br /><br />The DVD is just fine - pretty bare-bones, which is to be expected for a lower-tier nostalgia item (at least as far as the studio is concerned) without a huge fanbase.  A couple of extra scenes that didn't need to be in the movie - hey, that's why they had to wait for this DVD; a good-enough widescreen transfer.  I'd love a director's commentary on this film, but I guess I'll just have to go look up what Dante has to say about it elsewhere.particularly the era (the 1950s) he grew up in, and the film gets to say some rather interesting things about what we value in our society, and whether we're actually going forward.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Good  game to pass time,graphics are good. Great for younger kids. I recommend this game for everyone. It's free you can't go wrong.
031623480X|5.0|I loved reading this book. If there is only a grain of truth, I'm sure there is more like a whole grain of truth, in these pages, we all need to take heed. My husband and I are grain free. An excellent insight into mental health.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yes it is finally here. It seems like I've been checking daily and I was so excited to finally be able to get this app. I have been waiting patiently and its finally here and it works very well.
074401493X|4.0|Good but didn't cover the hardest difficulty level other than that it was well worth the price I paid for it
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I've NEVER played Minecraft and I really want to... I hear this game is like Minecraft but it gives me NO time to build or look around the island. I'd just like Candy Rufus Games to put more time for the demo please.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game but certain levels are a little over the top. Seems the computer is more in charge of game than the player
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|Very good book - was dubious whether to buy it but so glad I did.  The characters good and bad were handled with such finesse and I will be looking out for more books by this author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOOOOVE THIS GAME!! Tons of different puzzles, exciting, filled with lots of fun for all ages!! WARNING: Extremely addicting!!! Hours &amp; hours of fun!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is the most  heart rendering  book I've read since Bambi\\",  l will look at those confined to a wheel chair with greater empathy and helpfulness.  It's made me appreciate the life I've led and the decisions I've made and the love I've known.  This is a wonderful ,sensitive,believable story.  \\"Me before you\\" a classic \\" love Story\\",
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I've finished all three of the main hunts. Can u please make more regions. The graphics are great and I love the game. Can you please make a section where we can buy things to help us during the hunt. Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and thank you for finally making it available for kindle!! Now let's get farm hero's on kindle too :)
159562015X|5.0|I personally love the concept of StrengthFinder 2.0 and language it provides. Some assessments/results are so complicated they become difficult for the average person to digest. Tom Rath's focus on what we are instinctively good at resodenated with me immediately. I have always felt I am best at the things that come naturally, but we so often work in environments where the focus is on developing your weaknesses. I highly recommend this as a tool for individuals as a self-awarness tool, or small teams and new managers who want to know each other better and understand each other. I've watched the information provided in the assessments create amazing dialogue between managers and leaders - very exciting stuff in the world of organizational development!
B00DUCXFUC|4.0|As a fan of all the movies, I've always wanted to collect them all. The first trilogy set came out but I wasn't sold on that one really. Then I saw that this set was announced and I became intrigued. The content on this package is pretty good, although I do think for the price they could have added some more things, more collectibles.<br />The artwork and the HotWheels versions of his cars (and plane) are awesome. The extra feature length documentary that was thrown in there is awesome too, although that too could have been better, especially with some Heath Ledger commentary.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a fan of the franchise and/or like to collect things from movie history, I would definitely recommend this for you or for a gift! They won't be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun!  Not that big of a challenge.<br />Good for wasting time.<br />Gets both harder and easier as you play.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Loved the second season.  The early episodes were worth the wait.  And the finale was another unexpected development.  Looking forward to Season 3.
030758836X|2.0|I loved the book, but the last 30 pages were a complete let down.  The ending was horrible, very sad for such a great book.  I cannot believe the publisher did not make a change, really a shame.  Nancy
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|I would consider this a \\"return to form\\" for AFI, with the \\"form\\" being \\"Sing the Sorrow\\"-era AFI.  These songs are better written, better vocalized, and better performed than Crash Love.  Still, no real screamo vocals, mostly, but the songs don't really need them here. Best songs: Hope You Suffer, Resurrection, 17 Crimes, Heart Stops, Rewind, The Embrace and Greater Than 84.  Best moment: the last 45 seconds or so of \\"Anxious\\" which may be the best piece of music they've performed since STS.<br />So...the \\"black cover\\" thing:  Back In Black, Dark Side of the Moon, Metallica, Sing The Sorrow, and now Burials. Anyone got any more to add?  Anyway, welcome back, AFI!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book gives some great perspectives to today's society and what our future holds for us all. I highly recommended it.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Review of &#34;Dune,&#34; by Frank Herbert.<br /><br />Author Frank Herbert's masterpiece of science fiction, &#34;Dune,&#34; has earned the bragging rights to be known as one of the premier sci-fi classical writings of all time.<br /><br />If you can get past the commercialism spanning over decades of a board game or two, a movie, a television series, comic books, etc., and read the book objectively with no biases, you most likely will find an unbelievably rich and detailed story that harkens back to the likings of a Greek tragedy.<br /><br />The setting in &#34;Dune&#34; is far into the future where mankind has warred and has spread out into the universe. Organized religion still plays a vital role (Orange Catholic Bible, etc.). The nobility of each habitable planet bicker, plot, negotiate, and war with each other like Renaissance city-states. The title planet, Arrakis or &#34;Dune&#34; is a desert planet of sand that is rich in the spice &#34;Melange.&#34; Melange allows, when ingested as a narcotic, primarily among other things, the Space Guild to bend space so as to transport personnel and cargo great distances in little time. The main plot involves two warring Noble Houses that compete for control of &#34;Dune&#34; for various reasons involving much deceit and treachery. The protagonist of the story, Paul Atreides, finds himself a sort of &#34;Hamlet&#34; type of figure who grows physically, mentally, and spiritually to become a Messianic type of figure who controls the desert planet and terraforms it to become habitable (like Earth). The story is so much more involved than this though! I believe, however, that the sci-fi reader will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I read this book in 1987 after having seen the Dino DeLaurentis movie of the same name a few years before. Needless to say, I loved it! This book is the benchmark of the sci-fi genre. I rate this book at five stars. A masterpiece!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books but the entire book was just a big disappointment and it had a horrible ending. I was I could take back the time I wasted reading this.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, as it is an easy read, was amazed at how interesting it was and I recommend it.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|No serious spoilers!<br />First off, this book isn't about a clown. I can't get anyone who has seen the mini-series to believe me. I realized when I re-read this that I had derived one very powerful parenting lesson from it over 20 years ago: don't lie to your children. That lesson comes from Eddie Kaspbrack. I also realized why small towns make my hair stand on end. I learned that from the old man who goes back inside his house. Re-reading this book made me realize that Stephen King is incredibly intuitive about what motivates people, what people fear, and how much we really lose when we decide to grow up. The side stories about the town make your guts clench because you know that in some small town somewhere, they are true. Horrors are inflicted upon neighbors without any supernatural help at all. THAT'S what makes this story so much more horrifying. Remove 'IT' and the story still stands on its own. The spiritual aspects of this book as as surprising as they are completely appropriate. I will warn you, though, if you are the kind of adult that believes that all children are innocent until 18 and should be kept that way, this book will probably offend you and you will refuse to believe that children can, will, and often do any of the things in the story. However, as an adult who actually remembers the truth of my childhood, there are extremes but nothing I didn't at least see a hint of as a kid. I highly recommend, as I think it is my most bookmarked e-book in my Kindle.
6305127646|4.0|I like this movie val kilmer did a great job the story lacked a little when you compare it to th old saint tv show never really know how he ends up at the scene or why

B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|I have never read Steve king as I don't fancy that genre. I was  interested in this book to know more about what makes  him  so prolific and popular. I loved the book for it reassured me on many things this novice felt deeply, especially on the limited usefulness of plot and the verbiage of over description of the setting and characters. Who are we to curtail or direct the readers imagination? Most of all I loved his take on whether we must write for the money. Whether I ever pick up Steve's horror books or not, this is a book I will keep returning to, for its pith and humour. I feel I know the man now, and admire his resilience after a life shattering accident in his fifties. Bravo .
1878424319|5.0|the four agreements have given me food for thought far beyond what i expected...truly positive things to bring to daily life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is addictive, i play for hours.good way to pass time whem riding in car on trips and waiting rooms
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|Had this before, but this is by far the best it has sounded.  No &#34;Loudness Wars&#34; going on here.  Extra tracks are interesting (Peace album), but the production is a much lower quality and it's easy for me to see why the band wasn't happy and wanted to redo it.  But it's cool to see the progression of the music.  Good for a listen or two (the bonus tracks) but no the reason (at least for me) to buy this.  This is the first Cult album I heard and it's still my favorite by far.  Just saw them in a club and they played the whole album.  Freaking awesome and the band is in top form.  Price is nice and definitely a good value.  And get the CD version instead of crappy sounding mp3s!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Books 1 and 2 I read within 24 hours each. I thought they were well written, bright, funny, though provoking at times, etc. This book just falls flat. I'm about 50% of the way into it and I have yet to really enjoy it. It's not as well written as the first two and the style is 100% different. The glaring difference is Tris gets a chapter in her voice, then Four gets one. At times, I forget who is speaking.<br />Overall this one feels rushed and cobbled together at best. As others have said, save the money and imagine your own ending!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Used to play all the time on facebook and now it's on Kindle  !!!!!!!I could not be happier. This is an addicting game and so much fun to play
B0060D123K|4.0|This is the movie that gets me into the Christmas spirit. I remember seeing it in theaters at age 4, and is what I think of as my \\"first movie\\", and even now I sometimes watch it in the middle of June when I am feeling \\"Christmas-y\\". It is a lovely adaptation of the Dickens classic with the beloved Muppets, and Michael Caine is phenomenal as Scrooge. The music is fantastic, and after 21 years I still know all the words to the songs. As many times as I watched this as a kid, I always catch something new each year, usually a bit of humor meant for adults that just go over kids' heads...which I appreciate now.<br /><br />I bought the prime instant video having read the disappointed reviews that the song \\"The Love is Gone\\" was cut from the DVDs, and was prepared for it to be cut from this version, and yes it is true that it is not included. It is sad that the powers that be felt the need to do this. Although as a child I would have been psyched because I always fast forwarded through the icky love song that was boring to me, but now I realize the song represents a pivotal turning point in the movie and provides a crucial character development for Scrooge. Now having said that, I realize that may be a little over-analytical for a Disney movie. However, regardless of turning points and character developments, it is quite obvious that something is missing, even to someone who has never seen it. Additionally, it makes the ending song of the movie less meaningful because the last song is a reprise with the same melody, except it references the \\"love we found\\" rather than the \\"love is gone\\" and completes the Scrooge transformation musically and quite beautifully, which is very satisfying to the viewer. Without the first song though, the finale is simply another song, and to someone who has never seen the movie it may be confusing because it kind of comes out of nowhere.<br /><br />I recently got married, and I think about this movie as one I will watch with my kids when we have them. I hope one day they release another edition with \\"The Love is Gone\\" put back in. In any case, it is still my favorite Christmas movie.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Excellent service. CD is excellent. I love everything that Yanni performs. Excellent seervice. CD in great shape. Excellent service.<br />I don't mind leaving a short message of heartfelt feelings, but having to write more words just to fill up this square is not worth it
B00BATWJFE|5.0|I loved this book and found myself sneaking away to read. It is funny, well written and insightful. I particularly enjoyed the Internal and external dialogue. It was entertaining and succinct, making the narrator a likeable underdog with a quirky in a genuine and consistent way. For anyone who liked A Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, you will love this book.
B009949RKC|5.0|I was not all expecting this. Yes, I had never seen it before. Loved it! And I don't even like horror movies...
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|A lot of fun, especially for a free app. Good graphics and user-friendly interface. So far I'm very pleased and having a lot of fun with it.
B007HPO3CC|1.0|I ordered this on my kindle fire hd. It was a bugger to download and all of the episodes wouldn't fit. I returned it!
031603441X|2.0|I've read Up and Down with the Rolling Stones by Tony Sanchez , and that was an incredible page turner. This was not an easy read. I'm a life long fan, I heard the radio interviews and television promotions and looked forward to reading Keith's book. It gets bogged down almost immediately and doesn't flow.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I'm not surprised that it doesn't work but I had to check it out for myself. I do believe in the energy fields that she writes about but her technic doesn't work at all.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|While I do have a television, I don't have a satellite, cable, &#34;rabbit ears&#34;, etc.  I have Netflix and DVD's.  The quality of television that I was getting just wasn't worth the expense.  The exceptions to that include CASTLE.  I can watch the shows on the computer but how much more fun is it to have the Seasons to watch when I please.<br /><br />The relationship between Castle and Beckett was not only long awaited but also feared.  How often we've seen relationship status change and totally ruin the show.  (A lot of you don't remember the resulting train wreck of &#34;MOONLIGHTING&#34; but, trust me, it wasn't pretty.)  My favorite episodes are worth watching over and over, the others still are good television.  I think the series could work a little harder on expanding the characters (except for the daughter Alexis - her lack of respect and snide remarks directed toward a man who puts a very nice roof over her head, food on the table and pocket money continues to be a sore spot with me. I was thrilled when she went off to college and I'm hoping for elopement and a move to parts unknown.)  The story lines continue to be interesting which is probably not as easy as it once was as they enter into Season 6.  They have allowed considerable growth in Fillion's character while still maintaining some of the playfulness.  The occasional FIREFLY reference still tickles us diehard fans but this show stands on it's own and has done a wonderful job of doing so.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited when finally Candy Crush came to KIndle!!  Love, Love this game!!!!  Another great game for the Kindle Family!!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I had so so much hope for this book, I've been really excited for almost a year for this book to get here but nw that I've read it, I wish I wouldn't had. Like another review I read, there is enough sadness and bad things happening in our real world and at least myself, like to forget a little about all that while I'm reading, I just like to feel another story and hopefuly in the end, the story leaves a beautiful feeling in me. Well, Alllegiant definitely wasn't the case. First of all, I felt that there were too many times when I said to myself, &#34;this again?&#34;, it felt a little repetitive. Second, that ending, I don't have words for it, I get what Veronica Roth was trying to express, teach or whatever but you just simply do not do that to a legion of loyal readers who expected and DESERVED a happy ending. I wish I could get a refund for this book but since I'm from Venezuela, it's impossible to refund dollars to a credit card. That's the only thing that stops me from doing it. So, an advice?Just read Divergent and Insurgent and imagine your happy ending because in Allegiant, you sure as hell don't get it
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The game keeps you involved developing habitats for some interesting animals. The only complaint I have is the difficulty to get the Acorns needed to get so many of the animals and land as the game progresses. I have started spending less time playing because there is little I can do without spending real money. This makes it less than a five rating.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|Jack Black makes this movie hilarious.  This is a movie the whole family can sit down and enjoy together. I hope they make more Kung Fu Panda movies.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really liked all the other books in the series. The ending was the worst thing that you could put in a book you can't kill off the main character that everybody wants to see grow and live a great life with Tobias
B003SI9WYG|4.0|Our son thinks he likes to watch scary movies, probably because we do, but every time he watches one he is scared for months and takes up camping out in our room.  And I am talking about mild scary movies.  Anyway, since Halloween is approaching he started his annual &#34;I want to watch scary movies&#34; rant and we came across this movie.  I know this is a classic but me nor my husband had ever seen it (not really our kind of scary movie).  But this is definitely a great Halloween movie for kids.  Not too scary and definitely not gory.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|This was a fun book to read.  It is creative and new.  It uses new ideas that I haven't ever thought of.  Good job Brandon.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|a little tedious but when my kids figure it out they'll like it. just wish the timers weren't so long it really slows things down.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Fresh take on the old story of lost memory. You can't help but feel Chris's confusion and eventual terror. Great protagonist, well written.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This game is really fun. I had a blast playing it for two days until they wanted me to pay ANOTHER dollar for more levels . This is not a long lasting game if you don't want to pay more. It's not worth a dollar. It should be free.........
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You think it will always be simple but nope. As you go on it gets very difficult real fast! Rather it be jelly or timed you still come back to it
B00942Y35S|5.0|Very cute movie and outside of the box.  Very enjoyable and a good movie for little girls to help with self esteem
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|I wish if I had seen this movie in the cinema! it is amazing and completely bad ass. It is just another day on the job for Dredd
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|If all you want to do is make yourself notes, this will do. if you want an alarm, a calender, or to customise the list or format, don't get it. I couldn't even change the date format from dd/mm/yyyy to mm/dd/yyyy. I Like a lot more functionality in a notepad.
006202406X|1.0|*SPOILERS ALERT*<br /><br />Disappointment does not even begin to describe what I feel right now. I only liked the beginning of the first book until the end where it begin to go down hill, the second, there really wasn't much to describe about and the third? Well, like I said there really isn't a word besides disappointment to fully alliterate with what this book meant as a whole, as the final book to a trilogy that had so many people talking and buzzing around the internet. I hate putting a book down, even if it's a horrible book, especially in a trilogy... so I made myself to read this one and well... I feel like Veronica Roth who had put so much effort and time to the first book (and maybe the second) that she just literally butchered the third book. Every character's death should have a reason and some kind of justification to it and even if the death itself was so horrendous, make it believable; make it so it make sense to the readers! I find it sad that Tris, who had lived through so much pain, tragedy, selflessness, had to make the ultimate sacrifice just so others could have a better reason to live (I could understand this if you made it more believable in the context itself) and fight for. And to be honest, for someone who fought so hard and never had that chance to live through it...makes it even more worst. For all its worth, it's just a big sad, sad ending...even her death was just not fitting as a conclusion to the series, what exactly was the point of her death played in the end about? To have others see her sacrifice and use it as an example to not make stupid mistakes ever? Or What? I don't even know myself... Wish it was better.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This a poignant tale of life at its worst and life at its best.  It is a tender, well- written story of hopelessness embraced by helpfulness concluding with hope fully emerging as reality. I highly recommend gift yourself by reading it.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|It is my third Invicta and I really got impressed for this one.  Invicta is the best watch brand around 100 bucks. Products made with quality and design for a fair price.
B00EO10M54|4.0|I'm not a Miley fan but this young lady nailed it with this album.  She has a beautiful voice that can be rough when needed and soft at the same time.  She is showing the world that she has grown and here it is!!!  Love it!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is exactly what I was looking for.  The integration with Netflix and YouTube works very well, and being able to share a tab from Chrome is extremely handy.  It is easy to set up and works as advertised.  I highly recommend this product and will be getting this for my friends and family.  You will get a great value for your money if you buy this.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Eventually, the game becomes more challenging. Keeps you interested and makes you think strategically before making your move to try to do it in the least moves possible.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Fantastic.  The more I play the more I realize that there is no goal and this will go on until I mine every block in my world.  Ah, that must be the goal!  Love it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I love stories that remind me that life is not always fair, nor easy, but we can make choices that can bring us great love and a sense of belonging.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Great game to play on your cell phone while your waiting in line or waiting anywhere at the doctors office or really anywhere.
B00BSBUZT6|3.0|The first disc is very interesting, but the 2nd disc not as much.  The live concert wa good as well.
B00E3QJ7ZG|5.0|Universal has given &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34;(1973) a beautiful Blu-ray transfer for it's 40th Anniversary that will make Western fans proud and fans of Clint Eastwood want to add this to their collections. Eastwood made three Westerns in the Seventies(&#34;Joe Kidd&#34;, &#34;The Outlaw Josey Wales&#34;) and &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; was his first Western as both star and director. Filmed at Mono Lake, the cinematography by Bruce Surtees looks stunning in this Blu-ray presentation from Universal with vibrant colors that are a wonder to behold. The restoration team at Universal deserves lots of credit for making this great Western look brand new. Not only can you see the dust of the town of Lago, but you can feel it too. Even the beads of sweat on the actor's faces stand out in the pristine close-ups that Eastwood films. Another improvement of the standard DVD release is the Audio. It's so clear that in the beginning of the film when Eastwood's mysterious  Stranger rides silently into town the only sound is the horse's hoofs hitting the dusty dirt road(A word of warning: the gunshots are loud so you may want to turn down the volume). The production design is another standout given a whole new life through this Blu ray presentation. You can really see the detail in both the interiors and exteriors. Costumes are more vivid too down to the smallest details. &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; is 105 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 2.35.1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH and Spanish. Audio features are English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English Dolby Digital 2.0 and French DTS Digital Surround 2.0. The only special feature is the Theatrical Trailer. This Blu ray also includes both Digital Copy and UltraViolet and comes in a slipcase. If you love Westerns or a fan of Clint Eastwood, then you'll be more than pleased with this great new Blu-ray release from Universal.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|enjoyed this cd and of course it's easy when you like cold play. shipping was fast and I would recommend to others.
B00005JKHP|5.0|always been a Treky - love this movie and a good collectible as it is the Director's cut meaning more footage - good collectible for a Treky
B00FR3WZKI|1.0|the only really great remix is track ones love to love you baby, its fresh and a great remix, the rest, sad, all of them sound like there dated and from the 80s . Its sad, thats someone could have picked different songs, more songs, and did remixes that sound like there from 2013. When i heard these, i thought they were old remixes they found from 20 years ago, And one song it a DUB version, meaning no singing, really? a Donna Summer song without her voice? This cd is a mess, and I cant think who approved  these remixes, I have been a fan for over 43 years, and to hear these messy too long and dated so-called new remixes, its sad. It was a great idea, but done very, bad. Shame on whoever put this together, Maybe try another one, but more updated. So sad and what a mess.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was not the best book of the series, but still really good. I loved all of it except the ending when the author kills off  a main person to the story. I feel that she could of went a different way with the ending that would have apeled more to the readers.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This isn't one I'd go pay to see at the theater but no the less, it is a great movie!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I reread the first two books in the series(Divergent & Insurgent) over the past weekend. They were just as great reads second time around! I couldn't wait for Allegient to come out.<br /><br />All three books take you through the struggles that young people have while trying to figure out who they are in this broken world. My favorite characters were Tris & Tobias. I think Veronica Ross captured the essence of young love and the roller coaster of emotions that fly high. Somehow, this young couple figured out that there is no magical \\"happy ever after\\". Everything in life is a choice whether it's to forgive or to love. Wise beyond their years they manage to always choose each other. That's what makes it so difficult to say goodbye to these characters.<br />It's definitely not the way we want our young couples relationships to go but I saw it coming early on.<br /><br />Tris was so strong, brave, and beautiful! While the series mentions more than once that she's not very attractive when it comes to looks & figure but it's her qualities of standing for what's right, her desire to help the oppressed, her loyalty to her friends, and her willingness to do what it takes to restore the broken world that makes her a true beauty!<br /><br />The thing I missed most in this book were the factions. I had hoped that with all the characters missing the world they believed in, that they would help to rebuild but to have a representative from each faction in government rule. Also, there shouldn't be any factionless. If a person fails initiation of their choice then they should be allowed to return home & try a different faction the next day of choosing.<br /><br />Overall the book was well written but a tear jerker. Not the ending I would have preferred but a good read all the same!
B00C6B9H46|5.0|This is the first movie in the series but I hadn't seen it so before the new Riddick came out, I wanted to watch this one, then the second movie (The Chronicles of Riddick) before going to see the new one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i love this book. it is amazing. it's very steamy and kinky. but its a good read. the ending wanted me to move on to the second book right away. and of course i did. amazing.
B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|I need to gave this album a 2.5 as the songs are not on par with the first part.  It seems like this album is made up with the songs that didn't make it into the first one rather than another album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg thank you Amazon....I waited forever for this app on my Kindle Fire hd.......it so much better to play on my Kindle Fire than Facebook. The graphics are awesome.....
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and it was easy to see Danny in the character of Dan.  I missed Redrum. It's good to have it back.
0525953728|4.0|As a vet, it is nice to be able to read a book about the training and the missions. The author would have another star if the language were cleaner. Overall though, a nice job!
B0002KZAKS|4.0|It was just like the ones I saw in the store but I was able to purchase it for half the price.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|I wouldn't expect Brad Pitt to do a movie like this. It was ok, a little different than the usual zombie movie....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When I found out it was out on kindle I screamed! :-) I play on facebook and my iphone. This game is sooooooo addicting. I cant put it down. ;-)
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I wouldn't say I'm a &#34;Trekkie&#34; but I'm definitely a fan. I have admit one thing about the movie: If you didn't see the original Star Trek episode featuring Ricardo Montalban as Khan you're doing yourself a disservice. You'll miss out on most of the finer objectives of the story. Either way it's a SPECTACULAR movie!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|For the Star Wars Fan! Great addition to the angry birds.  Plus it is free always a good thing.  Warning can be addictive.

006202406X|1.0|The reason JK didn't kill Harry is because it would have ruined the series.  Ms. Roth just turned me completely off from any future books.  I refuse to invest any more time in her books.  She could of had an uplifting wonderful ending, instead of one that just sours the series.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very easy to use and fun app that is similar to the version I have on my lap top and PC
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|Creepy movie with good scares. Really solid actors makes this a much better movie. I'm always trying to find a movie that truly makes me creeped out, in which the characters don't constantly do stupid things, where the reasoning for what's happening makes some sense, and also that my mom will like...not too much gory stuff basically. This succeeded on all counts.<br />That doll is really disturbing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is about time. it will be so nice to play this on a screen bigger than my phone without having to use my computer.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Another fast paced book by David Baldacci. I enjoyed the twists and turns.  I know that this is a work of fiction however it certainly seemed real.  I would recommend the book to anyone who enjoys reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Funnest app ever known by me hope it stays. Let's have fun people and play some awesome candy crush. Boo YA!!!
B000KIPT30|5.0|This is exactly what I needed!<br /><br />We have a home bar where I've started utilizing my DJ skills from a previous lifetime only now I primarily use a laptop instead of all those vinyl and CDs (although I mix those in, too) I have (it's so much easier when drinking!).  I've also been doing a few paid DJ gigs, too.<br /><br />Trouble is, when the music is cranked it's difficult to hear the beats to mix through my headphones while in the &#34;preview&#34; mode.  I jerry-rigged a Lepai speaker amp and, while it got me through a few gigs, the sound was too distorted at high levels and the Lepai amp would cut off at high output.  (Note: the Lepai works fine for my outdoor speakers, just not for this application).<br /><br />However, the Behringer amp is perfect!  I can crank it way up and hear the preview song and the pre-mix perfectly.  It actually cranks much louder than I need but it's nice to know the power's there if I need it.<br /><br />I don't need the 4 headphone outputs but it was cool letting my wife plug in and hear what I do prior to sending a mix live.<br /><br />Another note:  If you use this amp the way I do you will need two mini-to-1/4&#34; jacks to go along with it.  Additionally, this uses an A/C adapter so you'll need to make sure you have enough power outlets.  I carry an extra extension cord around just in case but the power cord on this amp was surprisingly long so I haven't had to use it, yet.

B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I'm a BIG horror fan, and nowadays you can't find too many GOOD scary movies; BUT luckily this movie is one of the rare gems out there! It's a very good horror flick! Not to mention it's a true story so that makes it even scarier! I recommend it guys =D you won't be sorry!
B0002KQNL8|5.0|Best zombie movie ever. From the soundtract to the acting to the special effects. This one will leave you hungry for brains!
B005SCSL56|5.0|Chris Colfer charms the audience with this twist on fairy tales. My duaghter and I both read the series and we both enjoyed them!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|A good story,  but had an unusual ending, not a bad or strange one,  just different and very thought provoking
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Although I am an adult I did enjoy this book.<br />Chris Colfer is not just a good actor he is a great author. I really enjoyed both of his &#34;The Land Of Stories&#34; This is book two So I do recommend reading book 1st. And I really hope there is a book 3.<br />My daughter of 12 is also reading it and is enjoying it as well.

006202406X|1.0|* *SPOILERS* *<br /><br />I shall FOREVER resent this book, and especially that ending, because no one will EVER convince me that Tris's horrible just horrible and TOTALLY UNNECESSARY death wasn't for pure shock; this shows SO much disrespect for the character, and for me, as a fan of the series, that it makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it. Yes, Veronica, I get it, I get that Tris is selfless and reckless (AND ALWAYS LEAVES TOBIAS), and in Allegiant she had to remain loyal to herself, but you know what? She was never dumb, and yet she didn't even have her gun with her... but you so wanted to end the series like this, didn't you, that it doesn't even matter. No, wait, getting killed by a guy who happens to stumble upon her in that lab, who shots her multiple times, and who afterwards DOESN'T EVEN GET THE PUNISHMENT HE DESERVES. EXCUSE ME?? That epilogue: joke, thanks for ruining Tobias Eaton for me. Seriously, this book laughs at me, right in my face. Because of it, I'll always remember this whole story with a sense of wrongness, and this infuriates me to no end because the first book, and those beloved characters, don't deserve it. How will I ever re-read Divergent or recommend it to other people now? I mean there's NO POINT, there's NO HOPE, you killed our hope, she's ashes on the ground. I will NEVER read Veronica Roth AGAIN.

1559271620|5.0|Ender's Game and the sequel Speaker for the Dead are perhaps the som of the best SCI-FI novels written in the last half of the 20th Century. The first book is a rework of the mundane alien monster invasion of earth theme with a difference, that not only makes one question the hummanity of some the characters involved, but also in the end there is a depth of sorrow for the aliens that were destroyed not found in the mnany examples of this theme. The story can be considered a coming of age novel for late tweens and teens, but the violence is a little much for younger kids. I read it as an adult and find it to be a great story. Because most of the protagonists are young children it would appeal to them on the action alone. For adults the questions of the morality of a worldwide process of grooming children to become master tacticians and strategists leaves ont thinking. Also what to do with these Napoleans and Alexanders after the inevitable victory. The world view is not to distant thus there are nation states, and alliances whose conflicts were put aside to battle the existential threat. Now that it is done what next? OSC has done a brillant job of a page turner that leaves one wondering about the above issues. The Sequel is more of an adult novel dealing with things such as how much control can earth exert on distant colonies when it takes decades to get to them and how does humanity interact with another alien species which has very little in common with us. After the last encounter with an alilen specis  resulted in extinction, is this the only possible result? It also deals with the nature of artifical life vs bilogical life. The science part of these novels is not the most technically sound but again the genre of science fiction has room for techological sci-fi as well as sociological Sci-fi. OSC sereis of Ender novels are of the second type.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy and convenient to set up. Queuing videos on the tablet to play on the TV is something I'll never want to miss anymore.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great game i got so far in it and had everything upgraded and everything.. so i restarted just to play again
0800187873|5.0|arrived in top condition and on time.price wise this was great buying as vhs are getting  very hard<br /><br />to get in new Zealand but remarkably there is an increasing demand because of the high quality of the picture and<br /><br />the ease of replay, len holland
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book is amazing, and being a big reader, it is one of my favorites now. it had me crying, laughing out loud and &#34;awe&#34;ing throughout it. read this book!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG!!! This is the best game EVER. I have been waiting so long for it to get on the kindle and ITS FINALLY HERE!!!! :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It is very addictive. Be careful or you will play for hours. Also there are very few pop ups.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|VERY bad ending, I know it had to be conclusive but tris dying and tobias being all depressed about it takled my hopes to the dirt. I was hoping tris and tobias's relationship would progress some but it didnt. This will cause trouble for your later book series and this one cause you just shed light on how sad and depressing the divergent series was
B000F7OMZ2|5.0|I grew up with this movie and really wanted to pass it on to my kids too.  How fun to share the creepy things together with my own kids!
0062278096|5.0|This book is fantastic. It gives background to the character of Sherlock Holmes, as well as background to the stories referenced in the TV series. Also, you can look inside Watson's case portfolio to see notes he made, pictures, and etc. It was very entertaining!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great app! Better graphics than my phone. I am glad that Amazon finally got the app. It is easy to use and easy to sync to Facebook.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So enjoyable to watch a truly well written amd visually engaging program at my leisure.  Made me forget I was running on the treadmill.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME...waited for a long time go be able to play this on my kindle fire.  Thanks  love it love it.  Hard to resist.
B00FEX1AA2|4.0|Now I own it and can watch it again and again to see if others react the same way I did.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|If you were a fan of the first 2 you won't be of part 3. Not funny and didn't laugh. Wanted the movie to end so bad because it sucked.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|My niece wanted to watch it and I was glad we did and now wished I had bought it. I will probably watch it again.
B00DW1WR14|2.0|The first two tracks \\"Get Away\\" and \\"Mind Your Manners\\" have a little bit of punky grunge energy to them, but the rest of this album is very dull and uninterestings.<br /><br />First of all Eddie's voice is very annoying because it sounds like a cross between Scott Stap and Dave Matthews, not a good sign. Then again i never cared much for Eddie Vedder's singing, plus all the songs sound like Creed B-Sides. When you start ripping off the band the cloned you're sound that's always a bad sign.<br /><br />Bottom line: Most of the songs are uninteresting and lifeless, they just sound bored. Maybe it's cause these guy's are starting to age.
B0045DO8LK|5.0|This album had such an impact to me as a kid, it changed everything for me. This was my second Pearl Jam album to hear TEN being the first, but when i first listened to YIELD something about the album caught my attention and this is my favorite album of all time not only because of the impact it had on me as a child but the YIELD is a strong album overall the songwriting is beautiful, the musicianship is incredible, Pearl jam delivers in all their albums before this and after. In my opinion Pearl Jam is the greatest rock and roll band around today and YIELD is an underrated album of the 90s.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love king com it is the world's most popular game and their families will enjoy this game thank you for your website!

6303446590|5.0|Just as wonderful as the other video.  My grandson will be enjoying these for a long time.  Better than the cartoons.
006202406X|2.0|A sad end to a good start. I enjoyed the first two books. The third however was very slow paced, and did not make much sense.All the cities are ongoing experiments to repair genetic damage in humans that cause violence? I also did not like the two person narrative going on. Very hard to follow, They did that in Matched ( the last two books), and I did not care for it then. IF I could go back in time I would most certainly not buy this book. I recommend Fallen or Skinned instead.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it's fun for the whole family!!!! Even my 2year old plays this game! And it's great for on the road too :)
B005HE5J7I|5.0|I love the city of London and I love historical novels when they are well written.  This has the complete history told with interesting characters and storyline.  I can't wait to get Paris next.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|This CD is OK, I was expecting more I think, with a title like Duets I was expecting something like the Tony Bennett duet recordings, this one is different then that. It is ok but not great.

B002GHIPYI|5.0|If these cans had a name brand on them, people would pay $100 easily. Oh wait, they do.<br /><br />Comparing these to my Grado SR-80i cans, these hold up nicely. A bit warmer, better sound stage and better isolation, though not by much. Not as bright either, which is not what I had expected based on the other reviews. Maybe this says something about tolerances in the mfg process?<br /><br />The cord is not as thick as the cord on the Grados, which in my opinion is a plus. Now I don't feel like I have an umbilical cord attached to the side of my head.<br /><br />Comes with a screw-on type 1/4\\" adapter, with gold(ish) plating.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the bass is a little too loose for me. I listen to mostly death/black metal, speedmetal and stoner, so while there's not much bass, necessarily, in those genres, I'd like the bass that IS there to be tighter. It can get a little boomy at times. Running them through my Fiio E7 smooths things out a bit, so it might be mostly my source causing the boom.<br /><br />Anyway, read what I said above and remember I'm criticizing a pair of $30 phones like they were $100. These cans are in daily use and I love them. The Grados stay in my drawer at the office now. This is one of VERY few reviews I have  written for one of many audio products I have purchased. I like these so much I felt compelled to write about it 6 months after purchase. Buy them.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|Love Stevie Nicks and this concert with Fleetwood Mac was one of their greatest hits as far as I'm concerned,  love the expanded version and would highly recommend this to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE this game. Thank you for finally making it available on kindle fire. Totally as addicted to it and even when it takes forever to win a level I refuse to give up. Has not cost me a penny to play and am on level 170.  You just have to keep trying.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I almost never write reviews for books. Having formerly worked as a film critic, I know how subjective all reviews can be. But this book upset me so much I felt compelled to comment on it here. I read and loved Divergent. I liked Insurgent, although as many have already acknowledged it had its problems. I've been waiting anxiously to read Allegiant and even pre-ordered it, another thing I never do.<br /><br />I have rarely been so disappointed in an ending as I was for this book. It ruined the entire trilogy for me, and made me frustrated that I spent so much time on it and invested any emotion in these characters. Yes, the writing has its share of problems, with Tris and Tobias sounding the same in each of their chapters. It's impossible to tell who is narrating any given section. In spite of that, I could go along with the book and still care about the characters and plot. I wanted to see what happened and how Roth pulled these three books together.<br /><br />Then comes the ending. I won't give an spoilers here, but my advice to anyone who loved the first two books - stop reading!!!! Any ending to the trilogy you imagine for yourself will be better than how this one actually ends.<br /><br />I debated between giving this book one or two stars, since I did enjoy parts of the book. The ending was so disappointing and frustrating, however, that I felt I had to be honest - it made me hate the entire book. Save your money, save your time, and let Tris and Tobias live happily ever after in your memories.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Tiny Thief is great! It's fun, challenging, and features great smooth animation. My only complaint is that I flew through the levels rather quickly. It only has 30 levels and 5 are just tutorial. I wish I had more to play. Could be solved by adding more in an update down the road. Works beautifully smooth on my Galaxy S4 Google Ed. w/ Jellybean v4.3
B00371QQ0M|1.0|I guess I'm one of the few or maybe the only one who couldn't stand this movie? I wouldn't know where to start about this film? The only good thing about this was the AQ i guess. I know this film serves as nostalgia piece for most people out there, and i have seen most sci-fi films out there, almost all. I love sci-fi but I think that you either had to have grown up with this movie or seen it back in 1984 to really enjoy it or get into it.<br /><br />Even the first Star Wars movie came out in 1977 and it had a much better story and special effects than this monstrosity, and that's 7 years before Dune! I thought this movie would be an improvement. Plus the music score is downright horrid. I mean, bad acting, bad hair cuts, bad music, picture is too dark, and what's up with this pizza faced guy flying around, had mixed up story line, and again...had really bad special effects for even 1984's standards for crying out loud! This movie got down right cheesy at times. My wife and I are big sci-fi fans but i guess I'm missing the point on this yawn fest somehow. I do admit that I bought this as a blind buy because the cover looked really cool-awesome, had sting in it, and dealt with space! Plus this film had awesome reviews from Amazon so i thought what the heck! Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />I know what your thinking though, I'm a young one and want more action in movies, right? Wrong. It's true though in this sense but its the nonsensical storyline and musical score which make this a snoozer.  I'm from this film era, 40yrs old, never seen this movie though. My wife and i are big sci-fi fans so thought I would blind buy this because it's a space flick, right? Wrong, this movie is so wanting to be \\"artsy\\" but ended up being confusing and semi-hoaky so much we couldn't finish it. We turned it off half way through and now it's collecting dust on my shelf.<br /><br />You'll be better off renting this flick before buying it...If anything, rent it for nostalgia purposes or a bunch of laughs. I wished we had rented this flick first before buying it directly. We turned it off half way through because it was so boring, both the wife and I started falling asleep, very uninteresting, very long, and just weird. Again we even thought since Sting was in it this movie would be an instant classic, but even his presence couldn't save this film IMO.<br /><br />Even Star Wars, Star Trek, and other movies fare much better from this time period than this strange artsy sci-fi flick. If the creepy haircuts and boring storyline didn't get you intrigued, then you also have the fat nasty flying pizza face guy and the vag faced worm. I really wanted to like it, I really did.h of laughs. I wished we had rented this flick first before buying it directly.

This is one of the &#34;I wish&#34; books ... &#34;I wish&#34; that I would have read it sooner!  A must read type of book regardless of which industry.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Afi seems to keep succeeding to softer sounds, sort of.<br />Sort of because the thier sound Might never have been well like death metal, ok.<br />but they have always still been hardcore.<br />Thier lyrics and delivery seem to keep succeeding to softer and more mature sound.<br />It sounds similar to what they been doing for some time, with instruments guitar and drums.<br />Its sounds similar to crash love in the way the rock vocals are soft.<br />But almost completly different (of course) because they don't rap as<br />much as Crash Love (sing rap that is).<br />I'm not an expert , maybe it's more alternative hard rock than the hardcore punk and pop punk.<br />The first few tracks really do it for me listen to 1 through 5.<br />Of Course now I have to listen to this all the time, untill the next mystery sound LP.<br />(maybe they could like change thier look and sound to Slipknot stuff, ha ha, (<br />thier good to0.))<br />Anyway I'm feel comfortable with this LP.<br />And I feel 5 stars is perfect for me.!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Holy cow. I can't read anything from John Green without melting into a puddle of tears. Can't say enough about this book. It was amazing and so well written. I've fallen in love with the characters-all of them. These characters are so real. Just...to experience the love they felt for each other was phenomenal. Augustus Waters...wow.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|Extremely basic app for taking notes. No font changes, no background changes...just type your notes and it automatically saves the fles. I'm almost talking myself down to two stars. Hmmm.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device made it possible to stream youtube wirelessly from our android phones, tablets, ipad. Best experience was sharing all PC screen wirelessly from my Chrome browser.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'm a good reader, voracious and detailed oriented. This is a well written book about two sick, self-aware logic junkies who find a kind of assonance with each other. It's a sweet kind of love.<br />This story doesn't idealize childhood cancers; it gives the kids the respect to have their own feelings and motivations.<br />There's a twist in this plot, and to me, it was pretty telegraphed. However, to a less careful reader, it will only be apparent on a second reading. Which I think this book deserves.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited to see Candy Crush available for the Kindle fire! I had been checking frequently and no I have my favorite game on all my devices.  Works great so far but beware - its super-addictive!

B00C2VIA52|5.0|The graphics are very good. The story line fits the game. Controls are easy to use and understand. Very fun and enjoyable.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|Okay...so the update is on...in all honesty, I HATE waiting (per say, a MONTH at least) to get just ONE update that is, and I quote, &quot;required&quot; to be able to play the game. I do hope that the developer(s) will be able to get this fixed, HOWEVER, if this is going to take very long, which, at our current rate of technological advances being made as of current, it really shouldn't. So please, if your going to have a stupid game on MOBILE, such as android or Kindle, take my advice: DO NOT IGNORE THESE REVIEWS! This is why they're here in the first place!!

B00E95ED32|5.0|Although I've read a lot of people giving this album critique over it &#34;not being real _____&#34;(insert genre of music you think Avicii should fit), and some people just saying it plain sucks, with no other reasoning but opinion, I'm actually a huge fan of &#34;True&#34;. I choose not to expect certain types of music or specific things from artists, and I support them toying with their style and sound. This is exactly what Avicii does. Many people who didn't like it simply hated it because it didn't sound like Avicii or what they know to be the Avicii sound. If I were to hear these songs at a party or on the radio without knowing that it was Avicii's, I'd be curious to find out who it was and look them up. Given, it does change what I hear in my head when I think of him, but I think that's a positive aspect. Favorite songs: &#34;Wake Me Up&#34;, &#34;Lay Me Down&#34;, &#34;Dear Boy&#34;, &#34;You Make Me&#34;. Can sound anywhere from country-ish, to trance, to straight up non-genre-specific stuff where you just can't place it...but you dig it. 5 Stars from me. I look forward to more albums.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books of this series and have read them twice each.  Was so looking forward to this book.  Though I was engrossed while reading, all it takes is a bad ending to spoil a series. I don't think I will be able to read these anymore knowing the outcome.  And that saddens me more than this book ending.  I understand that everything is life is not all rainbows and sunshine, but the REASON a lot of people read YA FICTION is for a good story with an ending that leaves them full of hope and yearning to BE the main character.<br /><br />I have a very distinct feeling that this will taint the whole series and prevent a lot of future potential readers from starting this series at all.
B00F0N7JUG|3.0|Yea... The &#34;statue&#34; that the Collectors Edition comes with is a low quality injection plastic mold shell. It is not recommended that you remove the plastic box the statue comes in as the statue holds the discs using a flimsy pressure tab.<br /><br />Movie is great, special features are standard fare, I had expected some deleted/ extended scenes either filmed or drawing board conceptualization, but alas nothing of the sort.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally!!!! my favorite game is on the app store. This game is so fun and addicting I can't stop playing it! GREAT JOB AMAZON FOR GETTING CANDY CRUSH ON AMAZON APPSTORE!!!!!!

031623480X|5.0|If you think you have a problem with gluten, this book will convince you to change your diet.<br />Some information I had read before but also information that was new.  Well worth the price of the book.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Going into Allegiant, I already had a sense of what my reaction was going to be. Divergent was amazing, Insurgent was okay, and if this book followed the trend, I knew I wasn't going to be thrilled by the end.<br /><br />And I wasn't.<br /><br />It had nothing to do with the ending, okay, it had a little to do with the ending, but there was more to it than that.<br /><br />If you don't want spoilers, (although I think most of them had been addressed already in previous reviews) then you may not want to read this review.<br /><br />Issue #1:  The dual points of view. I think this was a bad choice, especially for the last book. Trilogies should be able to be read back to back and sound like a complete, cohesive story. With the two POVs in Allegiant, it felt broken off from the other two. Did I like understanding things from Tobias's POV? Sure. But it didn't work when it was only in one book of the trilogy. And through the whole book. It would have made more sense if it had been at the end after the death, almost as if he had been picking up where she left off to complete the story, but the way it was written, didn't work for me. It felt choppy and I had a hard time telling the difference between the two. There wasn't enough difference in the way it was written for me.<br /><br />Issue #2:  The story. It just didn't flow as well as I would have hoped it would. I think it would have been better if the United States was completely gone and there was a no-name government that was controlling everything. And I had an issue with a lot of the character developments. For Evelyn to just switch like that was out of character. She had abandoned her son years before without really a second though. Why switch at the drop of a hat? It wasn't believable. And I won't even mention the Peter thing or the Marcus thing because I think a lot of people have already said all I wanted to say about those two.<br /><br />Issue #3:  The death. I have to bring it up. It wasn't that it happened,because it was predictable. As soon as Caleb volunteered, I knew Tris was going to die. Not only because I had already read the ending (because the book honestly felt endless and I needed to know what happened at the end) but because it wasn't in his nature to be that type of person. It was more the way it was handled. She believed she was invincible and that the death serum wasn't going to harm her so she went into it with no fear. Even the bravest person in the world would be afraid to go into that kind of situation. And to only tell Caleb to tell Tobias that she didn't want to leave him? That would have left anyone with more questions than comfort. But because she felt she was invincible, she didn't feel as if she needed to say anymore. And then she was felled by a gun shot wound. Yep. Totally makes sense.<br /><br />This story wasn't meant to have a happy ending for Tris and Tobias. You could tell from the beginning. That didn't mean there couldn't have been a different way to wrap it up. But the reason the book didn't get a lower rating was because in some ways, it was a good book. It showed that you don't get a happy ending. That things aren't always as the seem. That you need to do what you believe is right. But the way it story was put together just wasn't fulfilling enough for me. There were too many issues that I had with it. Divergent, I'll read again. Insurgent, I may read again. Allegiant, I doubt I will.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I started to read the Divergent series late in 2012 and I fell in love with the characters and the plot, but as the story progressed Veronica Roth killed off most of the characters I loved. I hate it when the author kills off the main character at the end of a series. It feels like a cop out to me. It is a choice for someone who didn't know how to end their books. People don't read books to feel depressed, people read books to escape their problems.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of the best movies out there.  Well acted and casted. Morgan Freeman is just terrific and this was one of his best.  Loved it.

B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This is a simple notebook app like Windows Notepad or the app on the Apple products.  I own multiple tablets, smart phones and computer systems and they all have a similar app installed on them when they arrived.  This app is almost identical to those other apps but what can you expect, it is probably the simplest type of office app you can develop.<br /><br />It doesn't have all of the capability of Windows Notepad but it is OK for a small tablet.  It does rotate from landscape to portrait mode.  The font and screen grid on a Kindle Fire is crisp and it looks good on the screen. I typed several notes and they all became titled as New Note.  You can change the title and it will appear in the list with the new name.  You have to touch the title while in that note and delete the New Note and then type in your title name.  The text editing indicator that shows the location of where you are editing the title is dark blue, or black, on a dark brown background and it is difficult to see. It would have been better if the indicator was white while you are in the title bar so it would be more visible. I like the way that the Apple app takes the first line of the note and uses it as a title automatically as it is much simpler.  The date is shown in European format of day/month/year.<br /><br />Overall this is an average app. It is just OK and I would not purchase it as a paid app.  I do like that it has no bad permissions. You can also cut or copy the text and then paste it into an email. I rate this as a 3 star app.

B003ZMF26W|4.0|I had originally given this mouse a bad review due to what I perceived as a failure. Since then, I have discovered that it was actually the mouse pad (Steel Series 4HD).  My other mouse started to exhibit the same behavior.  I will review that mouse pad elsewhere.  In general, if you buy a high DPI laser mouse, make sure your mouse pad is free of any sort of high contrast pattern.<br /><br />So the only star I'll withhold on this review now is due to the poorly laid out buttons. I found that primarily the left mouse button arrangement resulted in my finger bumping up against the secondary button... you can look at the picture and see what I mean immediately. But I got used to it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like playing this game when I have a little time, like in a waiting room, or during my lunch break.  It doesn't take too much brain power, so it's easy.  A bit like a game of solitary.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|For its cost, this app is spectacular. The User interface is simple and pretty. The lesson progression system is mostly linear with some sub-paths; it makes you feel like you are progressing. The lessons feel like a video game, similiar to Rosetta Stone, but this keeps you entralled and wanting more. It does often assume you know things, and if you don't then you lose hearts, but here is no other penalty, so you just keep trying until you get it. The questions within the lesson are picture to word matching, verbal to text typing, and translating by typing or selecting words. The app stays synced with your account so you can use it on a computer (you should try the computer version) and continue on here. It requires Internet, however it will download the latest lesson to be used offline which is a feature I enjoy. It has a practice feature, so you can review what you learner so far, or practice individual lessons. If you already know some of the language, you can test out to a higher level too. Oh, and there are no ads.<br /><br />While it will teach you a lot, it won't get you entirely fluent, although you will be able to hold a general conversation. If you plan on becoming fluent you have to submerge yourself in a culture and reguraly speak the language. However, this is a very effective and splendid way to start and become, and you'll quickly learn thousands of words.<br /><br /> The languages as of now include English to: Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese, as well as all of those languages to English. Although Duolingo recently launched their language incubator, so expect to see some new languages eventually.<br /><br />Great app, if you want to learn one of these languages, get this app. It is the best free thing out there behind actually visiting that country.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game!! After countless times of intentional dismissal while browsing of apps, I finally decided to try it on. Could NOT be more grateful that I went against my game vibage. Not too simple, yet not over challenging. It kept me sucked in the entire time, without making me want to chuck my Kindle Fire against that evil wall of frustration I originally imagined it would of created in my life. For the most part, it definitely prolonged my happy time....until I completed the last level!!! WHY ONLY 10?? I can understand the process, creating new games, developing apps .... BLAH, BLAH, YADA ,YADA and what not..... But seriously, WHY ONLY 10???!!?? Hope this helps hurry up the arrival of many more levels to come. Needless to say, I am very much looking forward to it.

B00CEB5QU2|5.0|First I will say that I own several Kingston products and loved them all.<br />I already own three Wi-Drives by Kingston , 16G, 32G, and a 64G.<br />They work great.<br /><br />I bought this product for the flexibility of using UBS and SD cards for portable storage.<br />Here are my key PRO points:<br />1. Set up is a breeze<br />2. SD transfer and UBS transfer of date is flawless.<br />3. Streaming works great. (The better the SD card the better the streaming)<br />4. Battery life is great 5 hours is enough for me a day...I never ran it out.<br />5. The iPhone and iPad app is exactly the same as the Wi-drive app.<br />6. Transfer between USB and SD card is easy and is a great extra.<br />7. You can access the drive wirelessly with any browser and view and read files.<br />8. Size is convenient.<br />9. You can access this unit with the iPhone / iPad  &#34;Goodreader App&#34;...big plus for OS7 users. Transferring files to and from that app is what I find most useful. Once you files are in Goodreader you can use the OPEN IN to open any of the files any  of a multiple business  apps.<br />10. Only one negative...the on-off button is a pain.<br /><br />If I had this as a choice I would pick this over the Wi-Drive because of the unlimited storage available with this product.<br /><br />Lastly, I hope they update the app to let users create a folder on the portable device to transfer to.<br />Currently you need to creat folders on the SD or USB on your compter prior to the transfer.<br />It would be better to organize your photos or files on the removal drive or SD card.<br /><br />Overall I give this a best buy rating 10/10

B00CD36FF6|5.0|We have been led to believe dishonesty is a rational choice made by people weighing the incentives of choosing right from wrong.  Dan shows us that it is very much an emotional decision and that it has consistent, human roots that are about the same, regardless of where a person is from.<br /><br />He outlines several factors in the book.  I had thought to list them, but he kindly does so in the book itself.  You can find a very nice table near the end of the book on page 245 that shows the various factors and whether or not they are positive, negative, or neutral influences on honesty.  Perhaps the biggest surprise is that remedies to reduce dishonesty are doomed to fail because they do not consider the behavioral reasons why people cheat in the first place.  More reporting or oversight can fail.  Honor pledges can be surprisingly effective.<br /><br />This is a must read book for anyone trying to understand what makes people do what they do, especially when it comes to honest versus dishonest behavior.
0345803507|5.0|Wow, a great book, all the books in this series were great, going to make a great movie, thank you!
B00319ECGU|1.0|I love these movies, but it is really hard to watch this particular product because the playback briefly pauses every 15-18 seconds throughout the entire movie. This has never happened on our blu-ray player before. Very disappointed, and will not purchase any more DVDs from Amazon without watching them immediately on receipt.
B003UYUR10|5.0|I'm not sure where the heads are at of the reviewers who panned this movie, but they might want to take into account that this was a Fantasy Movie based on a Video Game. Sure there are historical inaccuracies and fantastical scenes, but that's the point.<br /><br />For me it was pure fun and I have re-watched the movie several times, and not just for the pure beauty of Gemma Arterton, In fact, my favorite performance is by Alfred Molina, who never disappoints me and comes through in spades this time as a 'slightly dishonorable entrepreneur'. He's just pure gold and a joy to watch.<br /><br />The action and the fighting is quick moving and never overdone. That can be a fine line to manage. Gyllenhall really makes a fun Dastan. He keep the dialogue fun with great physical acting- his expressions remind that this could have been done as an animation- and a wonderful friction-filled chemistry between his character and that of Gemma Arterton, the Princess Tamina. I've read in other reviews that they thought her acting stiff, but I think they have confused her playing a stiff character with her acting because she comes across as a spoiled princess who has yet to come out her shell. Her physical acting is wonderful as well if you watch closely. Her expressions at times can be priceless and when it comes time to express vulnerability she comes through quite well.<br /><br />All in all it's rally just a fun romp through a fairy tale, one that could have been done as a Disney animation, but the decision to make it live action was the right one. The rest of the supporting cast holds their own well, though most of the movie focuses on Dastan and Tamina. The physical stunts are really cool and even better when you realize that Gyllenhall did quite a bit of it himself.<br /><br />Well done, Highly recommended for at least one watch, but you should go through more than once because you will miss some fun things.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really enjoyed the world created in the first two books, but Alegiant ended up being a huge disappointment. Not only the death of a main character, but the ending in general, which didn't really make sense.  It was just a bit too convenient that this government agency, with security everywhere, be wired to gas everyone with the push of a button??  In addition, the most often used phrase in the entire book was &#34;Are you OK?&#34; This became very annoying by the end of the book, and really showed the limitation of the author's skill.<br /><br />To me, the author decided that in Allegiant, the whole &#34;ultimate sacrifice&#34; as the most important theme, which, obviously is her choice as the author, but it made the rest of the themes in this and the previous books (friendship, making your own family, love, fighting together for a cause) almost feel like they were forgotten. It made me feel cheated.<br /><br />Who knows? Maybe the movie will have a different ending...

B008HJGPVO|2.0|The multi-tip stylus works, but isn't a great deal better than tapping with one's finger.  The stylus is one more thing to keep track of. I ordered this, after seeing what looked like a great sale, and finding my pen didn't work well, to tap on the screen of my Galaxy 4 -- which puts symbols too close to the edge of the glass to easily tap without tapping other icons at the same time.

1476729085|4.0|First time author, Graeme C. Simsion makes a great splash with this internationally distributed book starring a brilliant protagonist with Asperger's Syndrome (though he is clueless and undiagnosed).  If you are a fan of TV show, \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" and the character, Sheldon Cooper, you will thoroughly enjoy this fast paced story.<br /><br />Don Tillman, a middle-aged associate professor of genetics, has decided that he must endeavor to find a wife.  Having struggled with social interaction and misunderstanding the complexities of close relationships particularly, he decides that the scientific approach to locating his compatible mate is best accomplished using a lengthy questionnaire to eliminate non-qualified potential partners.  Ironically, his best friend's are Claudia and Gene, a married couple, who are doctors as well; however, they are quite different in many ways.  Gene is also a geneticist at the same University and the antithesis of Don, a true playboy, who considers the world his sexual playground, giving little consideration to the feelings of his psychologist wife.<br /><br />Don relies on each to guide him in the subtleties of seduction, romance and his completion of his quest.  Through a series of missteps and numerous misunderstandings, an unqualified candidate becomes an obsession.  Could this be love?  Don watches many romantic movies recommended by Claudia and empirically determines that based on his reaction to them it is not.  Does science always have the answers to life questions?  I'm not going to tell you, you'll just have to read it yourself!<br /><br />The book was great fun, it is hard to write humor but Mr. Simon does a marvelous job of creating scene after scene of humorous incidents.  As a bonus, there are a few subtle insights in the plot; incorporating several situations where role reversal is used and the student becomes the teacher.  While I didn't laugh out loud, I had a smile on my face throughout much of this pithy story.<br /><br />This book was a joy to read.  It encapsulates an interesting medical condition into an informative adventure without being trite, preachy or judgmental. I highly recommend it to those reader's, who enjoy a light read without graphic language or gratuitous sex scenes.
006202406X|5.0|Spoiler Alert:<br />I love this book and I especially love how it ends. The ending is very poetic, full of symbolism and at it is clear that Tris was meant to sacrifice herself for her brother. Tris was happy to be reunited with her mother and although he was heartbroken I'm sure Four would go on and live a very happy and long life. I think  people do not understand the difference between a bad ending and a heart breaking ending in a book.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|The second book in the Ender series is vastly different from the first book, and in many ways much better.  It's science fiction told in a compelling way.  However, be prepared for lots of theories and beliefs the author has regarding the human race and how its members think and feel, which sometimes gets a little dicey.  But well worth the read.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|*********SPOILERS BELOW*********<br /><br />When I first discovered Divergent, I couldnt stop reading! It was amazing, and it was exactly the right balance between harsh reality and love. I was so excited to have found a new trilogy that I could be excited for. Insurgent comes out, I'm so happy, it's exactly the setup i wanted for an amazing conclusion that never happened. So allegiant comes out, I'm counting down the days, and I stayed up all night reading it. The POV's in both Tobias and Tris got me thinking about what she was planning to do, but I never expected what I got. Tris is a risk tasker, shes Dauntless! She's constantly almost getting herself killed. I read for an alternate reality, one that although has bad things in the end, the main characters make it through. The fact that I got that ripped out of my hands makes me so angry. When Tris SURVIVED the DEATH serum i was like this is it! Together forever. Then stupid david comes in and SHOOTS HER? The tris that is a role model of mine and a character i am so attached to... gets SHOT!? And not even for a good cause. I put down the book at that moment and was like this is not happening. This is not happening. Tobias and Tris WILL be together. They WILL. Then I start reading the mourning chapters and the epilogue and the harsh reality sets in. Tris IS dead. This didnt make a ton of sense to me at first because I was expecting to be happy when the book ended not sobbing! All the good series and trilogies that I have fallen in love with in the past have NEVER killed off the main character. Thats the golden rule of novels i THOUGHT. Sorry veronica roth, but its not edgy to kill of your main character and lose a ton of your fans. The next day, all my friends are super excited with their allegiant books and they are halfway through and loving it, and all I wanna say is stop now! Imagine your own ending! I really wish i could give this book 5 stars, I really do, but i just can't. Veronica Roth in interviews says that she knew all along that this was going to happen. I wish I knew so that I wouldnt have started reading the series. I am not excited for the movie because I know if I see it the whole time in the back of my head I will know that she DIES and I can't do that to myself. I apologize for all the other fans out there who have their hearts broken. Tobias and Tris forever&lt;3at she knew all along that this was going to happen.

1400069289|3.0|Only three chapters are both interesting and useful, but they all slow down when the author drags us through stories that could have been condensed into a few sentences or a couple paragraphs.  Frustrating.<br /><br />The science is interesting, but shallowly covered.  Basically the book is one big series of stories about how people changed habits to succeed in life.<br /><br />If you are looking for help yourself in this area, look elsewhere.  The author offers a small bit of useful advice:<br /><br />Basically, you look for the cues/triggers that are starting the routine/habit that you are not happy with but cannot seem to stop.  Then you determine what is the reward you are getting.  Are you eating the candy because of low blood sugar or because you eat with friends and need a chat or because you are nervous and it calms you, etc.?<br /><br />Discovering the triggers and rewards takes time and introspection--all left up to you.  The book cannot help you there.<br /><br />But once you do, you change the routine/habit by force of will every time you encounter the cue/trigger, making sure that the reward is the same.  The cue and reward must be the same.  So, instead of eating candy, you just go chat with friends on purpose, or you eat a better form of food to satisfy low blood sugar, or whatever.<br /><br />When you feel like engaging in the \\"bad\\" habit, ask yourself what you get out of the habit beyond the superficial and obvious.  Then replace that habit with a new one you desire to do that gives you the same type of reward/outcome/feeling.  Do this over and over until it becomes . . . a habit.<br /><br />So, there you go.  Saved you money.  Unless you enjoy random success stories.  Then the book is a good read for you.<br /><br />I wish I had not purchased this book, but you live and learn.
B0084B0656|5.0|The title of G. K. Chesterton's book, \\"Orthodoxy\\", made me expect at first a dry outline of the accepted tenets of Christianity. I expected him to delineate what we believe; I didn't expect him to show with such clarity and common-sense why we believe it.<br />He didn't begin from the perspective that Christianity was true. Instead, almost by process of elimination, he proved a hundred dead-ends to be not true, and further showed that what was lacking in each of them was present in the truth of Christianity.<br />He didn't start from the church as we know it today and work backwards, needing to strip it of controversy and confusion before he could reach a collection of pure facts - like one chipping away at a jewel to try to determine its components.  Instead he began as if Christianity was just being discovered, describing the shining delight of the jewel when first seen.<br />Instead of answering questions about Christianity, he asked questions that the human heart has always asked - only to find that Christianity was the answer to all of them.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm an avid reader, but I have never hated a book enough to write a review, until now.  I loved the first book.  I wasn't a huge fan of the second book, because it followed the formulas that so many trilogies seem to follow (undermining Tris by causing her to make foolish, illogical decisions, separating Tris and Tobias for almost the entire book, getting Tris and Tobias involved in a never ending revolution where nothing is accomplished).  I was willing to stick with the series because I hoped that the final book would bring everything together in a satisfying conclusion. I eagerly started reading it when it appeared on my Kindle.  Almost immediately, I realized that something was terribly wrong.  The writing was poor.  I was bored out of my mind.  Tris and Tobias seemed immature, unfocused and indecisive, not at all like the strong characters from the first novel. The author removed Tris and Tobias from the world she had created in the first book, which was so unique and integral to Tris' and Tobias' identities.  The plot made so little sense, I had to go back to the second book to try to find the thread.  The action and love scenes were lackluster.  I couldn't keep track of who the narrator was because there was no difference between their points of view.  After several chapters I quit caring and flipped through the book to the end, only to discover that Tris died a completely pointless death that apparently made little impact on Tobias.  I could have accepted it if her death had any meaning or poignancy but instead it was more like, \\"Then Tris died, blah blah blah, the end.\\"  If I could give this book less than 1 star I would.  I feel like I wasted my time on this whole series.  In fact, this book bears so little resemblance to the first book, I have to wonder, did someone else write this book??
B00472NZDQ|4.0|The author is a master story teller that occasionally sags a  bit when writing to meet a deadline of other reasons that would be interesting to determine.  I liked the story but it wasn't one of his best in my rating. But then I tend to put myself in the shoes of the hero and quickly realize difficult it must be for a writer to make his majpr characters survive the odds against them.
B00E8AVNBI|5.0|Dead in Tombstone was completed in 2012, but post production problems delayed the release date until Oct. 2013. It was well worth the wait! The movie reminds of the short lived TV Show 'Brimstone' where a damned soul earns redemption by tracking down other damned souls and sending them back to Hell. In 'Dead in Tombstone' a leader of an outlaw gang is murdered by his own gang and for all the sins of his life he is sent to Hell. Once there he makes a deal with the Devil to deliver the souls of the six men who killed him in exchange for his own salvation. The movie starts with the Black Water Gang breaking one of their members out of prison. As each member is introduced with a close up, a wanted poster for that outlaw appears. It's a great way to introduce the gang. Danny Trejo plays Guerrero Hernamdez leader of the gang. Anthony Michael Hall plays his lieutenant and Mickey Rourke plays a stellar role as the Devil. After the break out Hall tells Trejo about a bank job in Colorado that could have the gang set for life. So the gang rides to Colorado and they hit the bank. After the deed is done Hall wants to take over the gang and he shoots Trejo. The rest of the gang joins in and Trejo is murdered.<br />  Once in Hell Trejo makes a deal with the Devil to kill the six men who betrayed him in exchange for his salvation. The Devil accepts under two conditions, 1st Trejo only has 24 hours to deliver them to him and all six must die by his hand. So starts a 24-hour non-stop action thrill ride. I waited over a year for this movie and I was not disappointed. It was well worth the wait. I will not give a way the ending, but a possible sequel or series of sequels was set up. The special features include Deleted Scenes, Deleted Scenes Montage, Making of dead in Tombstone Featurette, and a Feature Commentary. The disc also includes the R-Rated Version and the Unrated Version. I believe the Blue Ray version of this movie has a few additional special features.
1416583432|4.0|The author uses anecdotal and scientific observations in trying to explain dogs.  It is an easy read but I thought she could have expanded on the scientific studies.  It made me wish I had paid more attention to my dogs over the years.  I throughly enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone interested in dogs.
006202406X|1.0|The third novel in the trilogy was lacking the plot and character development that characterized the other two novels. The realism that made her characters so relatable was non-existent and everyone felt so one dimensional.  I thought the ending was poorly done and I felt emotionless at her inability to draw me, her reader, into the drama of the last chapters.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|So well done. Definitely worth the wait!  I am definitely looking forward to the next series from this incredibly talented author.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game. When the speaker says, &quot;Sweet&quot; in that low voice it makes me chuckle. I like that the goals are different in the levels. I only wish for 2 things...more lives and a little more realistic challenge. On some levels there is just no way to beat it in the allotted number of moves without purchasing either extra moves or the lollipop. I understand that it's free but maybe a paid app with more options would be a good investment.
B00C1N9JWO|3.0|Nalini Singh seems to falter under the weight of this series' expectations sometimes. Kiss of Snow was abysmal and I think Heart of Obsidian is worse.  I give this 2.5 stars.<br /><br />I agree with the previous 2-3 star reviews that HO is repetitive, purple in its melodrama, and poorly constructed. Singh took one of the more intriguing characters in this series - Kaleb Krychek - and an equally fascinating counterpart, Sahara Kyriakus, and managed to make them romance genre tropes. I consider Nalini Singh - like Kresley Cole - and intelligent writer.  I also believe her readers to have higher expectations of their romance novels.  I'm actually quite surprised at the 5 star reviews here.<br /><br />Singh is clearly quite eager to set Krychek up as the \\"broody, inaccessible EEEEVIL\\" anti-hero.  There are multiple references per chapter regarding Krychek's ability to paint the ground red, litter the streets with bodies, crush the will of all those around him, etc.  While I believe that Singh means for us to conclude that Krychek is NOT the sociopath he describes himself to be - thanks in part to a rather obvious plot device (getting there next) - *who* he is remains largely unexplored because there's an utter lack of character development.  He is tethered to his uneasy humanity only by his fanaticism in finding and then \\"keeping\\" Sahara.  As with Hawke in KoS, I almost feel as if Singh became paralyzed by the options available to her with this character and therefore chose the simplest route possible.  Kaleb became a modern, suit-beclad version of the \\"Me Tarzan, You Jane, You Mine!\\" romances that pollute the genre.  If I never read the phrase \\"darkly possessive\\" or \\"dark possessiveness\\" again, it will be too soon. We GET IT. Krychek is possessive - darkly, even.  That does not substitute for character-building or decent monologue, of which there was sadly little save for the latter third of the novel. The reveals - Sahara/Kaleb's childhood friendship, Sahara's abilities, the identity of Ghost - which were clumsily hinted at via excruciatingly annoying cliff-hangers in previous chapters were handled with remarkable grace after chapter 30. Unfortunately it was far too late to safe the first two-third of this book.<br /><br />The obvious plot device mentioned is the *multiple* use of disasters of the mass death-inducing exploding variety to underline Krychek's incomparable power vis-a-vis other Psy and to force the pacing along. I counted Perth, Copenhagen, the university, Geneva, and Hong Kong among these. In all of these instances, a public attack is organized by Pure Psy, Krychek teleports in and either a) single-handedly saves the day or b) organized others to help him semi-single-handedly save the day. By the Copenhagen incident, I was afraid I was going to roll my eyes out of my head.<br /><br />Additionally, the \\"darkly possessive\\" Krychek, who could litter the street with dead babies without a twinge of conscience, who grew up under the less-than-tender wings of Enrico, is held to his waning humanity by...a ladyfriend. Oh COME ON.  STOP IT.  A quote from p 234: \\"I don't have empathy, Sahara. I can't feel for those who are going to die. It would be akin to asking a falcon to take flight when his wings had long been hacked off...without you, I would be a monster.\\"  We're repeatedly hammered over the head with exchanges like this and you know what?  The \\"love-as-my-only-redeeming-quality/weakness\\" trope is not hot.  It's novice Twilight fanfic right there and Singh is the furthest thing from a novice.  Krychek and Kriakus' hidden childhood relationship - which could have been interspersed with subtlety and sophistication along with Sahara's flashbacks - were instead shoehorned into the latter third of this book.  Krychek's (OBVIOUSLY) mistaken belief that he had participated in Sahara's torture was likewise shoehorned in.  BAM, ex-deux machina-style, this whole book is supposed to stand illuminated.  FAIL.<br /><br />On a positive note, I appreciate the continued progress on the political/world-building side.  Sahara's abilities were fascinating and her connection to the NightStar Clan allowed other characters to enter HO more fully.  Aden and Vasic were featured quite a bit and I felt that some hints were dropped about a possible Nikita Duncan/Anthony pair-up, although that could be wishful thinking.<br /><br />I've read this three times since I purchased it months ago in hopes that it would grow on me. Instead, I finish annoyed and vaguely frustrated each time.  It's unfortunate because outside of this (and KO), the series if exceptional.  However,  I would honestly advocate stealing this book from someone over purchasing it for an outrageous price of 11 bucks.  OK, obviously don't STEAL, but borrow from the library, don't buy.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was really looking forward to the last book of this trilogy and had high expectations that Ms. Roth would have grown as a writer and deliver the best of the series.  It was, unfortunately, the worst of the series. It was rambling and disconnected when the reader should have been getting a clearer sense of what a \\"better\\" world would be.  The ending seemed to be written for shock value and indicated an inability on the author's part to adequately describe what she hoped would have evolved.  The epilogue was full of clichés and an attempt to disguise the inability to write a really solid and satisfying ending, happy or not.  I read the first two books more than once and recommended them to my young adult students.  I will not do so with Allegiant.
B000RP4LEO|5.0|Startling performance. Played with such sensitivity and feeling. Her view of Beethoven as expressed in the notes is inspirational and perceptive

B0086HGW42|5.0|I bought this album for only 3.99 on amazon. Would've paid full price for it too. Ed Sheeran's melodies and lyrics are like honey. They're so calming and smooth and amazing. I absolutely loved this album and can't wait for his next!<br /><br />PARENTAL WARNING: Some songs do contain cursing such as You Need Me I Don't Need You and Wake Me Up. I love these songs and just tend to skip over the *bleep*<br /><br />Absolutely amazing album that will not disappoint!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging game with different ways to beat different challenges. Works great on the kindle fire, and I love the fact that it makes you put it down and come back to it later.....unless you want to pay of course.;)
B001AUEMFS|5.0|If you haven't heard this song, or don't have it in your itunes library- I am sorely disappointed with you. Improve your musical palate and buy this song! You will have absolutely no regrets! I've listened to it at least 200 times and it never gets old. It has a strange magic to it that way!

0061537969|5.0|Who would ever imagine that the best self-help book out there is told by one of<br />our scruffy, four-legged friends?<br /><br />Meet Enzo--the best self-helper to humans everywhere!<br /><br />So where have I been? This book's been around forever--but only in the past few months did I finally read! And I am a dog-lover, through 'n through  Woe to me that after plowing through slow moving duds like LIFE AFTER LIFE (the novel, not the famous NDE read) the myriad self-indulgent, and yes, self -help,  diatribes and Paul Coehlo's corn, I finally get around to one of the smartest story-self-help books I've come across.  All told by the wise pup,  Enzo.<br /><br />Enzo is profound. I mean, some of the lines are so good,--I could swear to you that I was reading the Buddha himself. But most of all, what I loved here is the good humor: not just takes on life, a la Enzo, but hilarious commentary on our man-made world and the lunacy of being human vs. canine.<br /><br />So what exactly is THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN? An entertaining story, a self-help read, and a spiritual text like no other rolled into one.
B001TKD4ZI|2.0|Sorry, I find this book too much like all the other books I have read about vampires. I need to take a vacation from vampire books. Who knows if I can find my way back to them in the future.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|This is a fun and fast paced game.  When Granny uses her cane she can fly threw several obstacles & proceed to the next level.  This game has many levels.  My 7yr. old loves this game!
B00C6PWC4Y|5.0|Looked great.  Perfect for the project I was working on (repainted and added a costume to give as a gift).
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I like this one a lot especially that I have a youtube list with a lot of epic music on it.This cd is almost completely on that list in general! I listen to my epic music a lot.
B00280LYIC|3.0|I tend to love stories that deal with Greek mythology. I think it is fun to see what different authors can do with it. I would say that this is a good youth introduction for kids to learn about Greek mythology. The author keeps fairly true to the traditions but makes it interesting for kids.<br /><br />Saying that, I wouldn't consider it a masterpiece but it is a fun read. It is easy to read and follow. I like the characters and I am going to read the sequels. I would compare this to a sitcom. There is a plot. It it is simple and can be read easily, but I wouldn't consider it to be worth reading to lead again. Just enough to find out what happens to the characters. I wish I had checked it out from library rather than buying it. But not bad enough to regret buying it for my kindle.<br /><br />In summary if you are looking for a fun easy read then this is a good book for you.
B009XY97VC|4.0|I like this one I dont know if I like more than Invincible but it still has a lot of great music on it! Two steps form hell has great music!
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Malala, in facing the injustice of the Taliban, shows conviction and courage not often found among men or women, whatever their faith. She also describes Pakistani culture and values for those of us who are ignorant of that world. Contrary to the claims of her detractors, she is a credit to her people, the Pashtuns.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love this game very much can,t Stop playing it. It,s th a f much fun
006202406X|5.0|I have to say I loved this book. I think it made the entire series. It doesn't have your typical fairy tale ending but after I got past the initial anger. I really fell in love with the story and with Tris' character. I think Roth's talent as an author really shows especially after chapter 50. It's intense and emotional and beautifully written.  I think the ending was perfect...... Tragic but perfect. Be Brave!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|The book is a billion times better than the movie.<br />  Think back to the first time you watched the movie and think about how blown away your mind was when all the twists and turns happened. Read the book (even after watching the movie) and your mind will be equally blown again.<br />  The book was writen great and for the most part the movie followed the book so you'll see a lot of the same lines and see (in your minds eye) the same scenes, but there's so much more.<br />  Chuck Palahniuk was able to put in the perfect amount of detail to give you a cristal clear image in your mind while still letting you creat some of your own personal stuff in there.<br />  If you think you're ready to re-enter the Fight Club pick up this book and you won't be sorry that you did.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a wonderful Christmas movie for all the family.  It has a good moral to the story that children can understand.  A classic!
B00514HDNW|4.0|Even though I really liked the movie I thought that I would download the book and see where it all came from.<br />  This book offers so many things for readers. A great battle with a crazy type of vampire, getting back on your feet, stopping bad habits, and an amazing story.<br />  I really liked watching the main charactor grow from a depressed smoker and boozer to a great person and working on doing what he can for the good of everything.<br />  If you liked the movie but you felt like you wanted more from it read the book. It'll give you that little extra feeling.
0744014956|5.0|Very helpful. If you want to get the most out of gta, read this and enjoy the game. I know I did
B005LAJ212|3.0|I really enjoyed the beginning of this series.  Set in a glamorous location, full of impossibly good-looking people having parties; it held my attention.  However, about halfway through, after several twists and turns, I found that I was losing the plot and starting to wonder who was who and what was what.  Towards the end, I got so fed up with the convoluted plotline, and the switching backwards and forwards in time, that I just turned it off.  No second season for me!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Fast paced, great acting and great chemistry between stars. Subtle romantic scenes are excellent and well placed. Love the show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm not even a game player, but my daughter showed me this game, and now I can't stop playing!  I have it on my iPhone and my Kindle.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Have you ever seen a broken man? He's alone, he does what he needs to do to get through the day and that's basically his entire existence.  Well this is how that man is created.<br /><br />People were clearly reading this last book and expecting Tris and Four to over come everything and live happily ever after. To be honest,  I like this ending more.  It's real. In real life, most people don't defeat everyone and come out with everything they hold dear.<br /><br />In real life, people have to sacrifice for the greater good, for the ones they love and even for themselves.<br /><br />This a beautiful ending to an amazing series.  It's heart breaking and thought provoking and unfair and probably the best last book of a series that I have read in a long time.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Overall it's a fun game, good for when you need a good distraction from everyday life. It might focus on social media and similar entities a bit too much though.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Gets very challenging. Usually games like this, you fly through it. But this one gets difficult :) i love a great challenge game! And its fun too!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I don't get it. I just don't get what happened. It seemed like the plot never even really had a long range purpose until about 3/4 of the way through it. Everything seemed to be resolved quickly...so it was just a story moving along...not drawing you in<br /><br />The dual POVs just disorientated me...I constantly had to skim back to see who I was reading...neither had a distinct voice. So I think this lead to the beginning being extremely choppy.<br /><br />I don't really care how Roth ended the book...it is what it is. I just felt the overall book lost the magic that sucked me into the world of Divergent.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I should have let the series go after the second book...my insides told me this was true.  And these thoughts kept after me the entire 17 (almost 18) months while waiting for the third installment.  But I'm OCD and I can't let a series go unfinished.<br /><br />Roth showed such promise.  The storyline was fresh, the characters believable (for the most part) and the writing was above par for the genre. So why, or why, did she choose to go Rick Riordan on us? And, meaning no insult to Mr. Riordan, not in a good way, by telling the story from different points of view with no change in emotions, perception or anything else?<br /><br />What she did give us, in spades, was an (unnecessary) emotional dissertation on the perceived evils of genetic engineering.  What a cop out.<br /><br />I won't even speak to the ending and those that put in information that will spoil it for others should remove it.
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|I wish the developer good luck but this appears to be an attempt only. And I need the finished product.

B00G32OMF8|1.0|I was a big fan of the 2 Before movies so was really excited to see this one.  I am really grateful that I missed it in the theaters.  Whew, was this boring.  Watching a couple fight for over an hour.  And, the stereotypes of the hysterical, emotional, neglected woman and the man who puts up with it all and loves her anyway.  There was nothing clever or original about the dialogue, so much of the movie takes place in mundane hotel room.  There was no gorgeous visuals to help with the flat storyline.  I was ready to turn it off before the end, it was so excruciatingly boring.  As another reviewer said, it was kind of depressing, if one takes it seriously anyway...  Oh well, the other two movies were so good.
006202406X|5.0|Allegiant is a riveting end to to an incredible trilogy, but what makes it such a good book is that it<br />is a remarkable reflection on human life and death.<br /><br />I am disappointed to see that many reviewers here have given this book a low rating.  Was it the<br />ending we all wanted?  No, but as another reviewer has stated, Roth is indeed dauntless.  She has crafted a book that is emotionally gripping and<br />causes readers to appreciate life and better understand the incredible pain of losing a loved one.  I think Roth's younger<br />readers will better understand her lessons as they grow older.<br /><br />I especially appreciated Roth's message that good people come together to support others during a time of loss.  We all need to hear this.<br /><br />WK
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So happy it's at the Amazon store. Beautifully done in HD. Super addictive and so much better than playing on my tiny phone screen.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Excellent train of self discovery in the rugged trail of Pacific Crest Trail.  It's a 5 for me.  Could not put it down!  Find your courage and hike forward.  Or hike forward and find your courage along the way.  Either way, live your moment.

B0082SU98U|5.0|Are you a fan of the Disney movie with Jane Wyman and Haley Mills?  If so, you should definitely read this.  And if you've never seen the movie (I suppose it's possible...), you should read or listen to the novel, and then watch it.<br /><br />&#34;Polyanna&#34; is a very charming, very old-fashioned novel.  It reminds me of &#34;Anne of Green Gables,&#34; and was written right around the same time, first published in 1913.  I loved it.<br /><br />This Kindle edition has a feature that I appreciate: a companion Audible book, from audible.com, with &#34;Whispersync for Voice&#34; capability, so you can switch between reading and listening without losing your place.  The audio book version, read by Rebecca Burns, is excellent.<br /><br />I highly recommend this edition.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I read a lot of series and I'm always sacred of how the last book will go. Veronica Roth did not disappoint. Each character plays out in the way they should, as the people we have come to know them as throughout this journey. I am sad it is over, but I am so happy I took the ride.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm really shocked this book is getting torn apart on ratings and reviews. It was good. I'm between 3.5 and 4 stars and that has nothing to do with the fact that I would have preferred a different ending to this series. I loved the dual p.o.v.s! This read smoothly and had a lot of good points to the story. The reason this isn't a 5 star read for me is only bc I feel like this book could of been condensed into the other 2 books... It sorta felt like a long book for not a ton of information or addition to the story. Some may argue that this book revealed lots of new things but to me if felt anticlimactic and could have been shortened to fit in with the last book. Either way I LOVED this series and think its unfortunate this author is getting bashed for not tying the ending up in a pretty bow. I would have chosen a different outcome BUT I finished this book feeling peace with the characters and the story. What more can you ask for?<br /><br />FYI can't wait for these movies!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie. The cast acting was flawless, no wonder Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar!<br />And it's a great story, too. The books are great but based on this movie I can say that the movies are going to be awesome, too. A must see!

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was great to get caught up with Danny Torrence again.  What ever happened to him and his gift was always in any reader of Stephen King.  As for most, I am not a fan of the Stanley Kubrick movie.  I on the other hand loved the novel.  Great job Mr. King.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was quite a good book right up until the ending.  To me the ending seemed lazy, like the author had some pressing engagement and had to tie it up because she had run out of time.  To write such a fine book and then give it such an brief, unbelievable and poorly written ending is a crime all its own.
B00DEFW8YY|5.0|The balance favours the piano slightly, but that does not distract the enjoyment of very impressive orchestral and solo playing. They do not pale even compared with classic versions by Curzon in no.1 and Richter in no.2. I would say these are the modern standard before us.

B0000793ZB|5.0|When I first received this (as a Christmas gift) back in 1985, I was thrilled because back then the only way to get the two or so songs you heard on MTV was to buy the record! Fortunately, this is a great album from start to finish. Not one song was a disappointment. I didn't need to make a mix tape for this one! I listened to the cassette constantly, and to this day love this album.
B004LOUD80|3.0|Blu-ray transfer detail level is limited by the movie having been shot using Super 16mm film. 35mm theatrical prints are \\"blow-ups\\" (enlargements) of the original 16mm negative. The level of detail (lack thereof) and film grain would have been obvious when 35mm prints prints enlarged from the 16mm original negative were projected in theaters. The coarseness and grain is very evident in the Blu-ray transfer which is quite good. It's not a result of the transfer process, it's the original film and its limitations. Likewise, audio quality is very limited by the original monaural audio fidelity (lack thereof). While the fidelity isn't there (frequency and dynamic ranges), pops, hiss, etc. have been cleaned up. Given the movie being created on Super 16mm with mediocre fidelity monaural audio, and that it has survived oblivion by becoming a \\"cult\\" film, it's easy to understand why it wasn't transferred to Blu-ray until now.<br /><br />Regarding the film's subject matter and content, the first thing one notices (now) are the early 1970's clothing styles, mens hair length, slang terms, and the music. This is most definitely an utterly unabashed \\"exploitation\\" horror movie. It comes complete with a generous helping of cliches and the obvious plot setups. In short, one can see the evil coming. It's not a matter whether or not something horrid will occur, it's a matter of what it will be and how depraved. The actors are quite mediocre, with some outright laughable (the sheriff and his deputy in particular). This was Wes Craven's *first* feature length film, and it was done using Super 16mm format with a total budget under $90,000 which is quite small (hence the smaller and much cheaper film size). This shows in every aspect throughout the entire film. Classic Craven in storyline, but plenty rough around the edges compared to later works like \\"Nightmare on Elm Street,\\" or \\"Scream.\\"<br /><br />Giving it 3 stars. The basic plot is quite good. The execution of making the story into a film is clearly not among his best work, or even his better work.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a very useful app that I could not believe was free. You never know what junk is left behind in your tablet that would degrade its performance.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The is a great mind challenging game and has a very easy  playing style and I would definitely recommend it to another person
B00D2K40WY|5.0|i love how this game is fun and kinda realistic. it makes you combine fashions and have fun with it
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Very interesting game, but without real money it is Very slowly. Long waiting for playing the next game. It is ok.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|Finished pretty quickly, the colors were nice and it makes a fair game adding goals to the match 3 type of game keeping you motivated to finish.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|This game has nice features, especially for a beginner. If you touch a number that is already in the puzzle, eg '2', then all the 2's that are already placed in the puzzle are highlighted. You can enter multiple possible numbers in draft mode. I have mainly played 'easy', so I know there are plenty of harder puzzles to graduate to, if I get any better at it :o).
B008EL25LE|3.0|Some of the picture matching intervals were easy to match some were so blurry or dark they didn't seem to match any piece of the picture. Also the crawling bugs seem random without any rhyme or reason to how many matches it takes or how to remove them when various powerups like the wind blowing blocks your vision from making matches to tick down the numbers on the bugs.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was fantastic! I couldn't wait to read the next 2, which I made short work of...I would definitely recommend it!
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|It doesn't fit the Kindle screen size or format too well. Hard to play moving the screen to the left or right to see the objects.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This is one go the most poorly written Grisham books I've ever read. The writing was dreadful, the plot patently not believable at most stages, and generally just a waste of time for a read. Did someone ghost write this for him or was he pissed off at the publisher and just fulfilling a contract?
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I had hope for this book. \\"The Shining\\" was a classic. However, this weak follow up continues King's path toward absurdity and steep decline. I feel like this book, like most of them he has written in the last 10 years, you can actually almost see him at his desk in Maine with his rusting mental gears grinding and thinking \\"Hmmm...how can I write this where it will be turned into a movie?\\" Unfortunately, he seems more of a B movie screenwriter than the once inspired horror author he once was. I'm not sure why I gave this two stars, but I will put it down as nostalgia.<br /><br />**MINOR SPOILER ALERT**--Seriously, there is a \\"struggle for the gun scene\\" between two characters using mind control. How boring and worn out is that premise? It's, in my humble opinion, the most dreadfully re-tread path in any movie or book and it's as stale as it gets.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|I have always liked Paul Anka since the days of American Bandstand with Dick Clark. I like the fact that he still has that wonderful voice quality and with this CD he sings with different singers and he has a little of Frank Sinatra I like  the songs he selected.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its so funnnnn!!! fun for all but some gamers my not like it but I play it alot 500 out of 10 point is its fun
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is amazing it will have you laughing, smiling, and crying to the end. The characters will leave memorable impressions on your heart. Beautifully written.
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|As someone not much younger than Ms. Summer's and who has been a fan from the beginning I was fully prepared not to like this CD but I think it's fantastic!  You can dance to it but it's very much just an updated and fresher version of the original songs.  Great tribute to Donna!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I love this cd. Just like I love the movies when I hear the music all the scene pop in my mind
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|All this product is, is a beta, and we the consumers are testing it.  More and more companies are doing this.  Instead of releasing something that's ready to go, they are releasing a test product, to judge demand and to work out the bugs.  They also want complete control.  Yes, there is much potential for the chromecast, but it's far from ready and very limited.  I'm not sure what Google is so afraid of.  Just open this thing up to developers and let them put their apps on it.  Instead, we have yet another product that has great potential, and that's about it.  It's fun to dream about what the chromecast might be able to do in the future, but I'm tired of that.  Apple TV is the same way.  Huge potential, but Apple wants complete control and has been dangle a carrot in front of us for years.  Maybe some day, someone will release a product that works great out of the box with no limitations.  There I go dreaming again.

0385350864|5.0|We were first introduced to Bridget Jones' Diary in 1997. Readers kept it on the New York Times bestseller list for over six months. We were utterly addicted to this new confessional literary genre author Helen Fielding had created--the unguarded, neurotic ramblings of a London singleton in search of love--and her obsession with Jane Austen's romantic hero Mr. Darcy from Pride & Prejudice, (admittedly Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in the 1995 BBC/A&E mini-series). We devoured the sequel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason in 1999, and the subsequent movies with an all-star cast of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, Hugh Grant, and, yes, Colin Firth as dishy, love-interest Mark Darcy. Now 14 years later, Fielding has resurrected her most popular character ...<br /><br />STOP. If you haven't heard about the big, gigantic, SPOILER in her new novel, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy--DO NOT PROCEED. This is your chance to bail now. Save yourself the trouble and time of ranting at me in some long-winded diatribe. You have been given due notice. But, please do come back here and let's compare notes, once you have read the book, of course.<br /><br />However, if you have heard the big news about this third book in the series, then carry on. My little review won't ruin anything for you that has not already been broadcast worldwide. Also, a slight warning as to the sailor-like language sprinkled throughout that we have come to expect from Bridget and friends. (My apologies to sailors everywhere who do not swear or speak in a vulgar manner. Terrible, terrible stereotype. I know.) Though jarring, cringe-worthy really, if any of my American friends were to spew such vulgarity, coming from Bridget, any Brit really, this American reviewer tends to give a pass. Maybe it's the charming British accent? Or the Renee Zellweger narrative I hear in my head?<br /><br />Channeling my inner-Bridget's up to the minute, daily diary-style format, the following is an account of my ponderings on Fielding's latest offering:<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT...SPOILER ALERT...SPOILER ALERT...SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Monday 30 September 2013<br /><br />Number of times I said \\"WHAT?\\" when The Today Show announced author Helen Fielding killed off Mark Darcy 20, number of negative thoughts 1000, number of Facebook posts and threads I mentioned this spoiler 9, hours it took me to overcome my shock of Mark's death 26, days I had to wait after this bombshell until my advanced copy was released from the publisher 10, days I had to wait until my copy was forwarded on from Austenprose blogmistress 2, hours I had to wait to get a moment to myself from delivery of said book until I could crack it open 10, number of days it took me to actually finish because of the rude intrusions of real life 3.<br /><br />7:17 a.m. Breaking news on The Today Show. \\"Hearts are breaking wide open around the world. Bridget Jones is back. Minus Mr. Darcy.\\" What? What?! No Mark Darcy! My dear husband tried to offer his condolences by pointing out the British are not afraid of killing off their favorites in their television programs, reminding me of the recent Downton Abbey debacle of doing in yummy male lead, and all-around good-guy, Matthew Crawley, and even many of my favorites from MI-5, aka in Great Britain as Spooks. (Not helpful.) Still, how can this be? Is this a prank? Pfffffft. What's the point? Who wants to read about Bridget Jones if there's no Mark Darcy?<br /><br />7:27 a.m. Facebook, twitter, and blogs are all abuzz with devastating news. I knew the book had been embargoed to all advanced copies for reviews. Was this the reason? Maybe so, and yet, somehow a copy must have slipped out, and the publisher must have said, \\"Go ahead, leak the bloody spoiler,\\" says my wildly, active imagination. Amidst the U.S. economy being held hostage by its own government, earthquakes, typhoons, Iran's nuclear program talks, Mark Darcy's death has pushed aside Miley Cyrus's \\"strategic hot mess.\\" Or, was so-called leak possibly part of cleverly choreographed marketing scheme? Hmmm...? On to reading the book...<br /><br />Friday 11 October 2013<br /><br />Number of times nits are mentioned 43 (plus or minus), number of times I scratched my own head after reading about nits 43 (plus or minus), number of times I scratched my head at the mention of some clearly British word or product like: spag bog and Fairy Liquid 2, number of barn owl sightings 2, number of times I cried at the end of barn owl scenes 2, number of times I wept over Bridget's memories of Mark 3, number of times I laughed out loud 78, number of pages I giggled at the repeated mention of the f-word (and I mean fart) 3 ½, number of pages until the use of the other f-word is used (and I mean \\"f-wit\\") 12, number of times used thereafter 278 (plus or minus), number of Jane Austen references 2 (maybe 3), number of days since I finished reading it (yet am still mulling over the details) 5.<br /><br />When last we read about Bridget Jones it was the year 2000, and at the close of The Edge of Reason Mark Darcy was arranging his case load in America and, or Thailand, with Bridget in tow. Over a decade later, the world has changed. Major life changes. 9-11. Technology. The Internet. Bridget and Mark now have two children.<br /><br />Mad About the Boy opens with Bridget in a quandary about her friend's 60th birthday party. Should she, or should she not, invite her boytoy Roxster, who happens to be celebrating his 30th birthday on the same night? Then it proceeds right into a calamitous episode of nits (head lice), vomit and diarrhea. She must handle it all alone, if we are to believe the spoilers, without Mark. For the next 20-odd pages all the usual Bridget chatter about her boytoy, and bumbling about as a single mother, without one mention of Mark. I quite think if I had not heard Fielding had killed off Mark prior to this reading, I would have been Googling to see if I had missed a Book 3 and was in fact reading Book 4. And then on page 26, there it was:<br /><br />Mark Darcy 1956-2008<br /><br />Told from Bridget's perspective, with long chunks of her irreverent monologue, her often minute by minute running commentary, her texting conversations, and now with Twitter, her attempt to get current, she tweets:<br /><br />Thursday 12 July 2012, 155 lbs, pounds lost 20, pages of screenplay written 10, Twitter followers 0. &lt;@DalaiLama Just as a snake sheds its skin, so we must shed our past again and again.><br />\\"You see? The Dalai Lama and I are one cyber-mind. I am shedding my fat like a snake.\\" (p. 55)<br /><br />So this is Bridget a decade and a half later. Widowed, 51-year-old, cheeky single mother of two small children, attempting to write a screenplay and still struggling with how she fits into the world--a tech savvy world. Forlorn, without her rock Mark Darcy. She is still friends with the bawdy cast we love and adore: Talitha, Jude, Tom and Magda, and as they are all now deeply entrenched in that other vulgar phrase \\"middle age,\\" are determined to get rid of Bridget's lonely, \\"Born-Again Virgin\\" status.<br /><br />\\"I've had enough of this! What do you mean `middle-aged'? In Jane Austen's day we'd all be dead by now.  We're going to live to be a hundred. It's not the middle of our lives. Oh. Yes. Well, actually it is the middle.\\" (p. 67)<br />Yet, she is determined to find her new normal. Mark wouldn't want her to be alone and miserable.<br /><br />And just like that, she decides to get back out there. After all, it has been four and a half  years since she has even kissed a man. But, like most times when you are trying something new, or rather something you have done before but not in a very, long time, and trying to be 30, when you are in fact 51, events do not always turn out as you hoped:<br /><br />\\"We all became crestfallen, our confidence collapsing like a house of cards. `Oh God. Do we just look like an ensemble of elderly transvestites?' said Tom.<br />`It's happened, justas I always feared,' I said. `We've ended up as tragic old fools convincing ourselves the vicar is in love with us because he's mentioned his organ.' (p. 80)<br /><br />However, Bridget does find love and affection via Twitter. This story-line is chock full of tender, LOL, randy moments, and amusing texting dialogue as she enjoys re-discovering her sensuality with her 30 year old boytoy, who really does fancy her. But Bridget is still Bridget--sure  to cock something up as she fumbles about and never showing herself to her best, especially in front of smug marrieds, potential career makers and her son's chess/music/sports department teacher Mr. Wallaker. Bridget describes him as \\"fit, tall, slightly younger than me, crop-haired, rather like Daniel Craig in appearance.\\" (p. 5). Surely this must be Fielding's nod to who should play the new teacher in the future movie? Yes, puleez.<br /><br />At the moment when you think you can't take one more self-destructive, idiotic, nitwit antic, Bridget takes a breath, adjusts her priorities and performs a few self-less acts--that end up turning things around. I think that's what Bridget would call Karma. And what would a series be (that began with what Fielding confesses was stolen from the plot of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice), without a romantic, happily ever after? Bridget-style, of course.<br /><br />\\"He took a step closer. The air was heavy with jasmine, roses. I breathed unsteadily. It felt as though we were being drawn together by the moon. He reached out, like I was a child, or a Bambi or something, and touched my hair. `There aren't any nits in here, are there?' he said.\\" (p. 321-322)<br />And that's not even with the loveable Daniel Cleaver, who, yes, is in this book as... wait for it... the children's godfather!<br /><br />So, let me be the one to say, although I loved Bridget with Mark Darcy, (her grounded, stabilizing life-force, her Yin to his Yang), I do accept that horrible, tragic things do happen in real life. Fielding took a brave leap (others might say foolish) in killing this beloved character off. Believe me. Those first 26 hours after I learned of his death I was as dazed as Jones in a vodka induced stupor. Fielding could have played it safe. But where would she have gone with that? Every day real life women get up, face the day, and soldier on. If our Bridget can do it... you can too. Stay calm and carry on without Mark Darcy. Mad About the Boy is a delicious, boisterous, raucous triumph championing a re-awakening of life. Read the book. As in real life, you'd hate to miss out. &lt;@Dalai Lama An open heart is an open mind.><br /><br />5 out of 5 Stars<br /><br />P.S. I was going to knock off ½ a star for killing Mark, but then reminded self it would have been a predictable, pointless, f-wit move.ge 26, there it was:<br /><br />Mark Darcy 1956-2008<br /><br />Told from Bridget's perspective, with long chunks of her irreverent monologue, her often minute by minute running commentary, her texting conversations, and now with Twitter, her attempt to get current, she tweets:<br /><br />Thursday 12 July 2012, 155 lbs, pounds lost 20, pages of screenplay written 10, Twitter followers 0. <@DalaiLama Just as a snake sheds its skin, so we must shed our past again and again.><br />\\"You see?

B004DTLKEE|5.0|The hero of this movie was a women who inside felt and acted as a young man. And although she was a women she had more of an idea about what it really means to be a man than most men who were born with one hanging and two swinging if you know what I mean. Being a man has a lot more to do with than having been courageous once. Anyone can be courageous once but can you do it everyday? Can you do it without getting a slap on  the back or recognition for having done it day in day out? Being a man is a very amorphous idea and can and often does mean different things to men and even women of different walks of life and status. What does being a man mean to you?

He lists every person he ever hung out with, particularly when they've developed some terrible disease. But other than comment on their illness or appearance there is no other description of them or reason to include them in the novel.<br /><br />He outs not only his own affairs but also those of the people working to protect him. I hope they had a heads up that this was coming.<br /><br />He obviously kept a meticulous journal but just because you know what happened on x day 20 years ago does not mean we want to.<br /><br />He certainly was at the center of terrible controversy and I wouldn't wish the fatwa on anyone, but that does not excuse the self- aggrandizing in this book.<br /><br />Did he not have an editor??<br /><br />I could go on and on. But I will stop, unlike Rushdie
B0060MYM3S|5.0|An Absolutely Outstanding video series.  Excellent character development and a lot of characters, plus superior special effects.  At the end of each episode I wanted to see more.  I don't usually bother with the \\"extra features\\" on video discs, but they are almost required watching because of all the characters and sub-plots.  I look forward to season #.

It keeps on disconnecting if I don't use it for a couple of days and then I have a little trouble getting it reconnected.  It works really well otherwise.  There is no way of shutting it off other then disconnecting it from the tv, which I have done and then when I reconnect it I have to go through the setup procedure again.  Maybe it's the chromebook that is the problem but no matter either way its a bit of a hassle.  But all in all I still think it's worth the money.

006202406X|1.0|I have seen other reviews praising this for writing style and effort, while pointing out the ending is not very satisfying.  I devoured this book after having read the first two, Amazon (Audible) delivered my copies last night digitally and I was all over it today.  This is one of those titles that I find very disappointing, not because the ending is not very good but because it doesn't cohesively work or build on the first two books.<br /><br />The beginning of this book changes location, place and mentality from the book that proceeds it causing an immediate disconnect with the reader as how we presume events will happen.  The book completely puts a dead stop on events from the prior books and assumes new facts that we didn't know from them and our characters act on these unknown assumptions.<br /><br />This creates a disorienting and muddy narrative that never really hits home.  It appears obvious that Roth didn't have a realized conclusion for this series and played it by ear which just doesn't work.<br /><br />I had hopes this book would surprise me, go in unique directions and hit a lot of the issues of morality and choices brought up in previous books and... it does almost none of that.  This is an embarrassingly bad read that a lot of people will feel obligated to buy in order to realize the conclusion of the first two books.  Too bad.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|It hurts to read a book that is written with such ignorant and blatant propaganda. The tongue-in-cheek attitude of this author is dishearteningly inappropriate when used in reference to terrorism and People of The Yemen. The narrative is over simplified. The author assumes that we are all idiots who will easily believe that all people of Arab descent are the same, violent, disorganized and easily led, and that all Americans are heroes, working to rid the world of the &#34;Bad Arab Man&#34;.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have never anticipated a book being released as much as this one.  I loved the first two books and recommended them to everyone.  I will never do that again.  I loved Four and Tris together, and wanted a happy ending for them.  I feel upset the author would end the series like this.  Four and Tris being together were what made these books so moving and addictive.  Now I wish I never would have read this series, especially Allegiant.  I will never watch this movie, read any more books by this author, and will tell everyone not to waaste their time reading this series.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Ordinary people whose lives intersect in extraordinary ways.  Each of the three main characters have very different lives and dilemmas to face.  Their stories build and intertwine until it becomes impossible to put the book down.  The author has great insight into people and their motivations.  She is unflinching honest!
0141394811|5.0|One of my favourite quotes is from Zach De La Rocha, singer with Rage Against The Machine. The quote goes like this: &#34;Your anger is a gift&#34;. Bearing this in mind is important while reading &#34;Autobiography&#34;.<br /><br />While some who have read this autobiography - written by one of the most important persons not only in culture but in public existence and now - seem stuck on the idea that Morrissey is nasty and a vile, damp cloth for not whitewashing things, I think he is writing what he feels, even though I'm sure that certain things in this book are debatable and arguable.<br /><br />However, a nascent non-philistine will know the contents of this book for what they are: a receptacle that will live on and that has, to the best of my knowledge, yet to find its real match.<br /><br />During my reading, I often found myself invigorated, filled with an urgency of life; paraphrasing and punning not the point; you will find much of that in the book, for instance, where Morrissey semi-starts, by writing of his teachers:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>Miss Redmond is aging, and will never marry, and will die smelling of attics.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />I won't defend Morrissey any more - which is futile, as his work speaks for itself and really needs no defense - but say this: the past is the past, and I have often read Morrissey's referrals to this book in the past, where he's been quoted by laying out the truth in his autobiography. If his troubled pre-teens were terrible, why not write about it in more than song?<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>I was small and I couldn’t swim, and the panicked roll to the corn-plastered depths terrified me for years after. This ringing hum of panic returned at Leaf Street Baths on our induction day, and I refused to jump into the pool. Ever-present Miss Dudley made no effort to understand the secret agony of a troubled child, and I was lifted up and thrown into the water in an act that, these days, would count as extreme physical and psychological assault.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />It is not without merit that the reader may question Morrissey's sincerity, given his glamor for strong adjectives used in the prop way of a Carry On film; that's his style, not an Attenborough documentary.<br /><br />Reading Morrissey's words on music at the start of his life is just heartbreaking, and something that all can relate to:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>It is only the singing voice, I decide, that tells us how things became how they are, and You’ve lost that lovin’ feelin’ by the Righteous Brothers had led me to the light. In this duet between Bill and Bobby, the language of despair becomes beautiful, and the final forty-five seconds hit such call-and-respond excitement that I am now in danger of feeling too much. Bobby’s rooftop falsetto is the fire in the belly, whilst Bill’s deep-chested leveling is the full invasion. Suddenly everything else in life is in question.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />&lt;blockquote>There are visions of divine things: Tommy K&ouml;rberg sings Judy, my friend, Matt Monro sings We’re gonna change the world and Shirley Bassey sings Let me sing and I’m happy.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />His sketches on what is &#34;male&#34;:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>The masculine man hates the feminine man because soft is the enemy of hard.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />&lt;blockquote>My notepad resting on my lap takes the scribbles of unspoken truth: effeminate men are very witty, whereas macho men are duller than death.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />&lt;blockquote>The womanly David Bowie is attacked by the Daily Mirror as being ‘a disgrace’ – although how he is a disgrace, or why, is not explained.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />And, of not being &#34;male&#34;:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>Female nudity is generally easy to find – if not actually unavoidable – but male nudity is still a glimpse of something that one is not meant to see. In mid-70s Manchester there must be obsessive love of vagina, otherwise your life dooms itself forever.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />All the while, school exists:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>St Mary’s Secondary Modern School on Renton Road in Stretford may indeed be secondary, but it is not modern.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />&lt;blockquote>Sealed up like an envelope, he is unable to act with kindness or humanity, for he has neither, and there is evidently nothing to humanize him. For five years I witness the monumental loneliness of Vincent Morgan as he busies himself day after day with the beatings of small boys.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />Good. Wash out the old. Bring crimes to the surface. However, unlike Questlove and other autobiographers, Morrissey doesn't invite anybody else to the party; why should he?, he thinks. Well. It's Morrissey. It's his trip.<br /><br />Still, there are plenty of self-critical points throughout the book, not least on a fashion tip:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>T. Rex are my first concert and my dad and sister drop me off at daunting Belle Vue on June 16th 1972, watching me waddle away alone in my purple satin jacket – a sight ripe for psychiatric scrutiny.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />And early bits, before personally getting to know the surviving members, decades from now, on the New York Dolls:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>An even darker force controlled the personalities of the New York Dolls, who are younger than Bowie and who are more-or-less transgender in appearance. Melody Maker announces them as ‘the world’s first homosexual rock band’, which, of course, is what they are not. On face value, the Dolls are menacing rent boys who are forcing the world to deal with them. Their arms drape lovingly around one another in photographs at a time when young men are assumed to want to look like Bobby Moore, Jimmy Greaves or Terry Venables.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />Morrissey writes - unsurprisingly - about liking Betjeman (the poet), but his words on Housman (another poet) made me cry. Here are some of them, but not all, and I believe they are key in providing valuable insight into Morrissey's writing:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>New air is discovered in the words of A. E. Housman (1859–1936), scholar-poet, vulnerable and complex. On the day of his twelfth birthday his mother dropped dead, sealing a private future of suffering for Housman, who was said to be a complete mystery even to those who knew him. With no interest in applause or public recognition, Housman published three volumes of poetry, each one of great successful caress, each a world in itself, forcing Housman into the highest literary ranks. A stern custodian of art and life, he shunned the world and he lived a solitary existence of monastic pain, unconnected to others. The unresolved heart worked against him in life, but it connected him to the world of poetry, where he allowed (in)complete strangers under his skin.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />&lt;blockquote>The published poetry makes the personal torture just barely acceptable. The pain done to Housman allowed him to rise above the mediocre and to find the words that most of us need help in order to say.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />&lt;blockquote>It’s easy for me to imagine Housman sitting in a favorite chair by a barely flickering gas fire, the brain grinding long and hard, wanting to explain things in his own way, monumental loneliness on top of him, but with no one to tell. The written word is an attempt at completeness when there is no one impatiently awaiting you in a dimly lit bedroom – awaiting your tales of the day, as the healing hands of someone who knew turn to you and touch you, and you lose yourself so completely in another that you are momentarily delivered from yourself. Whispering across the pillow comes a kind voice that might tell you how to get out of certain difficulties, from someone who might mercifully detach you from your complications. When there is no matching of lives, and we live on a strict dietof the self, the most intimate bond can be with the words that we write:<br /><br />Oh often have I washed and dressed<br />And what’s to show for all my pain?<br />Let me lie abed and rest:<br />Ten thousand times<br />I’ve done my best<br />And all’s to do again.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />&lt;blockquote>I ask myself if there is an irresponsible aspect in relaying thoughts of pain as inspiration, and I wonder whether Housman actually infected the sensitives further, and pulled them back into additional darkness. Surely it is true that everything in the imagination seems worse than it actually is – especially when one is alone and horizontal (in bed, as in the coffin). Housman was always alone – thinking himself to death, with no matronly wife to signal to the watching world that Alfred Edward was now quite alright – for isn’t this at least partly the aim of scoring a partner: to trumpet the mental all-clear to a world where how things seem is far more important than how things are? Now snugly in eternity, Housman still occupies my mind. His best moments were in Art, and not in the cut and thrust of human relationships. Yet he said more about human relationships than those who managed to feast on them. You see, you can’t have it both ways.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />And, naturally, words on Oscar Wilde:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>As the world’s first populist figure (first pop figure), Oscar Wilde exploded with original wisdom, advocating freedom for heart and soul, and for all – regardless of how the soul swirled. He laughed at the squeezers and the benders and those born only to tell others what to do. Tellingly, a disfigured barrister and a half-wit in a wig destroyed Wilde in the end, and in doing so one lordly barrister and one lordly judge deprived the world of further works from Oscar Wilde. Solitary confinement was deemed judicially right for the man who had brought more positive change and excitement and fun to the London literary world than anyone else – dead or alive.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />On finding a friend in youth, among others:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>Anji’s nightly telephone calls to Kings Road are marathon, and even the most vague generalities of her day are spiced with such absurd account that the two hours kneeling in an unheated hall, ears numb and jaw aching, are always worth the labor.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />At times, not for long:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>‘Oh, I went to the doctor today,’ begins Anji. ‘Y-e-e-s?’ I say, impatient for Part Two. ‘He said I’ve got six weeks to live,’ she breezes, almost throwaway. I laugh because everything in Anji’s delivery is funny – and she knows it. ‘Yeah – leukemia ... hang on, there’s someone at the door ...’ Some weeks later Anji’s life has met its deadline, liberating laughter leading her every step to the grave, never losing her edge for an instant, bearing sadness with dignity, and always explaining herself so well, at peace with death as she was with life, the black earth of Haslingden entombing seventeen years of best endeavor and generosity. I see her now – peeling potatoes in the sun and laughing her head off.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />On being a fan:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>At last I am face to face with Marc Bolan – as his flutterers flutter about him in the lobby of the Midland Hotel in Manchester. I am nothing and look nothing. ‘Could I have your autograph?’, I ask softly. ‘Oooh, no,’ he says, and slowly walks away to nowhere –&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />Manchester, growing up, thinking, tormenting:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>I am suddenly full of sweeping ideas that even I can barely grasp, and, although penniless, I am choked by the belief that something must happen. It is not enough just to ‘be’. I am reliant upon the postage stamp, and tactlessly revealing letters are catapulted north and south – anywhere where a considerate soul might lurk. There is such a godsendas ‘penpals’ – friends known only via letters, and these are easier to construct than any living embodiment. The lineage from Dolls to Ramones seemed like a Himalayan missionary’s trek from which a thousand lessons could be applied. But I want no more. I want it to stop now. I cannot continue as a member of the audience. If only I could forget myself I might achieve. I am crumbling from the top downwards – in mad-eyed mode, finding daylight difficult. Unemployable, my life draws in tightly. At 17 I am worn out by my own emotions, and Manchester is a barbaric place where only headless savages can survive. There is no one to take me on, and no one to bother about me. Months go on for years. I explode from intensity. I cannot cope with anything other than my inability to cope. I want to sing. I am difficult and withdrawn – a head, really, but not a body – full of passion within, but none outwardly. There are no sexual guidelines and I see myself naked only by appointment. It is simply a funnel, and there is no one around who suggests otherwise, and my mental horizons are so narrow and no soul is interested in the me that is beneath the chastity belt.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />On Sparks, and upon meeting Russell Mael on one of Morrissey's US trips:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>I wander into CBGBs, where I find Russell Mael, and I blush my way through a request for a photograph, and there I stand – 17, clumsy and shy, with Russell, smiling beneath the CBGBs canopy. The first five Sparks albums had been constant companions. I had first heard This town ain’t big enough for both of us as Radio One’s Record of the Week, which they played daily at around 5:15. I had no idea who Sparks were, but I thought the singer – whoever she was – had the most arresting voice I’d ever heard. In time, of course, Sparks exploded, the color of madness. Ron Mael sat at the keyboard like an abandoned ventriloquist’s doll, and brother Russell sang in French italics with the mad urgency of someone tied to a tree. It was magnificent, and the ferocious body of sound was a speedboat in overdrive. The life and death question was: what is it? As children the Mael Brothers probably slept in bunk-coffins in an unused wing of the house, playing with surgical instruments whilst other kids of Los Angeles addressed the surf. The straitjacket sound of Sparks could never be fully explained, and even now their historic place is confusing since they belong apart. Lyrically, Ron Mael is as close to Chaucer as the pop world will ever get – elevated and poetic, nine parts demon, and I am very thankful: You mentioned Kant and I was shocked ... so shocked; You know, where I come from, none of the girls have such foul tongues. The lyrics of Ron Mael and the vocal sound of Russell Mael are solid and original factors, so unique that by the very laws of existence I can hardly believe they exist. The sound registered is very tough, although the faces are fixed in imperishable marble. What are Sparks? A miracle, of sorts, and the dead child is momentarily revived.<br /><br />&#34;You’ve been waiting for your first encounter – what a let-down.<br />I’m just finishing my first encounter – what a let-down.&#34;&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />Further awaiting life:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>Deserts of boredom dripped by, thinly disguised as years.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />Indeed, language becomes quarry where Moz is concerned:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>James was one of the first people I had ever met who spoke in complete sentences, minus the ‘kind of, sort of, like, y’know, actually’ redundancies that prop up most people’s tautological cobblers. Londoners especially over-used the word ‘actually’, and usually placed it where it meant nothing.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />On meeting Linder for the first time:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>During the soundcheck for the Sex Pistols’ third Manchester gig I begin a conversation with Linder Sterling,who is with the group Buzzcocks. Linder is nine parts sea-creature, and alights with all of the conversational atmospherics of someone steeped in machine-gun artistry.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />&lt;blockquote>‘Are you still ill?’ asks Linder, as we meet our weekly meet at Kendals rooftop restaurant, and while a song is born, so too is a lifelong friendship fortified and not weakened by time.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />And starting the love of a non-lifetime, The Smiths:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>History had trapped me for a long time, and now it must let me go. But my time with Billy is already over. He has been lassoed into joining the excellent Theatre of Hate who are ready for Top of the Pops, and rather than bury my face in the mud I am happy for him. And history takes the strangest of turns. I return to the have-nots, with more reason to cry than anyone else on earth, but Billy has left me with a parting suggestion. He tells me of a boy called Johnny Marr, who also lives in Wythenshawe and who ‘is a much better guitarist than me’. The suggestion is thoughtful, but I am not the type to tap on people’s windows. Luckily, Johnny Marr was the type to tap on people’s windows, and Billy had also turned Johnny to face my direction.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />On Thatcher:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>Dispassionate and obviously mad, Margaret Thatcher is presiding over political England, raging war on the needy and praising the highborn.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />More on the start of The Smiths:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>There are months to follow when Johnny and I – along with Angie (Johnny’s lifelong girlfriend) – concentrate deeply on the realization of the dream. For the first time in my life the future is more important than the past. Angie’s view in 1982 (and for the next five years, at least) held a bravely impartial and apolitical quality, and she would never be of the Girlfriend Syndrome who are famously destructive of the band that causes their love life momentary pause. Angie would always be intelligently supportive and ready to block gunfire; an honorable tack far superior to the commonplace and dreaded musician-girlfriend who would habitually cause infallible destruction and petty squabbles at Thatcherite levels. I suggest to Johnny that we call ourselves the Smiths, and he agrees. Neither of us can come up with anything else. It strikes me that the Smiths name lacks any settled association on face value, yet could also suit a presentation of virtually any style of music. It sounded like a timeless name, unlikely to date, and unlikely to glue itself to come-and-go movements: it could very well be Hancock Park of 1947, or Hulme of 1968; it could be primitive or developed – the Smithy poets of bygone Russia, or the servitude of the hard-working, and so on.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />On the Hate for Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>I foolishly looked to Geoff for an explanation when the single Panic stalled for two weeks at number 11, inching no higher even though it is generally accepted that here is the Smiths’ first unstoppable number 1. Johnny sends me a postcard yelling ‘PANIC: NUMBER ONE !!!!!!!!’, a common sentiment, yet once again, here we are, derailed by non-existent competition. Geoff leans forward and removes his glasses. ‘Do you know why Smiths singles don’t go any higher?’ I say nothing because the question is horribly rhetorical. ‘Because they’re not good enough.’ He puts his glasses back on and shrugs his shoulders. I glance around his office searching for an axe. Some murders are well worth their prison term.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />Re. Linder's pregnancy:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>Linder appears at Caroline Place to tell me that she is pregnant. As the full-stop locks the T in ‘pregnant’, the legs of my bent-wood chair give way and I splat onto the floor. We are both bagged. There can be no composure. Reason is lost for ten full minutes, as Linder and I are unable to look at each other, each fit dying down only to start up again with a further convulsion, and out peals laughter and tears combined. ‘Well,’ I begin, with postgraduate’s calm, and suddenly we are both deranged all over again, painful laughter now causing concern, leakage imminent, sealed-up frenzy running loose.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />When solo, hardships remain indefinitely:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote>‘You have made alternative music mainstream,’ says the President of Sire Records, ‘and you have done it without the help of MTV – which is incredible.’ Yes, I thought, and I’ve also done it without the help of Sire Records.&lt;/blockquote><br /><br />All in all, this autobiography is a triumph. It contains much, much more than the above, which is culled from the start of the book. I strongly recommend it to all. The only downside to the book is Morrissey's bitterness, which can also be a strength, but where it goes on for far too long, it stains; still, this is a truly epic book and should be digested by all, swallowed whole and infused forever.from Dolls to Ramones seemed like a Himalayan missionary’s trek from which a thousand lessons could be applied.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Slow  in  the beginning of the game.  All you need is a little bit of patience to start.  Graphics are great.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was an interesting story of a time in history that I did not know about.  The two interwoven stories work well together.  The flow of the story is good and I consider it a quick read.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant was not my favorite in the trilogy, but it wasn't terrible. I enjoyed reading the book. The ending was a shocker, but a happily ever after ending would have been out of place and too perfect. I'm definitely in a book hangover fog from this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got this game the first day it came out. This is the funniest game ever there are no glitches or lost progress especially if you have a Facebook page or you need to have Internet access. But other wise it's amazing and it's an  addiction. So please play it. But the best thing is that it is FREE.
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Bill Bryson is as usual, entertaining, witty informative and fun. I don't have much interest in much Americana of the 20's , but I must admit to being &#34;sucked ' in with his style and approach. He actually made me want to read more.  I still think that his best was &#34;Made in America&#34; but that's because i always find that type of subject matter and its treatment appealing. I do love a good debunk of &#34;known' history.<br />When is his next book due?
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Indulge your inner 12 year old and revel in the pure epic awesomeness of this unique vision.  Very much in keeping with the tradition of Japanese giant monster and giant robot movies / anime, this is an americanized version, and the first big-budget hollywood movie of this type, ever.  If you're sick of superheros with outlandish powers striking their hero poses then this movie is for you.  The amazing fight scenes are candy for your eyes,  the artistry of the creatures and robots, the detail, is just lush and clean and awe-inspiring.  It has shout-outs to other sci-fi movies in it, see if you can spot them!  And, equally improbable,  a japanese leading lady that kicks butt and isn't a prostitute or somebody's love interest.  Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnan are both perfectly cast,  well-acted and heroic leads.<br /><br />This is the once in a generation movie that all sci-fi fans have been waiting for.  Don't miss out on this!

B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I can get about 2 full charges on my HTC Evo 4g LTE, which has a 2000mAh battery.  I technically should get more like 3 based solely on the numbers, but I supposed nothing is 100% effecient.  This thing is about the exact same size as my phone so it is fairly easy to stack them while charging.  My only complaint is that the built in usb cable is very short so based on where my phone's usb port is I have to hold them at an angle to each other.  And the plug end is thick so it doesn't fit all that well if you have a protective case on your phone.  All in all the cons are easily outweighed by the pros.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Wow. Just finished the third book in the series. Great story and a fun ride. You won't  be disappointed and you won't be able to stop reading it. Makes me proud to say I read science fiction. Enjoy.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|1. It feels like the author wasn't sure how to end the series. The explanation for the factions and set-up of the society didn't make much sense to me and didn't flow well from the first two books. In addition, I highly doubt that no one snuck out and then snuck back in to the city within eight generations. People are too curious to just accept rules without testing them for themselves.<br /><br />2. I couldn't put the first two books down. This one, however, I had to force myself to finish. Divergent and Insurgent were filled with action and the plot moved. In Allegiant the plot kind of, sort of shuffled along once in a while. Frankly, I was rather bored. Very little action, lots of irrelevant scenes, and way too much character development. After two books, we know the characters pretty well and have seen them grow and progress and mature. But in this book, I think some characters, Tris and Tobias especially, actually regressed.<br /><br />3. Tris and Tobias did not seem to be themselves in this book. I know they had some trust issues to work out after Tris' actions in Insurgent, but at certain points they acted incredibly immature. The jealousy? After what those two have been through together, it just seemed ridiculous, despite their relative lack of experience with relationships beyond their own.<br /><br />4. I'm not happy with the ending, but I accept and respect it. The whole theme of the series has been selflessness, sacrifice, and courage, so I think the ending makes sense--it stayed true to everything we know about Tris. I think its execution could have been handled better as well as the ensuing chapters about the fallout. Mostly, I just wish we had been left with a better sense of hope. Mockingjay didn't have a particularly happy ending, but it did have a sense of hope, which is what we needed after our hearts were put through the shredder. Allegiant just ripped our hearts apart and left them to rot in a ditch on the side of the road.<br /><br />5. Just acomment: I was expecting more about Tris and Tobias' fears to be incorporated. We sort of saw Tobias' when he went through the metal scanner, saw his father at the end, and finally went down the zip line. Surprisingly, there wasn't much about his fear of Tris' death, and Tris just suddenly seemed to be fearless. I just thought the fears were a rather big theme that didn't get addressed as much as I was expecting.<br /><br />6. Despite my overall discontent with this book, I loved Divergent and Insurgent and will undoubtedly reread them in the distant future (after I've had time to get over Allegiant, which I will probably not reread). As for the movie, I wasn't thrilled about some of the casting choices but I'll give it a chance. If the other two books are made into movies, maybe we'll have the rare situation of the Allegiant movie being better than the book (if the screenplay writers decide to \\"fix\\" it).
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was a surprisingly good follow up to the original story (long overdue). I wasn't sure I would like the book, but naturally there was no way to resist reading it. That's the way it is when you read a lot of S. King's books. I am really glad I read it before any of my friends did, because they would have undoubtedly  spoiled something for sure.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend's birthday as she is a huge Sailor Moon fan. She was ecstatic when it arrived. The packaging was to her liking as well. So I'm not a Sailor Moon fan, nor do I know what a Sailor Moon does... but if you are a fan, or whom you are purchasing this for is, buy it. Buy it now.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|You hope that this is fiction but as you read further, it captures you in it's newsreel.  Well researched, well told, just enough to make you look behind when you hear an in familiar sound.
B00821OX98|5.0|I Alien Science Fiction and I think this TV series delivers.  Good clean alien and survival action. Noah Wyle is great in this series.  A low key but intelligent, thoughtful leader as well as able to deliver on action scenes.  Cast has come together nicely.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its great<br />I I really enjoy  this game  I wish that when im playing that I could  have extended moves however when have used all my moves it appears that i only just begun

0689835604|5.0|I bought this for my niece's baby shower. It seemed easy for the baby to handle safely. It also had a nice story.
B008EL25LE|5.0|I enjoyed clearing the levels and the scenery was great. It was addictive and I would play it for hours and lose track of time.
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|This recording is true gift. A must have for your collection.  Put your headphones on, close your eyes and enjoy the ride.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Stop at the second book and let your imagination give you the ending this series deserves. I gave this two stars instead of one only because it had one real life part in it. If you keep doing stupid things you will get dead. Lots of books have main characters that repeatedly do life threatening things and they survive. Well this one doesn't.<br />I can not figure out why the death scene had to happen this way. I figured out another way right after reading the first attempt. It seemed rushed and poorly done.<br /><br />and as I have said on my FB page, why in the world would you kill your main character when you have a movie coming out? No one is going to go see that now, well ok I won't be going, maybe others will but what is the point? Oh what a great couple they make!! to bad she kicks it
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I like brain builder games. This one is a good one have only played a few games, but can't wait to try more games.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I'm obsessed !!! -_- I bought all of them and I got my mom and my sister hooked now they looked at me and blame me for their addiction to Castle! Love them they make the perfect team!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game gives you the chance to challenge your mind and your skills.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone who really wants to challenge their skills and sharpen their mind.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I think we can see a bit of ourselves in her, the doubts and insecurities and the little triumphs that make it all worthwhile

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Did not want to start this game, so I waited until this week to get it. Sure enough I became addicted to it. I love it. Glad I got it. Fun enough for kids to play.
B00F91H666|3.0|I like Brad Pitt movies and I thought the movie was entertaining, it just didn't grab me as much as others.  I would really give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.
B00FQAZ7PW|3.0|The album starts out with a bang with &#34;Get Away&#34; and then &#34;Mind Your Manners.&#34; There are a few good tracks after that,<br />&#34;Sirens,&#34; which is this albums version of &#34;Black,&#34; and Lightening Bolt, are both good songs, but then it starts to go down hill.  &#34;Infallible&#34; reminds me too much of &#34;Beautiful&#34; by Christina Aguilara and the guitar parts are similar to &#34;Tremor Christ.&#34;  &#34;Pendulum is a really good song, haunting and thought provoking.  But after &#34;Pendulum&#34; it just gets boring.  They try to rock it out with the &#34;Let The Records Play&#34; but the lyrics are too lame to let it really work.  Then its just one boring slow song after another ultimately ending in a &#34;country&#34; tune.  &#34;Yellow Moon&#34; sounds like Eddies cover of &#34;Big Hard Son&#34; off of his solo album.  Most of the album was written by Eddie, and you can imediately tell his songs, and by Jeff Ament.  The Ament songs are really the highlights of the album.  Stone Gossard contributes only one song and I believe this is why the album fails.  Gossard was the main song writer in the bands early days and has now been supplanted by Vedders all too predictable song writing.  You can tell that the band just writes songs individually and then records them as a group.  The album sounds like a &#34;greatest hits&#34; of all the members solo works, and not a Peal Jam album.  &#34;Backspacer&#34; had a similar problem but had more rockers on it to keep you interested despite Eddies constant interuptions.  I will say that for once Eddies voice doesn't ruin the songs as it often does in the past.  If you are going to buy this album on MP3, just buy the first 7 and save yourself some money.
B0030SCPZ2|3.0|I enjoyed this movie and would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  I love Led Zep but Jack White was the most interesting of the three to me.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Helen Fielding makes me laugh out loud, cry at the little truths, and just genuinely happy.  Her sense of wit and grip on life's little realities make grin goofily through entire chapters. She kept Bridget's voice after all these years, and it was just so lovely.<br /><br />If you loved the original, you'll love this too.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I saw this a few months ago and it was a great story that I found intriguing.  I definitely recommend it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love how it captures the reader with the different story lines that really appeal to every audience. Fun world created by the author that is a fun escape anytime!
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors that consistently makes entertaining movies.  It doesn't hurt that he gets a stud cast either.  Momento will probably always be my favorite of his, but this is certainly high quality.

B00F35BV64|4.0|I grew up watching Star Trek, The Next Generation and I like the Star Trek series, I especially enjoy the updated series with the look and feel.  This was a great movie and was highly entertaining, even providing some good chuckles.

B0018OIK0E|4.0|I've seen this movie a few times and it always entertains me.  Especially with so much crap out there.  Plus Simon Pegg is usually going to bring it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I agree with other reviewers who say just skip this book and imagine your own ending. I understand killing off a character when it advances the story, but in this case it just seems superfluous.<br /><br />In the end I didn't get any kind of emotional release, or any kind of resolution. It just depressed me and made the whole series feel kind of pointless. I still love this story and these characters but I am very disappointed in the way it all ended.
B006W33UC4|5.0|Some of the really hard to find track, tom does an outstanding job and love this 4 cd set.  ...a must have
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie - great plot, funny characters.<br />Had a wonderful message for kids and adults alike.<br />We'd like to have our granddaughter watch it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting to get this app on the kindle and now that I have it I don't want to stop playing.
0061730335|4.0|A picture of African hardship, but so refreshing to read about a boy with an inquiring mind who yearns to learn.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|unexpected plot but a good series. don't let the one stars cloud you this is a good book and is well written. i enjoyed it even with the sad ending
006202406X|1.0|I liked the first two in the series, but I just couldn't handle this one.  Roth has never had much a hand at poetry, but in the past her skill with plot made up for it.<br />This time around I felt like I was reading fan-fiction, and a third the way through I realized that I was bored out of my mind.  So I skipped to the last bit to see what everyone has been complaining about, and then put it down.  I suppose the ending didn't bother me as much because I had already been too bored into apathy to care about the characters.<br />Also, I should admit that this recent trend for first-person alternating narrators is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, especially because it always seems to be poorly done.  Tris and Tobias sound exactly - EXACTLY - the same.  And please, to all the young men out there, please tell me that this is or is not what men sound like when they think.  I'm not buying it at all.  I'm a girl, so maybe I'm wrong, but I just cannot possibly imagine a male of the strong, street-fighter variety talking the way Tobias does.  Ok, end rant...<br />Anyway, big disappointment.  I kind of feel bad for Ms. Roth at this point, but it's a harsh world.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|This film is a real find. Why it was passed over by so many is a mystery. Its a good, solid Sci Fi. The logic of the scrpt is a little fuzzy, but its a pretty nifty film. Great visuals, too.
B000I2JI80|4.0|Going back to using my medium format Yashica and this is one of the better films.  Excellent color range and reproduction.  The price for the package makes it very appealing.

B000KZBRG6|5.0|I use digital cameras, but when you use vintage film cameras, you become a true photographer.  This is one of the must have tools for good film photography.  Small, lightweight and accurate, what else could you ask for.  Plus it was at a very good price.
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|The idea of current DJs remixing Donna Summer's music seems like a can't-miss opportunity but unfortunately \\"Love To Love You Donna\\", a remix/tribute album to the late, great Queen of Disco, is ultimately disappointing.<br /><br />While nothing will ever top the original songs with Giorgio Moroder's groundbreaking productions and Summer's stunning vocals, it's fun to hear DJs remix and rebuild these classic songs.  In this case, the results vary.<br /><br />The first track is \\"Love To Love You Baby\\", Donna's first big hit from 1975.  Remixed by Moroder himself with Chris Cox, it's a great start for this project.  Moroder and Cox update \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" with current beats and it sounds fresh.  But the momentum loses steam with Duke Dumont's remix of \\"Dim All The Lights\\".  It sounds painfully outdated, as if it's still stuck in 1995.  That's fine if you like '90s remixes but this proves to be one of the album's biggest disappointments.  Only one line is repeated throughout; the remixer doesn't take advantage of Donna's incredible vocals, not even the song's famous unbroken note.  Chromeo's remix of \\"Love Is In Control (Finger on the Trigger)\\" is the best one, in my opinion.  It's bouncy, fun and like Donna's best dance songs, it gets you moving.  Too bad they didn't get to remix a few more songs.<br /><br />Afrojack's remix of \\"I Feel Love\\" and Frankie Knuckle's remix of \\"Hot Stuff\\" are serviceable but not outstanding.  Master at Work's remix of \\"Last Dance\\" sounds indistinguishable from their other remixes.  It's not bad, just a little dull.  The remix of \\"Midnight Shift\\" is pretty good, but the fact that Donna's vocals are not even used is pretty shocking (and puzzling) as her vocals are replaced by another female singer.<br /><br />I think there are other (and better) remixers/producers who would have been better suited to remix Moroder/Summer, particularly Daft Punk, Stuart Price, Dimitri from Paris and Almighty (in fact, Almighty did a remix album of DianaRoss' Motown hits a few years ago which was released digitally and is a lot of fun).<br /><br />It's great that Donna Summer's music is being introduced to a new generation of listeners but this should have been so much better.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. I thought it was true to the book. I didn't think it explained and displayed the mocking jay enough.  I suppose much of what I missed will be displayed in subsequent movies.
B0083GR6Y6|1.0|my god this was a terrible movie it moved to slow and never seemed to climax it was just not done well
160774418X|5.0|I am so happy to have this cookbook.  It has been on my wish list for 5 years now!  I have Plenty, but it's in metric measurements and I convert all of the recipes just to make these delicious meals :)<br /><br />They only down side is the color of the photographs - not always an appetizing tone.<br />The page layout is weird as well.  There is cramped text and a lot of white space.  Oh well, excellent food awaits!

B00881VLCE|3.0|This puzzle app used to rock. Then they upgraded. After that it would still play but would freeze and crash more often. Removed the ads hoping that would help. It didn't and actually made it worse. Now another upgrade and it's HORRIBLE!!! Won't even stay open long enough to play. Please fix!!!! So until they fix the bugs bypass this app and save yourself the frustration.

0345522478|5.0|Actually, the first book doesn't have Atticus QUITE at war just yet; at least not like the war in which you'll eventually see him. Atticus instead sets the stage for the Nordic, Gaelic and other pantheons - and the not so humble Druidic place in those.  Attic is spectacular - it's easy to understand how he lived so long, which is loving and helping (and very hip) attitude.  Although his green and tree hugging (har, har) attitudes against corporate America frequently make me roll my eyes at their naivet&eacute;, you can't help loving Atticus.  He's 2000 years old... and COOL.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a really fun game that increases the speed and difficulty as you play. It's a fun game. There are a few times that I wished I had an explanation on how to earn more coins or how to achieve some of the goals. It is very fun though and the graphics are good.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This sat on my Kindle for a long time as I worked through previous purchases. I really regret not starting this as soon as it downloaded. I didn't really buy the love story but everything else was spot on terrific. The world building (in a silo) is great. I cannot wait for more.
B00FPH6A70|2.0|In my opinion, this film has to be a bitter trick rather than a sweet treat for Hallowe`en!~!<br /><br />The cast of throwaway characters in this epic fail basically include Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston as Carolyn and Roger Perron and their brood of kids and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson playing Lorraine and Ed Warren; Plus various other non essential players.<br /><br />The tired old premise being that the Perron family move into an old spooky farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere...set up housekeeping and start to hear `noises`. So the Paranormal couple is brought in to banish the evil entity who resides there.<br /><br />The Conjuring uses every cliché in the book in an attempt to scare us but none of it ever really materializes. The players seem to be struggling to appear scared to death at every shadowy corner and try desperately to `react` to all those thumps and bumps in the night...<br /><br />The viewer gets no real sense of who these people are nor do we care.<br /><br />This film is a stinker from the start, I didn't stick `round to watch the end~!~<br /><br />Bitter* gulps her chilled Champagne*

B0071XO8RA|5.0|These five short stories that combined, make a great story, and this is only the beginning.  There are two more short-story compilations behind this one.  I've read all three and highly recommend them.  You don't have to be a sci-fi fan (I'm not) to enjoy all three books in the trilogy.  Buy them, read them in order and you'll be entertained for hours.  It was very difficult for me to put the books down to go do things that needed doing.<br />Very well written with a believable, sustainable story-line that weaves it's way throughout the entire series.<br />Good stuff!!

B000N2HBSO|5.0|D.K Goodwin's historical harvest feeds into the comprehension of not merely Abraham Lincoln, but of the social and political perspectives of the society within which he labored to accomplish what one might refer to as his calling, as opposed to mere political ambition. Her exceptional writing, compilation of the diaries of several characters who were a part of the dynamic of the moment, and the exposure of every element of Lincoln's character, lead us to embrace the necessary depth of true leadership, as well as the fulness of the burden. This book has potential to impact both leaders and citizens well beyond the limits of American culture.

0765325950|5.0|The finale to The Wheel of Time has been a long time coming. When Robert Jordan died, I, like many other ardent fans, feared for the story's conclusion. Was it written? What would happen?<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson assuaged my fears. This is one of the best books in the series. It was a hard job, tying up the loose ends that had been flapping around, seemingly since Book Ten. But here, finally is the showdown. Well worth the wait.<br /><br />After I finished, I actually felt sad. Sad that this book was over and there would be no more. I mourned. Which indicates how well this book is written, to invoke feelings of retrospection and loss in the reader.

B009NX3U20|3.0|This was quite an unusual approach to a movie.  The whole concept of the movie was based on the fact that there was always someone video taping everything, and the viewer sees everything in realtime through the lens of the video camera.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I am revising my review because I listen to those fans that gave this book 4 or 5 stars.  I decided to read book 1 & 2 and then read Allegiant.  The second time around was very different.  I feel this book did live up to the author's expectations.  All was wrapped up in a very neat succinct package.  Many did not like the ending, but forgot that this is Tris story.  Her life.  She always put others before herself.  The apex of Abnegation!<br /><br />At first I did not cry, but after reading it a second time, boy the tears just flowed.  Taking my time to absorb what the author wanted to convey, I sobbed the last few chapters.  My heart still hurts for Tobbias.  I plead to all of you that gave it less than 3 stars to read the entire trilogy again.  You will not regret it.<br /><br />Yes the POV at the beginning is a bit confusing.  Yes the subplots were not well developed.  The new characters were not well developed.  The state of the world was extremely ambiguous.  But you need to remember that this is Tris story.  Not the Bureau story, or the city's story, not even Tobbia's story.  This is the life of a girl that did not think much of herself and ended up saving so many people because of her selflessness.<br /><br />Still I do not think it deserves 5 stars.  The author is young and I am sure she knows the awakrdness of her POV and lack of character development.  Please give it another chance
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|Having read most of Gladwell's previous works, I approached this book with a slight trepidation. Any sociology student will tell you that correlation does not cause causation. The fundamental idea that MG espouses and disengenously use to make simplistic arguments about complex subjects.<br /><br />Only supportive evidence is presented and no reference is made to the &#34;goliaths&#34; that have won in battles with the david.<br />Anomalies and variations are skimmed over and at the end of it, the central idea that the book wants you to support is that being a big fish in a small pond is better than being a small fish in a big pond. There are plenty of examples where business leaders started out in large organizations and continued to climb to the top.<br /><br />Gladwell's books are essentially for those who prefer the summaries of any idea to those who actually spend the time in research. The latest book is his laziest. Not recommended.
B0036SXQEA|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson is a genus.  This movie is his shining star.  (Granted I haven't seen There Will Be Blood, but I have seen Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love, and The Master.)  Is life a series of random, meaningless events?  Is it all a coincidence?  Or is there no coincidence or chance at all?  These are the questions PT Anderson asks the viewer, and in doing so, he weaves a brilliant tale of several people with seemingly no connection that are truly completely connected.  This movie treats the viewer to some of the finest performances by some of today's best actors and actresses, including Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise (who does his best work when cast against type which is what he does in this film), William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Felicity Huffman, the lesser known, but still amazing, Melora Walters (btw, she's Wanda in Big Love), and the late Jason Robards.  I love every single second of this movie, and even though it is over 3 hours long, I could, and will, watch it over and over again.  If you don't like to think or pay attention while watching movies, don't watch this.  However, if you enjoy being challenged to concentrate, contemplate, and make some of your own decisions while watching a movie, watch Magnolia.  It will quickly become one of your favorites, and it is surely one of mine.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|This album is one of the most mature and reflective of any pop album in recent memory. Katy Perry has definitely grown up and come into her own and isn't afraid to venture into some deeper territory - a lot of which is obviously reflective of her divorce, etc. If your looking for the club banging anthems you may be more hard pressed to find that here, though Dark Horse does have an awesome beat. This album is refreshing because Katy has very unique vocals and is brining some fresh content here. There are a lot of ballads, a lot of angst but I like it very much so far. Consider this her \\"break up\\" album.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is better than the original. If you like blood, guts, special effects and action, then<br />this is the movie for you.
006202406X|2.0|Let's just establish one thing right away here - I adored the first two books in this series. I felt that Divergent and Insurgent were well written entries into the dystopian, young adult genre, and I liked the plot elements that Veronica Roth explored, the idea of dividing society into segments based on their skills and weaknesses. So I was really looking forward to Allegiant and what it would do to conclude the series.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Allegiant just felt as though a lot of the magic and the drive that fueled the first two books was gone - my attention wasn't grabbed by this book the way it was in the others, I wasn't glued to the page, barely able to put it down. Instead I found myself skimming, wanting to get to the more interesting bits.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the POV in this book shifts back and forth between Tris and Tobias. When I heard this, I thought GREAT! It is always interesting to get into someone else's head! I always wished that there was a chance to do that in the Harry Potter series - that's one of the reason I love fanfic so much, it gets into things that the author doesn't touch on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't find the switch-up in the POVs to be particularly interesting, which is surprising. In fact I actually thought that it detracted from the book a bit, because Tobias' POV wasn't distinct enough from Tris. There were quite a few times in reading this book that I was surprised to realise I was reading Tris rather than Tobias, and vice versa. Worst of all, he didn't sound like the Tobias I had seen through Tris' eyes, and while there is always some disconnect between the way we see ourselves and the way others see us, I didn't find this as close as it should have been.<br /><br />'What should have been' brings me to my last point about the book. Sadly, what could have been an incredibly fascinating journey into areas of this world that we haven't yet explored turned into a somewhat meandering story instead, with a lot of questions left unanswered. It's sad because the elements of a spine tingling, fascinating conclusion are in there, but they are fuzzy and jumbled and just not articulated well. I still have a lot of questions about the overall world and I feel that the stakes involved in the plot pushing the book were not as big as they should or could have been.<br /><br />Roth makes more than one decision throughout the course of the book that will be controversial, something I am not going to get into here, for the sake of spoilers. Ultimately I disagreed with several of her choices and did not close the book feeling satisfied in the journey or that all my questions were answered. I have no emotional satisfaction from reading this book, there was no payoff or conclusion for me, though I can see that Roth attempted it.<br /><br />I've seen some people say \\"Well, why would you expect a good ending? It's dystopia!\\" No, I didn't necessarily expect a 'good' ending, but I expected to feel as though I'd read a great story. Instead I feel as though it went off the rails at some point and left a lot unanswered.<br /><br />As much as I hate to do this, I feel the book deserves the two star rating because it did not live up to its potential or my expectations.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I think the game would be worth more, but to throw in a cost is brilliant for the developers only.  I prefer to buy a game and know that what I paid is the only expense I have.  I think I'll stick to Bejeweled which is strikingly similar.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very straightforward  to install and use, and I am not a &#34;techy&#34;.  I've had it for a few weeks. Makes it easy to watch all my Netflix favourites on the big TV screen.
B00FFRAKRG|3.0|been waiting for this new album for around a yr now and im happy with it good to see head back and you can tell in the music
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|I do love these guys and it was very funny and entertaining but I do hope they don't overdo a good thing and do another one
0915811774|5.0|if you're in the heart business, this is a great book for that connection. It's more like a return back home - enjoy.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Except for Leonardo the acting sucked. Whole movie was quite disappointing. I much prefer the one that Robert Redford made.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My son's 10 and 8 play this as well as myself.  We all really enjoy it. The only thing I wish you could change is the number of lives. I wish the lives were unlimited.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!! Perfect for horse lovers! Never had a problem with the game. It's never frozen and just cool!
B004FHCH96|5.0|Solid movie, solid treatment. Been a huge fan of this since it came out. Could've used more special features but isn't that always the case?
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|This app shows random people your exact location! I would not recommend this app anymore. I used to think it was cool. Until I started getting total strangers, especially creepy guys who only want to talk about $3X! And there's no real privacy setting to hide your location. And when I tried to log out of the app. Or even delete my account associated with the app, it didn't have any way to do so. I ended up deleting the app entirely from my kindle in a last stich effort to delete my account.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game very addictive.  Just wish you got more lives hate having to wait to continue to play.  Not one to pay for lives!!  I do recommend for we everyone!!
B007RI56NY|4.0|I love the funny lyrics and catchy tunes!  Puts me in a good mood, and the musicality of this group is terrific - listen for the horns section.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This heavier cord put more juice in the Kindle or the Phone faster.  I tend to use them a lot and so do my kids so it is important that they recharge faster.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|Love the music and the performers and love the show.  There is something here for everyone.  I'm stunned by the harmony and sensuality of &#34;If I Didn't Know Better&#34;.  This is a song I never would have heard if I hadn't watched this show
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I heard that it was originally intended to be a short story which makes sense, since it's a very quick read.  I'd say that's a good thing since I couldn't put it down.  A few really late nights and I have to say it was well worth it.  A very well-written, totally unique story that makes me wish there was more.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book I like how you made it very very very very very funny this is a great book
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased the chromecast because my tv doesn't have internet on it and i needed a way to stream things to my tv. Its fast and easy to set up. You can leave it pluged into your tv and it comes turns on and off with your tv. I only gave it 3 stars because the only streaming services it uses as of now are netflix and youtube. For me its basically a glorified netflix dongle but for $35 you can't go wrong.
B00755MHXG|5.0|It is a reeeeeeeeeeeeealy good book and i love the way the author wrote it, you must read this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game when I'm able to beat a level within the first two or three tries. I hate this game when I'm not able to beat a level after more than 30 tries. Do I play the game anyway? Absolutely!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun. My friends told me about it and I got it. I was so glad when I first started the app. I could already tell I would love this app. You should at least try this app, it's so much fun and besides, it's free!!!
006202406X|5.0|Veronica Roth's ending may not have been the one that YOU wanted, but the third book is a worthwhile read.  The whole series needs to be taken into account when reviewing.  Not everyone was happy with the way the Sopranos ended, but that doesn't mean it wasn't an amazing show.  The same can be said for this trilogy.  Great job Veronica.  Keep up the excellent work!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game i great its a lot like temple run but better you will like the new adventures and fun stuff you do get ready to ride the fun train cause uts coming.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Only downsides I have seen care due to my equipment or the smartphone apps like Netflix. I bought three more of them for the other rooms with screens.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Great game.  My kids love it too.  Got this app for free but would pay for it knowing how good and fun it is.
0812993845|1.0|I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books, but Wedding Night was not that great to read.  I was looking forward to reading this book, and at the start it was slow.  I persevered with reading the book, hoping it would improve.  Unfortunately it did not, I continued reading, but it was like a train wreck.  The characters in the story just jumped around, and there was no consistency through out the story.  It was very disappointing to read this book, and became silly in the end.  I hope Sophie's Kinsella's next book will be better.  I enjoy reading Sophie Kinsella's books, and I'm actually sorry to write this review.
1476729085|4.0|If you love \\"the Big Bang Theory\\" then you will enjoy this book!  It's fun, funny, light-hearted...OK...it is also predictable, but that's OK.<br /><br />Don Tillman is a professor who is unaware that he is autistic.  He has all of Sheldon Cooper's \\"quirks\\" but HE really wants to find a wife.  He starts a project to do so by developing a lengthy questionnaire...one that his best friend says that no woman can meet.<br /><br />In comes Rosie (who is introduced by his friend) and she meets hardly any of Don's guidelines, but there is something about her that he cannot escape.<br /><br />I felt the backstory about Rosie trying to identify her father was a bit over-done.  In fact, as they gather DNA from a number of \\"possible\\" dads, Don tests it. Now, here I felt the novel to be weak since I don't think you can do a DNA test in a few minutes!  At least on TV the process seems to take a while.<br /><br />I thought it was funny that in one section of the book Don talks about a book he has read and the author has the same last name as one of the characters in \\"Big Bang Theory.\\"<br /><br />Great literature?  Well, no...but it is fun and a novel that you'll enjoy to the end.
0385342063|4.0|What a great, feel good, fun read \\"I've Got Your Number\\" and page turner this book is.  Well worth reading.  I loved reading this story.  Fantastic characters, and a good story line.  Would recommend buying this book.  If I compared it with Sophie Kinsellas other book, \\"Wedding Night,\\" this book is better and flows the whole way through.  I loved it.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Edie Burchill is intrigued when her mother receives a letter lost in the mail for 50 years and her mother has an odd reaction that she won't explain, at least not in a way that seems satisfactory to Edie. She does learn that her mother had been evacuated from London as a child during World War II and taken out to the country, where she ended up living with a young woman and her twin older sisters in their castle.<br />Edie probably would have let the mysterious reaction slide except for the fact that one day she runs across Milderhurst Castle when she gets lost in the country, and her fascination -- almost obsession -- with the castle, its inhabitants and her mother's past begins. With some sleuthing, she begins to learn about the now aged spinster sisters, Percy, Saffy and Juniper Blythe, and their author father who wrote a famous scary story called The True History of the Mud Man. She learns about the tragedies that befell the family at the castle and even gets to meet the sisters on a tour of the home.<br />As Edie learns bit by bit about the history of the castle and its inhabitants, including her mother, the reader gets to learn about each character 50 years earlier; the narrative goes back and forth between the past and the present (well, technically, 1992). Information, personalities and motivations are revealed, and mysteries are slowly solved.<br />Kate Morton, author of \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" and \\"The House at Riverton\\", has penned another lovely novel with engaging characters and gothic secrets that keeps the reader hanging on until the last page. For those who enjoyed her other books and for any fans of gothic literature, this is a must-read.<br />- See more info at: [...]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Since I couldn't play this game on my Kindle Fire, I wasn't going to play any where. It took so long for it King to come out with the compatible version I had pretty much convinced myself that this game was all hype.  I was wrong.<br /><br />It's a great game for all ages.  It's hard enough to be challenging, but I haven't found a level I couldn't eventually win. Not to mention, it's so darn cute!  I guess all 2,000,000 player out there weren't wrong after all :)
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Don Tillman is a genetics professor and absolutely brilliant. But he's completely lost when it comes to social situations. He would like to find a woman with whom he's compatible and who would like and accept him, but so far, he can't get past first dates. Then it hits him: he should create a detailed questionnaire that would allow him to find the perfect woman for him: a \\"purpose-built, scientifically valid instrument incorporating current best practice to filter out\\" those who wouldn't fit his parameters. He gets to work and calls it The Wife Project.<br />Meanwhile, his best friend (only friend, really), a married man who can't stop his womanizing ways, tries to help Don. Shortly after Don gives Gene some of his questionnaires, Gene sends Rosie his way. Don immediately asks her to dinner, trying to take some of Gene's advice on dating. He is dismayed to find out right away that she has a number of faults, ones that should have been screened out by the questionnaire. But he does find himself interested in a new project: helping Rosie find her biological father (her mother died when she was younger but there was some suspicion her \\"father\\" wasn't really her father). So he puts The Wife Project on hold and commences The Father Project.<br />Don and Rosie end up doing some wacky things to obtain DNA samples from family friends whom Rosie thinks could be possible candidates. It's all a bit crazy and definitely funny for the reader, and Don finds himself having fun, as well. Only he doesn't really realize it; it's only clear to the reader by the things he says, which makes it even more entertaining.<br />In short, readers get to enjoy the experience of a brilliant man with Asperger's falling in love with absolutely the \\"wrong woman\\" for him. It's all told from Don's point of view, and it is sweet and clever and funny all at the same time. I just loved it. Such a light, fun read. I found myself reading chunks aloud to my teenager because I just had to share what was making me laugh out loud. Would be absolutely perfect if it didn't have so much strong language.<br />- See more at: [...]ing me laugh out loud.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm sure the following two books are equal to the first but it didn't live up to the hype.  In their own ways both main characters are mentally broken.  Life's too short to embrace spending time with one so self admittedly broken and one seemingly seeking it out under a self delusion of wanting love.
1476727651|5.0|Great read. I just could not put it down. I guess because I knew the history. Hope to see a movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book will be considered one of my favorites! Filled with plenty of twists to keep you reading. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!!!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I think this movie is timeless, and one of my favs that I rewatch every so often. It's Jodie Foster, science, life, everything. If you have never seen it, you're in for a great movie.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I Love this game! It is lots of fun and very enjoyable! The graphics are very good as as well.
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|This falls victim to almost every mixer giving each song almost identical treatments to in an ill advised attempt to make the songs sound fresh and current, but the very overplayed and long past it's due date house treatment on all just sucks the life out of these classics. Nothing here can electrify you like the originals can. There are remixers out there with styles that COULD have supercharged these tracks for an alternative listening experience (almighty, gomi, Eddie Baez, etc.), but sadly they were not utilized here.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This set contained so many of my favorite Van Morrison songs and all three discs at a really good price.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is a fun game. I just think that they need to give more life's. Just a WARNING you CAN'T put it down until you run out of life's.
B007REV4YI|4.0|very interesting james bond move like the idea that bond always looked neat and clear even will fighting the baddies
B00A285OOW|5.0|I am fascinated with stories of English royalty.  I highly recommend all of Gregory's books.  The only thing I don't like is when it ends!
B0037TPMOA|5.0|A bit pointless really writing a review on this book.  A SK classic which everyone has heard of and for very good reason.  Probably one of the best Stephen King books ever.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />I could cry right now. I'll admit, I despise the ending much like everyone else. But for me it wasn't the fact that Tris dies, but how she dies. Throughout the series, common themes have been selflessness and sacrifice, so I can understand Tris giving her life for the protection of the people inside and outside the fence. What I don't understand is why her death wasn't executed better than it was. The book gives no sense of hope whatsoever. You are left only with your grief for Tris' death and nothing else. It's hard to even be happy for the surviving characters because there was no sense of closure. Tris is there one minute and then, boom, she's gone. Tris deserved a better ending than what was given to her. I'm so disappointed with this ending because I truly love the first two books, and now I'll never be able to read this series again.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|An endearing movie!  One that will leave you thinking for a very long time, about family relationships and what is really important in life!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The game has great graphics but loads so slow,it keeps freezing up on me so I  have to reboot it all the time,but over all its a good game,and it free!
B00915G6SU|5.0|I love Criminal Minds. It is a consistently well-researched and well acted TV show. Can not wait till Season Nine.
0307474259|5.0|This book was a great follow up to Good Calories Bad Calories. It's easier to read and has more pictures and clear instructions for application. Last time I was trying to lose my baby weight, I hit a plateau and then found this book. Applying the concepts helped me drop the last few pounds and in a very short amount of time. I recommend this book to anyone struggling to lose weight--or anyone who knows people who struggle with their weight--or anyone who is just interested in food. Which I think includes everyone. So if you are a person, I think you should read this book. Let it enlighten your life.
B009RX7IX8|4.0|Season five shouts down the long disproved 'Moonlighting Curse'. The series only continues to improve as the years pass. I look forward to finding out what comes next.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|My main purpose was to use this to view files, mainly .mov fies, from my computer on the big screen. Most of the reviews said that it would do this. After running setup, which was very simple and easy by the way, I found that it would not play the files.  After some digging I found that Google had changed this ability due to some legal issues or something. Works great with Netfix and the other programs it was mainly designed for, but I already subscribe to them an have other products that play these for me. I've used it once since purchase.<br />How ever, If you don't have other devices to view Netflix or the other programs, I would highly recommend this.
B0050PYNN0|4.0|Great comedy action adventure with Natalie Portman. Would not recommend for children to see. Good to see Natakie Portman in a comedy instead of sci/fi or fantasy movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally -- it has been way too long but finally candy crush is for kindle fire!! Just did updates - hopefully it will continue to be great!!
B008JFUO72|4.0|Great fantasy Sci/Fi action movie with Robert Downey Jr., Gweneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, and Ben Kingsley. Marvel's comic book  hero goes to life.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If the first book was written the way this one was, I probably never would have bothered finishing it. It has a weak plot and frankly, without the headings, you can't tell who's point of view is who's. Stilted writing, was a chore to get through.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great Sci/Fi action adventure movie with Chris Pine, Karl Urban, Zahary Quinto, and Zoe Saldana. Star Trek at its finest, story has an old emeny and new story.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is a real page turner.  John Grisham has written some of the best fiction in the world over the years although in recent years it did seem like he was experimenting with different writing styles and looser legal research.  It wasn't clear if he was losing his touch or just bored.  This yarn brings back many of the characters from \\"A Time to Kill\\" set just three years later.  It starts off with a last minute, hand written will arriving in the mail just days after the wealthiest man in the county takes his own life--a man that was so secretive that virtually no one knew he had any wealth at all.  His family is cut out of his estate and replaced with his black maid as the beneficiary at the last minute which is where the fireworks begin.  The lawyers start piling on thicker than stacks of firewood.  Its impossible to figure out what is going on with all the twists and turns and the pages just keep turning.  Don't start this one if you have any important appointments to keep in the morning.<br /><br />Update:  It might not have been clear what was meant by different writing styles and looser legal research.  In a number of the author's recent books, he had written in the first person (\\"I looked at the judge and wondered exactly what he was thinking\\"), adding to that a present tense approach, which can be really hard to get into (\\"I am walking down the hallway and see the opening to the courtroom ahead\\").  This book returns to the more traditional (and I think easier to read) what is called third person, past perfect (\\"She looked at the painting in silence and thought to herself that no one in their right mind would hang such an abomination on a perfectly good wall.  The victim, of course, hadn't moved and still stared at it with unseeing eyes.\\").  As to looser legal research, the author, himself, mentioned that in disclaimers at the end of the last several stories, stating that he has become a lazy writer and has made up a good portion of the legal and technical facts.  I tend to think he has been stretching the truth a little on this point as he has listed quite a few individuals as consultants, professional or otherwise.  The characters--this is Grisham after all--are as disfunctional as ever but they come to life with his great writing such that you have to love them anyway.  Most of them are like bad relatives that you wouldn't actually want to spend time with but love hearing stories about for the entertainment value.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really EXTREMELY cute!! It's like Temple Run but even better! I can't even describe it. It's amazing.
B00F9040HU|4.0|I really like this one, except for the time limit.  I guess my old fingers don't work like they use to, but I just can't seem to get the job done in the amount of time they give me.  But I keep on trying.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Just a really enjoyable film.  A lot of good music, but a whole lot more.  The scenic shots of Alabama, the interviews, the file of the original recorings sessions, etc.  All really great.
B008QZ1ZYQ|1.0|The game is a typical puzzle game... however it's not what I expect from it... I don't like the game...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a very addictive game. I love it!!! I have this game on my phone and kindle fire, just can't get enough of it!
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|This graphic novel has captured my heart and was a wonderful read.  There are moments of joy, anger and sadness that captivate the reader and make us yearn for more.  Regardless of who you love, this story is a great experience about what it means to love without boundaries and to know yourself more and more with through love. I would recommend this to anyone.  Enjoy it, it goes by quickly.<br /><br />Side note:  I read this on the kindle version, and it was frustrating, as some have already mentioned.  The tile zoom feature did not work on my laptop nor on my iPhone. Sometimes technology is not the better way.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great on the spot dictionary. I find it really useful when I am watching a movie and I hear a word that I am not familiar with.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|To say I'm disappointed in this book would be an understatement.  I hated the plot, hated the repeat of issues between Tris and Four and definitely hated the ending.  If you liked the first books like I did then I would not read this final installment.
B00006674X|5.0|I admit it, I never liked any of Elivis' movies and not because my sister forced me to watch them with her late nights when we were younger. I simply thought he couldn't act. My thoughts changed after seeing this movie. I remember watching it a long time ago and it resonated with me. I had the chance to see it again a few days ago and discovered my feelings hadn't changed about it. I loved Elvis in this movie and I loved &#34;Rubberneckin'&#34;. He showed a great range of acting in this film that made me a believer and he was quite handsome to watch. I wish he had more opportunities to show us his acting chops rather than the crap he was forced to do to earn a buck. That was a downright shame and a waste of his great talent.<br />Too bad that movie was the last one he did. Put your preconceived notions aside about what you know of Elvis and see this movie, your minds will be changed just like the habits the title suggest. Enjoy the movie!
0316201561|5.0|I ordered for my 5th grade daughter, she loves it. Totally falls into it, and get me involved in this exciting story.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. I'm not the only one who thinks so too. It is currently the third highest grossing movie of all time and there are very few people on the planet who have not seen it, and even less that don't like the movie.<br /><br />I have wanted this BD and DVD combo since the movie was released because I knew there was 30 minutes of footage that was cut from the theatrical version that I really wanted to see. I don't know if all of it is on the BD or DVD but there are a few bonus scenes and extended scenes. There are also a good amount of other extras that you will really enjoy like the gag real, the commentary and of course, the Marvel movie short that comes with a lot of the other Marvel BD's and DVD's.<br /><br />You will enjoy this movie.
0470876417|3.0|The book has been beneficial and a great guide to organize a new business. Great American Books took good care to make sure the book got to me. Thanks.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I love the Marvel Studio's movies. This was another welcome addition to my collection of the movies.<br /><br />I love having both the BD and the DVD, but I really love having the digital copy. The download at Marvel's website gives you four different ways to download the movie and save it. I choose iTunes because then I can put it on my iPod and watch it anytime but also on my computer anytime I want.<br /><br />Without spoiling the movie, if you have not seen it there are a few surprises in store that you might not expect from it. Especially if you are a Marvel comic's fan and know at least a little about Iron Man and his background.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie!
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|James wan did a good job in making the film,  However, I did like his recent film insidious better.  The plot started out great with a few simple doors opening , apparitions here and there and noise. So the family hires a married couple who are ghost hunters too see and inspect the house.  I would say I did like how wan portrayed the apparitions via pictures and the sound affects.  I think  the possessions were to animated . It was difficult too visualize the mother running around the house as a zombie and being possessed.     Overall its a very good movie but compared to other ghost movies, I would rate this in my top 10 but not top 5...  The only reason I would give it a 4 star rather than a 5 is because of the possession and some parts of the film..  for example, the ghost hunter falls into this hole behind the closet and onto the basement and doesn't even gets hurt... and of course the possession could of been more subtle.    real hauntings like in documentaries don't have ghosts climbing walls and someone turning into a zombie such as Hollywood portrays.. Its more subtle and in a way where you do see images and noise and on occasion you will get intimated by its presence .  A good example is the movie \\"the innkeepers\\"  you don't really see or hear  the ghost until the end of the film  and at some points during the middle of the film  GREAT ENDING!  BY THE WAY    My top  5 haunted house movies are    1) the exorcist original version  2) insidious  3) Amityville horror  original  4) The Haunted (1991) sally Kirkland  5) THE innkeepers
B003LXSY60|4.0|Good band and a good album,  listen to the samples and see if you would like the whole album.  Amazon is great for keeping all your music.
B0000256KE|5.0|Out of the blue came Roxy's stunning and groundbreaking eponymous first album. Then this, to be followed by the equally magnificent Stranded. Even for the amazing stuff that was being released at the time (e.g. DSOTM, Ziggy, SEBTP), For Your Pleasure stood out as a bona fide masterpiece. Here was a type of rock never before attempted. The incredible interplay between Mackay's sax, Manzanera's guitar, and Eno's mad electronic processing. It shouldn't have worked; but it did, big time, because there were always the melodies. Ferry could pen a tune, no question, and had the voice to suit. And it was all held together by the great Paul Thompson, the tasteful timekeeper - always the best but never better than with the deceptively simple rhythms on Bogus Man and Grey Lagoons and the driving beat on Editions of You.<br />There's no avant garde, alternative, new wave music without Roxy. This is a phenomenal piece of work at a time of intense musical revolution when the sky was the limit. If you don't have this album in your rock collection, be thankful to be still alive to have the chance to hear it.<br />A massive 5 stars.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000256KG Roxy Music]]<br />[[ASIN:B0000256KM Stranded]]

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I avoided the 'just another' match three game on Facebook even though many of my friends kept inviting me. Then it was a free app on my Fire so I decided it out. Now I play it often.  Fun and different.

B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|If I could give this album a sub zero rating I would.  Neil Bogart MUST be rolling over in his grave and Donna herself must be doing the same.  They have taken some of Donna's finest songs and turned them into disco demolition derbies.  I have deleted it from my iPod and shredded the disc.  This album does a LOT of dishonor to Donna's memory and how her husband Bruce Sudano could have sanctioned this crap stuns me as he MUST be desperate for the money.  All of the music is techno, digital noise which could have been recorded in Sudano's bathroom.  All real live studio musicians are not to be heard as they were dead on arrival in the recording studio.  Programmed drums and bass?  No real guitars? No hissing disco cymbals?  Who in the hell are Keith Forsey and Tiffany Roth?  They have NO place on this album and contributed zero.  Did they ever win a Grammy or have a multi-platinum album out there?  I listened to Last Dance and Paul Jabara must be spinning in his grave as well.  Where did they get these so called \\"dj's\\" from?  They did a collectively crappy hitman job.  I blew $10.00 for garbage.  This is all electronic garbage in which the only person who could make that work for Donna was Giorgio Moroder.  In fact track 13, La Dolce Vita which GM mixed, is MISSING from this album.  Whatever you do STAY AS FAR AWAY from this as you can because it should be played on a lonely iPod sitting on a deck chair of the Titanic.
B00009NHC5|3.0|Most people love Audrey Hepburn because she seems like she was a very nice person but I've never liked this film because she doesn't seem very charming and her accent seems arch for most of the film.  She comes across better around the time she figures things out and of course, GLORIA turns out to be awesome.  The villains are really unlikable in this but not as menacing especially Arkin as widely-reported.<br /><br />This is a famous movie because it is such a unique idea and stars famous fashion plate Audrey Hepburn which means everyone who LURVES her more popular work will give this movie a look.
B00EH0K9H8|5.0|I feel bad for those who have had problems with this disk because it is an awesome live performance!  It sounds better than the album to me and shows the incredible talents of the artists. LOVE THIS!
B00E9HML1Q|1.0|What happened to releasing the exclusive statue with the DVD?  Why is it that the statue only comes with the blue-ray versions of the extended?  This poor customer service by amazon since not everyone has a blue-ray player.  Here's 3 orders they will not be getting
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Interesting, engaging and very addictive.  A look at two different lifestyles in a culture most would never see.  Recommend the program.
0385349947|5.0|Every woman should read it! It is an amazing and inspiring book that brightened my horizon! It made me realise my strength!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Would crash all the time and drained the battery in one hour, Also had to reboot do to there app per Tablet support.
0803738412|3.0|This is a fairly wordy story for the boardbook formatting. My 3 year old doesn't love it and I generally have to be the one to select it for reading. Maybe he'll like it more as he gets older.
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book for my 11 year old daughter. She loved it.  She was sad to be done with it
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|I originally had my doubts that it wouldn't look right, but it actually looks really good!<br />I am really glad I sprung for the Blu ray edition of one of my favorite musicals!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great series cut short with only the one season! Glad that they made a movie (Serenity) to bring some closure, but still have a lot of questions about character back stories. If you like Sci-Fi, you'll like this series. And, with just the one season, you can get through it in a weekend!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It's great to see a show that surpasses its previous season as well as Homeland Season 2 did. Buy the DVD and then spend your weekend in, just like I did.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|Season 3 ...disc 3.  At the very end the disc stop and started a few times...Other wise the complete season was fine.
