1423165691|5.0|Received book from amazon very quickly as usual, cover is beautiful and classy. The sketches inside are printed on very high quality paper so it feels just like an actual original sketchbook! Has a full line up of Disney sketches, all the way from Steamboat Willy to Tangled and everything in between! Excellent purchase!
B008D36INE|1.0|don't care for it. I spent only minutes watching it and can't even remember much of it to the point where I didn't remembe ordering it.
B0085157B8|1.0|Horrible acting, could not get through 15 minutes of this movie, then watched something else. Would not recomend this to anyone.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|This movie had great action and special effects which were it's good qualities. However: when it came to the storyline and orginality it left alot to be desired.  Ridley Scott who also created the Alien and following sequels had a great idea and ran with it. But when it came to Promethesus there was no original plot. It was just another round of Aliens all over again. The Charachters were also the same. Even including the Android David. I kept hoping that I would be seeing something different. It had pretty much the same twist as Aliens. Even down to the Alien creatures bursting out of thier hosts. BORING . This has been done before. I was left being very disapointed, after hearing all the hype about how great this movie was. It was not what I was expecting. Don't buy the DVD if you are expecting something different. You will only be sorely disapointed.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is truly addictive.  I can literally play it for hours...if I didn't have young ones at home :)
0385349947|4.0|This book came to my hands at a perfect time: I am heading down to my very first internship this summer. I am glad to have read it and got an overview of what awaits for me. It was an easy read and very straightforward. It made me emotional at times, also made laugh out loud at times.
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|I didn't like it at all.  I did not like the plot. It was very confusing. It was too gory
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This film is a masterpiece. It literally changed my life and my view of everything; from religion to God, to understanding how one can find God without religion and with religion I mean a structured congregation. When I finished watching Life of Pi it was as if an explosion occurred in my brain. I have watched numerous films in the past where all is great except the ending and I cringe in frustration but the ending of this film is genius. The words of adult Pi, especially, when referring to Richard Parker (the tiger) made me weep. This is and will forever be my all-time favorite film. PERFECTION!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I picked this book up before I heard about the movie and blazed through it.  Well written and captivating.  I only wish that the chapters were longer.  You would be getting into one of the many scenarios and bang it ends. Same thing with the next chapter until the end which made sense.  Good book affectionately worth the time.
B00CBXV96I|5.0|I love the set up, especially having read the books. This series will lead up to the point Jack realizes who Hannibal is, in the Red Dragon (well, shown in the movie). I guess I am losing it because I didn't really understand the first episode. Hopefully either my brain will get stronger or the writing will improve. Either way I am behind the series and will give it a big chance. I hope the network does too. It's going to take allot to sell this new Hannibal but the actor may pull it off. He needs to speak a little louder and MUCH clearer though; his accent is heavy enough that some of his words are difficult to hear/understand.<br />-edit: Here, at the end of the season, having watched each episode twice (I convinced my wife to watch it again with me), I am convinced that this is one of the best series TV has to present. It went, for me, from 3 stars for the first episode, to 5 stars for the series. I can hardly wait to see the next season!
B00003CXFV|5.0|I love this movie because it is a sotry of someone who worked against tremendous odds and made a success of herself by discovering the gifts she had and never realized. She might never have known the meaning of chutzpah, but she certainly knew how to use it. In the process she winds up revealing a huge, longstanding toxic dump that was poisoning the residents of a small California town. She eventually is able to produce the evidence that convicts the utility company and makes them pay nearly $400,000 to the victims.<br />The only problem with this edition of the movie--at least for me--was the constant use of foul language. The F-word is in every other sentence of Erin's at different points in the movie, and other words are liberally sprinkled about. If that bothers you, I know there is another version that eliminates a huge amount of those words without messing with the plot. During the time Erin was really working on this case, she, too, developed medical issues from being too close to the contamination, and she really wound up in the hospital. This was filmed but never used; however, you can find a version that includes those scenes, either in situ or as an appendix.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ahhhh... 50 shades of Grey. It seems like this book has been the subject of many reviews, both positive and negative in recent months. In fact, you can hardly ask anyone to recommend a book these days without having this particular trilogy brought up. And, being that I'm only human, I could only take the temptation for so long......<br /><br />Now as I get into my review of this book, there are a few things you need to know about me:<br /><br />1. I am a fan of the Twilight series. In fact, I read all four books in three days. So I was stoked to find out that 50 shades started out as a fanfiction of Twilight. I've read so many great stories over the years, that I was intrigued immediately. How much detail had she changed? Would the books beginnings be obvious? Unfortunately... reading this book reminded me too much of Twilight. Like Ms.James was trying too hard to be Stephanie Meyers. For example, her main character Anastasia \\"Ana\\" Steele, called herself \\"one of the most uncoordinated people in Washington State\\". Which as we know, was a title Bella Swan also held. In Washington State nonetheless. At one point Christian Grey even says \\"I'm breaking all the rules now\\", which to me, was even more of a direct a reference to his humble, Twilight beginnings.Don't get me wrong, I'm all for fanfiction. I always have been. But should we really make someone a \\"best selling author\\" for characters she's taken from someone else and altered?<br /><br />2. I am not familiar with the dom/sub lifestyle. So reading this book was a real education for me. I'm not sure how much of it was taken from the actual lifestyle, but their interaction was enough for me to determine that its just not my cup of tea. And being that he was Ana's first sexual partner, I somehow can't see her just going along with some of the things she went along with just to please Christian.<br /><br />I felt that there was a definite lack of character development. There was so much untapped potential for Ana and Christian to take on more of their own personality. To go less from their twilight \\"inspiration\\" and become more their own people, their own characters. The sex scenes took away from the plot instead of adding to it. Yes, I understand this is an \\"Erotic\\" novel, but I stand firm in my belief that not only were there too many scenes of a sexual nature, they were laughable. Too many \\"Oh\\" and \\"Ah\\" for my tastes. Although, and maybe this should go under \\"positive\\", Christian Grey has some amazing stamina.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" musings. Where at first they seemed like pointless thoughts to add to the word count, they became downright amusing at times.<br /><br />All in all.... parts of this book flowed smoothly, and were enjoyable, and parts of it were incredibly hard to get through. I did enjoy the ending, probably one of the only times Ana shows any kind of backbone at all. It also left the series open to hopefully be better!<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I received an advanced copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. This has not reflected on my review in any way.ristian to take on more of their own personality.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|love love love it and it is great and the price is great and I was thrilled to get it watched it right away  all I expected from the series
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I had to watch it somewhere else. I couldn't figure out how to get it to work on my laptop.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I think the maker of this movie have done an outstanding job. Unfortunatly could not finish watching it, but I surely will this weekend.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|so glad to be able to find this book from you  you always have everything I am looking for thank you ooo much enjoyed it immensely
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books held my interest from the first word written. I hope there is a book four written just like 1-3
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Watch it when you have a day to gorge yourself on the whole season. One episode at a time is just not enough.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have a Zenith DVD player that was bought as part of a home theater set.  I had problems with the DVD stopping and starting.<br />I figured that it could be the age of the player so I tried my laptop and the worked like a charm.  I just need to get a new DVD player.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|IT IS THE USUAL HIGH QUALITY  YOU EXPECT FROM A LORD OF THE RINGS PRODUCTION. I REALLY DO LIKE THAT SERIES.
B005LAII08|5.0|I can't say much about this purchase since I bought it for my granddaughter (haven't heard any complaints but I haven't asked if they have watched it yet) but we did see it in the theater and enjoyed it.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I'm not a bond fan, first of all. I know. Blasphemy etc. But I find them to be incredibly one dimensional and quite honestly, boring. Husband and I watched this and while it was filled with action etc, I felt that there were weird gaps that left me pretty bored. And although I love javier bardem, I was pretty grossed out by that blonde hair, which I guess means they did their job right, but whatever. Oh, and how M allowed that old fool to use a light while escaping. Wtf. Anyway, all in all it was okay, not something I'd really watch twice, but it was okay. I was more impressed with the scenes from the opening credits while that Adele song was playing than the movie itself!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book. I love the chemistry between the two characters. The author couldn't have created two people more right for each other!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|just watch it. Seriously. Just watch it. You will not regret doing so. I promise. And if you do, I'm not sure what to say to you.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series!!!!!!! Have all three seasons, waiting anxiously for season 4. Please be kind to Me Carson, don't want him to leave as Matthew did!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Omb love this game I'm the biggest fan ever I just love this game so much from your friends rj
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Really smart and engaging. Had no idea what it was about before I started--just went off a friend's recommendation. A wonderful surprise.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a great buy! The box set that it comes in is pretty snazzy and it just makes a great addition to my bluray collection<br />:D
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I've been a fan of Justin since his N'SYNC days. This album is INCREDIBLE! If you love real R&B, you're going to love this album. It's even great for the older generations to listen to! Best part is, he's coming out with the other half of the \\"20/20 Experience\\" later this year. I can't wait to hear it!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It does what is needed :) I honestly have no issues with it. I am just glad it does not mess up.
1476733953|5.0|I picked up Wool completely on a whim at a local Target, and I almost finished it in one sitting.  This fiction is a little light on the science side, but the characters are well drawn and the mystery plays out at a breakneck pace.  I don't normally condone jumping on a bandwagon, as Wool has become something of an indie sensation, but this one is worth the hype and well worth your time!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Thomas, a boy seemingly normal as any other boy wakes up in a box. Then he sees a light and soon ends up in the Glade greeted by other young boys his age. Something about the Glade feels familiar, but he doesn't know why. Things get weirder when a girl shows up to the Glade. Since the beginning there has never been a girl present in the glade. Everything in the glade ran smoothly until these new kids showed up; now strange things are beginning to happen. Thomas is determined to help the boys escape, but at what cost?<br /><br />The reason why I love this book is because it is a fast read, as are most YA novels, but this book isn't constantly action after action. Even with my ADD I was able to hunker down and enjoy the story. I wouldn't describe this book as \\"coming of age\\" since most of the characters are already of an adult maturity level, but I would still compare the book to \\"Lord of the Flies.\\" In both books a group of boys are left with tasks that would otherwise not be left for children. In the e-stores \\"The Maze Runner\\" is a book that comes up \\"you may also like,\\" or \\"others also bought,\\" etc for \\"The Hunger Games.\\" While wildly different the idea of a child overturning a large corporation is a reoccurring theme with these books.
B004HD61KE|4.0|There was so much information to assimilate that I found it quite confusing and had to re read so it took a long time before I could finish the book. It is mind blowing and quite interesting though. The world is a scary place to be in right now. I wonder when that volcano is going to erupt.
B004SDEP38|3.0|First, why is it necessary to have two apps downloaded to my device? The main app then the key. This doesn't do anything more than free versions. Good thing I got this one for free. I wouldn't pay for it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just love colleen, she makes you feel every emotion of the characters. Then after she's made you laugh  then cry, she throws in a twist to leave you devastated, then brings you back to swell with love. This is such a good story of love and tragedy and then more love.
B00019074O|4.0|It is fun, it is light and it is still a great comedy movie all these years later. Goes to show flashy is not needed for a good laugh.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|This is a great book through and through. Wonderfully written.  Baseball may take a different direction in the future.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching baseball, I highly recommend this book.
0439023491|5.0|Rather morbid in some aspects, not for the faint of heart, or people who already think on doomsday terms. Couldn't share it with a few people who have over-active imaginations and can't shake the gruesome images. Good hero story and triumph over evil.
B001NLKS16|2.0|I gave it two stars because the Latin was completely overdone and I felt there could have been more anecdotes instead.
0439023513|5.0|Rather morbid in some aspects, not for the faint of heart, or people who already think on doomsday terms. Enjoyed this series and sharing my interest in it with my 9-year-old.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Got this film for a good price. It's a classic at Christmas time. I can't say much more than that.
0439023521|5.0|enjoyed the book, enjoyed the movie. Rather morbid in some aspects, not for the faint of heart, or people who already think on doomsday terms.
B00992CF6W|5.0|very addicting ... rarely freezes.  it is one of my best games for the kindle.  the only thing is that its very pricey.
034580404X|5.0|the first book was the best. The other two were good, but the happy ending was a little unbelievable. Still a good read, I can't wait for the movie adaptation.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a great product and it shipped fast and the price makes it a great bargain.<br />I'll purchase again from this company.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very interesting!  One of those books that is hard to put down!!  I'm ready for the second book - City of Ashes!
B005LAII4E|4.0|*SPOILER ALERT WITHIN THIS REVIEW...FYI!*<br /><br />My dad and I were both interested in seeing this movie because we enjoyed the first one, so I decided I would treat him to a viewing for his birthday.  We both really enjoyed the movie, it was action packed and a lot of fun! I enjoyed the movie overall, but my favorite of it was seeing what developed with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow.  I don't want to say too much on that account, just watch the movie for yourself.<br /><br />The actors all did a good job in the film, and it was a joy to see Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as General Colton.  I was glad to see Flint and Lady J in the film too, as I'd wondered why they were not included in the first film, though regardless, I did really enjoy the first film.  And as always, a joy to have Ray Park back as Snake Eyes and Lee Byung-hun as Storm Shadow.<br /><br />Now for the aspects of the film that I did not really care for, mainly involving the characters, or lack there of.  *SPOILER ALERTS* Firstly, although I know the director had or might have a purpose for it, I didn't like that they killed of Duke, especially considering he was a primary character in the cartoon series...just didn't sit well with me.  Secondly and primarily, what the heck happened to some of the characters from the first film?  I.e. Ripcord, Baroness, etc.  They all seemed fine and dandy at the end of the first movie?  Why did they just suddenly drop out of the picture, without us knowing what became of them?  I imagine that some of it had to do with the fact that they couldn't get some of the actors back to play the rolls again, but c'mon...give us something!  It was kind of annoying to me that they suddenly weren't involved in the 2nd movie, without even so much as an explaination on what become of them.  I don't know, maybe they'll make a return in the 3rd film, because you know they'll make a 3rd one, and then maybe we'll get some answers.  Growing up loving GI Joe and being a bit of a fan, this just kind of bugs me.<br /><br />All that aside though, with that exception, the movie is awesome and action packed and should suffice most action movie fanatics, whether you grew up with GI Joe or just a big time action movie fan, which I am both.  Check it out, but decide for yourselves whether to pay to see it while it's still in the theater, or to buy it or just rent it down the road.it of a fan, this just kind of bugs me.<br /><br />All that aside though, with that exception, the movie is awesome and action packed and should suffice most action movie fanatics, whether you grew up with GI Joe or just a big time action movie fan, which I am both.

B003Y74KCK|3.0|I bought this for my husbands phone, but didn't realize it was an all rubber casing. Usually the sillicone casing has hard corners and a soft back, more like the otterbox cases, but this one is all rubber.  He is really rough on his phones, but only paying $1.15 (and no shipping) was a good deal, considering in-store we would have paid close to $20 around here.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Purchased after album after hearing a song on 96.5 the Buzz in Kansas City. Can't wait to see what his next album is like.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Absolutely worth the money. If you're a fan of the percy jackson series you'll love this. Fun book by the way.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I'm a big Passion Pit fan and looked forward to this is an AMAZING album. If you get a chance go see them live!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|GET THIS!!!!!!!! I think it is a epicosoty game so ya... I have to have 20 characters!?! Ok ladydoodyladeda ladydoodyladeda
B003YQ1QUA|3.0|My first experience with Esperanza was on the Grammy's. This is a good album. I purchased it because of the reduced price. I'll listen again, but it's not at the top of my Jazz album list.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I love this cd.<br />It's like sitting down with good friends and sharing an entertaining, music-filled evening.<br />The chemistry between the performers is fantastic.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I love being able to highlight, add text, and save any edits I do to any PDF. It works great!
1401307957|5.0|While this book was not what I expected, it touched my heart.  I did not realize before reading Danny Gregory's book, the tragedy that had befallen his family.  I was touched by the way that he handled his new life and how his art guided him through the darkest times.  It gave me a new way to look at the everyday items in the house and around the neighborhood.  I have read other Danny Gregory books, but particularly enjoyed this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The Kindle Fire is my 8yr olds and she loves the Temple Run games. She has both of them and plays them on a regular basis. Great games!
B002UEW31I|4.0|Not great resolution. Doesn't look like HD to me. If I could, I'd give extremely low ratings to Amazon for not letting me either download to my Mac, or let me watch on Apple TV.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I always look for movies or books relating to this period of time.  After completing one episode, I could hardly wait for the next one.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in the 1800s and early 1900s.
B00AO686MY|5.0|This is one of the top three movies from my childhood in the 1980s.  Great animation and unique story that never gets old!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Works as advertised, saves your micro slot from unneeded strain - I broke two micro charge cables in the dark while waiting for my pogo to arrive.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a compelling story!  As a parent of a soon-to-be teenager, I found myself worrying destressedly right along with the parents in this book.  This all seemed so plausible, it was both easy and painful to imagine myself a character.  Great writing, amazing ending.  A terrific entertainment book - this would be a great one to bring on vacation with you.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I loved the book!  I've always wanted to be a fly on the wall to get an understanding of a VP of IT's challenges both up to the Execs and within their teams.<br /><br />I haven't read \\"The Goal\\" yet but this quick-paced novel got me thinking in a different way about WIP, bottlenecks, dev challenges for turning out code and keeping up with the challenges of people asking for favors that can screw up company priorities.  We all have our own agendas but having a bigger picture of what a company is trying to accomplish and how each of our efforts impact success can be pretty complicated without strong communication and simplified rules of engagement.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it would not let me search any videos. i also hated it because you cant do anything but watch the videos they recommended
0399536108|4.0|If you've ever asked any of the following questions, you should read this book.<br /><br />Why do most people have to have a \\"job\\"?<br />Why do most jobs require you to work 40 hours a week?<br />Why does everyone have to go to college?<br />Why is work deemed more important than spending time with family and friends?<br />Is there a different way to work and be happy?<br /><br />This is the story of how one guy created the work and life of his dreams. It's an enjoyable book: thought-provoking, easy to read and quite inspiring. If you are hoping this book will be a step-by-step primer for how you can change your own life and career, I think you will be disappointed. But if you are reading it to expand your mind, inspire yourself, and think outside of the box, then I think you will like it. For me, the book was worth picking up just for the section on \\"A Second Look at Conventional Assumptions\\" on pages 73-74.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i really love this game because it is really really really really addicting and proabably the most funnest game i have ever played!!!
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I've been on the diet five weeks and have lost 11 pounds.  Fasting for two days is easy when you know you get to eat what you want the other five days.
B0085OELXK|4.0|The plot was interesting, the characters were intriguing & well acted. Stood the test of time well. Went on a bit long, and some loose ends brought out the skeptic in me. Overall a very good film.
B000OVLINI|4.0|One of my most favorite books.  Once you get pulled into the story you're hooked.  Looking for a summer read?  Try this book.
6305128952|4.0|Really like this movie. Can't pin down why I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars. Maybe the unnecessary romance feeling thrown in? Ay any rate, this is a comfort movie for me, meaning it feels safe and comfortable like being home. I don't have to watch it, just having it on in the background brings a sense of peace.
B001974DG0|4.0|Once I started I couldn't put the book down.  It is very bloody and sticks in your thoughts long after finishing the book.
B000VHVGM8|2.0|Anticipated watching a hilarious movie, was sadly disappointed. Maybe it's just so outdated, maybe it's just me. At any rate, unless you are a diehard fan of any of the stars I don't recommend wasting your time on this movie.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This is a great cd. I love all the tracks on it. I am a country music lover, but also like most other music. They have just a little more than country in their style, although clearly country roots! Love it!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|At first i didn't know what to make of the story but as i read on i couldn't put it down and then<br />got the whole story line. Never would have guessed the ending.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|It's not labeled explicit, but listen to the lyrics and you won't want your underage kids singing along! If you have it- then listen closely- otherwise look up the lyrics on the web. Catchy beats, some almost remind me of Michael Jackson- but that's part of the problem- the \\"sound\\"-- If you don't pay attention, you won't \\"hear\\". Yeah, the kids will think it's great, but if you're the responsible parent- you won't want it around.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I don't really like it too much. You don't progress very much. It is very slow and takes a lot of time. Of course, as an adult it is very time consuming, but would be great for little girls. I don't have a daughter so I wouldn't really know, only a little boy.
B008BRC7BE|4.0|The two new songs are awesome, which I already had from buying the original release.  I was under the impression there was a whole new album of material here, it is not.  Great stuff, and I am a collector, so I have most of this material, if you do not, it is worth the purchase!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I love this app. Its just like playing Mario Bros, but when you get stuck its hard to get the controls to work right on my kindle fire. I would still recommend it.
B001Y8WAKA|5.0|Great classic SAXON ALBUM, one of their best with bonus material!  I was unaware there was a remaster version, I got it as soon as I found it  This is a must for Saxon Fans and metal fans everywhere.  without Saxon there would not a lot of bands of today.  Saxon was on the fore-front of the NWOBHM!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|You really build your own Jurassic Park. It is so much like the movie. I love it and would recommend it.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I love my &#34;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&#34; complete season one DVD set. I have seen the series when it aired and having enjoyed it so much, now I have the set to enjoy it whenever and whereever I like! The packing is excelent and saves space in my video library (same size case as a single DVD!) and it arrived fast and in excellent condition.<br /><br />I really like the quality animation; It shows that a lot of hard work was put into this series. I see this on my home theater on a big screen and in 5.1 Dolby Digital and it feels epic. I truely like how they used the original sound effects from the movies in the series!<br /><br />I recommened this set to any Star Wars fan that treasures this great saga since I have from the first time I saw &#34;A Hew Hope&#34; as a kid and has been hooked on this universe ever since!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I'm not much of a twitter fan is the only reason I give it 3 stars. I prefer facebook but its great for those twitter addicts!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book kept me on my toes all the time. It was easy to read, yet the subject was engaging.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook and this app is handy when you are away from a computer but still want to check your Facebook! Totally recommend it.
B007L24T52|5.0|If you like reading David Baldacci books, reading this book is a must.<br />Am eagerly waiting for next one with the same character
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a lot of fun but you never have enough space to put all the animals you rescue, and it takes forever to raise the money to pay for each expansion. The expansions get more expensive the more you expand. I would still recommend for those to try it at least.
B005I3PAUO|5.0|Great action packed fast paced reading. Perfect for my Easter vacation. Could not put it down.<br />A bit disappointing in the end.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app. I use my kindle fire as my alarm clock with this app. It is very handy and always wakes me up. I love it.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Great book. Have not any other books by this author. Liked the setting and the suspense<br />Recommended if you like reading all sorts of book
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's always great to have your weather wherever you are. Especially when you have all that bad weather that usually comes with spring!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love this app! it's slow increase in volume and great sound selection are amazing. it's 100% reliable and great if you get up at differeng times on different days. lots of customizable options.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|This was such a great find and the price may have been the bargain of the year. The choice of songs is wonderful and her renditions are incomparable. Such a shame her early passing removed such a talent so early in life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game to me was an interesting challenge but fun in itself, I thoroughly enjoyed playing it to the fullest extent
0143119680|5.0|This series &#34;All Souls Trilogy' is the best I've read,ever. There are others I love,but this one is it for me..not sure how much longer I can wait for the third and final installment.Well written,exciting,moving and touching,the story of a woman and a man who literally cross time for each other and with each other to free her from a deadly future by unraveling a mystery which took shape centuries before.The best mystery story ever,best love story ever,and best paranormal mystery/romance fantasy story-ever!If you haven't read it yet,do.This is a story I will read again and again,it's that good.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very cute story and more believable than most harlequin romances.  Characters are human and not generic.  Very good book for a quick read.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Have really enjoyed the quickie  characters and the not to far out scenarios of the show. Reminds me of Twilight Zone
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is very addictive.Fortunately, you can play while watching TV or any activity that doesn't require your full attention. Highly recommended.DR
1401308201|5.0|This was bought for me on my account as a present.  So don't know much about the shipping or time line or anything.  But I love the book.  It's awesome and so is Wicked!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is the best app ever!!! I know all the characters. Get it!!!! I am very picky about the apps I get, but I love this app so much. I &lt;3 MLP!!!!
B0025KW29U|5.0|Heard some of the music on pandora and I love Neil Patrick Harris so I bought it.  Love the music, good price.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was an amazing person, and I think the American public is very lucky that he put together this account of his accomplishments.  I found his attitude of &#34;no matter what, we'll get it done, no worries&#34; to be inspiring.  Over and over he tells of moments in combat where any normal person would sit down and try to catch their breath, but not Chief Kyle, he is up and running across the street to help the next group of marines fight their way down the block.  R.I.P. Chief Kyle, you are a testament to what can be accomplished by simply never giving up.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|love being able to get the new releases as soon as they can with the assurence of the lowes price possible,  Keep up the good work.
B005IQZB14|1.0|Despicable person, no common sense or moral compass.  She is not a good model for dealing with misfortune or grief.
0061733199|5.0|This book is perfect to put into your B.O.B. It has pretty much everything you need to know if you have to bug out. It has everything from how to make proper shelter to visuals of plants you can eat and not eat. It really is just a lot of great information that everyone should want and needs to know.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's not that it's a bad game it's just that if u plan on buying this app on a kindle fire than it WILL glitch up and change the way u move and break blocks that your not even trying to break and some blocks break when their behind u so. u know u didn't break it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This isn't what I expected at all but it was very good.  There are lots of historical aspects to the movie.  I'm a native Virginian and I found it entertaining and very interesting.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|my daughter loves anything twilight so she really enjoyed it and will listen to it over and over lots of times
B00947N6D8|3.0|This was sent to UK as an Easter present, unfortunately, it will not play on their machine!I cannot there for review it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My two daughters (ages 11 & 12) loved this book. Many other Moms have also told me their children (boys & girls) loved it, too. I highly<br />Recommend it!
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Every song is well-produced and it shows different feelings and emotions.<br />I love this album and its presentation, photos and design.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|This is a good game but it copied gta just like the other gameloft games copied other games like real soccer copied fifa and asfalt7 copied real racing. Most of gamelofts games copied ea sports gamester. Gameloft is a copy cat game company
B0060MYKTY|5.0|This is a very fun show. I have no idea how historically accurate it is but if you miss the Tudors, try this show. It has sex, violence, costumes, great actors (and maybe a little over-acting at times but that's okay) and gorgeousness. And did I mention sex and violence?
B000HC2PCM|5.0|Just classic Merle Haggard.  Had many of my favorite Haggard songs. The key question is:  Knowing what I now know, would I buy it again?  Short answer:  YES!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I enjoy reading  Nicholas Sparks.  He makes you want to keep turning the pages for a tear jerking read.  Nice
B00B2G4O2G|2.0|I don't know but I just found the whole concept too preposterous and superficial in its depiction of violence and suspense. It just seems like it wants to shock you because it has to compete with other cable shows that are much more successful in their execution of similar edgy material. I'm not feeling the hero or the villain in this setup. Way too contrived for my tastes.
0062082353|4.0|I purchased this book after Chris was killed as I wanted to know more about him.  I also hope that the purchase of his book<br />will help his family.  Chris Kyle is a true AMERICAN HERO !
B0094M2S5A|5.0|Just about everything in this movie is good.  Great writing, acting and direction.  Excellent music selections...at least for us baby boomers.  Perfect shooting location for nostalgic boomers to appreciate.  Use of the video recorder by the players was an inspired device for background stories.  I could have done without the drugs, although they were a component of the character played by William Hurt.<br /><br />Note on IMDB, this movie gets 7.1/10.  I'll bet if you separated the ratings by viewer age, you'd see boomers give it 9/10 and Gen X give it 5.  Interesting that if you look up Kevin Costner's movies, you see The Big Chill listed, even though his part as Alex was shot as flashback scenes but completely eliminated from the final cut of the movie--in my opinion, a good decision, although maybe not so great for Costner at the time.
B000IAZ5HK|5.0|Initially I was concerned on how difficult or easy the cap on the stopper would come off, but it stays put and does not need to be yanked off.  The nozzle can pour rather quickly for standard dressings, but is wide enough to handle a crumbles of roquefort, herbs, or small seeds to come through.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|great movie it works perfectly and its a great gift to anyone.... loved itt and very cheap. :-D ,MAAA THANKS
B004I744AS|5.0|Yes, it is good and I can't imagine how I got along without it.  It is just what I needed to complete my apps.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A fantastic and futuristic look at a world where the 80s are an integral part of life.  With the continual gamification of society, a must-read!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Yes I love to play the game and it is very mind challenging.  I would recommend it to my friends and family.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|You won't regret watching this movie.  If you are a lawyer, you will remember why you went to law school in the first place.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was reluctant to jump on the fifty shades band wagon and buy this book but I'm glad I did. It was much better than I expected. It was a quick read. I've started book two. Not finished yet but also good so far.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Waste of money.  Waste of time.  If I were the author I would buy them all and burn them.  Please don't buy this book you have better things to do than read about dreamed up crazies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved that I was able to watch the episode I missed the next day. I had set my DVR to record and it only caught the ending. I was upset until my brother told me I could buy it on Amazon. You can't go wrong when it comes to watching the Walking Dead.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I like how you do missions. also how each level you get now things. last to have to clear trees to unlock now amber's.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|THIS IS EXCELLENT THANK YOU SOV MUCH, MY FATHER IN LAW HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THS A LONG TIME GREAT PRICE. THIS CAME BEFORE ESTIMATED DATE, EXCELLENT CONDITION. WELL WRAPPED. WOULD BUY FROM YOU AGAIN THANKS
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy the challenges and different modes of play in the rooms. It's a great game if you're patient enough. I love the quirky snatchins too.
B0060FXBNM|3.0|Product came and it was just three disc's that was it. Also the box it came in is very boring and mine had the corners dented in. Not sure if this was the seller or the delivery company. If you just want all three movies with nothing else then this is a decent buy.
B0026772N8|4.0|This was a very heavy book for me to read but I got through it and I actually learned a lot from it. Highly recommend this book.
B007REV4YI|5.0|THE BEST ONE THEY'VE MADE YET. ACTION FROM BEGINNING TO THE END. CAN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE ON BLUE RAY.
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|Clearly, this movie was just thrown together to put some otherwise non-busy actors to work, however, they forgot to pay for writers for a story line.  I just heard they're planning on making a third movie, I hope they have more consideration for the viewing public who were clearly overlooked when they made the Expendables 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really cool game and I got it for my 9 year old and she loves this app. This app is tun for not only kids but for adults too.
B001H1UQZU|5.0|&#34;Boys Don't Cry&#34; is the adapted true story about a young man, Brandon Teena, and his struggle to find himself. This movie is a must see for those interested in LGBT history, hate crimes, transgender issues, and want to see an excellent movie. I highly recommend it, but beware there are very difficult scenes of violence, sexual assault, and brutality.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Just got started with this set. Decided to start in the middle, and will have to get to all of them soon.<br />I'm perfectly fine with the fact that these are all supposed to be the theatrical versions. I like some of the little changes on the previous home releases of these movies, but it's kind of nice to see them make these available in their \\"original\\" form. I'm sure that if they didn't, some would surely complain, and it'd be kind of sad.<br />Think about it - the real original Star Wars movies (4-6) are only available on a badly transferred, letterboxed-inside-4:3-Standard-def-DVD, as a bonus disc, on out of print DVDs (circa 2006, which, I do own).<br /><br />These Star Trek movies are high quality, high definition transfers of 6 classic movies, as they were, \\"warts and all,\\" and I'm fine with that. Maybe someday, they'll put out a set with \\"directors cuts\\" etc, and sure, I do see the point some have made about \\"why couldn't they have just done seamless branching\\" - but - this is still really nice to have the best qualtiy copies of these movies, using as much of a disc as they can, even with a few extras on each one.<br /><br />Nice set. Well done. Not overdone. Nice simple menus, though I don't understand the promo for the 11th movie on these in the beginning. It's a box set. If anything, they should've put that on the bonus disc, as a bonus trailer or something. No reason for it to be on the main discs. Kind of cheesy. Kind of lame. It's not like most fans haven't heard of this, or wouldn't go see it. Then again, I suppose it doesn't really hurt anything. I do have an individual blu-ray of IV, so I'll have to see if it's also on that too. At least it's not taking up too much space.<br /><br />Transfer seems nice on III so far. I'm sure the others also look great. Pretty cool to have a good box set of all of these on blu-ray.<br /><br />Checked one extra on III before starting the movie, and it was really cool to see and hear the stories from some of the folks who worked on these movies. Digital effects are neat at times, sure, but these guys really made some great things happen with the tech they had to work with.<br />Real models and effects are still great. No matter how great computer graphics get, and no matter how cool some of it really is, the capture of something really tactile and really reacting is ...well... more real... These folks also have another great point - they had a lot of fun doing a lot of this work, and I can really respect the work they did to bring us their efforts.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good set. If you already have a DVD set, it might not interest you that much. If you don't care about the theatrical versions, it might not matter to you. To me, it just seemed like a fair deal to finally get this collection, and as a long time fan, I am not in the least bit disappointed. I am quite happy to have this set, and to be able to enjoy these classic films once again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love almost everything about this series.  The costuming, the manor, the great writing and characterizations.  It is wonderful and I am looking forward to next year.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was very well written.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat and is really hard to put down...
B006MW3V6U|1.0|Product would not stream properly, even with technical assistance.  My experience has made me question whether I would try this service again.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|The writers sure like to drag things out.<br /><br />A bunch of standing around talking, trying to make these super serious decisions all the time, except nothing happens.  And also none of the characters are interesting.<br /><br />It's not a very good show.  It started off well, but it looks like it's taking a nosedive.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This is a great story about being yourself and the love and specialness in each of us.  These are two young people who will survive and thrive.
B00B1CGDTS|1.0|First of all, this review is about the quality of the blu-ray, not of the movie itself. I love the movie, and it's always been one of my favorites. I was excited that it was being released on blu-ray. Now the bad news. Olive Films' blu-ray of McLintock is just terrible! What a waste of money! The only thing it has going for it is that it's sharper than the DVD version, but that's all I can say positive. And that's not necessarily a good thing, because when the source material is bad to start with, a clearer picture only magnifies the defects. I compared the blu-ray picture quality to the DVD presentation (the authentic collector's edition released by Paramount), and I have to sadly say that, in terms of color balance, light levels and black levels, the DVD version is a better presentation. The color-balance and black levels on Olive Film's blu-ray is all over the place from scene to scene. From shot to shot it changes. Scratches, film defects are not cleaned up. The quality is so poor, it's distracting to watch. I couldn't relax and enjoy the movie because of how unpredictable the quality was from scene to scene. Some scenes the film color really looks faded and aged. I'm just trying to warn anyone thinking of buying this blu-ray. Save your hard-earned money and enjoy your old DVD. Maybe some day a full restoration will be done to this film.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This was a fascinating read.  As i was reading it, I kept telling my friends, &#34;Did you know....&#34;.  They all ended up reading it in the end with the same fascination.
0425252868|5.0|&#34;A Higher Call&#34; is an incredibly wonderful story that humanizes everyone involved - in particular the German fighters. It's truly amazing that the German pilot had the presence of mind and the kindness for another human being  - &#34;the enemy.&#34; Thanks to him, several men went on to marry have children and lead productive lives. What's even more incredible is the fact that these two men would later in life get in touch and become such good friends. It's a wonderful story of human decency. I've had several people ask me about while I've been reading and I've encouraged them to get a copy. Several have. Thank you so very much for sharing this incredible story of such Christ like love!
B00C94JRWW|5.0|This is a show I have been waiting for, for a VERY long time. It is almost unbelievable how long it took to find a production interested enough in the Norse ancestry to make a full series from, and not just a 2h movie -- even the latter can be difficult to find sometimes, despite the Old Germanic obsession that a majority of people have. All things in their good time, seems to be the answer; because WITHOUT doubt, this show was worth the wait.<br />There are some ceremonial rites I think possibly conjectural -- but its a TV SHOW and anyone trying to bogg it down with negativity on such a note should be ignored; even that said, the majority of ritual acivities do seem legitimate (as well as can be known, at least). Being a scholar of Old Germanic and Scandinavian studies myself, I have overall found this show quite satisfying; pulling back the curtain on the Nordic beliefs (i.e., the Scandinavian's belief in the Aesir and such; Oðin,Þorr,Frey, Freya, etc) is possibly the best aspect of this show; and it is portrayed authentically, one could be fooled into thinking the actors themselves are \\"Asatruar\\" (as one would say today). The character of the monk, Aþelstan, is also a great idea, and I am very happy that the Anglo-Saxon world is being actively incorporated into the plot and story and script; the addition of actual Anglo-Saxon dialogue was an awe-striking surprise, followed by Old Norse. Truly great writers here on this show.<br /><br />The show is very, very good, and as I said above, is satisfying in quite a few ways. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Heilsa!
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Love the way this is organized in really short chapters, each focused on a concept and explained with examples. Would recommend this to anyone wanting to start a business or turn around one.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I am happy to know that my sight is secure. In today's world it seems very unsafe at times with all of the mental health issues and major decline in human values. Thanks
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game.  Easy to understand. Lots of options for playing. I would recommend this to friends if they like horses . Or animals.
B00005AWMF|5.0|some greatest hits cd's don't really give you a start to finish lineup of great songs.. sade does.  highly recommeded
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is a very addictive game. The controls and strategy is easy to understand. I would recommend any body to download.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game(subway surfers). I enjoy playing it a lot. I would advise people to buy this game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm having a good time with this app-- it's better than playing solitaire! Nice to see what other people pin.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I love this book so much! I will definitely give this one five stars!! Would recommend to anyone, to read by yourself or as a read-aloud.
B004I744AS|5.0|Very easy to use and I like the articles of the day which give fun facts.  The word match and other games are my favorite.  I recommend this app for anyone who wants to increase their vocabulary.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|this app is very good for anyone who loves to play piano and its very easy to flow the keys on the different songs that comes with the app i love playing the harry potter theme on it and the app is very user friendly and a very fun app  its just a great app for  people who like to play
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A lot of fun, simple and Great game for the kids  as well as myself we all enjoy it a lot
B004GFN11A|5.0|this app is great for anyone who has a wordpress blog on the site it self. this app is one of the best i have downloaded even though it was on a different item. its easy to use and it is very user friendly
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I remember playing this on my first PC. Always a good time infecting the world with diseases, especially the Itis. :-)
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|The original Die Hard is a classic for a reason.  We were introduced to a man who was forced into the role of a hero.  Yes, he was a hero, but first he was just a man.  We saw him fight through his fear and his pain.<br /><br />The terminator in A Good Day to Die Hard might have the same name as the man in Die Hard, but it is not the same character.  This terminator doesn't get hurt and doesn't feel fear.  It is no longer a man, it is a machine.<br /><br />If this film was called anything but \\"Die Hard\\" I might have given it an extra star, but it wants to be in the same series as Die Hard, so it gets compared to Die Hard.  This film comes up lacking in every way.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|It was not working properly. It wouldn't load all the tweets and was very buggy. I uninstalled it and got Scope instead.
8866130907|5.0|I got this planner for my son to replace the cumbersome 8.5&#34;x11&#34; agenda provided by the school.  Each 2-page spread has space on the left to write each day's assignments (also Saturday and Sunday, of course), and a lined page on the right for notes.  The note space has been especially helpful by delineating area for notes on assignment details, upcoming events and reminders for long-term projects.  And it fits in his back pocket!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I got this app so I could have the Bible with me without lugging my paper copy around. This is great for a quick inspirational passage or guidance in tough times.
0061452068|5.0|Chapter 1 opens with the following quote from Thomas Barrington Macaulay. On what principle is it, that when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?<br /><br />Matt Ridley then proceeds with wit, intelligence and a broad sweep of research to show that there have always been people who will tell us that the end is nigh, The plague, Y2K, Peak Oil, the ozone, AIDS, H5N1 etc., etc., etc., and yet not only have we survived but we enjoy a standard of living that even King Louis the XVI would have envied.<br /><br />Matt Ridley makes the point that while we face many issues there is no reason to believe that our lives won’t improve. The history of humans is one of improving quantity and quality of life primarily because we share ideas and trade.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough as an antidote to the endless stream of pessimism served up by our sensation seeking media and the media’s audience… US!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|The Blu-Ray and DVD bundle is great and enhances the movie experience at home! The toys that came along with it was a cute addition too and perfect for Easter.
1400064287|5.0|This book is a must for any one who is keen to communicate an idea and wants the idea to be remembered. I have read many books on presentation skills and story telling in my time and this would easily be one of the best. Chip and Dan Heath, show the science behind stories and ideas that stick. If you want to get your message across … read this first!”
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this show starts off slowly, but pulls you into the storyline.  A show both I and my wife enjoy. That is not a common thing. :-)
0385528752|5.0|The brothers Heath have done it again. Another highly readable book on how to help people make a change. The book is packed full of anecdotes, case studies and examples of organisations and the individuals who have shifted them to the next level. These stories are structured into a very neat series of principles â\\" Direct the Rider (How to provide direction and competence), Motivate the Elephant (How to increase commitment) and Shape the Path (How to shape the environment). All three things together do not guarantee that change will take place but together they provide an easy to understand change checklist. This means the ideas in the book are easily translatable to a wide variety of circumstances. Good Stuff!
B001DJLD1M|5.0|i have been a long time fan of the matrix series and finally go the whole collection on dvd , very happy !!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and did not want it to end. It was beautifully written. Its author cleverly wove the Victorian meanings of flowers into a story about a girl who lived in numerous foster homes, and had difficulty expressing her feelings.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|We have spent evening after evening watching Alfred Hitchcock movies.  Every movie is a thriller and several have been chillers.  This disc is a keeper...we will rewatch from time to time.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I like it. It is a bit heavy, but I don't have to worry if it gets dropped. Nothing could hurt the Kindle inside of this strong case.
B009AMANH4|3.0|This is a good movie to show me how much I have forgotten. A bit of background history study would have helped me enjoy the move more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun fun fun fun fun fun fun funding n n n n n n n n n n n n links correspond its fun not just nodding get this game no joke
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I saw this movie in theatres and could not have been happier to get it for a birthday present right after it came out! It is not by any means a movie of the musical but stands on its own as a very well done movie--very pleased with the changes that were made, which make it a better movie.
B001C1066E|5.0|For the amount of money I payed, is totally worth it, I saw ppl complaining about the size of the mouth (inside), yet I don't see a kid holding way too much cash to need more space, and therefore I see it perfect.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is pretty fun and very addictive!! it's User friendly as well! I like that it tells you what tasks to do in order to move to the next level. it doesn't just keep you hanging
B009A882D0|5.0|You will definitely enjoy this music. I had never heard of them; hard to believe right. I new the music though just not the group. Now I know both.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|It is very fast for a dual core, and it ran on the first post with no problems. The snap in process of the heat sink was kind of annoying. It took 10 to 15 minutes to get two of the locks to snap in. I am familiar with these Intel heat sinks, but they just did not want to cooperate. It took a great amount of force for them to finally stay in (yes they were unlocked). I was actually concerned about having physically damaged the processor but thankfully it's ok.<br /><br />I got used to using quadcores, the last was a q9550, and it was definitely a stronger performer than this new dual core. It depends on what someone does, for gaming or video editing I would definitely recommend more cores. Or just expect it will be slower. Some claim dual cores are better for gaming, but that's just something a person just tells themselves (and their online friends) when they buy a dual core. It will do the job for now. It is still an Intel and have a great amount of respect for their products, but plan to upgrade in a few months.
0345803507|5.0|Great!  I loved the books and how they kept you interested in what was going on at all times.  Wonderful!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Loved this book, it took a different perspective on the old Zombie take that we see on many shows.  I enjoyed the different points of view from all places in the world.  If you are looking for something out of the ordinary then this is the book to read.
0345803493|5.0|Great!  I loved the books and how they kept you interested in what was going on at all times.  Wonderful!
B000C65Z1G|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and received it in very good condition.I have passed it on to my son to watch.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Back story and the story being told by each side of a tragic event is not always what it seems.  Interesting though provoking.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|After watching some of the Clone Wars (season 5) on U-Tube I decided to get the Clone Wars movie and seasons 1-5. I enjoyed the first season. The plots were good, the battle scenes were outstanding, and absolutely loved the sound track and music. The animation can be divided in two parts. The first half of the season I would have to get the character animation 3 stars. The nonhuman characters were fine (except for Binks), but the human ones had that frozen look and looked more like the Thunderbird TV show. However as the season progressed, I was seeing the skills of the animators growing, with better emotional expressions from the human characters, which would merit a 4 star rating. That's not surprising to see that progression. When I look back on the Star Trek the Next Generation, you compare season 1 to let's say season 4 you do notices a upgrade in production quality. From what I hear from the following seasons of the Clone Wars the trend of improvement of the animation can be seen and I am looking forward to watching them. One of the things that I really enjoyed is being introduced to new characters from the Jedi Order. I thought it was a good start to the series and the good far outweighs the negative.
B007JGAR6U|5.0|I had a GN50 flash that took four AAs for my Olympus Pen E-P1 (the Promaster 7500EDF) and I was a little concerned that I'd be disappointed with the EF-X20.  It doesn't bounce, uses AAAs, and I feared it might have the same chintzy build quality and weak output as the EF-20 (aka Sunpak RD2000).  But that's not the case.<br /><br />It has a metal shell with a rubberized plastic underbelly, and it oozes quality.  Like the X-series cameras it's made in Japan (presumably by Fuji) and shares a satisfying clicky dial for both manual exposure and exposure compensation for TTL.  It also comes with a soft leatherette case.  An extremely compact stand with a plastic tripod thread comes with it for off-camera use.  While Fuji dosn't have a wireless control scheme for this purpose, having a stand and being able to literally dial in the output is both satisfying and useful for creative work.<br /><br />When it's actually on the camera, things are even better.  Fuji has been known for several years to use a very light touch with flash, and that extends to this unit as well.  Most often it will fire on very low power, just enough to fill in the shadows without making it look like a flash shot, and it doesn't visibly preflash.  The only time it will use full power is as a hail mary into the abyss -- I lit up a pond in a city park with it, as well as the buildings across the way.  Because it uses such lower power for the most part, it's not as slow as it ought to be, though I don't know how battery life will be til I've broken in the NiMHes I bought for the purpose.<br /><br />So far the only peculiarities I've noted:  The test button may fire at full power regardless of manual setting.  Not always, but sometimes -- don't know if it's firmware or a quirk of this particular unit.  And the slave setting is on the bottom of the unit, so if you forget to switch it properly, you have to remove the unit to set it right.  I'd have preferred a slide switch for the power, but I'll manage; atleast shutting the camera off will shut off the flash with it.<br /><br />For a flashgun I can hide in my fist, it's top notch, and produces lovely output that I could never coax out of the Promaster without bounce and a lot of fiddling.  Recommended.
B0034G4P80|5.0|The sets and costumes were absolutely stunning in this film. It also had all of the elements of a good comic book movie. The plot, characters (or cast),  and score were also strong and made this this a good movie. Marvel I think is doing a good job with the Avengers theme and of the ones that I have seen I may like Thor the best, however I have enjoyed all of them so far.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Will someone PLEASE explain to me how a film shot in regular flat-screen can be \\"converted to 3D\\" ? JURASSIC PARK is a true Masterpiece, no matter how or where you see it...
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Some of this may be to comparisons to Sea Biscuit (Which maybe the best horse movie, if not sports movie ever) but it does not have that “it” that I’m looking for. I think for me the movie was just too depressing. I know that The Great War isn’t a cuddly feel good theme, but the dark war stuff just dragged on. There was no uplifting triumph of the human (or horse) spirit at the end. Instead I was exhausted and glad that this horse ‘s nightmare was finally over. I did not hate it but it’s something I would not spend north of five bucks for.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Good read.  Interesting to discover what obstacles a navy seal has to achieve to become a member of their elite team.  I appreciate all the men & women who serve fighting for our freedoms. My God Bless them all and their families.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Nothing much about this all time classic. Nicely remastered in Blu-Ray and worth the ten bucks price I paid on this site deal.
B009AMANH4|5.0|If you are A. Lincoln, you are the President of the United States.  It's January 1865.  This bloody war has dragged on for 4 years, the forces of the rebellious slave states fiercely fight on, but it's obvious the end is nigh.  It is slavery that has rent the United States apart;  it is slavery that must end.<br /><br />Your Proclamation, two years ago, to free all slaves in states and parts of states that remained in rebellion, is on legally shaky ground.  The war could end with the question of slavery unsettled after the horrendous loss of life and suffering to settle this very issue ... only a change in the Constitution will work.<br /><br />Last year, a proposed 13th amendment to abolish slavery passed the Senate, but failed in the House.  Now that, with the elections over, it may be possible to pass it in the House with the votes from a few lame duck Democrats. . . .<br /><br />Note on ending:  The movie closes with Lincoln delivering an unidentified speech;  it is from his 2nd Inaugural Address.<br /><br />Extras:  \\"The Journey to Lincoln\\" - 9 minutes  &  \\"A Historic Tapestry: Richmond, Virginia\\" (Blu-ray only) - 4 minutes.<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray-2013): 4.5,  (DVD): 4.<br /><br />If you don't mind the very slightly lower resolution for the DVD, it does have an advantage if you want to stop the movie and finish it later.  To continue the movie where you left off, press play on your remote.  On the DVD it takes a half a minute, on the Blu-ray its around 3 minutes.  If you had subtitles selected, the DVD will remember that, the Blu-ray does not.<br /><br />Of special note:  If you have someone in your family that is visually impaired, select the \\"English Descriptive Video Service\\" option;  it turns on narrative descriptions of scenes and actions.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read all three fast than I've ever read anyone book.  Didn't think would like it, not really my interest.  Would highly recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was not at all what I was expecting, but it blew me away. Great story line. A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was Lincoln, no doubt. Amazing historical account in all aspects.<br />A must see for everyone! You won't be disappointed.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This ending is not for everyone but it was a refreshing change from the endings I usually read and I appreciated the change. Overall very sad this trilogy is over, seriously going to miss these characters.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I enjoy the fact that it is like the full computer version. It does seem to be a bit slow in updating though.
B0025WX2YW|1.0|Can't they come up with more than the same old sex, violence and over indulgence? All the same lineup of characters that you would expect in this type of movie. Boring!
0061128562|5.0|Granddaughters were  very excited to receive  this book. Quickly becoming a favorite! Very well written and illustrations are awesome! Thanks
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is a book for all ages.  It is the story of a boy's adventures of the kind we would all like to have.
0618001905|5.0|I can't add anything else to the outstanding reviews (which persuaded me to buy this book), except to say that reading King Leopold's Ghost was so enthralling that I practically read the entire book in one sitting.  Another reviewer mentioned that this book is history that reads like fiction--a perfect description!  But when you read this compelling book you'll find yourself wishing it were fiction instead of the truth of the horrible atrocities that actually occurred..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've just started using this app,  but so far I'm enjoying it.  Great graphics and easy to use.  Would definitely recommend.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I thought this movie was very good I enjoyed it and want to watcch it again and will probably buy it
B00BF11STU|5.0|As a filmmaker, I can say this was an unbelievable movie. I would definitely recommend it, not only in terms of the story and content, but also the structure and way in which it is told.
B008Y5OWSO|5.0|This version of Heavens Gate in this time frame 2013, so surpasses most of the movies released today. I'm not sure we will ever again see the scenery, sets & the correctness of the wardrobe provided for our viewing as this movie demonstrates. The visuals in digital format of history, how people lived 1890's, dressed & the toil of immigrants to the United States are so very accurate, Photoshop & Computer gimmicks were not in use in 1979 through 1981 while the movie was being filmed & cut to this length.  I'm so very glad the original version was released late in 2012 we now have access to viewing, how the talent, dedication, hardwork should have been viewed some 32 yrs ago.  I worked on this movie as a Stunt person & witnessed the dedication of Michael Cimino each day, even in the heat of the summer, Cimino wore heavy wool clothes along with the rest of the principle cast, extras & crew. There can be no denying now, Cimino, the Photographers, Musicians are & were artists. The music played by the young man, who plays a fiddle in the Roller Rink & looks to be maybe 15 or 16 years old, I actually thought at the time was just hired to act, but No, that it was David Mansfield the composer of the fabulous music throughout the movie, the young man then as well as now has an abundance of talent. The story line is not exactly as history played out during the Johnson County War of Wyoming, but many of the scenes I'm sure were playing out across this nation during the late 1800s. There are photography shoots of some of the most gorgeous scenery in the US, if you do not have access to the back country of the west, viewing this movie will give you an idea of what this country was like prior to humans populating, & building excessively across this country. Heavens Gate, will be around for the generations to appreciate; the beauty & artistic abilities of those that dedicated themselves. Hopefully the movies now with badly enhanced digital scenery, drug dealers, phoney scientific scenes & robotic characters will have left the public's tastes. I'm not sure this movie should be called western, its more a taste of history. I enjoyed reading the nice colorful brochure that comes with this 2012 edition too, it will help those not familiar with history to get into the story line.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Did not watch it all these years on TV. It is one of my favorite now. Can't wait to watch the next one, so sometimes I watch them back to back to back
B000QCS8TW|5.0|That series on HBO? The one all your friends watch? It's a book. It's a great book. Actually the first of a bunch of them. You should read it. You should read them all. Period.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|This little bluetooth is awesome! Our state is going hands free July 1st so it was a necessity. This product has great clarity and I like that it can be transferred to other vehicles. Battery lasts a long time. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone that doesn't have built-in blue tooth in their vehicles.
B007G51UV0|4.0|I bought this motherboard for my first computer build. All of my components fit like a glove, and the motherboard itself fits great in my Corsair 400R. Overclocking the cpu and ram is easy, just be sure not to over-overclock (though I think that is pretty self explanatory).<br /><br />My only issue I had with the initial set up was with the cpu fan on my Hyper 212 Evo. The fan's idle RPM is lower than the mobo's defult config, which triggers an error within the mobo's built in fan controller. To fix this, all you have to do is drop the Idle RPM speed to ~500.<br /><br />Updating the mobo's drivers is a bit irritating; not sure what the proper way to update is, but it seems that you have to download each individual driver from the website, which is a bit of a pain.<br /><br />Other than those couple issues, the mobo is great, and Asus's tech support is extremely helpful if you ever have issues.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I definitely think that the game was creative and fun. I would play it all day if I could. It's amazing. I definitely think it's worth buying. It deserves five stars.
0525244581|5.0|This book is not a classic for nothing!  Mr. Hoff perfectly puts both Tao and the Pooh genre together in, at the time, truly a unique way.  In this persons perspective, there is no better way to introduce oneself to the Tao methodology.  A &#34;must read&#34; for the novice or long practicioner alike.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I loved these books but I was a little disappointed with the end.  I hope that the author left it this way so she could write a fourth book since I don't feel like the story is over.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|After watching the movie every year, as far back as I can remember, I was surprised how different the book was.  It was more gruesome than the movie as well as lengthy.  I didn't think Dorothy would ever make it home .  I am going to research the history of both to see why the discrepancy. That being said, it was a good story.
B000ID37LS|2.0|I love Peter Jackson and Michael J. Fox but this is just awful because it's done by these two. What a disappointment. It's disjointed and overblown with effects, a visual trick used by directors to cover lack of story, script, what? This is Peter Jackson! and there's an interesting story, interesting characters and it still doesn't work. It seems it was written and cast when Fox was younger (like Back to the Future days) when he could have handled the comedic/ironic lead. Instead there are two movies; the one with ghosts and effects and then the one with Fox. The story gets going as if the film is headed in one direction then it slows down when Fox comes into scene and the other movie takes over - and seeing as this is basically a comedy, it's not very funny. (Jeffrey Combs's characters are always over the top and comedic in that crazy psycho way which could be another movie in itself). There's no irony in Fox's treatment of the bungling psychic, no comedy. It's sad as well that there's no chemistry between Fox and Lucy - there's more interest and character development in the two diabolic leads than the heroes. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this film and I was rooting for Michael J. to pull it up out of the quagmire it's drowning in, but to no avail. I should have minded the other few star reviews.
B004YR8AJI|5.0|This does not work on a Mac out of the box.  You need to go to their website and install the drivers.  Probably ditto PC but didn't try.  The website is easily navigable and finding the drivers is straightforward.  Post-install and reboot it worked just fine, very quick.  Ejection mechanism for the SD cards could be better, but it's no biggie.  If you are buying this, I'd guess that you need to move a lot of data, and this card will do that quickly.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|Case Histories is a great series, and I especially like Jason Isaacs in the title role.  I wish that he would do more in the series.  Great entertainment
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it keeps you on your toes it workes your brain<br />it has lots of different square<br />to work it keeps you thinking
B0068RHSCW|5.0|I loved the movie, \\"Dream House\\". A good psycological thriller.  Kept me guessing all the way through.  I would watch all of Daniel Craig's movies.  He is a good actor.
0141345659|5.0|The book was awesome and arrived right on time as I was expecting and came like new, with no markings or damages
B0035O66CO|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid and it's still one of my favorites as an adult, but I would be cautious about allowing very young children to watch because of some of the adult content.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game. very interesting to take up idle hours on a plane on just hanging out. Grandsons love it and it can be quite a challenge at times
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I love the Twilight series and I think this was one the best out of the series and I would recommend it to anyone who loves love stories
034580404X|4.0|I loved the sexual content of the books but it was not a well written series.  The first book was very repetitive, the second book finally started expanding on the story line, and the third book was the best of all UNTIL I got to the ending.  It was if she was tired of writing and just gave a quick summary.  There is another book begging to be written!  I was left feeling short of a few more orgasms!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I love this album and New kids on the Block I would recommend to any new kid fan and I will love them till the end of time
B004UPANGM|2.0|I was bored and I started texting through the movie in order to get through it. It's blah and not that funny.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is AWESOME:)!!!!!!!!!!! I would definitely recommend that you get this game:)!!!!!!! I saw that some y'all rated this as a 1 star game. I don't get how you rated this game that. SO WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS??????

B006GWO5NE|5.0|I would reccomend anyone who has a Kindle Fire purchase one of these!<br />When I purchase my Kindle Fire it came with the USB cable, however it would not charge my device unless it was completely turned off. After receiving the 5ft USB Cable and Kindle PowerFast for Accelerated Charger my device has improved. I no longer have problems with it charging and am completely satisfied with this product!

0143034901|2.0|I won't go over plot or characters as they are all laid out in other reviews.<br /><br />The net is that the story is so overwrought. At it's heart, it's a story about a young kid of 11 who gets a book he can't put down. The search for the author propels him into intrigue, ruined lives, and murder. It's just too much.<br /><br />I fell in love with books and authors at that age. But most people have some perspective. This isn't story about saving the world, or sneaking people out of an oppressive regime. It's an author who is underappreciated and unrequited love.<br /><br />The central conceit just didn't support the book for me, certainly not over 450 pages.
B007H7XJD4|3.0|It's okay could of been better, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have never had any problems with the cord.  What is perplexing to me is why I always have the cord, but keep losing the AC Adaptor plug whenever I travel.  I realize that by using a USB approach it is easily adaptable to foreign countries, but it still would be nice to have a one piece unit
B0045NXMJE|5.0|This was a smart movie that I think a lot of people would enjoy. Visually the director of Amelie does not disappoint! (Which was the reason I first saw this movie). It is charming, while the bones of the story is political and carries a message. Truly an entertaining film and one I've watched numerous times. Well worth buying for your movie library.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Could not get this program to work for me. All I want is a way for my Android tablet to be able to send things to my printer for printing. Toshiba Android
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Solid album! If you like the single I highly recommend the album! The flow is great and the songs did not feel repetitive. A good album to play on a loop.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO REGULAR SEARCH ENGINES. This is an amazing app.  Calculations, deep diving for facts, all a breeze.  Results are presented well.  I like the logic. An amazing project.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is one of my son's current favorite movies, we have watched it everyday since he received it for Easter and I can honestly say I really don't mind! The story is sweet with just the right amount of funny!
B0026WNGBA|4.0|I'm headed toward marathon #4 this year.  I am an older runner who doesn't put on many miles weekly.  I wanted to see if this could help me get along a bit better this time around.  I like the mechanics, but am not perfect.  Requires patient practice.  I think I'll be able to master it before the marathon this October 2013 (now is April 2013).
B005DKLPF6|5.0|In the ever flowing ocean of music available to us, it's easy to miss out on great music because we simple do not have the time to fully explore every band we may or may not enjoy. This is exactly what happened to me. I am going to tell you of my Mastodon journey so that you will be inspired to give this incredible band a chance. I first heard of them years ago sometime just after Leviathan came out, believe. Listened to it briefly, didn't hit me, didn't give them a second thought. As the years forged on and Mastodon grew in popularity, (if I don't hate a band I'm likely to give them a second listen occasionally) I looked in on them again at a friend's recommendation and listened to \\"Blood & Thunder.\\" I liked it, but didn't love it. It had a modern thrashy vibe, but it just didn't stick with me, so again I moved on and forgot about them. Fast forwarding again, I found the just released \\"Crack the Skye\\" at my public library. I figured, eh, it's free, I'll give it a spin. I actually listened to the entire album, and honestly, while I didn't hate it, I didn't get it. Thats a problem I have: If I can't classify a band (I'm a sub-genre freak), then I have a hard time getting into them. \\"Crack the Skye\\" had a modern metal sound, but it wasn't nu metal or metalcore. It wasn't crushingly heavy or thrashy like previous Mastodon albums; I just didn't get it. So I returned it and moved on yet again. Then last year I was listening to the metal radio station on Directv and heard \\"Curl of the Burl.\\" It took me a while, but I realized that I truly like this song. This year my musical sojourn brought me back to Doom Metal and then to Sludge Metal; of course \\"Curl of the Burl\\" had to be on the Sludge & Stoner Rock & Doom Metal playlist I made to satisfy my current musical trip. Then tonight I decided that I should listen to this whole album and not just what I had on my playlist: blew my freaking mind! \\"The Hunter\\" is nothing short of a metal Masterpiece. Is it progressive? Yes. CanI now categorize it? Absolutely: I would call Mastodon progressive Sludge Metal, and \\"The Hunter\\" even has some influence of thrash to it (see Spectrelight). If you have discovered the mind crushing brilliance of Sludge Metal, you must get this album!!! (Also HIGHLY recommended anything by Rwake.)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story is fascinating and the costumes and scenery are beautiful.  Music is lovely and the actors are perfect in their roles.  There is humor, intrigue, conflict and pathos in every episode and i was fascinated with the whole series.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is fun and a bit challenging. Having the intake bucks is nice and they can be slowly earned by doing quests and leveling up. But you have to be patient and save it for the big rewards.<br />The dinosaur look amazing. I like building g style games so this is definately for me.(
B008NA2JMQ|4.0|A no holds barred description of life in the financial world of the 80's - money,drugs, sex and thievery. Told by one of the most successful in terms of the above but one of the most unsuccessful in terms of life. Fascinating.

B005723JSQ|5.0|I want to be clear that while I'm VERY disappointed in the overpriced cost of the Kindle edition, I didn't want that to interfere with my true opinion of the book. I've read and loved all of Sophie Kinsella's previous books, and not only did this one favorably compare, it surpassed. The plot was original, intriguing, humorous, and romantic. I had difficulty putting it down. If you enjoy this type of chick lit, this will quickly become one of your favorites. I was very happy to be able to borrow the digital copy from my library and comfortably read it on my Kindle for FREE. I really think this publisher does Ms. Kinsella a disservice by charging so much, it definitely puts people off.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|got good ratings and love movie. thank you. highly recommend product to anyone. cant wait for more 3d movies and regular blu rays
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Not a typical love story or chick flick novel. Had a new twist on things. You won't be able to guess what's coming next, which is always a good thing.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|It is so convienent, it has the day, week, and month right at your fingertips. and you can put more than one item in a date and can change the times etc.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I wanted an automatic watch for occasional wear, mainly so I could throw it in a drawer for long periods of time and not worry about the battery dying.  Now that I have worn it for a week, I can comment how pleased I am with it.  Nice styling, is well made, and accurate.  It has gained less than a minute in a week, and has not stopped running (I took it off two nights just to see if it would still be ticking in the morning).  Overall, very pleased with my purchase
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The original micro usb cable that came with my KIndle was damaged at the end wire. I bought this as a replacement and it works just like the original one that I had. Problem is, I think must micro usb are easy damaged.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I did not watch the series on PBS, but keep watching it win awards at the Emmys. I bought season one more out of curiosity and was entranced.  I immediately ordered seasons 2 and 3 and watched the entire series in the Original U.K. Edition.  The attention to detail and the historical transition period over which the events of this series takes place makes the series particularly riveting.  I ordered it in Blue Ray so that I could get the special features and learn more about how careful they were in getting the historical detail right.  The actors are perfectly cast.  There is not a false note.  Wonderful series.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I pre-ordered the movie firstly because I saw it in theaters and was eager to watch it again, but secondly because it was such a reasonable price. My family and I were going on a 8 hour car trip (for which I would be in the backseat the whole time) so I watched in on my computer. It was even better the second time around and I was so happy it arrived on early so that I could bring it with me.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I felt like this was just your regular 007 movie. I wasn't impressed with the storyline. The beginning just seemed stupid to me. Midway through the movie it picked up and actually enjoyed the ending as well as the main &#34;bad guy&#34; charachter. I didn't love it but I ended up liking it ok.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|An interesting plot. I could never have guessed the end when the story started, the story had twists and turns.
030716327X|5.0|This is a classic and wonderful book - bought this as a gift because my kids absolutely loved it..<br />Recommend
B0076DELIG|2.0|This particular novel didn't have the intensity I have read with other Connelly novels. Perhaps the &#34;cold case&#34; is too chilly to I thaw for the warmth and excitement found in other works such as The Lincoln Lawyer.<br /><br />Harry Bosch, the main character, is an aging detective whose stories seem to carry less interest and intensity each time I read them. This one involved a 20 year old murder that for some rather vague reason (other than it was his job) caught not only his attention, but his emotions as well. Unfortunately for the reader, not much ignited my interest or enthusiasm for his quest. It was his job and he did it because of his convictions.  Connelly tried to get us a bit more involved because Bosch had to do the job with a less than supportive boss. Sorry, it didn't add much. The Desert Storm angle was new, but without drama or resolution that mattered. The title probably best describes the whole reading experience--a black box, not a new and enticing story. Let this one go and read Gone Girl, Defending Jacob, or The Round House. Much better ways to spend your reading time with interesting thrillers.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|people told me this movie was great but i wasnt to unsure about it because of its tittle and its time period it took place. BUT! dont let that fool you! i watched this movie like 3 times since i got it. its a great vampire killing movie with a twist of history :).

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I heard so much praise about the book, and by curiosity, I bought its kindle version. I did not go further than the scene of their first date. It is a stereotype of those cheap erotic books which try to attract the readers by inserting a story between the sexual descriptions.<br />The 2 main characters are so unrealistic, him being a multi millionaire, and as handsome as Adonis, and her, a pretty girl, unconscious about her beauty? I'd rather read fairy tales!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love this album and have a hard time keeping it as family likes it so much too.  Great artist and music--as must for Adele fans.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Great Service, arrived at time, just what I put in my order, good packing, and good price, thanks for this.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Very  political, and long!  All 3 people that were watching fell asleep! But the characters seemed very real, the acting was great!
B0001MDQ6W|5.0|Great Service, arrived at time, just what I put in my order, good packing, and good price, thanks for this.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I love this film. However, I would definitely recommend seeing it, or reading reviews of it before purchasing. It is clearly the type of movie viewers LOVE, or HATE. You either get something from it, or nothing from it. Very thought provoking, and seems to mean different things to different people. I think it really points out the simple things in a lifetime that make each day worth living, but also tear worlds apart.
B004FEL6GO|5.0|So glad I found these thanks Amazon. Grandson has so much fun with this and has yet to get bored with them. Fairly easy for him to switch back and forth from car to robot. Price not bad either
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|it's the OriginL Raw version of Sons of Anarchy. Sexy lead man, raw violence but you still can't stop watching
193609648X|5.0|the book is a beauty, you can use it as a coffee table piece. The pictures are great, the pieces to make gorgeous.<br />Wants to make all of them. LOL&#62;
B00C32REYI|5.0|its amazing,. of course, i expect nothing else from james blake, he is truly amazing musician and  his voice is haunting
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I could not put this book down. Can't wait to read the rest of the series! Will recommend to anyone!
B001AR4K8K|5.0|Best vampire movie.  Kiefer would eat Edward for an appetizer.  Since ten more words are required for this review I'll write this sentence.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie.  Very true to the written word, which is important to me.  The way it was shot made it wonderful to watch on the big screen but not less enjoyable at home on my 42&#34; TV.  Totally looking forward to Parts 2 and 3!
B005KAH7QU|3.0|The movie had some good parts.  I liked some of the action scenes in the beginning.<br />The ending was somewhat predictable.<br /><br />-CeCe
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|like I said its mofunkin grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeat<br />best hot damning mobile game eeeeeeeeeever!!!!!!!!!!!! seriously couldn't add enough exclamation marks to stress how radtastic this game is.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This was my first read be Nelson Demille and I've gotta say I'm impressed. Great read, you won't be disappointed.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This movie was so cute and very nostalgic, especially for those who grew up in the 80s/90s with nintendo and other video games.  It has the typical Disney plot where the story gets really sad and you feel sorry for the character, but it of course, picks up and has a great ending.  The humor is appropriate for all ages and our family had a great time watching it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it you play with your friends and family it's tons of fun and if you have a lot of battery you can play forever.

B00499QUK2|5.0|A friend from the UK recommended Sherlock to me because I watch Elementary.  Sherlock is different and better.  A great show.  Can't wait for season three.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey still the same arrogant loveable ny cop trying to save the world from another terrorist. Nelson DeMille does a wonderful job with character development and bringing together two formidable characters from his previous novels to battle The Panther. Great read
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  It just keeps getting better and better.  If you like Sherlock Holmes in Elementary be prepared to enjoy even more.
B008J34466|5.0|Love the majority of the songs on this CD. There is one or two that stink but the rest are awesome!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It was just OK-Jennifer Lawrence is darling tho. Otherwise, what was the big deal? Maybe the problem is I'm 66 y/o...
B003O86FMW|5.0|The was a amazing book!!! I really like that book I hope that other people read it to. I hope you like it too
B000J5XS3C|4.0|Very useful mixer. Good quality. Feels pretty durable and not cheap. The sound quality through this is very very good! Clear... loud! Almost no noise. Great preamp. Good controls... good performance! And the price???? A REAL STEAL :D  Overall good. Definitely 4 out of 5 :)
B008MM9630|4.0|I like this game!  I gave it four stars because there is supposed to be a box in the upper left hand corner where you can buy the boxes or special deals and i dont have it 99.9% of the time....  i had it pop up once then never again.....  besides that it is fun to find out what potions do and what decorations and trees do and give what
B009LRE040|5.0|this movie is amazing and was the prequel, I wont give away any spoilers but it is definitely worth the purchase for those days I want to have a batman marathon.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I had heard a lot about it, but never had the chance to watch it until recently.  Then I decided to buy it, which for me means I must've really enjoyed it.  I think it's unfair to compare this film to Brokeback Mountain, however, since the tone, story, setting, and budget are completely different for each film.  They're both great films in their own right and I enjoy both of them (and own both of them) for completely different reasons.  Shelter is sweet and hopeful, BBM is sad and achy.<br /><br />The acting in Shelter is better than I expected and the little boy who plays Cody is utterly adorable.  The two leads have good chemistry and they made me believe their relationship.  The soundtrack is definitely topnotch.  I would also caution you to disregard those who describe this film as a &#34;gay surfing movie&#34; because while there is plenty of surfing, it's not a surfing movie.  That's not what the film's about.  The characters just happen to surf.  They also happen to paint and draw and write and act like immature boys sometimes, too.<br /><br />This is really a film about learning who you are and accepting it, about finally letting yourself reach for the dreams you've been denying you could have.  Watching Zach's transformation and Shaun's quiet encouragement is a real treat.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a sweet and hopeful story with a happy ending.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|What is needed when replacing old thermal paste on proc that the heat sink had been removed or when replacing a proc for upgrade.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is absolutely thrilling the entire way through. The author does an incredible job portraying the main character's thought, making you feel for him throughout the book. I would suggest this to anyone looking for a great read.(Admittedly I would suggest the first book because many parts of this book are more amplified if you know the whole story).
B00362DRQS|5.0|Been a Duran Duran fan since 1981, and purchased this set mainly for the second and third discs. It really does have some cool packaging and is Duran Duran at their best!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great game to play when u are not doing any thing .I tell my friends  know my  friends have the game ALL my friends
B000FA675C|4.0|Decent, doesn't really live up to the hype though. It was free so it worth it. Would I pay for it - nope
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I bought this when it was on sale and as this was my first paid kindle game I wasn't sure how good to expect it to be.  My biggest problem was the graphics of the city.  All the time the textures didn't show up until you were right on top of the which made for some ugly landscapes.<br /><br />Positives however out weighed that.  Spiderman looked good and the animations were very well done and fluid.  The game play was fun as well as swinging around the open city.  The controls are very simple too.  Overall the game is far too short but is lengthened by the street crime you can fight against.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|After seeing many Denzel Washington films, I have become quite a fan. But his performance in this movie was above reproach. I was entertained from start to finish and am definitely adding this to my collection! 5 stars from me, excellent movie. Excellent actors, great plot, well done.
B006LSZECO|4.0|And while I wish I did not have to put it down like my title says because you know, you gotta sleep, go to work, etc. I could wait to get into it every night! VERY different from any type of writting I have ever read in the Mystery/Thriller genre! Amy is one truly disturbed woman!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Oh my gosh....What a great story. Could not put the book down...kept me on the edge of my seat....just a great great read...
B00BF123WG|5.0|I thought this film was better than Argo, which won the Academy Award.  This picture was not even nominated, is that correct?  What an oversight, or ridiculous manipulation.  I thought both the Argo and Zero Dark Thirty filmmakers did a good job of keeping partisan politics out of their movies; it was just about what happened, with emphasis on the very interesting people involved.  Still, Argo was flat compared to Zero Dark Thirty.  Members of the Academy who nominate and vote on these things - you're fools.
B001HN697M|5.0|This is an awesome series. I totally enjoy the series and am glad that i discovered it.  Highly recommended to all.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm probably not the typical demographic that watches Downton Abbey, I'm a geeky guy in his 30's but I find it fascinating.  The characters are extremely well written.  They have depth, consistent personalities, and flaws.  It is very easy to believe that each is a real person, and you grow to care about them (at least some of them).  I also like that the series is centered around real world events and keeping a realistic timeline.<br /><br />The one thing that is glaringly hokey about the series is that O'Brian and Thomas are the only two that smoke.  Having the two villains being the only two who smoke is quite a cliche.  It screams &#34;don't like these two, they are bad!&#34;  Most of the time their plotting is done while outside surrounded by a cloud of smoke.  That is really a very minor flaw and not something I'd recommend against watching the show for.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love this book, the energy and excitement just keeps going.  Love all Dan Brown books, can't wait for Inferno.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had decided to read safe haven before I saw the movie, well  I read two pages and realized I had read it when it first came out. The point I'm trying to make is that it only took me two pages to remember this wonderful book. It was so enjoyable, but still haven't seen the movie. Easy read
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I got hooked on season 1 watching a few episodes on Netflix and then ordered the 3 season set and really loved in and wait the start of season 4
B009UX2YAC|4.0|If you like temple run this fun packed game is perfect.Charging around railways and jumping on trains, you can unlock fab items and players!However the game is addictive and needs patience.  Have fun!
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I chose this movie for family value and it delivered. Good lessons and all! The Graffics were great and it kept moving no slow spots
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|This movie has become one the grand-daughters favorite dvd.  They are aged five and seven and it keeps their attention.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I purchased this movie because I wanted to own it. Before I was able to watch it, others members of my family did and actually watched it again when I had the time. My family members watching a movie twice within a week. It has to be a good movie! I really enjoyed it and even though I am sure it isn't entirely accurate, it is a true story and that's what I enjoy in a movie.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game is awesome. Big fish as done a great job with this one. You can kill lots of time. The puzzles are pretty and the game is challenging.
B00B671W6W|5.0|I heard about this album last summer and was very excited.  At one point I heard the EP was just a rumor and would not be released.  Then word came that the EP was slated for release this month.  I read about the tracks to be included and was ecstatic!  I grew up listening to all of the bands covered with the exception of Rush.  I picked this EP up yesterday and was pleased with my purchase.  I was not disappointed that Anthrax stayed true to the originals because they said all along that would be the case.  I take these songs for what they are worth; a band paying tribute to their influences and having fun along the way.  I was not expecting Anthrax to try and make an even better version of any of the songs.  I think they did a great job!  Maybe I am biased because I love Anthrax.  I think you have to be a true Anthrax fan to appreciate this EP.  I think the standout was \\"Big Eyes\\" but all the songs rock!
B006RXQ8RI|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie the first time seeing it but it didn't really click with me until I saw volume 2. Now I love them both.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book is about learning the meaning of words and why it is important to learn the English speech and the English language.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Before I had seen this movie I thought it was about zombies. Then after seeing it I figured the creatures are more of a zombie-vampire hybrid. Later when I read the book, I found the author had a very different story about vampires. The book is good but the movie is even better. How often do you actually hear THAT sentence?
B000F1IQN2|5.0|This movie is one of Spielberg's best. It's not on blue ray but I actually liked watching this on regular DVD. Gave it character for this type of movie being the 70's..
B00005KAQP|5.0|Beautifully singing nuns, Maggie Smith, a fske Pope John Paul II and some good ol' Whoopie... what's not to love?

B00571F26Y|4.0|I have been limiting wheat for quite a long time and haven't had the dramatic weight loss he describes. It makes sense but don't know if the science supports the conculsions.  Worth trying and some of my friends HAVE had dramatic results from eliminating wheat from their diets.
B009R659L8|5.0|I love mary higgins clark ,  This book is great.  I pre-order<br />this book, it arrived at the time it was supposed to.<br />If you like this author I recommend it.  If you have never<br />read her books I highly recommend this book as well<br />as all her books.<br /><br />Karen.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It strengthened my belief that heaven is real and that one day we will be there and we will see face to face our Heavenly Father and our loved ones. I can't wait to get there.
B004NBZG06|5.0|There is a surprise in store for the reader. The characters do not all seem what they are in reality. This was a very nice book.
0739368435|5.0|Such an interesting book. I love that it is historically based and such a heartfelt story. I purchased the audio version to listen to in my car...it is wonderful as well.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Awesome book! This is one of those books that you don't want to put down! First book I've read by this author, but she was great!
B00632HWOG|5.0|It loaded up and running quite well.<br />You will want to sync up the contacts list.<br />Very nice and handy app.
B0097AQEG8|5.0|I've been watching Gary Clark since I heard him at SXSW back in 2009/10?  And then saw him at Buddy Guys Place (Legends) in Chicago.  That same weekend he played with Clapton at Crossroads. I've since seen him 2/3 times he is an awsesome guitarist in the Blues genre but his diversity, live and on this album, is amazing.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Used it a little.  Have not tried to buy or sell any<br />thing through this app, so I can't judge it just yet.
B008393Q2O|4.0|It's pretty easy to use and fun.  Whenever I think of something I need to pick up, I add it to the list.  Great for grocery shopping!  Heard a song you don't want to forget?  Put it here.  Or a movie you want to rent.  Anything really.  Good tool
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great super hero film! Entertaining for the whole family .  My grandson already thinks he is either Captain America or Spider-Man so now he will be Iron Man!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this series. I am really glad I waited to read them when all five were out so the cliff hanger at the end of the book about Jace and Clary was cleared up fairly quickly for me, otherwise I may have stopped reading.  I am too old to read so much &#34;YA&#34; but I can't help it. I must know what happens to these characters. I care too much about them to stop now. I also recommend reading the Infernal Devices as you will have to go back and reread these books to see the correlations.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Just got this new watch. Looks good, easy to operate, and keeps good time so far. I like the smaller face size. So many watches today have the oversized face, but this one has a classic, smaller size. Overall, seems liek a good quality watch.
B001NLL93W|5.0|That this book clears up the relationship between Jace and Clary.  It just makes you love them even more. This book is also shows you more about Magnus Bane, and makes you look forward to the upcoming Bane Chronicles series.
1439163154|4.0|I have been oddly fascinated with James Franco ever since I first saw him years ago in a preview at the movie theater for Tristan and Isolde.  When I first saw his face I recall feeling like I was being struck with an arrow, and he has remained on my radar ever since, often making surprising appearances in my subconscious and conscious psyche.  I have seen most of his films, read what little there is about this elusive man online, and find him to be extremely interesting and gifted but I fear him collapsing in a heap from burnout and even depression.  Where is his \\"off\\" button?  He seems to always be \\"searching\\" for something, plunging himself into projects that often involve very dark roles and spreading himself way too thin with art shows, too many classes and intellectual endeavors.  It is my humble opinion that what he is searching for and has been blatantly ignoring is his heart.  All the raunchy, hard-core objectification of women in this book and most recently his pursuits in the gay sex lifestyle.  It's quite obvious to me that what lies underneath all of that hardness is a deep-seeded fear and simultaneous longing for something soft, giving him permission to \\"stop all the futile searching\\".  James, if you are reading this, you remind me of a hamster running on a wheel, running nowhere because you need to just STOP and FEEL YOURSELF, your heart; you disguise your sensitivity in your blatant, over-expression of all that is \\"alpha male\\".  You my dear are so much more than that.<br /><br />James' extreme sensitivity looms in the background of this book, popping up in little places here and there, when he describes the children's books, his love for April, or observes with great detail the features on someone's face.  It also carried the underlying theme of, \\"I am a good person.  Please think of me as a good person\\".  I found this book to be highly personal and even felt like he was standing over me while I read it...a little spooky.  Is it possible for him to be in two places at once?  He IS such a wonder-boy.  It is also my hunch that he was someone who was raised with very little, if any, structure; a boy who was given far too much freedom and became hugely overwhelmed (due to his high sensitivity) which lead to all the numbing out (emotionless sex, drugs, etc).  Where in the *&%$ was his mother?  Can I be your mother??  This thought loomed in my head as I read this book.  I give Palo Alto a strong four stars, my reason being that felt like it was a pure, mostly unguarded expression of things inside of HIM.  He is a very talented artist who needs to stop denying/avoiding his softer side before he loses all that fantastic mojo.  When he does, I think there will be 5 stars for him everywhere.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I can't say enough about the Mortal Instruments and the Infernal Devices. I had to reread these books after I read the Infernal Devices.  No spoilers, but you have to read the whole series.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|This cameera was purchased for use in a school classroom. We have several teachers using them and they are all pleased with the ease of use and the clarity of the projected images. We also have one &#34;very expensive&#34; document camera. It works well, but takes a lot more effort to set up, is nowhere near  as portable, and cost about three times what the Ziggi did.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|I started reading the book hopeful that I would like it. It is written in a funny way that may be due to the translation. I don't know much about the Russian Czar and quite honestly got bored. I'm sure that if I gave it a chance I would really like this book, but I just couldn't get into it.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|We love this product. Excellent. A wonderful addition to our collection. We have enjoyed the product very, very much!<br />Would buy again.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|This serial puzzler has done it again. Keeps you on the edge of infinity. The Following is a great new series based on this story line. Horror thrillers and series have come a long way since Alfred Hithcock and other greats in this genre of film.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I had seen the 3D version at the theater, so wasn't sure if watching it on my TV would be as good.  It was!  We enjoyed it very much and am so glad I purchased it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really like this game, but your character runs out of energy too fast. And the only way to get more is to pay actual money, request energy from friends, or wait until more energy is given to you over time. Therefore, gameplay is annoyingly sporadic.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book is really good, but... Too many unnecessary details... it's a really mature book. But it was still enjoyable.
B001I13PM0|5.0|I have some CD of Yani even though I didn't finishing all. I always like to hear his music this concert was superb.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't believe I have to wait until October to watch again!  This series is so exciting I didn't want it to end.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Whilst this excellent drama deals with only a small part of Lincoln's triumph and tragedy a turning point of American History, it is totally engaging. Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln is perfect for the part, he got an Oscar for the part. The politics of that era have lessons for modern politicians. Oh, how the Republican Party has changed from a positive, progressive movement to the state of play today.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was lucky enough to get into Wool at a point where the omnibus was out and I could sit down and digest this book fully.  Hugh does a great job getting you emotionally attached to these characters and the silo itself.  This is a well written book that suspends disbelief but keeps it so tangible and the science believable, it feels like something that could be a reality.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is the most reliable and fast keyboard on android.<br /><br />With the new swipe feature it has become even better. I use both regular typing and swipe methods depending on the need and use.<br /><br />This keyboard has saved me a lot of annoyance. I have huge thumbs and so auto correct and word suggestions come in very handy.<br /><br />With regular android keyboard and even swipe I had issues getting the right suggestions.<br /><br />Punctuation marks are also much easier to add with this keyboard than any other.

B0080M3OGW|2.0|I usually like anything Meryl Streep is in, but this was too slow. I stopped watching before I was half-way through.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I went through a lot of ch-ch-changes when confronted with this album. After a couple of listens, I began to appreciate it. Most of it is very good indeed. I find the vocals to be excellent. For a man of 66, Bowie's voice and attitude are not tired and resigned; if anything, they are as vehement and uncompromising as ever. So this is not a happy, earnest comeback piece designed to please everyone and make money. Most of the music has a hard rock sound, with dissonance and grating guitars. That brings up another thing I like: it is LOUD. After all, Bowie is primarily a rock artist. And, as many other reviewers have pointed out, some tracks contain echoes of Bowie's classic albums. The lyrics are as cryptic as any fan of Bowie could wish for. I'm registering insights with my soul rather than understanding them with my intellect. I found very striking lyrics in these songs, among others:<br />\\"The Next Day\\" (\\"They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps/They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death/Drag him to the feet of the purple-headed priest\\"),<br />\\"The Stars Are Out Tonight\\" (\\"They burn you with their radiant smiles/Trap you with their beautiful eyes/They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared/But I hope they live forever\\"),<br />\\"Valentine's Day\\" (\\"Valentine told me who's to go...The teachers and the football star...It's in his scrawny hand...He's got something to say\\"), and<br />\\"How Does The Grass Grow\\" (\\"Where do the boys lie/Mud mud mud/How does the grass grow/Blood blood blood\\").<br />The one weakness, and this is what concerned me when I first played the samples, is that many of the melodies are not very \\"musical\\". Many are one-note, two-note melodies, almost like chanting. But in the context of the entire album, with its inclination toward the dark and serious, they work.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are: \\"The Next Day\\", which reminds me of \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" from \\"Heroes\\"; \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\", which has a little \\"Aladdin Sane\\" album sound; \\"Valentine's Day\\", which sounds like the song \\"Heroes\\"; \\"I'd Rather Be High\\"; and \\"Dancing Out In Space\\", in which part of the vocal is double-tracked but the tracks are one note apart, resulting in dissonance rather than harmony. Musically, I would call these \\"radio friendly\\", although probably no radio station will play them. There are many features to appreciate on other tracks: the prominent sax in \\"Dirty Boys\\" and \\"Boss of Me\\", the throbbing bass of \\"Love Is Lost\\", the dead serious hopelessness of \\"Heat\\", the very busy strangeness of \\"If You Can See Me\\", and the breezy pop quality of \\"I'll Take You There\\". \\"Where Are We Now?\\" is probably my least favorite track, although I do like Bowie's mention of various Berlin locales. As ballads go, I prefer \\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\", which sounds similar to \\"Rock 'N' Roll Suicide\\" from \\"Ziggy\\".<br /><br />I can't say much for the album art, except that the grim, rather spectral photo of Bowie on the inside pretty much matches the album's general mood. It would have made a good cover.\\"Aladdin Sane\\" album sound; \\"Valentine's Day\\", which sounds like the song \\"Heroes\\"; \\"I'd Rather Be High\\"; and \\"Dancing Out In Space\\", in which part of the vocal is double-tracked but the tracks are one note apart, resulting in dissonance rather than harmony.

B004H1V5RU|4.0|My daughter (15 years old) asked for this after using it as part of her therapy.  I have not figured out how to get past about the 4th obstacle.  This is not for the faint of heart or for those who frustrate easily.  For those who enjoy a challenge or could use practice on learning how to concentrate or develop some eye-hand coordination, this could be the toy for you.  It does provide a nice break from electronics and mindless tv.  One challenge we had was finding a place to store it.  It is rather large and tends to roll around.  We lost the stand shortly after we purchased it.  Everyone in our house gave up on it after about a month.  It was an expensive toy to have for a month and now it is not used at all.

I was a bit worried that it was going to be a sappy love-story, and it isn't (well, it kind of is, but in a different and good way).

I also like that the menu has sandbox play.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Volbeat has the best music in rock n roll and i feel the vocals are a bonus.  Musically this band is off the chart I absolutely love the music and vocal wise is great too but the rock they produce is like a mixture of Motley Crue meets Godsmack meets Led Zeppelin.  Take a listen if you like Rock N Roll it will not disappoint.

020530902X|3.0|It has been a number of years since I had had a class in English grammar so when I read certain sentences or phrases that just did not sound right to me, I decided to purchase &#34;Elements of Style&#34;.  The book is more about writing style, the type used for research papers and other more formal topics.  So I was disappointed that very little emphasis was placed on basic grammar rules.  I did not give up my pursuit and subsequently purchased &#34;The Only Grammar You'll Ever Need&#34; (ironically the more correct title would be &#34;The Only Grammar One Will Ever Need&#34;.  This book more closely fulfilled my needs; however, in my opinion individuals who want both basic grammar and stylistic writing should really purchase each book.

I'm sure she was a delightful girl just as she was in the movie. She certainly seemed a fine woman.

B00BAB6CNC|3.0|WHAT?! Not a 5-star review?! HEATHEN!!!<br /><br />Hold on, friend. Let me explain. I hold Stone Sour in pretty high regard, so it pains me to have to criticize their work. As much as it hurts, though, I cannot give high praise where high praise is not due.<br /><br />Back when House of Gold & Bones Part 1 (HoG&B Pt. 1 from here on out) came out I was excited, but I tempered my expectations because Corey's prediction that this two-part concept album would be \\"Pink Floyd's [[ASIN:B005NPBT5M The Wall]] meets Alice in Chains' [[ASIN:B0000028M7 Dirt]] on steroids\\" seemed just a little bit lofty. As I expected, HoG&B Pt. 1 fell short of the unattainable. I still enjoyed it, though, and I ended my review of that album by stating I was optimistic Part 2 would leave me satisfied. Well... not quite.<br /><br />\\"Red City\\" starts HoG&B Pt. 2 in the right direction as it transforms from a mellow vocal over piano into a signature Corey Taylor harsh-vocal amidst snarling guitars. Then, as so often was the case on HoG&B Pt. 1, the album takes a big step backwards with \\"Black John,\\" a snoozer reminiscient of \\"My Name is Allen\\" from the first album. This track utilizes an annoying (and seemingly pointless) sample at the beginning, which is a recurring thing in the HoG&B experience. None of the samples add much to the music, but their inclusion does provide a very distant similarity to The Wall, which is what Taylor was probably going for.<br /><br />Next up is \\"Sadist,\\" a dark, imposing track that features a filthy interlude from guitarist Jim Root. \\"Sadist\\" is one of the few tracks that stands out immediately; it gives way to \\"Peckinpah,\\" which is unexciting except for one cool riff midway through. \\"Stalemate\\" and \\"Gravesend\\" follow with more boring guitars, average lyrics, and another dose of those annoying samples. \\"'82\\" is fun but not memorable. At the eighth spot on the album \\"The Uncanny Valley\\" shows up. This track is easily the worst on the album with its weak hook and stock lyrics. Fortunately, \\"Blue Smoke\\" deviates from the previous tracks and does some interesting things musically. Taylor's haunting vocals only make it better, and though it really serves as an intro to \\"Do Me A Favor,\\" it is still worthwhile.<br /><br />Already a hit single, \\"Do Me A Favor\\" is similar to \\"Absolute Zero\\" in that it is the catchiest song on its half of the concept dual-album. Near the end it changes direction and flashes back to \\"A Rumor of Skin\\" from HoG&B Pt. 1, which only enhances its value. Surprisingly, \\"Do Me A Favor\\" ends up being one of the best tracks on the album. \\"The Conflagration\\" is another standout. It cleverly wraps up the repetitious lyrical them of, you guessed it, fire/conflagration found on both albums, and Taylor provides what might be his best vocal on the album. Musically, there is a lot going on as well. Orchestral arrangements underlie piano and multiple guitars. It leads directly into the title track, which is by far my favorite track from either album. \\"House of Gold & Bones\\" is classic Stone Sour: fast, angry, and catchy. While it includes musical themes from \\"Absolute Zero,\\" it also reminds me of material from [[ASIN:B000P6R96C Come What(ever) May]]. \\"House of Gold & Bones\\" fittingly concludes the two-part experience with a bang.<br /><br />In the end, the House of Gold & Bones experience is solid. I love concept albums, but they have to be done carefully. The awesome thing about a concept album is that some of the really cool riffs and melodies usually recur throughout the experience (think Dream Theater's [[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]], or really any of their work). The awful thing about concept albums is that the boring parts might also show up repeatedly, leaving the listener no avenue of escape. HoG&B Pt. 2 is a mixed bag in this regard. While I greatly enjoyed the last handful of tracks on HoG&B Pt. 2, there are too many uninteresting riffs and lyrics in the middle tracks for me to really get into this album. In that sense, it is a lot like HoG&B Pt. 1, which was also plagued by boring moments. As I said in my review of that album, Stone Sour will not make many new fans with this two-part effort, but they certainly won't lose any either. The House of Gold & Bones experience caters to the fans, so I understand why people like both albums. I do, too. I just don't love them, and that is why I have to give both parts of the House of Gold & Bones experience a mediocre three star rating.e, it is a lot like HoG&B Pt. 1, which was also plagued by boring moments.

Sophie Kinsella's books are always interesting and entertaining but this one you can't even try to predict the outcome!!! Plus you have a love/hate with not only Becky but her daughter as well....actually not so much her daughter but Becky's parenting. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun read and anyone who loved the Shopaholic books.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|After watching the movie I had to read the book. It was good it was sad. It was a quick read.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Lincoln was not the best movie of 2012, but it is the most memorable. The Academy - unlike many years - got it right with Argo. They also properly selected Daniel Day Lewis as the Best Actor for his portrayal of one of our four greatest presidents (Washington, Jefferson and FDR the others). This haunting portrayal of the most written about president will no doubt be the most remembered of the movies from this previous year. Its beauty, writing and message were powerful. But it is its somber depth of purpose that will be most remembered for yet again redefining Lincoln. Too often today, historical dramas are portrayed from such a current Point of View as to be all but unrecognizable from an historic perspective. Lincoln is not. Doris Kearns Goodwin's work in &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; provides the bedrock of an excellent screenplay.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games has been on the tip of everyone's tongue for quite some time now. I'd seen the movies, so when I caught the trilogy on sale I thought I'd give it a try. The world into which you enter is captivating, the characters are complex, and the outcome is surprising. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop until I was done.<br /><br />The Hunger Games, first in the series, is absolutely phenomenal. It sets the stage so well, delivering dialog that doesn't make you cringe and telling the story from a perspective that really brings the terror and horror of it all home. Katniss Everdeen is a fantastic heroine, and the cast of supporting characters assembled all hold their own against her.<br /><br />Catching Fire, second in the series, is one of the best examples of a sequel ever. Enough is said to keep the reader following the story if it has been a while since they read the first book, without ever becoming redundant. The shocker twist doesn't rear its ugly head until after you're 1/3 into the story. And from there the intensity never lets up.<br /><br />Mockingjay is probably the weakest link in the trilogy, if only because there are some changes to the character of Katniss that were, well, not in her favor. I could have done without the forced love triangle, which is an overplayed angle anyway, and I wanted her to continue to be the strong heroine she'd shown herself to be in the first two books. The weaknesses in the third story, again mostly revolving around her character, were not enough to lower my score of the trilogy overall, and I still liked the 3rd book.
B0046H95RM|5.0|This is a very well thought out book. The plot is simple but the story hinges on a good twist that actually makes sense. Would definitely recommend it to crime solving/thriller and suspense fans.

Dan Brown takes an actual clandestine group of people, real places, art of priceless value, and the Catholic religion and ties all of it together in a way that is in the end is so simple, so logical in fact, that it's hard not to believe.

0802473156|5.0|I'm not all that big on self-help books, although I've also read some of Dr. Gray's Mars/Venus books to help me better understand how and why men and women are so different, and to embrace those differences and re-learn communication and conflict-resolution skills.<br />This book by Dr. Chapman is entirely different and just as effective, in a different way. My boyfriend's son had sent it to him a year before we met, when he (my BF) and his wife were about to split up, hoping that it might help and maybe they'd reconcile. My BF read it cover-to-cover, loved it, learned from it, and, while it didn't save his marriage (his wife was leaving him for her new boyfriend no matter what), he highly recommended it to me and I bought it the next day. Wow, am I glad I did! It's an easy read and makes so much sense. We all have our own &#34;love language&#34; - and if our partner doesn't know it, and expresses his/her love a different way, it may not be the way that we need (and vice versa). My love language is Words of Affirmation (there are 5 major languages, and we all have one primary language that our partner should learn, and we should learn our partner’s). So when he tells me how much he appreciates me, loves me, tells me I look pretty, what a great mom I am, whatever, I positively glow. He also *shows* his love in so many ways, not just with words, so even if he doesn't say it, he shows it, and I appreciate him so much for that (and for so many other things). But because my &#34;language&#34; is Words of Affirmation (probably stemming from my childhood, when I got little to no positive feedback or encouragement), his loving words mean more to me than anything else, even though the other languages are important too. By the way, the 5 Love Languages, according to Dr. Chapman, are: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch (in a non-sexual way, such as spontaneously giving an affectionate hug or squeeze on the arm while passing by, bear hugs, sitting with my legs on his lap while we watch a movie, cuddling – yes, guys, cuddling is great and I’m lucky that my BF loves to do it too – and he’s as masculine as they come!). While the other languages are very important, I determined that my primary language is Words. We all have different primary languages. But I realized that, despite his showing me his love in so many ways, if he never again said &#34;I love you&#34; to me, or told me I'm pretty when we go out, or gives me an atta girl when I accomplish something important to me, etc., I'd feel that something major was missing (and in the book you'll read about how we all need our Love Tanks filled and the way to fill them is to speak our partner’s language regularly – that sounds silly maybe, but the book puts it into logical context). Quality time (one of the languages) doesn't mean simply being in the same room watching TV together; it means things like sitting down and talking (and listening) to each other without multi-tasking (texting, glancing at the score on TV, reading the paper, etc.), even if only 20 minutes a day. Important? Absolutely. Acts of Service: I’d bought a house last summer and when my BF was over the other day he saw an 8-foot extension ladder in my family room and asked me about it. I told him that the light bulb in the ceiling fan in my 2-story family room had burned out and I needed the ladder to reach it. The ladder was still there last night and the bulb not yet changed because when I’d climbed up and tried to remove the fixture cover, the screws were too tight so I gave it up that night, planning to go up again the next day with a wrench, pliers or other grip to loosen them, but I hadn’t had a chance to yet. So without a word last night, he got right up on the ladder and unscrewed it for me (I love a strong man!). I was grateful, absolutely, yet I also could have done it myself, so Acts of Service isn’t my primary language, though it’s still important. Receiving Gifts isn't my language either, although of course I appreciate them. Physical Touch: that comes naturally to both of us so it wasn't even a consideration since we both do it regularly. Therefore, Words are my primary language. As for my BF, turns out that's his language too, which doesn't always happen that way; most of us have different love languages. Anyway, sorry to go on and on, but I highly recommend this book, whether you're embarking on a new relationship or want to rekindle an existing one that may need a new spark.<br /><br />My grateful thanks to my BF's son, who sent him the book, otherwise I wouldn't have known about it. (By the way, just learning what each other's language is isn't enough. That's only the first step. From there, Dr. Chapman goes on to share how to actually speak the language, to put it into practice. My relationship was fantastic from the start, and knowing what I know now from reading this well-written book will help ensure it stays that way! So stop thinking about it: Add it to your cart! :)  (And thank you, Dr. Chapman!)ifts isn't my language either, although of course I appreciate them.

0446343129|5.0|I recommend this book because of the amount of research that was done and the useful factual data that is presented. It would take ages to have done all that useful research. Unfortunatley there is unnecessary stuff near the beginning that one needs to gloss over. But if you do that and get to the middle of the book it's really a good read.
B003ZWTGKU|4.0|Magnificent voices, perfect interpretation, but stage production very dark and very poor. Kaufmann is indeed the great voice of our times.
B003D87PGS|4.0|A story told from different perspective is always so much richer and interesting. The murder of a child is always terrible but sometimes get lost among the other stories on the news - this book give you insight into the emotions involved - from several angles. definitely worth a read.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I gave this a 4-star rating because the information was useful, practical, and to the point. If you believe you are not &#34;creative&#34; you should read this book. If you need a quick refresher course on stirring up your creativity, this is a book to read.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|What a thoroughly enjoyable book. Written from different perspectives, it give the reader insight into a normally secret world. Money and time well spent.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I got thisti play around with and after beating all the maps, my two year old son stole my phone and laid waste to each level. He likes to target the peasants and calls them butterflies when they die. He's learning a lot about cause and effect with the different kinds of ammunition.
B002U3CCBK|4.0|I always think, since time is so precious, that a book should teach you something about life - in this case what the right attitude may achieve. Time well spent.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a must have tool for any smart device. I would like to see different interfaces, but other than that no complaints.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Bought it for &#34;Pumped up Kicks&#34; and found I liked the whole album.  Really pleasant music all around.  Good travel music, too.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was an awesome movie. I grew up under President Carter...he was the worst ever before the current one at 1600 pensylvania ave...<br /><br />Very intense, great music, acting, all of it was great. In fact the best movie I have seen in several years. I highly reccommend it!
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I was too young to know &#34;The Animals&#34; in the sixties, but, I heard a lot of their music played in the seventies, and liked it. So when Eric Burdon appeared and performed on David Letterman, I was impressed that this guy could still make rockin&#34; relevant music. Good &#34;Road trip&#34; music, can listen to entire C.D. without wanting to skip any tracks.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's experience is so beautifully validating!  We are so much more than we believe ourselves to be, and this story opens us up to so much knowledge.  Even if you are a skeptic now, with an open mind your viewpoint will change.

0316044695|5.0|Very powerful story. It's amazing how Marcus survived and a tragedy how the others did not. He did a wonderful job paying tribute to his teammates and letting everyone know about their heroic actions. The stories of humanity that Marcus writes about are also very touching. Whenever there is a part about Gulab, you'll probably find yourself smiling. These men are such heroes and we are so lucky to have men and women like this defending our country. As they say, \\"home of the free because of the brave.\\"
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I am supposedly level seven.  I have the Springboks Lions and Elephants. Had to hunt down two elephants.  Ran out of gas in the Rescue Vehicle twice. Then I got a quest to breed the Elephants for a baby. I was thrilled that it was only 20 minutes. I wasn't. thrilled when 20 minutes later the game had &quot;forgotten &quot; that I had rescued a 2nd Elephant already,  ran out of gas twice doing so, and there was no baby coming,  either. I tried again, rescued yet another Elephant, made another baby,  and set my watch alarm for 20 minutes.  When it beeped, I eagerly checked,  only to find that my 2nd Elephant was not there again, and again, no baby in the nursery.  I am deleting this trainwreck NOW!
0062014536|5.0|This is definitely one of my more favorite series because the overall plot is unique and I have grown to love the characters.  Unfortunately, the last book of the series didn't really leave me feeling satisfied.  I feel like it lacked a concrete ending but at the same time, the author may have meant to leave the ending open ended like that.  I gave it a high rating because overall I feel like the series is quite accomplished.  Just don't expect that epic conclusion.  It is a conclusion nonetheless but it doesn't necessarily end with a resounding bang.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not one to be interested in zombies whatsoever, the kids told us we had to watch it.  Well, here we are already waiting for next season!  Excellent stories, and character development.  I cannot wait to see what's in store for Rick, Carl, the baby, Daryl, and Carol.  If you haven't started watching this series - I strongly recommend that you start from the beginning, Season 1 and plan your weekend accordingly.
146500632X|5.0|The only thing I don't like is that the pictures are pretty outdated.  But I love my boys in any shape, way or form so it's no biggie!  The quality of the calendar is great overall!  Nice, sturdy, calendar material and the pictures are crystal clear.  Recommended for every directioner
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Enya has three songs that I really like.  Orico, Caribbean Blue<br />and Only Time.  The price is worth is just for those songs.<br />The other songs are good.  Unique sound.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|It's Star Trek what else can I say, a great update to the 1960's special effects. The color looks better and clear picture.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Take a good storyline and completely trash it.  This was the biggest waste of film that i have ever rented.  Save your self some time money and effort and watch ICE age or something credible.
B00062PN6I|5.0|This is a good product. I use it in my recording studio. To me it looks a little better on the picture but it gets the job done.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|I have enjoyed the earlier Step-Up movies for the simple reasons that the dancing is incredible.  They perform things with fluidity that I've never seen anywhere else and it is quite impressive.  While they follow a basic boy meets girl type storyline (hard to do anything else for this genre), it is fast paced, the dancing is actually pushed up a notch and visually it has stunning moments.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|How can you not love this movie I wished it ended differently but non the less very good 2 thumbs up
B002WV5A9G|5.0|While some TV shows have been redone simply as remakes, the nice thing about Star Trek is that we have a plausible and intelligent reason why history for the Star Trek Universe will change, without throwing away our well loved characters.  Some die hard fans will complain about the changes but this is unreasonable as then we would be stuck with just repeats of the same stories already told.  The acting is fun and they have several scenes where you can tell the actors are trying to sound like their 1960s counterparts without all of the weakness of being in a 1960s TV show.  I grew up watching the original series as a kid, loved Star Trek the Next Generation the first several seasons until it started feeling trapped in biases/prejudices of the time.  When Enterprise came out I enjoyed it as fresh and yet still within a familiar universe that would eventually give us Kirk and Spock and Chekov.  This movie manages to feel nostalgic and yet completely fresh.  The only negative thing that stood out watching the film was the rebellious kid in trouble scene (being vague to avoid any spoilers) because while it helped establish a character's background, it seemed too forced and abrupt--a minor blip in an otherwise fun film.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|Season 1 seemed to be about kings and politics and tangible concerns, right until the last episode.<br /><br />Season 2 reveals more of the magical aspects of the series.  I felt like this season had a lot of pieces moving around just to get them in place for what will happen in Season 3.  It did not seem as dark as the second book, but I still struggle with watching so much violence.  You know what you are getting with this show in that regard.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The books were great and this show has actually followed them pretty closely.  Peter Dinklage is amazing.  The show is well made and never strays into the ridiculus with the material.  Not for children, as there is lots of gratuitous nudity and sex.  However, much of the sex is used during exposition, which I find funny.
0060936223|5.0|This is one of most touching accounts of platonic friendship that I've ever read. Strange,  because Patti Smith (rock star/poet) and Robert Maplethorpe (photographer) are heterosexual and homosexual respectively. Well at least they come to discover as much about themselves. They start out in a romantic relationship that's thwarted when Robert realizes his sexual persuasion, but still their bond remains strong. They are soul mates, wholly devoted to each other and to their work - finding their way in the turbulent artistic waters of the 1960s, 70s and 80s. They are poor, starving, directionless people but they never give up, never stop dabbling until they find what they are best at. Theirs is really an inspiring journey, all the more so because they make it together. It's a love story in a sense - I've heard it called that - but not a romantic one. Instead, this story makes you realize how much love is actually inherent in friendship and how the boundaries of acceptance can stretch and bend to new proportions. Patti never begrudges Robert his sexuality, though she feels surprised and hurt when he first comes out - and she never sees him strictly in that lens. Essentially to her, he doesn't change - there's so much about him to cleave to and respect. And their vow - to never betray or abandon one another no matter what - carries them through the decades, enabling them to weather anything.<br /><br />I did have some issues with this book - but mostly because the events discussed occurred before my time. There are tons of cultural references in here - people, places and things I'd never heard of. Smith name-drops nearly every other sentence and does so in a tone that suggests I should, of course, know who she's talking about. This alienated me so that I started skimming sections, my eyes glazing over a bit. But there's still a lot of poignancy to the book, which epitomizes the artist's struggle - the perennial search for one's truest self.
B004SBX112|5.0|It's only 99 cents and worth the peace of mind.  The ads would pop up almost every other time I switched screens.  It got to be extremely irritating, which is not what I want in a game.  So I paid so I wouldn't have to see those stupid ads any more.
1439152802|5.0|I enjoyed this one so much I didn't want it to end! Kate Morton has always been a \\"guilty pleasure author\\" of mine - though I'm not sure what I have to feel guilty about. Morton tells deeply engaging tales; you know that phrase you see on the cover of books - \\"compulsively readable?' - well, this one is. I enjoyed it so much every time I dipped into it. The writing is luscious, the plot forever unfolding and best of all there was a twist I never saw coming at the end. Usually I feel manipulated when authors do that, but here it felt right - the product of a good writerly work ethic: Morton wasn't going to abandon her characters to a conventional ending - she was going to keep the tension taunt and the story unpredictable until the last page.<br /><br />The book is a bit long but not in a tedious way. It's a great one to take on vacation with you or enjoy during dismal weather - like the blizzard we're supposed to be getting here in NY this weekend.<br /><br />Enjoy this new one from Morton! And if you haven't read The Forgotten Garden, my favorite of hers, pick that one up too!
B009AP2G26|5.0|I was a drama/band geek in high school and this show reminds me of the stuff we used to do.  It's fun to watch and the music is amazing.  Be sure to get their mp3's on iTunes.  This show is current, edgy, and innovative.  Glee addresses issues that other shows won't touch.  Well worth the watch.
0525478817|4.0|I'd been hearing a lot of good things about this book - I thought it was be profound, transformative and very deep given the subject - two teens who fall in love while battling cancer. I know, I know depressing. But I thought it would give me a refreshing, life-altering perspective.<br /><br />Once read...well...it was a disappointment. Though others said they cried all over their Ipad (or Nook, or Kindle or good old-fashioned page) I didn't shed a tear while reading this book. I kept waiting to cry, waiting to feel but...nothing. And I'm pregnant and hormonal, so what does that tell you?!<br /><br />I think the problem was I couldn't connect to the characters. They speak in really obtuse voices - kind of like the way the kids of Dawson's Creek used to sound - insightful, intelligent but totally not true to life (or their ages!) There is humor but it's sardonic and you just feel like their whole schpeel is fake. Kit Steinkelner of Book Riot agrees with me and I'll include her review here (scroll all the way down for it) because we had almost identical reactions. What about the romance, you ask? I read enough Lurlene McDaniel growing up. And quite frankly, she did it better.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game requires no real skill. It's a great way to kill some time or wind down after a hard day. I would caution against selling prizes to buy coins. I usually just play until I run out of coins and by the time I am ready to play again my coins have fully regenerated. My one major complaint is that the game froze on me once and when it was fixed I had to start over from the beginning as opposed to the level I was already on.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Me and all my friends love to play it. I still cant get past the jigsaw one . Ive worked on it for days! But still very fun.
B002RXMG00|5.0|Still think Tony Perkins is the best Sick  B@#*^&d ever! Not sure why I chose HD other than habit but the sound was probably better.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Completely addictive, great acting, great show, amazing story lines that take their time to develop. once I started I couldn't stop watching!
B001VNB54A|5.0|Maybe not as good as Band of Brothers, but still an amazing and well put together mini series. The packaging for this set is the best I have ever seen. If there is an award for best packaging of a DVD or Blu-Ray set, I hope this one was the winner. Truly amazing sound quality. HBO is king when it comes to the mini series.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Man, there is not much to say about Clutch that hasn't been said already.  All I can say about Earth Rocker is that it delivers on it's promise:  it shakes and rocks the earth with a steady dose of rock n' roll, only as Clutch knows how to do.  If you haven't picked this record up yet, don't wait.  Better yet, go see them when they come to town.  You will only be disappointed when the show is done and you'll have to wait until next time.  Rock on!
0307341577|5.0|Gillian Flynn is a master of the non-linear narrative structure and organizes multiple perspectives (which can oftentimes confuse the reader) in a coherent, easy to understand format at the beginning of each chapter. I could not put this book down. I read this right after her most recent novel, Gone Girl, which was positively gripping. So, I went on to read her first book, Sharp Objects. The only problem is that I'm having a hard time finding other books in the genre that I enjoy as much as hers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not in the habit of writing reviews, but every once in a while an author comes along and totally knocks it out of the ball park. Hugh Howey has done just that with WOOL OMNIBUS! Silence is no longer an option. I'm as compelled to share this work as I was to read it. The characters are deeply realistic and relatable, the plot is deliciously intriguing, and the storyline lures one in to a world that feels completely alien and eerily familiar at the same time. Hugh Howey's WOOL is not only an incredibly powerful book, it also makes one question the world around us and the way we live within it. Not many current authors manage that feat. Did I mention the caliber of writing? Top notch. Howey comes out of the shadows of the bench and hits a home run. Other than that, I refuse to give anything away on this one. Just read it. It's that good.
0307341550|5.0|A great first effort by a brilliant writer. The plot twists were stunning and the prose was full and descriptive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was a great season! So many twists and turns, every episode was riverting. So thankful that it was available.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was just so interesting to read. I could not stop reading it. I think it was very well writen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game should have all of the blocks in creative that are out. I found more items in survival. Also this app could use multiplayer mode so you can play with other people not using your Internet Connection. But this is still an amazing game.<br /><br />Posted on: 4/11/13 11:39 P.M.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it is the best game in the entire world you can get new ponies and houses plus you can play games  too
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I waited to see this on TV and I'm glad I did.  While the book was not for the squimish, at least there was a fuzzy story line.  The movie jumps into the action with only a brief introduction.  In some misleading action, the camera delicately averts its eye at the possibility of a young deer being killed by a bow-hunting Katniss--no such luck when she is (and the other \\"tributes\\") are aiming at each other.<br /><br />If you enjoy seeing kids goaded into murdering each other in inventively gruesome ways, this is your movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love it!! it is a game that teaches young kids how to generally be responsible and take care of horses.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|I'm not one to enjoy seeing movies a second time, but have watched this many times over the years and love it each time.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Not hideous, but not very good, either. People get rich pumping out the same-old, same-old. Sparks has found a nice little vein of gold to mine for the rest of his life. It's not for me.
B005N09L5C|2.0|I remember loving this book when I ready it - many, many years ago and was it excited to see the movie when I found it on amazon.  It was very disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Big lead-up, big lead-up, big lead-up, he did --- to my --- and it felt so --- big lead-up, big lead-up, big lead-up, he did --- to my --- and it felt so --- . What is this, mad libs? This is a poorly-written book with simple-minded sexual descriptions. It amazes me that anyone would buy the second or third volume.
1400079276|5.0|This is a complicated story. Yet the flow of the writing is simple. At no moment while reading this book did I feel I was losing the plot and that was important for me if I wanted to truly realize the magnificance of the story.<br /><br />Its hard to say what the story is about. For each reader it will have a different meaning. For me it was about redemption, responsibility and the natural order of things. Every character in the story, regardless of how big or small his part, had a reason for existing. The writer created Spinoza's view of life in a metaphysical setting that will most certainly awe readers.<br /><br />This novel will one day gain the same status as Franz Kafka's metamorphosis.
B00867GKIK|3.0|The movie was ok but not great.Compared to movies like despicable me and The incredibles it takes a back seat.Not enough funny moments as I had hope.That said,my daughter loved it.
0060899190|5.0|I bought this book to go with living room books - large, hard back books that are mostly pictures that visitors can dive into if they're waiting on something. I wanted to have only interesting books - nothing like typical coffee table books - as I'm not really a coffee table person. This book fit that perfectly. I love the originality of the book. All these confessions from people. It helps you realize that we are all a little weird and messed up. And it's great to see that honesty, knowing that somewhere, just writing a postcard helped someone get something off their chest. Highly recommend!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show strikes a great balance between single-episode legal cases and long-term story arcs focusing on Alicia's family and her husband's criminal case.  Characters are complex -- especially firm investigator Calinda -- and their intertwined pasts are slowly connecting as the season moves on.  Absolutely love the show!
0988178532|5.0|I am the type of person who usually reads 3 books at a time; one on the nightstand, one in the bathroom, and one on the coffee table. For the first time in years, this book followed me to all of my reading locations. Outview kept me captivated from beginning to end, and I truly didn't want to put the book down. I love how history and spirituality were intermingled into the story almost making the story plausible. Legg took believable concepts, and then he twisted them to a point which pushed the boundaries of my imagination to weave an amazing tale. I for one can't wait for the 2nd book!
1469984202|5.0|Simply stated above, and a great self publishing success story to go along with it.<br /><br />Hugh Howey's vision of a dystopian future yields not only a uniquely great story, but some of the finest characterizations to grace the post-apocalyptic genre.  Written as a series of novellas, this is the first five installments collected into one Omnibus edition, with two more story arcs following, The Shift series, which was recently finished and a worthy successor, and a final arc Howey is currently working on that will bring the two together and complete the series.<br /><br />This series gets my highest recommendation, smooth, seamless writing, an uniquely intriguing story, great characters, and just an overall great ride!
B000FA675C|5.0|Great book! I could not put it down. Dan Brown is an excellent author. I have read all of his books and cannot wait for the next installment in the Da Vinci Code series.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are a pleasant way to survive a wait. music is annoying. new games slow in coming.overall a decent app especially for children.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a prek teacher slightly addicted to finding great ideas to implement in my classroom!  And it keeps everything organized so I know how to find what I need.
B00284G2JE|4.0|Nice thick, heavy sounds from the 90's.  They obviously liked what they liked and I like what they liked so I like liking something that I can actually like.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Never put this one down.  Very entertaining and he stays true to his format of a quick read, and a guilty pleasure.  Not meant to be a heady, Faulkner type novel.  Certainly doesn't bring out shades of David Foster Wallace.  It is what it is.  Entertainment, and well crafter story momentum.  Look forward to Inferno which comes out May 14th.
B007KWD7BK|5.0|I really respect the way some bands commit to a sound and just keep on going with it.  The album is weird and long, and I can't understand what the guy is singing most of the time, but the overall sound is great.  Heavy, thick guitars, pounding and droning along in a magnum opus.  Not for everyone I guess, but I dig it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I got in on Downton Abbey starting the third season. I started watching it on the internet and then couldn't get all of season 2 free so I purchased it. I enjoy getting it delivered right to my computer and I didn't miss any of the episodes.
B00BU18U82|5.0|This game igot me through a  5 hour airplane flight and I am still not bored of it.  I strongly recommend this game to anyone that likes simulators.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This version doesn't follow Austen's book to the T.  They have also taken on some liberties of their own. But isn't that the thing for films to do?  Every adaption, opinion, and writing is not the same, nor should it be.  This version has it's own \\"individual stamp\\" on it.  I have read the book about six years ago, so I am rusty.  But I read this book more than Austen's others.<br /><br />I bought the '95 version on iTunes a few years ago.  That version may have been verbatim to the book, but it just made the story dull and boring.  I saw the movie three times and it was not a charm (twice with iTunes and once on Amazon).  I was very disappointed that I deleted the download.  I didn't believe that Hinds and Root were in love with each other and the pacing of the film was very slow.<br /><br />This 2007 version was a nice change.  The acting was believable.  I really liked Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins as a couple.  Sally isn't model gorgeous but real.  She is who I imagined when I read the book.  She looks \\"homely\\" with a faint past existence of possessing beauty.  Rupert is now my forth favorite Austen hero actor (Colin Firth, Jeremy Northam and Johnny Lee Miller my first three faves).<br /><br />I liked this version the most.  The characters were a lot more likeable and believable.  The pacing of the movie ran smoothly and wasn't boring.  And the photography was perfect.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This app is terrific - it's a lot like the classic game that used to come on pc's. The levels get progressively more challenging. Both timed and untimed options can be played. Graphics are clean and the game actions are responsive to touch. This one is a keeper.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|A little quote from the movie that I feel depicts Austen's satire to Gothic Romance perfectly.<br /><br />\\"[Riding in the curricle, Henry and Catherine see the first view of Northanger Abbey]<br />Henry Tilney: There.<br />Catherine Morland: It's exactly as I imagined. It's just like what we read about.<br />Henry Tilney: Are you prepared to encounter all of its horrors?<br />Catherine Morland: Horrors? Is Northanger haunted, then?<br />Henry Tilney: That's just the least of it. Dungeons, and sliding panels; skeletons; strange, unearthly cries in the night that pierce your very soul!<br />Catherine Morland: [sardonically] Any vampires? Don't say vampires. I could bear anything, but not vampires.<br />Henry Tilney: [laughing] Miss Morland, I believe you are teasing me now. [seriously] I have to say, there is a kind of vampirism. No, let's just say that all houses have their secrets, and Northanger is no exception.\\"<br /><br />I have not seen any other adaptions of Austen's Northanger Abbey, so I am a little prejudice in really liking the 2007 version.  The casting was great.  The photography was perfect, even if they didn't really film in Bath.  The speed and character development kept true.  The storyline might have had some discrepancies but not too noticeable.<br /><br />JJ Fields and Felicity Jones were a perfect fit.  I believed the chemistry between the two.  Their acting was well done.  JJ Fields plays perfectly as the hero, Henry Tilney.  Hugh O'Conor was perfect as Catherine's military brother, James Morland.  And Carey Mulligan was perfect as the protagonist, Isabella Thorpe.<br /><br />I am very happy that I purchased thus dvd.  This is a great adaption.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice big screen. Basic calculator that works well. Downloaded for my kindle fire and comes in handy when a math problem comes up.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is a four part mini series of Jane Austen's \\"Emma.\\"  I find the 4 hour length to be just fine because I felt that it followed the book nicely.  It's a cute romantic version that I bought on iTunes.  I'he seen this the most out of all the Austen movies.<br /><br />Romola Garai portrays a good Emma.  She's stared in movies like [[ASIN:B0013XZ6X4 Atonement (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00023BLXK Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights]].  Romola can portray naive innocence and cheerfulness attitude with the perfect amount of matchmaker busy-body attitude.  I think Romola is a perfect match for Emma.<br /><br />Johnny Lee Miller plays a perfect Mr. Knightly.  He's more known for his acting in [[ASIN:B0057ZAA6W Trainspotting]] and [[ASIN:6305047456 Hackers]].  I love Johnny and his acting is really good.  He has shined in all the shows (Elementary) and movies he's stared in.  He is about 40 years old and he still has this gorgeous baby face.<br /><br />All together, the cast is great with each other.  I recommend this movie.

B00B1EEKM8|5.0|This recent blu-ray release of JURASSIC PARK (probably my favorite movie of all-time) has a great new transfer.  The film has never looked better.  Glad the U.S. finally got a great release of this classic film!

B007MJSYF0|4.0|A very good film. At times they have a tendency to slow things down and even reverse the original theme, but ultimately the battle for survival is driven through quite well.

B0067EKY7M|5.0|As I'm getting older I'm finding it  harder to enjoy the Hollywood block busters and its becoming less and less often I enjoy new movies. But this movie was so different and very very enjoyable. Ewan McGregor is out standing playing this part . Its just a lovely enjoyable movie no matter what kind of movies your into. I would highly recommend Salmon Fishing in the Yemen as an all rounder movie for all to enjoy
B00136NYR6|5.0|Just the way I remembered it. I had it on my machine in just a few minutes and on a CD to put in my truck. The price was great and it sounded just like the record that it came out on.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|What a great ending to the Bella and Edward love story. The book is so much better than the movie and it does not contradict the story as the movie does (in the movie Alce &#34;sees&#34; the wolves and yet we know she cannot see them...oopsie lol). A must read if you are a fan of Bella and Edward!

B00BF11STU|4.0|If you are interested enough to consider seeing ZERO DARK THIRTY in the first place, you will almost certainly find it worthwhile. Just pick a time when you have 2.5 hours and a good bit of patience to spare. The acting, script, and cinematography are all quite good, and Jessica Chastain gives a strong performance as CIA Agent \\"Maya,\\" generally quiet and low-key but utterly driven in her pursuit of high-level Al-Queda operatives and ultimately, Osama Bin Laden himself.<br /><br />Two problem areas:<br /><br />--Pacing: The first half shows a lot of CIA interrogations, coercion, and bit-by-bit uncoverings of details over the course of eight years. The key events toward the end all happen a little too quickly, and consequently, it seems, too easily. It also stops short in some crucial spots: I don't want to spoil anything, but I think you'll see what I mean. It's entirely possible that the producers were in a hurry to get this out while the events were still fresh on people's minds, hence the lopsided feel of the film. ZERO DARK THIRTY's creators had a long, hard story to tell, but nevertheless, it seems they could have found some ways to add excitement.<br /><br />--Scope: Perhaps intentionally, in order to show the arduous process the CIA went through, there aren't a lot of changes in scenery here. Most of ZERO DARK THIRTY takes place in various CIA headquarters and interrogation rooms. Certain key political and military figures are conspicuously absent, omissions that I'm sure were made because of the recency of these events and a desire to avoid politicization. Still, more of an overview of the roles that other U.S.  agencies, America in general, Pakistan, and the rest of the Middle East played here would also have made this a better film.<br /><br />I haven't done any fact-checking, but as oversimplified as parts of this film are, I'm sure it has some major inaccuracies; e.g., Just who IS \\"Maya\\" anyway? Does she have a last name?<br /><br />Yet, for all my quibbles, I found ZERO DARK THIRTY riveting, as I think most American audiences will find it, and am glad to have seen it. A few years down the road, when these events are more history and less current news, I hope that someone will make a more detailed and all-inclusive dramatization of the hunt for bin Laden.es, I found ZERO DARK THIRTY riveting, as I think most American audiences will find it, and am glad to have seen it.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|i like how you can search for a key words or basically type in a situation your in and it gives you parts of the bible that relate to it.<br />i dont like how you cant look up words in a dictionary while your in the app you have to get out of the app and search for the words in a separate app.<br />I do like the verse of the day and it seems like it has alot of other perks like plans, notes profiles, live chat with other people but it wants you to  set up account with them havent tried that part but it seems like i really didnt want make a account for this.<br />i say about 20 to 30 percent of the time i have trouble getting the app to start up but all in all its ok it might even be better if i made an account.

LOVED IT  Julie H and Tim G

B005HEVBGG|4.0|Season 1 can be summarized as &#34;you can't wave your arms around in the delta-quadrant without smacking an anomaly&#34;.  It's fun to observe that the folks playing the role of 24th-century humans are carrying around the equivalent of tablets and using touch-screen consoles, and we thought how cool that was in the mid-nineties when the show was filmed.  I'm looking forward to the iReplicator.

For the first time in my life, while reading this book, I had to set the book down because I was laughing so hard I was in tears.<br /><br />The kindle edition is my fourth purchase of this book. I have a paperback copy and I also bought two copies for my son and a friend.<br /><br />GOOD OMENS is thought provoking, insightful and comical. When I read the kindle edition, it will be about the sixth time I've read it. While I have read many of Pratchett's books a couple of times, this one stands out. No other book have I read this much, with exception to perhaps, Dr. Suess in my youth.<br /><br />The characters are so alive and the end of the world never looked so good. I recommend this book to everyone!

B009B8YZIK|4.0|For a low-budget movie this was remarkably well done.<br /><br />If you were a fan of the Battlestar Galactica series then you should like this movie.  The movie had the same &#34;feel&#34; as far as the scenery, the props, the acting and the action shots were concerned.  Even some of the actors from Battlestar Galactica starred in this movie.<br /><br />The basic storyline is fairly simple to follow although there are a few spots where they could have done better (Like Cortana's borderline insane ramblings at the very beginning of the movie).  The producers of the movie obviously make the assumption that anyone watching this movie would be familiar with the games and therefore they don't make much of an attempt to explain some things.  With just a few minor 'tweaks' this movie could very easily have stood on its own merit as a sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Whether you've ever played the Halo video games or not, this is an entertaining sci-fi movie.<br /><br />There are plenty of examples of successful movie series that were based on video games.  With a few slight adjustments to this storyline (drop the assumptions that everyone who is watching this has played Halo before), then they could make an excellent series of movies on this character.  There is a sad lack of quality sci-fi movies out there.  This could (and should) be made into a series.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood is a fascinating figure -- he made several low-budget movies that have become cult classics, despite having no talent or understanding of how to make a movie. He just loved film.<br /><br />And director Tim Burton clearly has a lot of respect for that love. \\"Ed Wood\\" follows the director during the, um, best part of his career, as well as his friendship with the fallen horror actor Bela Lugosi. This is one of the best films that Burton has ever made -- a slightly cartoonish tale about an optimistic, energetic man who wouldn't let anything stand in his way.<br /><br />When playwright Ed Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp) hears about a schlocky sex-change movie, he convinces a producer to let him direct the movie... because he's a transvestite. No, I don't quite  understand the logic. Then he strikes up a friendship Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau),  whose drug addictions have destroyed his career. But Wood blithely casts his idol in the movie, determined to give him the recognition he deserves.<br /><br />After \\"Glen and Glenda\\" bombs, Wood starts searching for independent funding for his next movie, \\"Bride of the Atom\\" -- only to encounter a lot of personal and financial disasters, including being dumped by his girlfriend and Lugosi's suicidal depression.<br /><br />The next movie -- initially called \\"Grave Robbers From Outer Space\\" -- seems to be going well at first, especially since Ed has found love with Kathy (Rosanna Arquette). But then things begin to spiral off into disaster when Ed must contend with a tragic death and recalcitrant Baptists who don't understand Wood's vision. Will this movie finally crush Ed Wood's spirit?<br /><br />\\"Ed Wood\\" is a strangely touching movie, especially since it focuses on the early part of Wood's career, before he spiraled into alcoholism and weird porn. This Wood is an enthusiastic optimist who believes deeply in his artistic goals. And his unlikely friendship with Lugosi forms the heart and soul of the movie -- Wood's innocent admiration of the fallen star gives him some lease on life.<br /><br />This is Burton before he lapsed into self-parody territory -- while there's an oddly cartoonish quality to some scenes (the octopus falling on Tor), it's the most realistic movie he has ever done. The black-and-white filming and slightly over-the-top acting give it a weird quality at times, but the more somber parts are hauntingly sad and realistic, such as when Wood finds a suicidal, depressed Lugosi.<br /><br />This adds a poignant undercurrent to what is otherwise a rather funny movie. There are a lot of hilarious moments (\\"You must be double-jointed. And you must be Hungarian\\"), particularly when we see Wood's \\"big picture\\" method of filmmaking.<br /><br />Johnny Depp gives one of his all-time best performances here as Wood -- he's a bright-eyed, eternally optimistic creature who adores film and wants to make glorious schlock himself. There's just something very endearing about his innocent depiction of Wood, and it makes you root for him even though his movies are notoriously bad. You really want him to succeed.<br /><br />But Depp is frequently eclipsed by Martin Landau, who gives a truly heartbreaking performance as Bela Lugosi -- he captures all the sorrow of a talented man who has been chewed up and spit out of the Hollywood system, because of a drug addiction that no one except Wood will help him with. When people start recognizing him in the street and asking for his autograph -- all because of Wood -- it warms your heart.<br /><br />\\"Ed Wood\\" is a delightfully funny movie with a tragic undercurrent -- and the brilliant performances by Depp and Landau make it a truly beautiful experience.

B000FA675C|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Not only is the story compelling and expertly told, it is imaginative, well thought out and meticulously researched.

B003UD7JEE|5.0|I have to admit: this show COMPLETELY took me by surprise! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this show while seemingly searching in vain for something to watch on Netflix. We, like many of the other users of the site, DEVOUR television series like it's our job. It was my turn to select what we were going to watch and I was fighting to start Damages. My boyfriend resisted and I handed over controller to him and he landed on Nikita. I was initially wary of the show. I had seen promos for it in the CW while watching Supernatural and it was always one of those shows I INTENDED to watch, but never got around to. About to push it aside again, my boyfriend persisted and we began watching the first episode. By the time it ended the two of us were sitting forward in our seats and when the credits began to roll we turned to each other, mouths open.<br /><br />This show is action packed almost from the very first moments until the end. The first few episodes are lacking some humor, but a third of the way into the series they realize this and it becomes even more enjoyable. I can not believe that I ever resisted this show. It has been one of the only shows that causes my boyfriend and I to yell in reaction to something or scream in frustration when something goes wrong. We are now completely caught up and watching the third season each week and PRAYING it gets renewed for a fourth. This is a series that keeps getting better and better with age. Just when we think that the writers can't possibly think of something new, they do and it's AMAZING.<br /><br />By the third season, the core group of characters are wonderful and blend in well together. This is definitely a show that I intend to watch until the very end. I honestly hope it gets a few more seasons. If you are on the fence about this show, just jump. Watch it. The first few episodes are a little shaky, but believe me, the rest of the series more than makes up for it!<br /><br />(Random side note: My boyfriend and I rescueda German Shepard last week; a gorgeous girl we named NIKITA!)

B0050VI5SI|5.0|If you are looking for the ultimate genre crossing ultra pop album this is it.  Every song is amazing and you'll find yourself quickly forgetting the single Pumped Up Kicks as it is obscured by the non-stop catchy amazingness of every other track.  Houdini, Helena Beat, and Call it What You Want are nothing short of addictive.  A written description fails to accurately describe this album.  Simply put, its an album you need to own.

While delving into the more personal story of Harvey Dent the story also builds on the Falcone / Maroni gangs and the events that lead up to Dent's fall from defender of justice to cold blooded killer.  This book will not disappoint delivering on both plot and art.

B005ORVMT2|1.0|Just seems like another money-grab from Mercury Records to appease Rush fans. I understand this is a good way to ring in more fresh meat. Personally, after hearing some samples, I'm with the opinion that this stuff should simply be left alone. This is getting worse than the redundant trash you get from Beatles releases. The mixes/masters totally damage the goods. How many times do we thing that remastering these old albums is going to get better? I'm selling mine as soon as I can.

B00170I7GG|5.0|Spoiler alert-A timeless story about a man who has a bad attitude on life until he meets the woman of the depths of his heart. God (obviously, who else?) makes him have the same day over and over until he is the man of this woman's dreams. Hilarious, memorable (Ned, Ryerson!), classic. A must for any movie-buff.
B001GMQALY|3.0|Great movie if you looking for sensuality and seduction.  This movie is like a PG version of the Shades of Grey trilogy.

B003L16FAE|4.0|This review goes to the quality of the Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-ray. I did not own the previous Blu-ray transfer, but the reviews of that version ubiquitously deplore the poor quality - graininess - of that edition.<br /><br />In stark contrast, the Ultimate Hunter Edition underwent extensive computerized enhancement. That too has been decried, but apparently, given the previous transfer, which indicates the film stock itself was not in particularly good shape, the choice to radically improve video quality should instead be applauded.<br /><br />The image quality is good, even though, doubtlessly, detail was lost, along with the insufferable graininess. Face shots sometimes look plasticized.<br /><br />But the jungle shots, and most of the movie, look great. This edition is Blu-ray quality. All things considered, if you like this movie, this is easily the edition to own.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is hilarious and it really really makes a lot of sense nothing better read when bored -_- Rick riordan is Asome :O)
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The group continues to get themselves into bad situations by making really dumb decisions. And I think Rick finds some good acid because he be trippin. Enjoy!
1451696191|5.0|So i personally love this book alot and im glad i read it!!!! Alot of these reveiws are saying it promotes homosexuality and its disgusting and afful and dont let teenagers read it well i disagree it is a more mature read for teens i would say like age 16 and up would be good i mean its for 12 year olds because it does deal with mature subject matter such as homosexuality,rape,abortion,suicide and being molested the author is not glorifying it bye any means but the fact of the matter is this stuff happens all the time and this is a book about a kid dealing with the loss of his friends and making friends with two awesome people one of them happend to be gay.And he deals with the fact he saw someone get raped and didnt know that was what it was and he realised he was molested when he was younger its really a good book but like i said mature subject matter
1433523930|5.0|As a teacher of a large adult bible-study group, I use this bible as my primary resource. Due to its large size it is not a bible to carry about, but that is the price you pay for the beautiful, large print. It sits on my desk beside my keyboard, and I can easily read the text as I type. The cover is quite flexible, and the entire book is sturdy and durable.<br /><br />Study notes are extensive, sometimes taking as much space on the page as the text. Maps are excellent, and the notes and commentary are explicitly biblical and authoritative.<br /><br />The ESV Translation is completely modern and readable, but retains much of the poetic beauty of the KJV. I have never enjoyed other modern translations like this one.<br /><br />There is an additional benefit of having free access to the ESV Online Study Bible. This is wonderful for me, as I am able to use these resources in my class for visual presentations of the text, charts, maps, and other resources, The online bible is not downloaded to your computer, but is accessed through the internet. From the site, you can project from your computer or copy and paste into handouts, using a proper attribute.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game enjoy playing and sharing with my girls. Love features never bored something always to do. I'm going to tell all my friends with children that love<br />Horses to get this game it's really look. LOVE IT!!
B00BESM14U|5.0|The undercurrent of the movie was quite dark but there were nice moments about high school in the 80's including Rocky Horror, fascist teachers, mix tapes, football games and fitting in.  The movie is genuine in the sense that it accurately captured these moments and the vulnerability of teens.  I liked the movie and hope you enjoy it also.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|This side project of Nine Inch Nails front man Trent Reznor is addicting to listen to.  My copy arrived a week ago and have listened to it a dozen times already.  As a die-hard NIN fan I was thrilled to hear familiar beats and synth dropped in various tracks.  The lead singer, Mariqueen Maandig, voice lends a hauntingly beautiful touch to the music.  I recommend this album to those that enjoyed NIN's &#34;The Slip&#34; and Trent's soundtrack work.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I have had a lot of fun playing this, but as you progress the game gets more and more difficult until it reaches nearly impossible levels. Power ups and gems are few and far between compared to other Temple Run games, and I think that is intentional - and the intention is to compel you to spend real money buying coins and gems. Sorry, no can do. I'll play Temple Run 2.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is the best Kiss record I've heard in years, not to say I haven't liked the others. \\"Back to the Stone Age\\" reminds me of Gene songs from back in the day. Both the Tommy and Eric songs are really good and again are more classic sounding songs which is probably why I like them so much. I think \\"Long Way Down\\" is my fave Paul track on here. Very Zeppelin-ish. this line up makes solid records and I look forward to hearing more. You can tell they had fun making this which is the point after all...
B00B1R8TCM|3.0|purchased because it was on sale.  Like Charlie Musslewhite so I thought I'd give it a try.  Charlie keeping flying solo
B006UG90RM|4.0|Van Halen has a lot to live up to. Not just what people heard, but what people think they heard. There's a whole lot of teenage memories tied up with those songs and somewhere along the way it becomes hard to separate those experiences from the \\"soundtrack to your life\\". So, I, like a lot of others have that bias to contend with. Having said that, VH created a record that fits their demographic now. This isn't an album for you back in the day. It's an album for the evolved you. Keep that in mind and you will enjoy the ride. Whoo hoo!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Interesting read. I couldn't relate with Cheryl as I am not as independent as she is. I'm also afraid of the dark - but I admire what she was able to do. I love my alone walks in the woods... but I couldn't be alone that much!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I have been using TripAdvisor online for several years and am happy to have an app for my phone and for my Kindle Fire HD.  There is a wealth of information for me when I am planning an international trip.
0783240236|5.0|We love watching old classics such as this. Compared to the scary movies of today, this seems like a Disney flick. It scared the heck out of me when I was 12. Worth watching again.
8674360335|3.0|I purchased this book because my friend, an English teacher, recommended it.  It was ok, but I don't understand all the hype about it.  At times I was shaking my head because the plot was so &#34;off&#34;.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My kids simply loved it. One of the best kids movies out tbere. How can anyone go wrong with Dr. Suess.
B00821OX98|4.0|Very nice. The script could use a bit more imagination, but over all it was satisfactory. I would recommend it to someone else.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Whale Rider is a wonderful tale from New Zealand of 12 year old Pai, born into a Maori culture in which only males are allowed to rise to tribal leader. Sound familiar? Pai believes that she can become tribal leader and sets out to become the legendary Whale Rider, who Maori legend says led them to New Zealand riding atop a whale leading his people. She is determined to make his grandfather proud - in spite of his disappointment at having a daughter for a grandchild instead of a son. The movie explores contemporary issues in a lyrical magical realism context that is captivating, thrilling and brings audiences out of their seats. Winner of multiple awards, this is the perfect parent-daughter movie that portrays Pai as a wonderful role model for young women, and tells a terrific story with lavish photography. A worthy partner to Life of Pi [Blu-ray 3D], and Beasts of the Southern Wild [Blu-ray], both of which deserve to be seen on BluRay. Bring your daughter!
B000VI12ZS|5.0|Great script and a wonderful cast. The story was wonderful. It was great that the writers captured the bigotry that existed among some of the soldiers at that time. Some things will never change.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I think this is a a great app and a great alarm! It wakes me up the time I set it and I don't have to worry about it not ringing. I wish we could set it on a certain day. Over all it is very good.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie dragged, and the audio played faster than the video, that's never happened renting  Amazon before. I did not watch the whole movie, as it was frustrating with the technical aspect.
B00838HRP2|3.0|I purchased this DVD but when I got it I couldn't get it to play. It was European and wouldn't play in US players. However I contacted the seller and they gave me a full refund.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|Never get tired of watching these great ole' movies  :)  Still entertaining and delightful.  All that graphic gore is not necessary to enjoy a flick  !!!!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|We watched this movie on HBO and my husband loved it.  He watches movies at work in his spare time and loves action pack movies and this had a lot of action and can't wait for the second on to come out.
B004RZGUBM|1.0|Complete waste of money. As others have stated before me, there is no index of the novels which makes it impossible to use. I am deleting it from my Kindle.
B002ZG999U|4.0|My husband likes to watch movies at work in his spare time.  He like action pack movies and this has lots of actions and great stars.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was suspenseful! I Loved characters in the  book! The storyline was great!  I'm definitely looking forward to the  movie!
0689835604|5.0|I bought this book because it was a flip book and it allows my son to know some of his body parts. I read this book to him and he sits and listens and he loves to grab on the flap and flip it up. This book is so cute. Buy it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the different point of views demonstrated in this show, keeps you involved and makes you feel apart of the characters of the show. Really wish I didn't have to pay for season 3 to watch it now. I will be waiting but I already miss watching the show.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragons are well designed, this is a very simple game. Almost too simple. This game is very slow but still very entertaining.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I am sooo upset I spent actual money on this book. It was like reading a story my kids put together. The story could have been good. But the writing was not. It was incomplete and boring. I'm not sure how anyone could possibly give this a 5 or even a 2. Please don't waste your money. I have read free books way better than this one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept my interest through to entire book.  You never knew what  was going to happen.  I difinitly reccoment it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it everyday of the week.  love that you can set up so many different alarms!  free is good!
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|I liked this book it is an easy read and was interesting some of it is a bit hard to believe though.
0425252868|5.0|This is a great story which was skillfully crafted and brought to life.  I bought three copies to give to family and friends.
B000060MMI|5.0|If you haven't heard them give them a shot!  If you like the Drop Kick Murphies (spelling?) you will love Flogging Molly.  This is one of their best albums.  Love it!
1439170916|5.0|This book is a fascinating read.  I have given a number of copies of the book to friends affected by cancer and they share my feelings about The Emperor.  Great!
B002WY65W4|5.0|Product was in superb shape for used. Watch the Blu-Ray and it was higher quality than I anticipated. Well worth the money.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love the different worlds and the crazy colors. It makes the game a little difficult but I like a good challenge.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|I'm not even close to a music expert. But this CD is a great value. I recommend to anyone who likes the Single &#34;Radioactive.&#34; The Cd has great tracks and I'm very happy I bought it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A must see...season 1-3 kicked butt. The added of new people was easy and wonderful to see how the group had to change and accept them. It sucked to see good people die. This show is a winner...
B009ZQJVAK|3.0|My wife needed to watch this for a class and I watched it with her. It surprised me by the end that overall it wasn't a bad movie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game, needs to be able to rotate buildings. Also needs to move away from posting on Facebook, but overall a good game
B004UPAIDK|4.0|Evil Dead 2 is a great movie.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.<br /><br />Skip the original Evil Dead - watch Evil Dead 2 - then check out Army of Darkness (the funniest movie ever).
B000B5MI3Q|1.0|Bought Seiko divers from Mr. Watch, all in a box, looked good but then only lasted two months and started to lose a lot of time, contacted Mr Watch and said I would send it to Seiko uk, they didnt want that, they wanted it sent to them. Anyway took it to a local jeweller who inspected it and said it was a copy, therefore no Seiko gaurantee as Mr Watch said. DO NOT trust Mr Watch.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|If you're a Nicholas Sparks fan then you'll like this book.  It was a nice easy read, whilst some parts were a little predictable the ending was not what I expected.
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I read this book while we were engaged, and it made such a positive difference in our relationship! Realizing the different love languages we had and how to relate to each other through them has made our relationship much stronger.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I got this as a instant video and after a scary moment were my computer died while downloading it everything worked well. I streamed from the Blu-Ray player (that I can link to the internet) and had no trouble playing it. I'll definitely be using Amazon's Instant video again.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Based on some of the other reviews I was expecting something potentially cheap. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a quality product and charges my phone relatively quickly. No complaints!
B0062W5U32|1.0|I have an older print version. It is indispensable but it weighs 20#.<br />Living on the road without it, I thought I'd get the Kindle version and have it in my lap top.<br />But, many illustrations (especially those of printed tables) are presented at too low a resolution to read easily on a 1,900 x 1080 monitor.<br /><br />Because of this, the Kindle book fails to transmit to the reader significant parts of the information the authors worked so hard to present.<br /><br />I was given a refund and I appreciate that.... but I'd rather have the book in a form that works.<br /><br />Note to the Publisher: Fix the problem, issue a statement that you have done so, & I'll buy the book again
B009G3T01M|4.0|I've been listening to this CD on repeat while at work - the beats and the energy keep me motivated. Plus, who doesn't love Thrift Shop?
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Miss piggy and kermit finally got married and had kids.  Well, these kids are super bad and have there own video game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|FABULOUS!!!  Great Entertainment --- Love the Lords and Servants -- EQUALLY!!!  Can't wait for the NEXT season to begin--- SO EXCITING!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Its the same game with a great theme.  Play it but becareful not to fall into the clutches of the evil empire.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Bought game for my grandson , he loves it he wants to own all the dinosaurs  the only problem I have is it cost to much for the money ones I can't afford it . It's bad enough that the evolutions cost a lot of coins and some of the coin items are way up there ( clearing areas -food- etc.) That's all fine its when they want $240 dollar's for one dinosaur  that's ridiculous or they charge money for the really cool items like the tar pits or the cave  or a beach just to name a few I know  the people who do the game got to make money but poor people like to play and get the cool stuff to. P.S. I didn't buy this kindle all 3 of my kids went in an bought it for me for my b-day. I would recommend this game just plan on needing credit.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|You know what it is and why it is so cool.  Just buy it already and start having fun, okay!
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|It was a litle slow however their was alot of imagry in it the movie just rate it just ok
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|We play this game every time we have a free moment.  Its a fun driving game with lots of hair pin turns.  collect coins to buy upgrades.  cost is zero but even for a free game, its worth it.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Didn't like the movie at all Very much like the last few Clint Eastwood movies I didnt like care for it
B00947N6UG|3.0|It is a clever story with good graphics but the characters are flat and only sort of sympathetic.  Kids will enjoy their holiday heros come to life.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|i get maybe twice volume or a little less. I noticed though when riding motorcycle at very high speeds around 75MPH  I get no volume loss with just ear plugs and amp.  Without the amp I would  hardly hear the music.  I researched around and found this to be good buy.  the E 11 is powerful with i think twice the output but twice the cost and twice the size too.  I like the size of the E6 because i plug  it into bottom of phone and leave it and not worry about gravity uncoupling it when mounted onto bike's handlebars.  E11 would cause mounting problems for me  because most strap it on back of phone but U can do this with the E6 too if you like
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was interesting.  Another movie is being shot now. Good performances.  I highly recommend.  I loved the cast as well.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I own all the other Paramore albums, and even have their EP's and some demos. I've been huge fan of theirs since their Riot! album and then quickly discovered All We Know Is Falling. This album continues to make me a huge fan. It pushes their sound while retaining elements of previous albums that have made them great. I really like the addition of the sutble electronic elements, and some of the songs have a more raw sound mixed with these very modern elements which really pop.<br />I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Paramore, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />My favorite tracks on the album so far:<br />Fast In My Car<br />Now<br />Daydreaming<br />Part II<br />Last Hope<br /><br />And as a bonus, I really like the ukulele interludes.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy Reich's  interesting good book. She keeps the story interesting in the murder plot and in her personal life. I read it in 2  1/2  days. I am glad Amazon carried it with such a  reasonable price. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in this type of story. Thank  you.  Barb
B000067DNC|3.0|I purchased this as a gift. The gift was well received and for anyone trying to complete their Stargate SG-1 collection, this would definitely take care of season 2 on dvd.
B007N6ZH5M|5.0|Well written, understandable language, good summaries, usable info. Good research and common sense added to the enjoyable read. You do not be a financier to be able to make sense of it all.
0385349947|5.0|As a very independent woman myself, Sheryl gives voice (and power) to many thoughts that I have had over the years regarding equality. You need to stand up for yourself because no one else will!<br />And I appreciate the effort and level of commitment that Sheryl brings to the table by being willing to put her own head on the public chopping block so women less inclined or confident enough to do it themselves know that they can take those steps too. I eagerly await the next book, and a continuation of the dialogue!
0345505387|3.0|Saw it on her website.  Got this out of curiosity after reading the first 3 Outlander books.  I love those!<br />This is a graphic novel. A little too cartoonish for my taste.  One night's read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|THIS BOOK HOLDS YOUR INTEREST. A GOOD MIX OF EMOTIONS AND NOT OVER DONE. GUARANTEED WILL NOT PUT YOU TO SLEEP. I WANT TO READ MORE OF HIS BOOKS.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|My children were so excited with The Hobbit:  Unexpected Journey showed up on the same day that the video was released. We have watched the film many times and appreciate having multiple formats.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|star packed thriller that is sure to please. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken  at their best. This is film made Slater a star.
B00BEFL5Q8|4.0|After such a long time one begins to wonder if Suede can hold up in the 21st century, and thankfully it does that and more because Bloodsports not only feels of its time but also refreshingly old school at the same time. The grand guitar riffs and throbbing basslines are back in full force as Brett Anderson's signature voice and theatrical lyrics make a return. And what a return it is, guitar pop hasn't felt so great in a very long time. It took 11 years since 2002's A New Morning, but Suede sounds like Suede again.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Great movie.  Great picture.  One to keep and show to the entire family.  Would highly recommend buying this movie as a keepsake.
0765342294|5.0|A great read that can be read over and over again. Instantly went to the top of my list in the genre.
B004LROMWU|1.0|There is nothing original in this show. Every single scene is a cliche culled from dozens of mediocre war and apocalyptic shows. The characters are boring and one dimensional. One feels like the writers spun a wheel and decided to stick in every stock character from better shows. You got the idealistic protagonist, the grizzled army commander, the criminal who usually gets the best lines and the innocent kids who are hanging around the story line to be all cute and annoying.<br /><br />None of these characters develop from the first episodes. They simply keep going along from one terrible episode to the next without any level of engagement.<br /><br />However, one should note that the most egregious part of the show is the music cues. This is a show that has decided to pseudo-patriotic music is a substitute for characterization, realistic dialogue, interesting plots or any originality whatsoever. When one knows exactly how the pitch came about (\\"It's like The Walking Dead, but with aliens and clumsy appeals to patriotism\\"), it's not a good scene.<br /><br />I tried hard to give this show the benefit of the doubt and even adjust my expectations accordingly (after all it's a show about alien invasion. I shouldn't expect Mad Men) but every time I think I can lower my standards and just accept that this is a dumb show, the show gets even dumber. Lines like \\"you drank the Kool Aid\\" and \\"We gotta hit them with everything they got\\" don't belong in dialogue for a show that costs thousands to make with the backing of a network. They belong in self-published novels by teenagers who are trying to break into the place where they are allowed to Star Wars tie-in books.<br /><br />And if you want to know just how bad this show is, consider this - most of the positive reviews are one sentence long and say the same thing. These aren't actual reviews. They are robots using a set of predetermined phrases in an effort to sound human (which ironically is a very good description of the characters on this show).
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Using Kindle Fire 8.9, Slashtop Basic worked fine switching monitors but could not preview landscape. So I paid for the $8 HD version, have landscape, looks great but now I cannot switch monitors.  It is simply not an option anymore.  I can revert back to basic and multi-monitor still accessible.  Naturally 1/5 stars for failing x-platform test.  This worked on cheaper version, so stupid. I was willing to accept this was un-encrypted.  Unfortunately, is is unencrypted and broken.  Thanks for wasting my time!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book will change the way you think, change the way you feel, change your perspective.  I highly recommend it if you wish to be successful and happy with: career, people skills, finances, relationships, EVERYTHING!<br /><br />Think of this book daily.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Written for a teenager but since it is a Grisham it is well written, good plot, and moves along with suspense.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A very good read for those who like adventure, action, and high sea pirates ! The fluid movement of the authors prose keeps you entranced and turning the pages til the end. Movies are movies, the read the book is adventure !
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I wanted an unobtrusive, uncomplicated, and inexpensive iphone cover.  This one is exactly what I was looking for.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.  Anytime I need phone accessories, I look to AmazonBasics first - I haven't been disappointed yet.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Better than Lord of the Rings, less happy than Harry Potter. I highly recommend it even though it's long its a great series and it doesn't get dull.
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|Only been through the album a couple times but it's pretty good so far. Not too different given the new lineup.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|A great movie, so I had to have it on DVD to watch over and over.  Of course, the book is much better, but all and all the movie was a good rendition.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|Great game but pretty short.  The story isn't great I would've hoped for more time travel. Wishing for more levels in the future.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Game is awesome me and my kids love it we enjoy it on the day today basis. Keep up the good work.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love the series and the book buy its worth the money and if you are still reading this than you haven't bought the book yet
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved it still enjoying it today . Nice sequel . Would recommend to all . It's a must have
030758836X|5.0|This was a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  Amazing writing.  There was quite a bit of bad language but it fit the character's personalities.  This book will keep you guessing until the very end.  The ending makes you wonder?????  Would love for Gillian Flynn to write &#34;Gone Girl  Again&#34;!
B009O2XY12|3.0|Ok but not what I was expecting . I found some thing else more intriguing . Good try but not for me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Couldn't wait to see what happend next so had to view this episode!  Always a spellbinder and may have to buy the entire season
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality when I received this Anker USB 3.0 Hub. It arrived in a nice quality attractive shipping box that can be used for storage if desired and was packed in a static bag.<br /><br />It is small (fits in the palm of my hand) but substantial feeling. It is small enough to easily fit in one of the zipped pockets on my laptop case.<br /><br />I am using this with my [[ASIN:B0085RZPPA HP Pavilion dv7-7010us 17.3-Inch Laptop (Black)]]. It is loaded with Windows 7 and has one 2.0 port and three 3.0 ports, which is nice but you can never have enough ports in this electronic age.<br /><br />I like the design with the power cord coming from the corner of the small, square hub, which leaves all four sides of the hub open to have a 3.0 port.<br /><br />I have used the hub with my Canon camera, downloading pictures to my laptop. I have downloaded video from my JVC video recorder. I have uploaded music and pictures onto my SanDisk Extreme 64gb 3.0 flash drive. All have worked perfectly and downloading/uploading has been extra quick.<br /><br />I also like that the hub comes with an 18 month extended warranty. That sure can't be beat for the price, which is extremely reasonable. And they actually have the service phone number and email address on the packaging, rather than trying to track someone down on a website if the need arises.<br /><br />It also has a built-in surge protector. I don't know if that is an industry standard but I'm betting it's not. Nice touch.<br /><br />NOTE: I received a free hub from Anker in exchange for my honest review.
1932100660|3.0|All the book is about the research he did and the results. In the conclusion he always mention why the vegetarian diet is better for us. Even in his lectures he mentioned this, but he doesn't write a chapter about this diet and what to eat or combine according to the results of his study and to get a well balance diet. Now I see that a cooking book is coming in May by his daughter so I will be force to buy  another book to get all the information.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you played the many Mist games on PC, which I have, you will love this game. I can't wait for the next chapter to come out. The only problem is it was to short. I wanted it to keep on going, but for $2.00 it is totally enjoyable and engrossing to play. HINT: To extend the game play try not to use the &#34;Hints&#34; unless you are completely stuck.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love it... so happy I found this on demand.  I blew through the season in just a few days.  I would recommend it.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|For those who love the series, this one is a must see for all fans!!! Watching the birth while not as gory as the book the film definitely did it justice!
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Love it! Penelope was the best in the film, as always she is amazing and such a natural talent. xoxoxo<br /><br />I recommend to watch and open your mind to an artistic film.
B00005R2IS|5.0|I love this movie.  I saw it at a drive-in  theater and have wanted it on DVD a long time.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I love his writing and this is a wonderful example of his skill. Action, good characters and exotic places and sights.
0470474874|5.0|this authore is very easy to understand . Hes straight to the point and has lots of tips and the cd helps alot to with the examples.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|very good series.  Interesting to learn about World War one and what it was like to be an aristocrat during that time period
B00571F26Y|4.0|Somewhat overstated his case, but certainly excited about his theory and makes his reader think about diet. The recipes are very difficult.

B000FA675C|5.0|Great book.  Author Dan Brown is one our contemporary greats. I have read all of his books and have enjoyed everyone of them.  My all time favorites Angels and Demons with DaVinci Code, but all of his books are good.
B0000028M7|5.0|DIRT is a complete MASTERPIECE!!!!! i really don´t know which AIC album is their best....Their debut FACELIFT, or this one DIRT.....i remember seeing the video from the song THEM BONES, back in the early 90´s and i was completely hooked up for this band!!!! THEM BONES is one of the COOLEST songs of ALL TIME, as others like the phenomenal ROOSTER, or DOWN IN A HOLE, WOULD and RAIN WHEN I DIE!!!!!!!!DIRT is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie for all ages.  I normally don't sit down with the kids and watch a whole movie, I just catch snippets, but I sat through the whole thing and loved it.
B00000272N|5.0|FACELIFT is one of the best HEAVY METAL ROCK albums EVER!!!!! MAN IN THE BOX must be one of the coolest songs of ALL TIME....And all the other songs are great like WE DIE YOUNG, BLEED THE FREAK, IT AIN´T LIKE THAT and SEA OF SORROW!!!!ALICE IN CHAINS is a gifted unique band, and ALL their stuff is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, ALICE IN CHAINS!!!!!!!!
B00BHMF578|4.0|Thought this movie was really good. Great performances by the actors, some very tense scenes, and a good story line.<br /><br />I'm not sure how accurate this account is, so if you're looking for historical accuracy you might should do some research.<br /><br />Bonus points for seeing Bryan Cranston with hair.
B000007T1M|5.0|The first 2 albums from SYSTEM OF A DOWN are MASTERPIECES!!!!! this one, their debut, in my opinion, is even better than their classic TOXICITY....All the songs are amazing, heavy and raw...They never did something so unique and heavy after this beast....SUGAR, SPIDERS, KNOW, SOIL and WAR are metal gens.....some people call this NU METAL, but SYSTEM go WAY beyond this kind of metal...well, this one is a masterpiece!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like HEAVY METAL!!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009R86L|5.0|A great addition for anyone needing a padded shoulder strap for your laptop bag. I also like the no-slip feature. If I had one thing to change, it would be the color.
B0000027RL|5.0|TEN is really one of the GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME....i can´t really say many albums better than TEN.....Maybe FACELIFT, from ALICE IN CHAINS and the BLACK album from METALLICA....PEARL JAM is a great band, but never recreate such a inspired collection of songs like that(Vs is great too)....Here you find THE TOTAL classics EVEN FLOW, ALIVE and JEREMY, but all the songs are AMAZING....TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!WELL DONE, PEARL JAM!!!!!!!BRAVOOOOO!!!!!
B004GJYROG|5.0|I saw this on a friends wish list for her child. I loved this movie years ago. She was so happy to get it.
B000000H3Z|5.0|After 2 great but really raw albuns, SEPULTURA create their sound on BENEATH THE REMAINS....On MORBID VISIONS and SCHIZOPHRENIA, SEPULTURA was like a mix of SLAYER and METALLICA, and Max vocals were REALLY raw.....on BENEATH, they reach maturity and create gens like STRONGER THAN HATE, INNER SELF, MASS HYPNOSIS and the title track....Max vocals improved A LOT here....you can even understand what he is singing....well, i love SEPULTURA and ALL their albuns until ROOTS, and BENEATH is recognized as one of the best THRASH albuns ever....and it´s true!!!! i put this beast among REIGN IN BLOOD, MASTER OF PUPPETS and RUST IN PEACE as the BEST THRASH you can find....ah, ARISE is AMAZING too(my favorite)....if you like THRASH METAL, you just got to have BENEATH THE REMAINS!!!!!!! BY FAR THE BEST THING FROM BRAZIL!!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, SEPULTURA!!!!!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series! Would love to visit Downton. So many favorite characters! LOVE! I am hooked! Looking forward to Season 4!
B000002HEP|5.0|KYUSS is one of the most underrated bands of all time....maybe because they came in the same period of the grunge, when Nirvana and Pearl Jam were the most famous bands....SKY VALLEY is a collection of AMAZING HEAVY ROCK songs like GARDENIA, 100 DEGREES, ODYSSEY and DEMON CLEANER....it´s like a perfect mix of BLACK SABBATH and METALLICA....i thought BLUES FOR THE RED SUN was their masterpiece, but SKY VALLEY is a masterpiece too....TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!WELL DONE, KYUSS!!
0486281523|5.0|I bought this for a 14 yr old and he loved it.  This is a good book to stimulate children's  imagination and make Math more fun.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very gripping, especially for someone who is very familiar with the setting (suburban Boston).  I felt that I knew these people and I was living each traumatic experience, feeling every emotion, with them. I kept reading at every spare minute I had until the final page.  Every parent will feel for all the parents involved in this horrific case.  Very thought-provoking and unsettling.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|The 3D film is outstanding in quality and illusion, but unlike most DVDs, there are no clear instructions or options seen as the DVD opens other than when to use the 3D glasses. As a result, it is very difficult to get the DVD out of showing the trailer loop over and over. On almost all DVDs the options for playing scenes, or total film are clearly stated as the DVD opens; that does not happen with this DVD. There were 3 discs in the Collector's Edition I purchased. One disc offered the 3D version, and after we finally got out of the trailer loop we got to see the film. The second disc is the non 3D version, and the third disc is supposed to offer behind the scenes details involved in the making of the film. It is impossible to get  beyond the trailer loop in the third disc after trying every possible routine that normally works on DVDs. I was sharing the experience with 6 well informed DVD users; they all tried to get the discs to run properly, and they also could not understand why these DVDs are so devoid of instructions on screen or in the printed material. Loved the film, hated the technology or lack of it.
1450400957|5.0|This author has a great ability to convey information about weight training.  He describes many lifts with illustrated pictures and explanations that really put the reader in the mindset of recognizing which muscles are engaged.  If you are new to weight training and intermediate, this book will give you solid information about lifts and teach you new ones.

The science makes more sense than many I have read about as a physician.  The science is very similar to information that I learned as a medical student over 30 years ago!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Always a fan of Ms Nicks, but after seeing the documentary I have a greater appreciation for this masterpiece. Highly recommended.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love this app and its free how great is that hope it wakes us easy...very easy to contrast to use an d a Nice display.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I loved the story and the countryside, scenery  and costumes were great.  Actors were pretty good I you could feel the sexual tension between the main characters.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|J love this movie because I love surfing and I especially love Hawaii. The movie has a wonderful lesson in it and I bought it for my now 3 year old granddaughter. I want her to learn this lesson. The filming was terrific and there wasn't any foul language in it. Was this made in the USA ???  I would DEFINATELY reccomend it to young teenagers and anyone else too !!!!!!
B000JIN3J8|5.0|Beautifully done.  Its been done so many times but I enjoy watching them all.  Acting was good as were the costumes and beautiful sets. Wonderful story.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I love Bruno Mars, I love this album, but I wish I would have bought the non-explicit version. I am not a fan of unnecessary swearing and feel like every song with the F bomb in it, could have easily not been said or replaced. The songs are amazing though and I'd recommend the NON-EXPLICIT version.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|OK Casey Aflleck you did a good job.  I liked the story and had a very surprising ending.  I like moves that have a surpise at he end.  Although I didn't througly agree with the ending, I liked it.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Definitely for people in the medical community, but I loved the focus on simplicity and how it can still have a profound impact on patient care and in lives saved. Very well written and accessible for those who are not in medicine, though I still think it is most applicable to people working in healthcare.
B00280LYHS|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!! Adventures always are AWESOME!!!!!!!!! ¡! But not as good as Harry Potter.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was surprised to read on Anthony Ryan's Wordpress site that he was a 'full time researcher'.  After reading Blood Song, I think he should quit his day job.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book in the series!
B008602KQI|5.0|Saw it in the movies - couldn't wait to get it once it came out on video.  Pretty good adaptation of the book.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Although long winded at times, this classic does well to establish and maintain intimacy and desire for the welfare of each character to its readers. No character need the story without a view of their future.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I really just loved this movie. Beginning to end entertainment! Funny, racy, but not too over the top... Good fun!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Liam Neeson's heart felt portrayal of Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's film Schindler's List helped earn Steven Spielberg's true story seven Oscars including, Best Picture. The movie Schindler's List is a 1997docudrama about Oskar Schindler, a womanizing alcoholic business man from Czechoslovakia. Schindler took over an apartment in Krakow, Poland that had been originally occupied by a Jewish family who had been sent to the Ghetto, with the hopes of being a more successful business man than his father.  Upon his arrival in Krakow he quickly got in with the local Gestapo Chiefs. It was partially due to the influence he had with these men which eventually enabled him to save the lives of over a thousand Jews during Hitler's reign in Germany. As it turns out his factory, Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik, was not just in the business of making money, pot and pans, or ammunition, but it turned out to be in the business of saving lives.<br />The film is in the true documentary form of black and white. Spielberg puts a slight twist on the motion picture by beginning it with a modern day Jewish family celebration, in color, as the family disappears so does the color. The last scene in the film fades back to color from black and white. This is an especially powerful scene of the surviving Jews, Schindler's Jews, coming to his grave to honor him. The holocaust's impact on the Jewish community is immeasurable but it is evident in the last scene that Oskar Schindler's impact on the Jews was to leave hope in humanity.<br />Although Oskar Schindler does not appear to be very religious himself there are several indications that he is sympathetic to the plight of the Jewish people such as when he reminds a factory worker, the Rabbi, that it is Friday night close to sunset, that Sabbath is about to begin. Mr. Schindler may not have been a military hero but he became a hero of the Jewish people because of his bravery and willingness to risk his business and his life to save them. In the end Oskar Schindler gave up his earthly treasures to save persecuted people.<br />[[ASIN:B00BP4X3W2 Schindler's List]]

B009J2VQSK|5.0|Great Sound, loved all the music, Alabama Shakes my Favorite, do not miss the movie!  Tell all your friends to see it
B0095P31L6|5.0|As an adult I loved it. It is a terrific homage to the desert and the cowboys as they appeared in the old movies.<br />The point is that my 4 years old daughter could not appreciate.<br />Rango won the Oscar for the fabulous work accomplished but, in my opinion this animation is not specially entertaining for kids.

B007ZI06FE|5.0|This was great book loved it from page one and couldnt put it down.Cant wait for the next book to come out.
B007KYQIEQ|3.0|If you paid attention then you knew what would happen next. That said, I watched it for two reasons - Hugh Jackman & Liev Schreiber.  While these two retained their usual roles - they did a very good job of playing loveable characters you would expect in this sort of film.  Meg Ryan annoyed me because her character was a jerk but the lead still falls madly in love with her.  For these reasons I rate this movie as &#34;okay&#34;.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I you are expecting to watch new born serious actors playing not that serious roles in a fun and overwhelming story you should definitely watch this movie.<br /><br />Personally I like to see this kind of pretty normal stories that transform normal people in great mature people, this movie is not about to be different but about how to face normal life in the good and the bad times. Besides if you born before the middle 80's you will feel empathy with many of the characters for sure.<br /><br />Story is pretty well handled and even if some parts seems to confuse you or have no sense between the scenes you totally will have a smoothly revelation along the movie like a nice and tightly wrapped gift.<br /><br />and as a great extra detail, the movie has awesome music playing the role as it play it in the real life.<br /><br />last comment Emma looks beautiful in the movie, she looks like the first love of any one
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Where a girl (Snow White?) is thrown into a battle situation and fights for truth, justice, and her way of life.  The overly dramatic win in this film - they match well with the background and the darkness that centers on this story.  The girl who would be Snow White lacks fire or character -any real feeling besides some kind of will to live.  The ending is not a real ending. This should have been retitled The Huntsman Prevails.
0385349947|4.0|I purchased this book after seeing the author's 60 minutes interview. It's balanced, authentic and surprisingly personal.  As a working father of two young daughters and a wife who is an executive in a large corporation, this book helped me to identify, empathize and appreciate the challenges of working mothers and the unique issues they face.  Kudos to the author for her successes and her boldness.
B00BVYNSLC|2.0|Saw more than I cared to see in the trailer.  Thief steals identity of herself. Interesting idea, not so interesting lifestyle.
0345803507|5.0|Have shared with my sister.  She is also enjoying.  Books on CD are a great listen in the car or while completing housework.
B000HZGBLA|4.0|Very little character development in the movie, although if you played the games you probably already know this.  The story is more about the adventure than the character interaction.  Lots of slay the monster, survive the people, and some solve the puzzle thrown in. Angelina Jolie does look a lot like Laura Croft and I think this is why a lot of people enjoy the film.  This is sort of like national treasure -if the center of the tale were focused on the other team.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|after score tron legacy by DAFT PUNK, kosinski director love french touch. french group M83 make beautifull albums,and this score for OBLIVION is great. Hans ZIMMER style is near, with INCEPTION score (horatius et return from delta) and DARK KNIGHT RISES, and also DAFT PUNK with TRON LEGACY(tech49, unidentified object, odyssey rescue). Unbelievable soundtrack.<br /><br />The CD release has 17 tracks totaling over an hour of music. If you want a more complete experience, the iTunes \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of the album has 30 tracks.<br /><br />favorites tracks:<br /><br />- waking up<br />- starwaves<br />- grater lake<br />- unidentified object<br />- earth 2077<br />- raven rock<br />- i'm sending you away<br />- fearfull odds<br /><br />this tracks are great, strong, powerfull...
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Doesn't seem to matter how many times I have seen this movie or how many different people I have watched it with. Everyone comes away with - That rocked!  Pulls at your heart strings with an emotional first five minutes, keeps going with good character development, storyline, graphics, and action.  Cant wait to see the sequel May 2013!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Quirky, so if you don't do quirky a la Bill Murray, maybe take a pass, but I loved it.  Great performances by a huge cast of stars.
1401201911|4.0|In the old days, when DC wanted to tell an-out-of-continuity story, they would call them \\"imaginary stories.\\"  Since the '80's, these have been marketed as \\"Elseworlds\\" stories.  Millar's Elseworlds Superman tale has Kal-El crashing to Earth in the early 20th century in the USSR, which he takes over after Stalin dies.  His main opponent in his quest to save humanity from itself, socialist style?  Lex Luthor!<br /><br />After having said that, if I now say \\"and yet, he's still Superman\\" you'll say \\"what are you, nuts?\\"  Heh.  Read it for yourself and find out.
1933952806|5.0|This book is better than the Nikon user manual, which comes on the NXView2 software CD with the D7000.  I tried to find a printer who would print the Nikon user manual, but had no success.  Copyright issues. I finally ordered a hard copy of the user manual from a source in England, but the book and print is so small it is difficult to read.  However, this book Mastering the Nikon D7000 is great. I also ordered Mastering the Nikon D90 for my D90 camera.

0385737955|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I read the trilogy and enjoyed them all, I did not care for the prequel (The Kill Order).  I highly recommend The Maze Runner. I thought it was interested and kept me reading, I didn't want to put it down.  Its also an easy read with short chapters.  I really liked it and have recommended this book to friends.  As soon as I finished it I couldn't wait to start the next one.  I will say, I think The Maze Runner is the best book in the series.
B00866JL96|5.0|A great love story. Two people who struggle with past hurts find each other and discover that life can be good again.
0385742886|2.0|I enjoyed the Maze Runner trilogy so I was very interested in reading The Kill Order.  I had a hard time getting into this book.  It takes you back to see how The Flare was effecting society.  So you do get to see how it was devastating society and you can see why a cure would be needed.  Still, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did the trilogy.  Also, I don't think this is a necessary read just because you read The Maze Runner trilogy.<br /><br />Overall, not bad but not really something I'd rush to read.  I would highly recommend The Maze Runner trilogy but I don't think this one is as good.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Want something fun and entertaining you gotta see this one.  A great family movie. Harry and Marv are up to their crazy ideas again.  They ought to know that danger awaits them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have been a fan of Grisham for quite some time. That said, this book is written in a very unusual style. It is almost all narative and very little dialogue. I enjoyed it, especially for that reason. I saw the finish, slightly before the end, but it kept me in suspense and I definitely recommend this to anyone who like a good story, legal or otherwise. Great job, Mr. Grisham.
0743270754|5.0|Just started to read this. Beautiful written. This is by far my favorite time of history.  You actually see government working to get a great thing done. Lincoln saw us all as equals and was willing to go out on a limb to make sure that the government protected all our rights.
0307887448|5.0|I absolutely loved it... For a kid who was born in the 90's but raised with the 80's (older cousin who introduced me to cartoons, music, and films) I couldn't put it down for one second.

B00B2166BS|5.0|This is a high quality cable. It fits perfectly in my Nexus 10. The shipping was quick. They're shipping from Aliso Viejo in California. So, if you live in the west coast, you should get it faster.<br /><br />Now, is it really faster than the micro USB cable?<br /><br />I used app from Google play to measure the charging speed of each cable. It takes 4:02 min to charge 1% using the OEM micro USB and 3:32 min using the Pogo cable. So, we are talking about 12.4% improvement in charging speed. Based on these numbers, the micro USB will need 6:43 hours to fully charge a dead nexus 10, while the Pogo cable will need 5:53 hours.<br /><br />The convenience and the little bump in the charging speed, makes this cable a good purchase.
1435114949|5.0|you have to get this book. Its... its perfect man perfect. It even smells great. I just received my book and the binding is well put together it even has a built in book marker which is also nice. All and all this book is top shelf.

0525953728|5.0|Some evils in life are necessary and this is one of those evils. 'Mark Owen' educates the reader on the tools, planning and stage exercises required to complete a successful project regardless of the outcome.  Time has passed since the release of &#34;No Easy Day...&#34; and many people and Navy Seals alike have had time to evaluate not only the content but philosophies of live. One of the down-sides we must understand is that Seals eat their own.  Even if well respected, a Seal who does not perform as expected will get tossed aside like trash either for retraining or simply outcast entirely. In this respect, Navy Seals are no different most other humans. Individually we give, sure, but we also take from each other often without remorse. Regardless of where we are in life, we still have to deal with the human condition.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really loved this book. I was afraid that it would be too difficult to read but because it is from the perspective of a 6 year old, it wasn't so hard. There are no long descriptions of what the kidnapper did to them. It was a real page turner and I finished it in two days.

B00AFPTSI0|5.0|True or false--\\"Nice guys finish last\\"?  It depends on what question you ask.  If you mean selfish people versus selfless people, the answer is \\"True\\".  But Adam Grant asks:  Who will most consistently find both success and happiness in their work,  \\"takers\\", \\"matchers\\", or \\"givers\\"?  Takers aim in every human interaction to get the better deal--more money, more recognition, more power.  Matchers help and support others in proportion to help and support received or anticipated.  Givers persist in offering help and support not expecting the other person will ever give anything back.  Then the answer is that nice people, the givers, finish last--and first.  Some givers finish last, takers do somewhat better, matchers may outperform takers, and some givers far surpass matchers or takers in achievement, fulfillment, and respect and appreciation from others.<br /><br />I'll summarize his thesis in my own words.  I want to do first-rate work and earn the respect of others as a gifted and effective self, on my own behalf and on behalf of people I love (family and friends).  I want to enhance the lives of people who matter to me (colleagues, clients and acquaintances).  The happiest and most effective people embrace both intentions.  Committed to the quality of the work itself, disregarding immediate reward in status or pay, they cooperate with others and persistently help people who cannot return the favor, motivating others to \\"pay it forward\\" (become givers themselves) rather than \\"pay it back\\".  Matchers debilitate their own performance and that of the organization, afraid to give to anyone who won't \\"earn\\" their trust or assistance.  Takers do worse and are more unhappy; unable to trust, grabbing short-term \\"wins\\" at others' expense, they engender suspicion and resentment, subverting their own self-interest and the culture of the enterprise.  \\"Selfless\\" givers, failing to honor their own gifts and desires, negate their effectiveness not only at work but in their efforts to help; they finish last, burn out, and resent the \\"fact\\" that no one appreciates how \\"good\\" they are.<br /><br />Selfish people disregard the interests of others; one way they undo themselves is by evoking hostility and resentment when they do succeed, and colleagues may decide to fight back.  Selfless people disregard their own interests; one way they undo themselves is that (like takers but for different reasons) they refuse to ask for help.  Both pathologies leave us unhappy, unrespected, and unloved.  Matchers weigh their own interests against the interests of others, compromising both.  Effective givers, to paraphrase an old book, love their neighbors as they love themselves, with unstinting regard and generous care for the gifts and potentialities in every individual they meet--including the individual they meet in the mirror.  Characteristically, effective givers turn many of the strangest strangers into devoted friends; were I an effective giver might I befriend even the stranger within myself?<br /><br /> Fortunately few people are completely selfish.  Fortunately few (if any) can be completely selfless--and we'll be better off if we stop berating ourselves when we can't be (especially since it doesn't work anyway).  And unfortunately very few are always effective givers; for better or worse, we need to respond intelligently to people who are employing every gradation of \\"matching\\" on the grid.  Here are a few of my favorites among Grant's suggestions for dealing with real-world complexities.  1) If it takes less than five minutes you should be willing to help anybody you meet.  2) \\"Clump\\" rather than \\"sprinkle\\" your generosity with your time; you'll be happier and more effective if you devote, say, a Saturday afternoon to volunteering rather than trying to wedge in an hour of \\"otherness\\" five days a week.  3) \\"Tit for tat\\" might describe a typical matching strategy.  Especially when you're dealing with a taker, try \\"generous tit for tat\\", giving one out of three times when the taker tries to exploit your generosity, refusing to play (just do straight \\"matching\\") the other two times.  4) Rather than worrying much about what the other person feels, thoughtfully image what the other person needs or intends; offering to help meet key objectives on the other side can free both of you to find \\"win-win\\" solutions that are better for everyone.<br /><br />My schematics do justice neither to the first-rate academic research (in no small part his own) Grant summarizes, nor to the moving and inspiring stories he relates, nor to the nuanced and practical counsel he provides, in this unusually well-written book.  I suggest you own it, read it, mark it, and keep going back to it until it's part of who you are.  It's that good.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I have now seen all three seasons of Downton Abbey.  It's a really great series and it's pretty cool that we were able to stream it all for free with Amazon Prime.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Received in good order and at a good price in an acceptable time. I'm big fan - Lord of the Rings. So had to get this 'next in the series'. Look forward to watching in the future.
B001NKI60W|5.0|This movie is soooo good. I love all the songs and ALL the actors are awesome! One of the most underrated chick-flicks i know! Definitely watch!
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I loved the idea of what it is suppose to do.  I love the fact that it is a case for my bluetooth headset.  So far it is working out great.  I wish it wasn't plastic.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Good Old Fashioned Entertainment , alongside of pretty bad-ass visual specia;l effects.  I recommend the Blu-ray version, played on a good system. Surround-sound is awesome.  Intentionally not a deep movie.  This movie is great fun for a night at the movies that's decent for all ages.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I enjoy the charater devolpement in this season of the walking dead, and am glad to see they realized solid walls are needed for defense.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A very good story and it keeps you watching to see what will happen next price was ok . would be good for kids but does have some viewing that is kinda scary with the tiger appearing to be pretty wild
B000056HOZ|5.0|Reason I love it. Is simple. Sometimes with videos is they seem so dated. But with this set of videos the only thing that seems to aged is Bruce and The Band (sorry to all) and that is not bad! His music is always good no matter what year it comes from. Please don't let the word VIDEOS stop you from missing out on this one.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|really easy to use it, just open the cap and pump it out keep away of your hand and stay clean.
B00C32REYI|5.0|Best JB yet. Blake has been honing his craft and is getting better day by day it seems. Take his experimental s*** from klaive ep make it beast mode and have him sing much more and you have Overgrown. Add the RZA and Brian Eno guest track and you have ULTIMATE SATISFACTION.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a young woman in college, this book has already taken my success to new heights.  I have recommended this book to all my female friends and family while giving my significant other chapters to focus on!  READ THIS BOOK!  It will empower you.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Old cable wasn't OEM & wobbled.  This is a solid, well shielded cable that fits both the plug and Kindle ends snugly. Works great.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|The entire book built up to the revelation of a secret, but once revealed it was anticlimactic and not worth keeping a secret over.  It also seemed the book ended long before it actually ended. It seems Dan Brown was pressured into making another book with Langdon due to the success of the other 2 books, but this one is a let down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Following the past 2 seasons was no easy task, but Downton Abbey season 3 kept this series interesting and the viewer left wanting more.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I had only seen one episode of this show at my mom's house. I decided to buy the first season and I am so hooked. This series really makes me smile.

0307719774|5.0|With the Q and A format, I am never facing the &#34;white page&#34; and wondering what to write. I can barely wait to fill the whole thing in. Great for those of us who like to keep track of our thoughts as they change over time and for those for whom journaling is a new activity. I even think men might like this compact little book.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I liked the style of writing, it was easy to read and understand.  I found the story line very interesting in the way it followed three time periods, I very much like these types of stories.  The characters where very easy to imagine in there settings, perhaps because of my travels around Australia and overseas.  I did find it a bit too hard to believe that a child of 4 would be so accepting of such a big and scarey situation though, an didn't make a fuss about being lost, it just doesn't sound like a normal reaction. I liked the way the character of Cassandra developed and matured through the story too.
1616550414|5.0|Legendary. And epic. Only words to describe. The details of everything, the time-line, the time-line via the games as well. It's all very lovely.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Love and miss this show so much.  IMHO, better than BSG, Dr Who, SG-1, and even Firefly.  Epic story, epic characters, epic cast, crew, and writing.  I even love the soundtrack and miss the BBBbbrummm!, everytime Destiny comes into view.  Not to spoil the ending, but it's been three years.  Time to bring it back MGM!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's fun and very addictive! I can play it everywhere I go and not get borred! Colorful, happy and exciting! Would recommend to everyone who likes this kind of games!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I haven't had any problems so far it's worked well. I like the fact that it kicks in when you start charging
B004YXE438|4.0|This app is easy to use and enjoyable to play. The images available are pleasing to the eye and just challenging enough.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is not for women only, nor is it about women only. This is about a new workplace that transcends the mindless equal workplace. This asks the question for both men and women how do they want to get what they are worth. In a very real sense this is theory. Companies that lack internal reflections and inspiration would just not get it. People who do not understand that getting ahead is also hard work and that cooperation is probably harder than anyhting to do at times will not get this. I can not imagine a government or a military employee having any interest at all. If you like \\"if it is to be it is up to me\\" in a rational, ethical, heuristic, and share a curiousity about things that could be better in a decent tone there is a great deal to think about for boys and girls :)It is  not only about the future of the individual but raises the question of just how are we going to design a fair and yet productive workplace for everybody in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games has many perks you can Mack more perks by by piece perk are good bye you made a great game it's awesomeness so you could make another
B0038NN3B4|3.0|Scan the plans, get the gist, download the app for shopping and planning. Then just do the low card diet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friends told me about it and I looked for it. When I found it I didn't stop playing it. This game is awesome!!! I am happy I got it and so will you.  I recommend this for all who want to have an addictive game!!!!!!!!!<br />Have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was an enchanting story with an interesting twist at the ending that left a bit of mystery.  We were spellbound throughout the story.
B00005JKED|4.0|Just got around to seeing this. I must have heard something negative about it, but it turned out to be very entertaining. It's a tough, gritty crime film with great acting, perfect setting, and a one-of-a-kind central character. Yeah, there are some plot holes and developments the film doesn't prepare you for, but it roars along and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Way above average.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played, and now that it is on tablet, it is just that much better. I would recommend this game for anybody that wants to play. And the price is so worth it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Ever since Amazon acquired The Good Wife, my family and I have tried to watch it.  We have two locations where we can watch it via either FiOs or high-speed DSL.  Over and over, the show would stop about a quarter or sometimes halfway in and start buffering and buffering and buffering.  The blue bar would just stop moving and still be stuck a half hour or so later.  We use Roku players, two different models, and the only way to get out and reset them was to unplug their power supply.  Finally, last night we watched three episodes from Season one with no problems.  I was about to completely give up on Amazon's streaming service but last night's pleasant experience with no buffering and being able to watch an entire episode all the way through was literally and new and pleasant experience for us.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I love the purple color - makes it stand out from the other Kindle in the house which has a gray cover (also Marware). Easy to maneuver into different configurations for standing on a table or holding in your lap.
1609611543|5.0|Yes, I'm serious!  This author provides you with the history of modern genetically altered wheat and can correlate it directly to the rise is a plethora of health issues especially in the U.S.  It is shocking to learn!<br /><br />The book is an easy read ... sometimes a bit technical yet not overwhelmingly so.  Each chapter provides you with insight into something specific so you can skip around if that strategy works best for you.<br /><br />Even if all you want is a flat belly ... give up your bread.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Saw this little gem just browsing through stuff one day, and thought it was worth a try for the price...  WIN!<br /><br />I carry a Gerber Instant for my EDC, and I put that thing through the ringer.  It's cut through wire, small limbs, marked boards, notched boards, sliced vinyl sheeting, scraped paint, dug a bit in the gravel and dirt, etc., and to be honest, it hasn't had any other maintenance other than cleaning it up and oiling it a bit here and there for over a year.  I had a couple of moderate knicks in the fine edge portion of the blade, and a couple of rolled edges in the serrated portion.<br /><br />When I got my PP1 in the mail, I immediately opened it up, pulled out the pocket knife, and went to work.  In less than 5 minutes of light work, I had both portions of the blade back into GOOD shape, with the fine edge being nearly sharp enough to shave the hair on my arms.  Not the &#34;razor&#34; sharp that some people like to brag about, for sure, but an extremely good utilitarian edge that's more than sharp enough to do anything I need to do.  It sliced single pieces of paper with no drag or tear, and made me fall in love with the knife again!<br /><br />If you want a better edge, take it to a professional sharpener then tuck your knife away in a drawer so you don't ruin it, but if you're after a good edge on a utility blade, without a lot of time or effort, this is your tool!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Very awesome game. no flaws whatsoever. CAN'T WAIT TIL' NEW UPDATE! New tower, Engineer, co-op. What if there's a tower called, Monkey commando, where it has weapons ( guns).
0756405890|5.0|You know that feeling you get with some books where you have to push yourself through the first few chapters?<br />You do not get that at all with The Name of the Wind.<br />From page one you're pulled into this amazingly detailed world with an intricate design, budding plot, and some of the best character development I have seen in the past decade. Even if your a bit rusty in using your imagination it does not matter because Rothfuss' words not only build this elaborate world but he really brings it to life in your head.<br />The story is raw and seems so very pure when you first meet Kvothe (the main character), leaving you anxious and wanting more. As you progress through the novel Rothfuss puts you in Kvothe's head and you see his world through his eyes through all of Kvothe's tribulations and his unanticipated success. It is an intense experience that leaves you unable to get proper sleep until you've finished the book.<br />Some other notable parts are the lack of those minor little flaws other novels of the same genera tend to have:<br />-The system of magic is elaborately explained but done so over time so you have a true understanding of how it works in the novel.<br />-The currency and currency conversion systems are even laid out skillfully and if you use the conversions mentioned at the start of the book, you will find the math adds up correctly even in book two!<br />-The storyline is tangible from the start to the present pause without any glaring incongruities.<br />-Rothfuss has immaculate temporal continuity, with wonderful poetry, stories & lore within the story itself that add a whole new level of emotion and depth to the world he has created.<br />-Rothfuss is not afraid to beat the living hell out of his own main character.<br /><br />-Did I mention there is Not an intolerable romance story woven throughout the entire story with some stupid woman foiling the main character endlessly? Of course there is a woman Kvothe pines for, but he knows sheis a harlot and that nothing will ever come of it (or so Kvothe suggests), but it is by no means a romance or love story.<br /><br />It has been a really long time since a fantasy novel pulled me in like this one did, and for that it has become one I recommend highly.<br /><br />I am anticipating the release of his third novel!<br />----------<br />If you like Philip K. Dick, J.R.R. Tolken, S.L. Viehl, Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, or Terry Goodkind you will love Patrick Rothfuss.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's all fascinating to me.  Great character development - people with real hearts and souls.  (Even the crooked souls have some appeal.)  I'm pleasantly surprised with the dry wit and humorous gems sprinkled here and there. The early twentieth-century fashion trends, hairstyles, and aristocratic decorum are absorbing.  A greatly entertaining time piece.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I own a Microsoft Surface Pro which supports USB 3.0 and wanted a lightweight hardwired option for Gigabit LAN Connection.  This device was the answer to my needs and the price was right
0307476073|5.0|Strayed writes with such straight-forward honesty!  Love her style and ability to say what many of us only think!  You will love this book!
0553381407|5.0|Wasn't sure about this book, but it turned out to be very informative and helpful in getting perspective on family abuse.<br />It's the best book I've come across yet on the subject. It helps one understand that toxic parents don't change and often cling even harder to illusions of the past because the last thing in the world they want to do is confront situations. This helps one suffering from family neglect or abuse to not waste precious energy on thinking their parents will one day change and become loving, supportive, protective - what a normal family situation would provide.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The last update was a huge improvement. Thank you. Failed to load alliance base has not been an issue anymore.<br />Still needs refining in exiting. Occasionally reverts back to previous game play, but not nearly as often. Thanks again for the update.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I've owned mine for over 5 years and love it. It replaced a long string of atomic watches and I find that the mechanical movement has much more character. I also appreciate the Seiko's simple, non-jewelry, utilitarian design. As for accuracy, it has consistently lost 5 minutes per week since I bought it. That's what makes this little beauty a chronometer of sorts. Sure, it is not as accurate as quartz or an atomic quartz watch, but the loss is consistent.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Greatest band of all time does it again, ths is a gret album. I can't wait to see them live.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This book took a LONG while to &#34;get there&#34;. To reach that point of really knowing what the purpose of each character really was for the story as a whole. But when this book &#34;got there&#34; it all made perfect sense.  Sparks' does a great job introducing just the right amount of supporting characters to keep things interesting.  The &#34;twists&#34; in this book were fairly predictable - but I really don't think it matters much. This isn't an overly lengthy novel droning on and on about nothing at all - wasting your time. This is a well-written, smartly-organized novel about how love really can last forever... even if not in the way you might expect.  This book had a touch of paranormal to it - which usually strikes me as unnecessary, unrelatable, and unbelievable.<br /><br />One of this books' major positives is the chapter length. I do not like to stop my reading in the middle of a chapter - but sometimes you have to when they are 80pages long (annoying).  Sparks' keeps these chapters at a satisfying length - aided by the continual change on POV throughout the story.<br /><br />Seriously - all of Sparks' novels are amazing - this is just a &#34;middle of the roader&#34; - but still worth the read. :)
B004XN3FHA|4.0|The light is bright enough that you must be careful not to shine into someone's eyes.  The throw in unbelievable.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I picked up this book when it was fairly new and on the &#34;must read&#34; lists everywhere - however I was gravely disappointed after only investing a few hours in this book.  At first you think - &#34;oh, this is a nice story with lovable characters&#34;. And then it all goes south...pun intended.  This is literary porn at best - I do NOT understand how they are going to make this into a movie, with even a shred of class intact.<br /><br />I suppose I can be fair and say this just wasn't my cup of tea - but for those who are into that sort of thing...by all means enter the world of Christian Grey at your own risk.
B00122OCQI|5.0|really, really good album if you are new to Depeche mode and you are looking for a consistent album that brilliantly captures Depeche mode's distinct pop new wave sound this is the record for you solid record start to finish.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I from the old James Bond movies. Craig gets beat up do much.<br />Some times he looks like a homeless man.<br />This movie was better than most he had stared in....
B0063IH60K|5.0|love, love, love this game! only wish my kindle fire battery lasted longer! ads are only between games and you simply hit the &quot;skip&quot; button.
B007KOMTUI|1.0|I don't know what the problem was with Amazon streaming.  I couldn't watch an episode on any computer, tablet, phone, without this skipping and restarting.  Haven't had this issue with other purchases (mainly rentals).  Won't buy from amazon streaming again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really appreciate this app! especially if I am in a hurry and need to know what to expect from the weather!  it has been extremely accurate.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  I liked the charactors and the details of their lives and personalities.  It helped me understand the time period and what happened better.  I knew of Henry VIII from history class but I never new the details.
B00C32REYI|5.0|Epic sound, ever track has parts I look forward to hearing. The whole album has a very somber feel to it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great. I really like this game. it is very addictive. I also like that I can gain coins when I'm not playing.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Initially I was unable to install it on my galaxy s2 (t989) running ICS 4.04. Once my phone was updated to Jelly Bean 4.1.2 - I was able to install the update with no hitch and former issues with the app seem to have been worked out. It works great. I hope this helps others.<br /><br />06/30/2014<br />The latest version (12.2) of the app is still awesome, but I have noticed one little thing that has been removed from the previous versions and it is kind of disappointing. It is the fact, then when music is being streamed, and I receive a notification from any app that is on my phone, the player automatically stops and one needs to press play to get it going again. In the past, whenever there was a notification from any other app while the player was streaming music, it would just pause long enough to let the notification sounds finish and then the player would resume back up without any input required. Aside from that, sweet app.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Ok, I should rephrase my rating.  I personally don't love it but my husband and kids do & occasionally drive me nuts with the little flying bird noises.  All around it's a great game.
1452115567|5.0|Therom Humphrey's book is everything charming and fun, yet meaningful, a great book to leave lying around the livingroom for guests to enjoy and start random conversation.

B00009NQQO|4.0|The balls have a hole in them and are like &#34;squirties&#34;.  I've refrained from buying anything like this anymore because it gets mold inside.  That said, my 2 y.o. daughter would much rather fill the balls and squirt the water everywhere than throw it into the basket!  Still a fun bath time activity.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|P.D. James did an excellent job of writing in the style of Jane Austen.  I loved the fact that she referred back to the characters as they were in Pride & Prejudice as it has been awhile since I read the book, however, I did watch the mini series on PBS which was almost verbatim to the book.  It was a very good extension to P&P.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Excellent roman epic series with enough action, romance, gore, nudity and deceit that those craving more can enjoy. Loved every minute of it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use and to view the figures and the findings can be saved - what's not to love!  I have not used it a lot but it was certainly easy to use.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|Very good deep heartfelt movie... If you're looking for a true love story this is the one to watch without a doubt!
B00C9V1Q5G|1.0|The series is beautifully produced and well-acted. But the grisly focus is creepy and offensive. It's just porn in a pretty package.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books.I could see why so many ladies and even men are reading this,it pulls you into the story You want to be Ana. At least I do.Is E.L.James doing any more books like this,cuz I will definetly buy it.
B00C7L4QB4|3.0|Its hard not to compare this show to the Following with Kevin Bacon. On the surface, they're very similar. Tortured main character, gruesome murders, creepy psychopaths. Yet, they are, in essence, nothing alike. Bacon's character is a cliche. Will Graham, the protagonist in Hannibal, is so beautifully drawn, I can't take my eyes off him. He is a &#34;special investigator&#34; with the FBI. Those who work with him see him as fragile, so much so that they all seem to be holding their collective breath, waiting for him to shatter. The thing that makes him weak in their eyes is his stunning depth of empathy. This is how he solves crimes. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist (and future notorious psychopath) who works with the FBI and Graham, has a different perspective. When Graham asks &#34;how do you see me?&#34;, Lecter replies, you are &#34;the mongoose I want under the house when the snakes slither by.&#34;  The production quality is high, the supporting cast is great. The show is smartly written. However, because the show focuses lovingly and long on each gruesome act, I give it only three stars.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|Since Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys announced their reformation at a fan convention in 2005, OMD have enjoyed something of a career renaissance. Reunited along with Martin Cooper and Malcolm Holmes, the classic 4-piece performed their 1981 masterpiece, \\"Architecture & Morality\\", in full for the first time on 2007's highly successful tour. With the synthpop pioneers back in vogue, and with long overdue critical acclaim for the albums created during the band's Imperial phase in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was fresh impetus to deliver some new product, and this eventually materialised in 2010...<br /><br />In truth, McCluskey had been stockpiling material since 1996's \\"Universal\\", the last of a trio of `solo' albums that McCluskey had recorded under the OMD moniker for Virgin Records. \\"History Of Modern\\" was essentially another solo work, with Humphreys committed to other projects (such as his work with partner Claudia Brucken in OneTwo). Disappointingly it was a rather unbalanced affair, with outtakes (\\"Sister Marie Says\\") nestling alongside Atomic Kitten rejects (see the rather strained \\"If You Want It\\") and a smattering of new compositions that had been written by McCluskey after his commitment to other girl acts such as The Genie Queen had lapsed. Significantly, however, Humphreys collaborated with McCluskey on the album's two best cuts - \\"Green\\" (originally demoed by McCluskey in the early 90s) and the enchanting \\"New Holy Ground\\", the track that came the closest to mirroring that classic OMD sound. Fast-forward 3 years and we have 12th album, \\"English Electric\\", with both McCluskey and Humphreys pulling the choral strings...<br /><br />It is OMD's fourth album, \\"Dazzle Ships\\", that provides the blueprint for this lovingly crafted album, with sound tapestries interspersed throughout the assured 12-track set. \\"Please be Seated\\", the first of four sound collages, starts \\"English Electric\\", PA announcement style (with tantalising echoes of \\"Radio Waves\\"and \\"Introducing Radios\\") before the first song proper, \\"Metroland\\", begins its 7-minute-plus synthpop odyssey. Picking up where \\"The Right Side\\" left off on the previous album, it is another unashamed doffing of the cap to Kraftwerk (see \\"Europe Endless\\"). The track (much like The Human League's excellent \\"Night People\\") was cruelly edited and released as the album's first single in March this year. Third track \\"Night Café\\" maintains the momentum, with a teasing intro that evokes their first hit \\"Messages\\", with lyrics inspired by the work of American painter Edward Hopper (who had influenced the sleeve design for 1985's \\"Crush\\") and intriguingly described by Humphreys as \\"Souvenir meets She's Leaving\\".<br /><br />With the previous tracks being steeped so evidently in the past, by contrast, \\"The Future Will Be Silent\\" is a more experimental affair, featuring a whispered vocal from McCluskey, robotic voices, Kraftwerk-like melodic interspersions and even a hint of dubstep, as if to emphasize that the 21st century version of OMD is much more than a nostalgia trip. \\"Helen of Troy\\", a collaboration with Greek act Fotonovella, is more traditional OMD fare, allowing former history student McCluskey to indulge the listener with a semi-sequel to OMD's classic brace of \\"Joan of Arc\\" tracks, with his paean to the mythological Greek warrior (previously immortalized in Icehouse's excellent \\"Trojan Blue\\" from 1982's \\"Primitive Man\\"). Bearing rhythmical similarities to the aforementioned \\"Joan of Arc\\", and containing the duo's trademark choral flourishes, this is classic OMD. Track six, the beautiful \\"Our System\\", continues in the same 'old school' vein; a slow building choral-heavy workout featuring samples of NASA Voyager recordings and some effective cascading drums from Mal Holmes in the coda.<br /><br />While McCluskey's insistence on ostensibly using the previous album to 'clear the decks' rendered the project more OCD than OMD at times, \\"English Electric\\" benefits hugely from its compositions being conceived within a narrower timeframe, making it a far more cohesive affair. The one exception is \\"Kissing The Machine\\", a collaboration with former Kraftwerk meister Karl Bartos that was originally released under the guise of Elektric Music in 1993. Humphreys has transformed the electro ballad, giving it a more uptempo and contemporary sheen; even enlisting the services of partner Claudia Brucken to provide the spoken word vocal mid-song. While many fans have bemoaned the track's inclusion, it does fit the album's retro-modern template. And it's a great song that deserves a wider audience. Fans of Kraftwerk (and indeed this record) would also be advised to check out Karl Bartos's excellent new album, \\"Off The Record\\".<br /><br />It was \\"Decimal\\", another musical mosaic that offered OMD fans their first taste of the new album earlier this year. Playing like a 21st Century \\"Time Zones\\", this curious soundbite perfectly bridges the gap between the previous track and the simply gorgeous ballad \\"Stay With Me\\", which features a rare Humphreys vocal (his first lead on an OMD album since \\"(Forever) Live And Die\\" in 1986). Another single contender.<br /><br />\\"Dresden\\" (wisely chosen as the album's second single) is structurally similar to \\"Sister Marie Says\\" (itself something of a musical cousin of \\"Enola Gay\\"), and further enhances the album's classic OMD status, with its driving bass line and a monstrous synth motif that has the potential to be as ubiquitous as the one that permeates Muse's \\"Starlight\\".<br /><br />Arguably the album's two strangest tracks are reserved for the climax. \\"Atomic Ranch\\", the penultimate track, boasts cacophonous sound effects and, ostensibly, a statement about modern consumerism. The ephemeral - and aptly titled - \\"Final Song\\" is further challenging. Sonically sounding like a revisit of old b-sides \\"Annex\\" and \\"Navigation\\", it features a typically abstract lyric from McCluskey, while some unexpected near-operaticfemale vocals add an unusual flavour to the mix.<br /><br />Thirty-five years since their formation, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark have crafted an album that comfortably nestles alongside the best work created by the core duo of McCluskey and Humphreys. Whilst it sometimes feels a bit clinical in its execution, this is a beautifully produced (and perfectly sequenced) set of songs, with an attention to detail lacking from previous albums. A real surprise in fact. (9/10)
0345505387|4.0|This is a collaboration between author Diana Gabaldon and illustrator Hoang Nguyen.  What is different is that you now have pictures of people and places that are interesting to consider.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was laugh-out-loud amazing. Ralph is a villain tired of doing the villain-thing, and ventures into other games to prove himself. Along the way he runs into a rambunctious little girl who is a &#34;glitch&#34;, and together they learn from each other and become better people, accepting their &#34;flaws&#34; and growing stronger. I'm usually the one to root for the underdog, or be intrigued by the villain and their life story, so this movie was right up my alley. I'm also a big Sonic the Hedgehog fan, so it was a bonus to see him every now-and-then throughout the movie!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I spend hours on this site.  The chance to see some of the greatest photos I have ever seen in the world excites me.<br />It is also great fun to set up your own boards that represent you and your likes, and a chance to dream about how I<br />would furnish a dream house.  Highly recommended.  Friendly community.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|This is a great series that ended too soon.  The manga just started again so maybe we will see more episodes someday.  Very well done only negative is there is definitely fan service moments.  But if you can get past those you will enjoy this series very much
0679805273|5.0|We give it out to everyone who is moving or graduating.  It is a great story for kids but works for adults too!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My wife and I have been playing this on our smart phones and on also on my Kindle and so far the farthest I've gotten is about 3150. I think you have to hit the circles but that's not entirely clear in the very abbreviated instructions. Overall it keeps you coming back for more. Both my wife and I run enjoy playing although I wouldn't say we were addicted to it. I'm sure we will figure it out as we haven't been playing it for all that much time. I would recommend it, it's the first game for I've found for the Kindle the uses the gyro and has good graphics.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I enjoyed reading this and really putting myself in Tom's life. I READ a lot with my children (ages 6 and 7), but feel they are a bit too young to be able to separate realities in their lives from the superstitions and ghosts etc. To really be able to enjoy this story.
B0055S348W|5.0|I feel obligated to review this app.  One of The most useful apps for productivity.  I've been using this for a while on my Galaxy S3 and Note2, it's amazing, worth every penny!  Works flawlessly.  Booting my laptop to print an email is history, thanks to this app.  Easy to configure:  Plug your printer to your home of office network, connect your phone to your wifi and print.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|trouble with the packaging.<br />i`ve received with the cover scared. maybe because of wrong handling by custom but i suppose it is not your responsability
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I am trying to forget this movie. Why was this ever so popular? People hunting each other? It's awful. The only reassuring idea is that hope and love can save us.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very thought-provoking; one of those stories that I will talk about and remember for years.  I especially recommend it to parents of teens, and those who work with them.
B007712XAU|5.0|Not for women only!  The men in my life love this, too.  Lots of history in this incredible saga which takes place in England in the early 1900's.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|This is another movie I have waited a long time to be available for streaming. It's now a 'classic' rags to riches RomCom. It's a movie you can watch all the time and never tire of. It's about a prostitute (Julia Roberts) who happens to be hired by a millionaire (Richard Gere) to spend a week with him so he has a professional date for business meetings/functions. It's an enjoyable movie. If you've never seen it and enjoy romantic comedies, you really should check it out.
B0000012XC|2.0|The performance of Kempff is excellent, but unfortunately there is some static noise in the background. I should recommend to buy a more recent recording.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I love this app and use it all the time but was sorry to see people leaving bad reviews because of the price. If u want to know the nonlinear streaming price is optional and is only $2 a month OR $16a year. these are GREAT prices compared to other streaming services.
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I grew up listening to these guys and I could not resist buying this new album.  My favorite song is track 2.  Glad I bought it!
B0068MNNOE|5.0|Long ago, a few years beyond university, I learned to question anything \\"experts\\" present as factual.  Politics, religion, economics, and science have mostly occupied my question resolution.  Now, as a result of the movie Anonymous, I can add art to that list.  Seeking answers, if only on a personal level not for publication, is a fun journey through the minds of all the published experts who present their facts and speculations on both sides of an argument.  In the process my knowledge base and ability to contemplate new issues expands significantly.  Anonymous gifted me with a new subject to explore.<br /><br />Honestly I had never given William Shakespeare much thought since High School literature classes.  Back then I remember thinking \\"how could such an uneducated man achieve such intimate levels of personal expression?\\"  When I asked that question of the teacher the answer was \\"he was a genius.\\"  I accepted her response because I had not yet learned to question authority.  When I left HS I left reading Shakespeare behind, only enjoying a few Shakespearean based movies like The Tempest, Much Ado about Nothing, and Hamlet. As a result of Anonymous though I have thoroughly enjoyed reading both sides of the Shakespearean authorship question, learning more about his life and the lives of others of that era.  As an uninvested spectator I will never have a true answer, but I will form an opinion.  The ticket to the journey to form that opinion supporting one side or the other was won by merely watching Anonymous.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I loved this book and i need to read the rest! I read the whole thing in one night its amazing, juicy, and mysterious:)
B009O07NDY|5.0|I read all the reviews of both the special edition and the other CD for this product and was a little apprehensive to buy it because of what they said. A few reviews mentioned the songs were not the same as the movie, but from what my husband and I can tell is that they are great and exactly what we wanted.<br /><br />This purchased even came with free MP3 downloads so as soon as I bought the CD (hadn't even shipped) I was able to download the MP3s to my computer and we listened to the whole CD before it even arrived in the mail. This was awesome especially because we were concerned by what the reviews had said.<br /><br />Needless to say we love it and it was a great birthday present for my husband.
B00518HBD0|5.0|This is a great CD<br />just a good rock CD - I don't see how you can not like this one
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 9 year old daughter loves this movie and couldn't wait to start reading the books!! She is looking forward to reading the rest in the series!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|You'll like this one. It has the same feel, expands the world, and doesn't really answer anything. Not a bad read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well built characters. You walk and breath with them while you are reading. Very involving plot. Interesting twists. A true page turner.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|This is a great album at a great price. It even has her newest duet with country superstar Vince Gill
030758836X|5.0|WOW, I get what all the hype has been about. You will never look at marriage the same again. Can't wait to read more from this great author!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I would recommend it as a mandatory read!  Now I want to see the movie!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is one of my fav<br />You have to get this game. I cant put it down. The best ive played in a long time.
0765325950|5.0|Some spoilers but nothing bad. I can't believe its over - but what an ending! Well worth the read - but be forewarned - this is bloody!<br /><br />Blood and Bloody Ashes! My heart is pounding. I feel like I am breathless and covered in troloc blood. Oh light, the things I have seen today. Lightning, balls of fire, molten rock, and bodies falling from the sky. The Amyrlin Seat, bloodied, striding forward with some kind of ivory rod, raining death and destruction on our enemies. Jack of the Shadows himself, with that bladed staff of his, bringing death to Fades. A King without a country riding out to meet the enemy general, as Two Rivers longbow men, from 100 paces off, create a path through the hordes of trolocs. Aes Sedai and Asha'men facing off against Dreadlords and the Forsaken, while Dragons boomed in the distance. The Heroes of the Horn have a new Rider, his name is Robert Jordan. Walk in the Light Brandon Sanderson, may you always find water and shade.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Such a good movie and wonderful character studies. It is delightful and full of surprises. Ends beautifully and with an uplifting future for the characters!
B00B7FXYJG|1.0|To start, I would consider myself a more than average Dark Knight/Frank Miller fanatic.  I read these when they were out in the 1980's and I still say the graphic novel itself is still probably one of the most influential pieces of work which have transcended into most superhero films of today.  I thought Part 1 was okay and I was really hopeful for Part 2.  It was pretty much unwatchable.  The voice casting and direction was amateur.  The animation, while I admit Miller's graphic novel is gritty, attempts to capture some of the iconic scenes but fails miserably.  What I think is missing in both films which I will admit may have been hard to capture is the interior dialogues.  I think this was Miller's best work as to why we understand how all of the characters were the way they were.  I think it worked in the movie \\"Sin City\\" and it was disrespectful to the fans of the graphic novels not to include it.<br /><br />Also, I detested the PG-13 sanitization of the books:  Gordon smoked cigars, Joker does kill a alot of kids at the fair with poisoned cotton candy.  If Warner Brothers is not going to do the adaptation truthfully then don't do it at all.<br /><br />Absolutely horrible.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|If you appreciate a fantastic Blues guitarist, there is no way you will not love this video! Joe Bonamassa rocks!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun can blow s*** up and can advance without having to<br /><br />put money in to the game. The Granville of military might.
0061537969|5.0|This book had me moved from the first page to the last sentence. I think I read it in a day and still often go back and pick it up in random places and start reading. Wonderfully written and has changed the way I view my dog. Keep the tissues close !
B008133MDK|5.0|Loved the new twist it brought to th old Sherlock. Looking forward to viewing the series and hope there will be more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is a great way to wind down at the end of the day...and it will probably keep you up late too!
B0067R0APK|3.0|I was using the free app for awhile & liked it. This new design presents the information in such small print that I am jst rating this okay.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I haven't played  can this game  since I was a kid &amp; it's still fun. I can even play while on a boring phone call!
B0073RSVMC|5.0|The Schleich dinosaurs, although pricey, are well constructed and very popular with children.  Our 3-yr. old grandson takes it to bed with him everynight.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|The concepts raised in this autobiographical story from Sheryl Sandberg resonated with me.  I've really been taking a hard look at my own ideas about ambition, the culture of work in America, and the benefit to all when we have diversity in leadership.  This book is aimed at a small sliver of the population who have the drive to reach the executive suite.  However, it is worthwhile reading for men and women who want to see change at the top.
B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|Anew twist to bad guys coming after the food guys. Well done and believable. If you like Si-fi you'll like this.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I just love this app. It never fails to relax me, even when I'm wound up. It's worth the petty change it costs. Don't go to McDonald's today, and it's paid for.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I want to be able to know the weather forecast for where I am as well as for back home.  So this allows me to get the weather forecast at any time.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|The story itself was fine but the ending left me feeling confused.  I hate when endings of stories feel rushed or not thought out.  I was really looking forward to the book and was really disappointed with the outcome.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This gives lots of info about the weather and more details for specific areas.  I really enjoy the pictures that people have uploaded from many different places.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Wow this is a really great and creative game! The first thing you notice when you open the app is 1. the long line of the companys that created it and copright and all that jazz. 2. The home screen, this is the playground mode. To move, tap the right side of the screen to move right, left side to move left. Tap the notepad in the upper right corner to open the type screen. And the icon next to it of a landscape you tap to change area. Tap play to go to the character menu/level select screen. That's pretty much the basics of the game. now the other features and complaints...You can really think of ANYTHING and make it appear! The playground and levels are great! Only one problem, the levels relation to astrology and evolution and God as a playable character is rather undesirable for me. And $5 of I.A.P'S are also a downside. I don't really think you should pay for a &quot;all world pass&quot; to play some worlds and play any on future updates. And the fact to pay 99&cent; for one of the four 9 character packs. unacceptable for a paid app. Any in app purchases are. So overall. A great creative/puzzle/sandbox game. worth the 99&cent;. (plus $5 in IAP)
B0063IH60K|4.0|A great pastime when I have a few minutes. It is something that I can sit down and just relax.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|My fav Volbeat album so far!! Dead but Rising, Room 24, Black Bart, The Lonesome Rider and Doc Holiday are my fav on the album.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is my favorite show. It has all the shock value of an HBO series but without all the nudity. Still, it has wonderful writers that keep the main storylines from the graphic novels while creating a new version for the series. It keeps readers like me glued to the television not knowing what will happen next. Will it be like the novels or will something new and exciting happen? I love not knowing what is in store for our poor tortured group. I love the addition of new characters like Darryl that keep the show interesting. Not into zombies? Well, the show is much more than just zombies. It has a wide range for anyone that likes drama ad suspense! Completely recommend to anyone!!!!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|This is such a disappointment.  The movie should have been a straight drama without all the fancy staging effects.  Directors need to keep to the original story line and kept this a straight drama, instead of a play within the movie.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I recently saw the national tour of JERSEY BOYS and loved it so much, I went a second time.  I bought the soundtrack and then this so I could hear all of their big hits.
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|I've been anxiously awaiting this release since I heard it was coming out. Needless to say, Stone Sour did not let me down. I'm very picky when it comes to my rock and roll, but I can honestly say that this band has never disappointed me with their music. If you enjoyed HoG&B Part 1, you will enjoy Part 2. Black John and Sadist are my favorites. Excellent Album, Excellent band. Rock on boys~
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The author creates a very plausible post-apocalyptic world, but there are no rules on that, other than basic physics and so forth.  I only fault him for using the “nobody remembers” gambit to avoid having to explain how that world came to be.  Something as impactful as an apocalypse would be preserved in the cultural collective memory.  There is an opportunity here to write a prequel that explains the origin of the solos and the collective memory lapse.  That would be welcome by the fans of the story and good for the author.<br />On the positive side, the characters are well done and consistent and the driving forces of love, social order and power are well developed and not overdone.  This is a very human sci-fi story.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book has so many twists and turns that it left me researching groups and circumstances on the internet and in the library to learn more about those things. I found it a quick read, but yet I reread several parts while researching them to make sure I was getting the whole essence of the story. It certainly made me wonder how much was based on truth and how much was made up!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|OMG, this movie was friggin fantastic.  I was so impressed by this movie.  Action packed, edge of seat anticipation.  I mean lets get #2 going all ready.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Rambles in places, definitely written to appeal to women more than men, though the romance is boring. Amidst this are descriptions of intense violence and brutality, so I definitely wouldn't call it a light read. But the story is very engaging and the characters are likeable.
B007UXT6T6|1.0|Action was cool.  Story line was mediocre.  Tom Cruise is terrible these days.  Time to retire the brand, for ten years or so.
B0031RSA24|5.0|Clear thinking is a gift beyond measure, and this book is filled with it.....enjoy but avoid it if you are a fundamentalist, it may ruin your delusion!
B008EQIK90|4.0|my wife and i grew up watching johnny depp on 21 jump street.  this was funny and had its moments.  i like Jonah hill he is a great actor.
B004SIP9B0|5.0|I was so happy to received this dvd, I had order it before from you guys but some how It got feet and left my house, I was so happy to get it again, thanks and I will always order via Amazon.com...you guys are reliable and it always come on time..thanks
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Rented this for kids on Ipad during Hurricane Sandy.  Great movie, great story.  3 yr son, 5 yr old cousin loved it!
B005LAIGSC|5.0|this was a good movie and it came just like it was told to me it was going to arrived and in a timely fashion as well, thanks once again for this prompt arrival of my good movie. Thanks
B0088RQ4TI|1.0|Not even worth the first thirty five minutes.  I watch a lot of movies and this compared with 10K BC and XXX.  Bad all around.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Excellent product. Works well with my 7D. Easy to use and great secondary controls.  Would definitely recommend to anyone needing extra battery life.
B0091XRL86|5.0|Our son is loving pirates right now.  Sleep over with cousins and popcorn and this was an instant hit.  Hope to see more installments.
1781163243|5.0|I got a damaged copy the first time I ordered this, but was able to send it back and get a new copy at no charge. The art and descriptions are beautiful! For anyone who likes Halo and art.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|This was a great watch with the family.  It had cute story with really cute characters.  The dancing was really silly.
B007HACDLK|5.0|FANTASTIC.  Fast paced and exciting.  Hated to see it end.  Can't wait to see what is in store for Irene Kennedy and her cohorts next!
B006TTC590|1.0|I love the BB I hate this DVD! It skipped at the height of the performance killing my enthusiasm. Do Not Buy This! Thanks for a big let down!
B0068THAGY|4.0|Entertaining enough.  A more restrained J.J. Abrams which is not an entirely good thing.  The young male and female leads saved a movie that easily could have gone off into the weeds of farce, but just by a whisker.  Might be a bit intense for younger children.
B0050ACY4U|5.0|the metal box with the art on the metal make this a very nice collector's item. the movie is fantastic, one of my favorite modern day myths. this is one of my most prized movies and having it in this form is very pleasing
B008602KQI|5.0|Girl power in all it's quiet glory.  A few holes in the plot here and there but on the whole a very entertaining popcorn flick worth the watch.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Loved the previous two books, and this one is good as well. The militaristic feel of the first two books isn't quite as abundant in this book, as it tends more to the civilian life of colonization, but it still makes an appearance. Good but not as great as the previous two books. Still recommended.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is my favorite version of Peter Pan.  I prefer live actors to cartoons.  My great grandchildren have the Disney movie, which I also enjoyed, but I bought them each this version as well.  Hard to believe the movie has been out for about 10 years, and I never heard of it.  Highly recommended.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|An absolutely great read. I was taken away with Craig's story and he really has a great knack for writing.<br />Riveting and thoroughly likeable, Craig deserves kudos for &#34;American on Purpose&#34;.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Every now and then, I like a sentimental movie.  This is a good one.  Sort of every middle-aged woman's fantasy, I guess.  Pretty much a &#34;chick&#34; flick.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I was surprised how intriguing the book turned out to be.<br />I do recommend to anyone who likes a good survival story.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|The special effects were great!  Loved the transformers and Shia interaction.  I eespecially like it when the good guys win and save the World--again!
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded this game for myself, but my husband steals my kindle every chance he gets to play it himself! :)
B005OCFHHK|5.0|best HP Blu Ray movie set EVER!<br /><br />It's super slim case is just great. The CD's are all beautiful and the presentation as well.<br /><br />The quality of the video is AMAZING.<br /><br />100% recommended for a Harry Potter fan!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an amazing way to pass the time on the train, at the Dr office and just anytime boredom happens lol...I'm not a game person but this is just too fun.
B00190N4E4|5.0|I love it , great movie and lovely presentation I would recommend everyone watching at least once in their lifetime
B008YP272M|5.0|Thank god for Christopher Hitchens!  The first few chapters had the familiar razor sharp wit that made me laugh out loud.  Then as Christopher's illness progressed to its inevitable conclusion, sadness that this unique human being would be lost to the world took over. When my time comes to shuffle off this mortal coil, I want to be reminded of this immortal book so I face death with the same dignity and unshakeable faith in his principles as Christopher showed us is possible.
B0086700CM|5.0|Keeps her occupied when I'm dragging her around shopping with me and she picked it up rather quickly at 5 years old.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Good quality, with minor download freeze but not the movies fault. Good action and enjoyable. Would highly recommend for families.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Terrific! Absolutely no complaints here.  Great service. Great app. Still need a few words for this review... and got it.
B0081JFGQU|5.0|love the way these two do the songs they sing, and Susan Tedeschi's voice is fantastic as far as I'm concerned!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game. I find myself looking forward to my energy restoring so I can play more.  Buying gems or coins is not required to play since they can be earned but I have found myself buying gems a few times to complete things faster. I have had a few issues with forced closes so I would like to see that fixed. Most of the time it's right at the beginning but there was one time where I opened a room using 10 gems and right after I went into the room it closed and when I went back in the room was locked again but I was missing 10 gems. So I wasn't happy about that but that's really the only issue.
B0087YZBMS|5.0|I really like this CD, saw her on BBC doing &#34;Pride&#34; for the UK Olympians...really has a good voice and some nice songs. Guess she is a big hit in Europe and can see why....
B005NF2UE6|4.0|I am a fan of the band and this CD didn't disappoint. I like to listen to this stuff when I'm riding my bike.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|This toy is cool but if it cost less money than more people would get it .It was fun making it but it needs more details in the instructions so it will be easier to put together.The person who made it needs more blasters because not all the troopers can get one.Could you get more droids for the mini mtt?Could you add a mini snowspeeder?why isn't there an at-at driver?Could you add horns to darth maul sata claus?
B00867GJYK|5.0|I really love this movie one of my favorites when I was little! The price I paid was great. recommend this movie if you have little kids!
B006S080DK|3.0|Other reviews spoke enough to me to watch this.  I love costume and period dramas.  I was excited to see Helen Bonham acting.  However, the story was so condensed to get to the point, every character was given little to  no time to develop,  The music was drippy dreadful.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|this movie sucked , pretty lame for a martial arts movie, main character cant act, and his narration sucks. i wouldnt suggest this dumb movie to anyone!!!
B008N1V11U|4.0|Nice gameplay toot graphics would like it more if control was easier. But over all its a good game try it out.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|my kids and me enjoyed the movie. it was good seeing some of the old video game characters and it was pretty funny!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Nice action could be easier to get power ups. My kid loves to play it he's 3yrs old. Even he can be a web slinger
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|it was decent , and the graphics werent that bad either. i think it would have been better if there were more environments used.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read a series of books that has captivated me so much, to the point where I lose track of time and reality.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is amazing. I just started so I am new to the game. Anyway the graphics are great and the animals are adorable. My only concern is that when you are trying to catch an animal to put in your shelter if you don't bribe the animal with peanuts, there is a greater chance that the animal will escape. Other than that this game is great.
0739368044|5.0|I bought this for my husband, he Loved it!  for those folks that are Eragon fans, get it.  two thumbs up!
B007SGM084|5.0|It was a great book and it kept my interest.I don't read that often but this book kept my interest.
1608871452|5.0|One of the coolest collectables for a Supernatural fan. My girlfriend loves it and I think it's pretty cool too.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great game to keep your mind fresh. I love competing against my kids even my 5 year old likes to play. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to pass time and have fun.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Fast paced fun game .takes some getting used to the controls,but once you do!!<br /><br />Fun jumps and great graphics thou.So addictive!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would highly recommend this game because it fun and has a good graphic picture. This is a good game for passing the time. I love this game. It's mind blowing!:(
B00029LNHS|3.0|It was as advertised.. But I wasn't impressed. They have better stuff out there... ... .. .. . . .
B003ODIZL6|4.0|When ever I didn't know a word  I just looked I it up  in here and  then I just knew the word. I  we  very useful to me an  it will be useful to you too.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It takes a lot for me to get into a book, but I gave to say I was hooked from the first page. Although I saw quite a few grammatical errors, the sorry line was absolutely amazing! I definitely recommend this book to all.
B00B0YL0E0|5.0|I have always been a fan of Pretty Maids, this is top notch, not a bad track on this, I keep listening over and over. My favorite track is \\"I See Ghosts\\", one hell of a comeback album.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We loved the movie but the dvd quality is crap about half way into the movie it starts to skip and at one point freezes all together. I wouldn't buy it again. I will go else where to get my movies from now on.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book gives a real perspective to both sides of a horrible issue. I would definitely recommend it. A must read.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We watched it but forgot about a few scenes an our younger son was watching so not a movie for young ones really.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I am reading the book on my kindle and the video is a very accurate depiction.  What a commentary on the &#34;leasure class&#34; of England.  Thoroughly enjoyable
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I think this should be given to high-schoolers to read.<br />I can not begin to analyse this text as there are so many possible readings that my head hurts.<br /><br />Based in a time where whimsy and and magic were starting to take audiences by storm, The Night Circus examines how far individuals (if not groups of people) can bend reality to fit with their desires. Basically, when shown the impossible how much further will the bar be pushed?<br /><br />Very romantic (though not soppy or erotic), a part of me wanted the female protagonist to sort of wrench free of her confines; I wasn't 100 per cent sold on her romances.<br /><br />Must read - it has almost made me forgive clowns for their abominable existence.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. There are new levels all the time. It may take a little longer than I would like to gain energy but its worth the wait!
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|I heard his Lohengrin in Munich and his Parsifal at the Met.  Now that Domingo has retired from the Wagner repertoire and Ben Heppner is often not at his best, Kaufmann is the lyric Wagner tenor of choice.  His deep, rich lyrical voice is perfect for Lohengrin in particular, and he has a compelling stage presence.  Runnicles is a sympathetic collaborator.  This is a first-rate release by a rising star, worthy of release during this bicentennial year of the Master's birth.  The sound quality is very fine also.
B000002NCW|5.0|What is there not to like about Mike Oldfield?  A first class collection by this artist. Any collector would want it and I found it brilliant.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Its great for the whole family. It is covers all emotions from tear jerkier to laughing to inspirational. Highly recommend it my friends
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Bought as a Kindle book, with a number of others also on Kindle for a friend of mine who really loves the &#34;bodice ripper&#34; type novel. She loves them so that is all that matters
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|My all-time favorite science fiction novel is Childhood's End!  It has a vision that's different than all other science fiction books.  Clarke's use of language, foreshadowing and tone adds to its appeal. The concept of the book--to explain one of humanity's oldest, most deep seeded fears and its relationship to the next step in the evolution of mankind--astounded me the first time I read it as a teenager--still does and I'm a long way from my teenage years.  Interesting sub themes too such as the view of the clash between science versus religion.  I will say no more, lest I give away too much.  My hope is that a top notch filmmaker of great skill such as Steven Spielberg soon makes it into a movie and stays true to the astonishing story.  My highest recommendation!
0803729227|5.0|My kids read this book to where now we don't need to read at all but can say it off-by-heart.  They keep coming back to this and other J. Donaldson books.  There is a lovely rhythm to it and the illustrations are simple and bright.  I give this as a birthday present to many 4-yr old friends.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|I loved this movie! It was a wonderful tribute/roast of the 80's rock scene. Tom Cruise makes this movie. He is mesmerizing!
0307719774|5.0|As other reviewers have suggested, this is a great journal because (1) you only have to write a few lines each day, and (2) it prompts you with interesting questions.  I am very much looking forward to seeing how my answers change from year to year.  I think this would make an excellent gift.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It hurts me you don't like the book, a feast for crows is as good as the others. The only difference is you're not...
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|It seemed a bit jumpy and there was a lot going on in the book. Sometimes it was difficult to keep up on the characters. But in the end, it was a great story.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love B.B.C. news, because I get news from around the world. Current, business, nature science, medical breakthroughs and more. But most important is there's no bias. I just want news from every where, but I don't want opinions. I prefer to weigh the available options and then make my mind up!!
B005LAII0I|5.0|I love the whole movie makes me feel happy after I watch it! Although,<br />When I tried the DVD it skipped at the end I was a bit disappointed but the seller refunded my whole purchase and would have sent me a replacement DVD if they had one! Great customer service!!! Thank you
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I would have given Facebook 5 stars except for the fact that they allow soooo many advertisements to show up that I'm about sick of it. The spam that is, not yet Facebook. But it's so easy to use and keeps you connected with people you want to keep in touch with.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great app.  I love being able to pause, record, and go back 10 seconds.  Also nice to be able to set it to record.
B004M8S6FC|5.0|Not even completely finished with the book, but it's so good I can hardly put it down.<br /><br />The characters are interesting, even some of the protagonists die.<br />It shows how...useless some (all ?) deaths in war is and the reasons for some (in this case alien races and humans) to go to war<br /><br />Book is well written, well paced and very entertaining !<br />I look forward to reading the other books from Mr. Scalzi, already have 2 more in my reading queue (The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony)
B005GPFDQK|2.0|To make myself perfectly clear, this review is not about the music on the album but the physical vinyl itself. And I'm writing that because my wife has had this CD since the album came out several years ago and it's one of DD's best releases EVER. I decided to surprise her with a copy of the vinyl version as we have gotten back into vinyl as of late. I've seen it on a single record release and not many double records so I jumped on this one when I saw it was a double record set which meant fourteen songs; same as the CD release as opposed to the ten song digital release. THIS is where the story goes awry. I made several assumptions, and we all no what that means. The first assumptions: at almost a $30.00 price point I ASSUMED it was on 180g vinyl; it was not. Not only was it not 180g the vinyl is cheaper than even the height of cheap vinyl in the late 1970's/early 1980's. It literally wobbled as I put it on the turntable AND the second record already had a bow which made listening precarious at best. The second assumption: since this was double record I ASSUMED it would have a gatefold with nice pictures and liner notes: it has neither. The record sleeve is slightly oversized as to allow both record to slip into it. All in all, I was very disappointed. I wonder of DD had any input into the creation of the packaging? It is NOT worth the $30.00 price point.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|This app is great but on the kindle fire HD it will cause your Internet to drop when using LAN connections to samba servers. Also you cannot log into a samba server with any account that has special characters in its password. It's great when it works but it's just too buggy.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This video is really five stars for it's vivid and real content. A tour through what goes on behind the scenes. The corruption and evil practices of farm factories is now exposed for all to see. What could go wrong is going wrong now! I enjoyed the part where the farmer put his hand inside an opening of a cow through the gut-wall to pull out the e. coli because they are now corn fed instead of grass. A must see for everyone and I highly recommend this.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Typical of John Green this book was heartbreaking, exciting, full of mystery and had some of the most relatable characters I've read. A must read.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Suspense, likable characters, good sex scenes, nice story. Did not read the first two but it wasn't necessary to enjoy this book.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This was a really great read.  Rook sounds just like Castle, makes you laugh out loud at some of his comments.  The writer really does the characters well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun!! my 6 year old plays this all the time and she loves it very fullfilling
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I love Rio! It's funny enough that even my middle school and high school students like it. It's also useful to teach about Carnaval in Brazil.
B00C32R64G|5.0|volbeat continues to amaze me. i cant wait for the next one. i love all the guest stars on this album.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Very few albums have so many great songs in it. I like every single one of them. Love this band.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great book! I love how different it is from the first book in the trilogy but at the same time similar.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|As many have said the update is broken. I uninstalled the old version and the new version installed with no issue, and works great. I ssuspect this is an appstore problem, and the app shouldn't really be penalized with a bad review because of this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best book in the trilogy! It is amazing how one person can change another's entire outlook on life. Amazing love story!
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Nothing new here, move along.  Good and bad transformers fighting over planet earth.  Megan Fox replaced.  Continuity issues.  The version I was watching periodically shifted into an extremely fuzzy low resolution mode.  If you like the Transformers franchise you will probably find this movie acceptable, unless you experience the technical issue I had.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to see what all the hype was about....I got hooked! I couldn't put this book down! I instantly connected with the main female character! (Not in all ways ;) ) I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it and doesn't understand why it is so popular....you will understand everything in the first two chapters!
B0068THAGY|3.0|It was OK.  Not great, not horrible.  A bunch of kids are out filming a zombie movie when one of them observes their science teacher deliberately wrecks the train. Animals mysteriously flee.  Metal starts disappearing.  A mysterious cube picked up by one the kids shakes ominously. Kid's eye view of flawed fathers overwhelmed by grief. Power abusing military guy. Barely visible clips of the monster. ET and various people connect telepathically. Presumably ends at night so you won't notice how underwhelming the finale is.
B0089X38EU|5.0|I like this album very much, it reminds me of my younger years, cruzing the roads of our town listing to some great music
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I was hooked the first page. Great plot twists and action. I hope to hear more from Will Robie and Julie.
