B0055Q5F36|5.0|Most reviews are giving negative reviews on the OtterBox for the screen protector not adhering to the screen correctly thus causing bubbles. If you do the research on the Galaxy S2 the screen is made of Gorilla glass. Some people have claimed to have their S2 slide on the asphalt and not a scratch on the glass. One review, I can't recall at the moment, did a drop test of the S2 vs the Iphone, with the glass facing down and the S2 did not break, crack, or shatter in any way. The Iphone did shatter. Others still believe that a screen protect is good insurance, but it really isn't necessary. Save yourself the grief and leave it off.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I usually don't review an item before the product is released, but there has been so much discussion about this series, I figured I'd try to approach it a bit differently.  I expect the blu ray discs will be fine, but if they aren't, I will update this review.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the casting was just about perfect.  The actors were all well chosen for their roles.  No Hollywood cuties here.  To their's and the directors' credit, there was no \\"over-acting\\".  Everyone stayed true to character.  Some characters gave you an instant impression of where they were on the spectrum of good and bad, while others had a bit more subtle...just as they were in the book.  The sets were superb as were the locations.  Each region had its own feel and nothing was laid on too heavily.  You got the feeling you were looking at a \\"real\\" place.<br /><br />To be fair, the series doesn't cover everything in the book.  If it did, it would have to have 50 episodes, rather than 10.  But it does keep the storyline intact and understandable.  Besides, we don't absolutely need to know all the things they wore and ate, or just how frequently they had sex.  Yes, there is sex in the series.  I didn't feel it was gratuitous.  some of it was absolutely necessary for the plot and the rest gave an insight into the mores and habits of the different peoples.  Were there differences between the book and series?  There were a few, but when they occurred, it was to make the series more understandable without some of the details contained in the book.<br /><br />There are two questions I'll try to address.  If you haven't read the book, will you enjoy the series? Yes, if you lake a well told story that is fantasy, but not the kinds that kids like.  Will you like the book if you see the series first?  Absolutely.  If you like stories where everyone lives happily ever after and the good guys always win, this isn't for you.  But if you like a well told, well acted story with plenty of twists and turns to keep you coming back for more, this is it!ing back for more, this is it!
B0040QYROK|5.0|Released in 1927, amid the golden age of the silent film era, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS is a stylistic tour-de-force that has remained influential for the rest of the century, inspiring films from \\"Frankenstein\\" in 1931, \\"Bladerunner\\" in 1982, to \\"Dark City\\" in 1997. With its imaginative set design, elaborate photography, bold editing, and its then groundbreaking special effects, this German sci-fi silent classic exemplifies the highly inventive period of German Expressionism, which also include such film masterworks as \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligaru\\", \\"Nosferatu\\", \\"The Last Laugh\\", and Lang's \\"Die Nibelungen\\".<br /><br />The 2010 Kino Region-A Blu-ray edition (and its corresponding Region-1 DVD edition) is titled \\"The Complete Metropolis\\" to avoid confusion with earlier DVD editions. It contains, to date, the most complete, two-and-a-half-hour cut of the film, combining the two-hour version from the monumental 2001 restoration effort by Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation (previously released as the 2003 Kino DVD), and about half-hour of footage discovered at Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2008 that had been unseen for decades. This previously lost footage has been edited back into the film to create this new \\"Complete Metropolis\\" edition. The added scenes are sprinkled all over the film, improving continuity, clarifying storytelling, and thus heightening the impact and yielding a result that is greater than the sum of its parts, as they finally restore Lang's full vision to its near complete form.<br /><br />The HD picture quality of the Blu-ray ranges from sparklingly clear in some footage, slightly softer in others (especially the special fx shots), to severely battered and damaged as in those newly-discovered shots. All the \\"good-looking\\" footage came from the 2001 restoration. With the upgrade to HD, the sharpness and the clarity over the DVD counterpart is readily apparent, and therefore this Blu-ray represents the best that the film has ever looked onhome video. Unfortunately, the half hour of new-found footage, originated from 16mm film, looks severely damaged and sometimes barely watchable, and it doesn't benefit much from the HD picture. As the new footage is sprinkled all over the film, the picture quality oscillates between good and bad, normally an uncomfortable experience but a small price to pay for finally watching the most complete version yet of the classic.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc contains a lossless DTS 5.1 audio track of the original orchestral score by Gottfried Huppertz, performed by Berlin's Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra. Many viewers, like myself, were disappointed that Alloy Orchestra's own uniquely interpretative score was not included.  I contacted Alloy Orchestra and they said the German distributors would not allow Kino to use their score on the new edition. Thus, Alloy Orchestra is selling their score on a CD disc, albeit in lossy MP3 format with only a 192 kbps bit rate. Google \\"alloy metropolis order\\" to order it.<br /><br />The intertitles for the 2010 Kino edition, just like in the 2003 edition, are in English only. Whenever there is on-screen German text, English subtitles are provided and not removable.  If you are a stickler and prefer to see original German intertitles, just as the viewers saw it in 1927 Germany, you have to buy the British Region-B Blu-ray edition released by Eureka, titled \\"Metropolis\\", in which intertitles are in German only and supported by removable English subtitles.<br /><br />Supplements on Kino's 2010 edition do not contain any from the 2003 edition (so save that disc). Instead, we have a pretty good 50-minute documentary titled \\"Voyage to Metropolis\\", shown in HD on the Blu-ray and narrated in German with optional English subtitles, about the dramatic history of \\"Metropolis\\" up to its re-discovery in Argentina. (The same documentary is also on the Region-B disc. TCM has also broadcast another 50-min documentary on the same subject titled \\"Metropolis Refound\\", which is equally excellent but is not on home video.)<br /><br />(I mentioned the Region-B Blu-ray earlier so I might as well do a comparison with the Kino edition. The HD picture quality is virtually identical on the Kino edition and the Eureka \\"Master of Cinema\\" edition from Britain. Both have the same Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra score in lossless DTS. Both have the \\"Voyage to Metropolis\\" documentary (shown in HD on Blu-ray). The Eureka disc also contains an excellent full-length audio commentary by David Kalat and Jonathan Rosenbaum, while the Kino disc has a 9-minute interview with Paula Felix-Didier, curator of the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires. The Eureka disc also comes with a 56-page booklet of essays, interviews, and restoration notes. So in terms of supplements, the Eureka edition seems a better offer -- to those who can play Region-B discs.)
B00004R99F|5.0|My 19 year old daughter actually asked for this for Christmas and when she opened it screamed \\"best Christmas present ever!\\".  If you've ever gone on a family roadtrip, you'll relate to Goofy and his son.

B004H1V5RU|3.0|The Epic is durable, colorful, and fun for those who have patience and can stand frustration.  It is more difficult than anticipated and takes very steady hands with good eye/hand coordination.  Adults as well as older children can both enjoy this product.

B000FBFN1U|4.0|Almost as large as the first two novels combined, the third book in the Game of Thrones series ratchets up the drama, wraps up several major plot lines, and sends the series charging forward in a somewhat unexpected direction. The most epic of the first three novels, A Storm of Swords is as good as its predecessors, if not as quick a read. New POV characters are introduced, giving the world of Westeros greater depth. The black and white of morality, already muddled in the first two books, swirls increasingly into gray in Storm of Swords.
0307891372|5.0|I bought this guide a few weeks after buying the game, and I can tell you now that I wish I had it from the start. This guide has great references for when you start out, as well as good walkthroughs for quest without giving too much away. I already recommended this to 3 of my friends who play, and they all had the same opinions as I did.
1419702238|5.0|I love diary of a wimpy kid. So I couldn't wait for this to come out! So funny and hilarious! Jeff is so createtive. Overall I love the  hard back. It is a great book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this book immediately after finishing The Hunger Games. I just HAD to know what happened to the characters next and Suzanne Collins did not disappoint. The author creates such a vibrant world and characters you really feel for.
0525478817|5.0|Look, I can say no more great things that anyone else who has posted before me.  This book is beautiful and haunting.  Funny and Smart.  Real and Cliche.  And it's filled with symbolism, some of which is obvious, some of which is painfully subtle, and some of which one of the main characters will gladly point out for you.  Just read it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I \\"rented\\" this book as part of my Kindle Prime trial and could not put it down. I enjoyed it so much that I finished it the same day and immediately bought the 2nd and the 3rd books in the series. I even bought this too so I could keep the trio!
009193768X|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my daughter, who had just visited London and stopped for tea at F&M.  The gift was a great hit.  The book is really nicely done--as a tribute to tea at F&M should be.  I'm very happy to give it 5 stars and I think the bookseller also deserves 5 stars for the fine service and excellent condition of the product.
B00009RGBS|5.0|Not enough stars for this product--love it love it love it and play it over and over and sing and dance lOLOL
0385721234|1.0|I honestly was shocked when I read this book. I arrived until the end only because other people had told me it was amazing.  Mainly it is the vulgarity of it that shocked me. The story is definitely unexpected, but far-fetched in a twisted way. One thing that the author managed to do is to make an impression: the book is indelibly engraved in my mind.
0525478817|5.0|i have not taken the time to read many books in my few years, so needless to say i am vastly behind in the world of good literature. this book, is a perfect combination of comedy and tragedy, John Green has outdone himself.
0446585025|3.0|I love Ellen, really.  And this book started off strong.  But a few chapters in, I started skimming through to get to the next story.  It had a lot of filler words and phrases, and by then, I was dissapointed, and wished I didn't spend the money.  I passed along the book to a friend who is also a fan and waited for her to finish just to confirm my thoughts, and she agreed as well.  Ellen, you could have done better.

0316056863|5.0|Don't let the creepy man arm and Charlie Chaplin hat wearing picture on the front cover fool you.  Tina is bright and hilarious as ever in her book.  Gives a little snapshot each stage of her life complete with some awesome pictures along with references from 30 Rock, SNL, along with a healthy dose of self-depricating humor that can make you relate.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is great! no issues. always loads and never freezes. so far, so good!  wish more were like this one.  I really like the 'show you how to win' feature.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I bought this app because a friend of mine said it was great... I absolutely love it. You can set the sleep timer for as long as you want and the sounds are so realistic, sometimes I wake up thinking that it's actually raining outside.  I has really helped me ignore and drown out the noise from my upstairs neighbor so that I get a great night's sleep.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it is a simple clean great app. works perfectly on kindle fire. could be made better by adding option for categories
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great for when I get up in the morning and don't want to go outside to check the weather before work.  The options for hourly and daily weather forecasts are also great if planning for the weekend.  Very useful app.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The app works well and is pretty reliable, but tends to make claims it can't live up to. Such as saying that it will snow 4.132 in three days, ect

B0054JZC6E|4.0|my 2 year old loves these games ..our fav is the elevator drop and the s.usu.I stab....if there r more games added educational ones would be good
0525478817|5.0|Beautiful. That is, put very simply, what this book is. I finished it rather recently, no more than an hour again, and I still have tears in the corners of my eyes. This book touches you. It's a book that I can't really explain. I could sit here for hours and tell you that is it perfect. Amazing. Inspiring. Saddening. Hopeful. All in one. But I cannot make you understand what I mean by each of those words. This is book you have to read for yourself. It's a book that makes you cry, makes you laugh, and then cry again. It makes you want to yell and scream at the wonderful author, yet it makes you want to hug him to.   I haven't been this into a book in a long, long time.   DFTBA, my friends. Enjoy The Fault in Our Stars.

0385522401|5.0|This was my first McEwan novel and I know that I should have started elsewhere but I felt that the length of this novel justified that I squeeze it in over the Christmas break before the new year started.  Boy!  What a blow this novel packs!  I knew that McEwan was known for his dark stories as well as tragedy (I've seen Atonement) but good grief!  This novel is like someone just dropped a ton of bricks on my head.  It lingers long afterwards.  The story is simple but complex at the same time.  I won't rehash the premise but know that the story is a depressing one and I agree with one of the reviewers that it has a tone of the horrific with it.  Not that this is a frightening novel but it is horrific in what happens and just like Atonement one little moment causes a great deal of pain and resentment to destroy what could have been beautiful and happy.  This was NOT the novel to choose over Christmas but I did enjoy it and I am glad I read it.  The impact alone was worth it because it is an emotional ride for such a small book.  If bleak is what you seek then you've found it On Chesil Beach.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case meets all of my requirements. It is light weight, does a good job as a stand for viewing video, and does not get in the way when I am using the KF as a book reader. At first, I was a little disappointed when it seemed it could not be used to support the KF at an angle suitable for using the keyboard in landscape mode, but I eventually found that this could be done by folding the cover in half under the fabric that connects the cover to the plastic shell.
B005NS0VNU|1.0|Really i was happy they finally broke up!AND THIS JUST REMINDED ME WHY I NEVER REALLY LIKED THEIR CONTRIVED POST PUNK POP MUSIC IN THE FIRST PLACE!
B0068MNO4S|1.0|This film failed on every level. Not only did it NOT ignite any controversy, it received little attention from critics, most of the reviews panned it. It also failed to make much monsy. The studio knew it had turkey on it's hands and attempted to release it as an \\"art house\\" film. They could have released it as a road runner cartoon and it still would have failed. Ifans plays de Vere as wan and humourless. The endless parade of pouting , flouncing, pretty boy actors can't even save the film from it's own banality. The film ruins Elizabeth by portraying her as a mindless whore who cannot keep track of her own bastards,(don't get me started on the mother/son incest. How repugnant!)and Shakespeare is a ridiculous cypher, not even attempting to show him as a real character. The good news is that as badly received as this film was we can all breathe easy that there will be no other bizarre conspiracy films like it made again anytime soon. My guess is it won't make much of a profit on video release either. It has damaged Emmerich's reputation to the point that Sony is reportedly pulling funding and demanding rewrites on his next project. Failure is written all over it. I'd bet Emmerich wishes he had remained \\"Anonymous\\"!
B005ORVN1Y|3.0|Just played P/G on my high res 2 ch system. Yes there is more clarity but this was a poorly produced rec to begin with, as it never had dynamics and neils drums sounded distant and muffled w/o pop. The latest remaster ( not done from the orginal master tapes) sound better but no where near a audiophile level recording such as Steely Dan's AJA ( recrodred 10 yr Before P/G) which blows away any rush recording out of the water in terms of production quality by a light year.   The remaster of p/g is better yes but it still sounds compressed, processed, flat and has glare and siblence at times in geddy's high notes and Ss.  The best way to hear P/G is the 2 tracks that are on S&A live, blu-ray, which has much more dynamics and clarity, less conpression. The only  well produced rush is S&A live and PW. Im not sure why they abandomed the production methods used in 1985 PW in HYF and later records which sound thin and steril in comparison to the the rich, dynamic, lush sounding PW which needs no remastering. If u do it right the 1st time, remasters are not needed.  Aviod the new time machine dvd and get S&A live as the latter sounds much better. Time machine mix put neils drums lower in the mix, why???  he sounds flat & less dynamic than S&A.
B004TACMZ8|4.0|Works as well as any wall-scanner I've used (including Craftsman and DeWalt); which is to say that it works most of the time.  Our home is a high-rise unit with concrete pillars and dividing walls, ½ metal and ½ wood studs on interior walls, and a mix of plumbing types.  The unit does an admirable job scanning for wood studs and finding AC power on concrete walls; however, it is hit-and-miss when it comes to detecting the metal studs and just plain miss when trying to find AC power on the wood or metal-studded walls.  The display isn't as intuitive as with prior scanners I've used that just had an ascending bar graph, but it does provide additional information that I found useful once I read the manual (which I found to be thorough and helpful).  One thoughtful design feature that I appreciate is the addition of a pencil hole at the scanning area.  Overall I found the scanner to be better than tapping with a hammer and guessing, but your mileage may vary.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|though not all the games are great and the ads are irritating it's a fun app to play when you're bored or just want to waste time.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I LOVE STAR WARS THIS SERIES IS AWESOME ANYONE WHO SAYS DIFFERENT IS BLIND! \\"i think it won best movie ever made\\" -Ricky Bobby
B0062P332Y|5.0|Based on a true story, it's a really good movie.<br /><br />Trade-craft of the 80's is so interesting and I'm sorry, but there's been probably tens of thousands of people (since 2001, probably a million since 1963) murdered to look like accidents and heart-attacks. That's why the story is so awesome, the actors of course are good too. A fully-fledged good movie.<br /><br />Killer Elite reminded me of how many bad movies there have been in the last ten years, how everytime I like a new show (especially sci-fi), it gets cancelled or dumbed down. What's left is all this fodder that's a waste of time. The last movie I think I liked was Jumper.<br /><br />cheers

B006TLFIAQ|1.0|Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors but he was just phoning in his performance in this stinker of a movie.  The writing was sophomoric at best.  The plot? Well there was sort of a plot but it seemed to be more of a thin thread to link a series of action scenes.  The dialogue was one cliché after another. The director and writers might want to brush up on their skills at developing the characters and creating a story line that was clear and had a modicum of believability.   I guess DeNiro just needed the money. I am sure he was brought into this project to add more star power.  Sorry, even the $3.99 rental fee was too much for this one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Even at 15 years old I would much rather play this game than the &quot;crowd pleasing&quot; angry birds. The graphics are clear and top-notch making this the app for hours of fun!!!
1401923127|2.0|I went into this book on a recommendation. I tried to like it and kept on reading. I got a few interesting tidbits, some entertaining stories, and the sense that the author does have a long-standing sense of curiosity about cells. Nevertheless, these positives were already mixed with some (yellow- to red- flag) questionable assertions from very early on.<br /><br />Then, however, I ran into a hard stop within the first 30 pages. The author badly misstates the theory of evolution by natural selection, the central organizing theme of modern biology. The author's (fashionable but still flawed) act of placing himself above mere \\"Darwinism,\\" without actually having managed to present what it says caused me to close the book cold. Sure, very few people actually do properly understand this theory and its more recent refinements, but I can forgive them, as they are simply buying into popular misrepresentations of what it is such as those in this book. I wouldn't guess the author is consciously misrepresenting natural selection theory; rather, like the vast majority of people, he has probably just never \\"gotten it\\" to begin with, while thinking he has.<br /><br />I don't doubt that one could extract some more interesting points by reading on in this book further than I managed to. However, I would rather seek my information from more reliable sources. Here are some alternative recommendations on some of the topics covered, each of which seem to me to be on more solid footing in their respective fields: 1) To actually understand real evolutionary theory and not just try to get \\"beyond\\" it, read The Greatest Show on Earth, The Selfish Gene, and The Extended Phenotype; 2) for the power of belief to alter life patterns and trajectories, read Nathaniel Branden on self-esteem or even Covey's 7 Habits; 3) for a solidly argued alternative hypothesis about some elements of basic cell function, read Cells, Gels, and the Engines of Life; and 4) for some practical applications of evolutionary epigenetics that work to improve health, read the Primal Blueprint!hat work to improve health, read the Primal Blueprint!

B001K3ENEA|5.0|Purchased these at a local store for $45 on sale after doing some research online about headphones to use with a guitar amp for under $100 bucks. These do the trick and sound great for the price. I primarilly use these for late night guitar sessions and have only tried them out once with an MP3 player and the sound quality is good. AKG seem to make very versatile and durable headphones at a good value and I would buy another product from them in the future.  I am no audiophile but I wanted cans that would let me hear every note clearly from the guitar amp and these seem to be handling it well. For the musicians, I have a small solid state amp and a larger tube amp in which the AKG's sound exceptional. The cord is long and the frequency response is far better than the older Sony cans I used before these. These are good headphones for under $50 bucks, its n wonder this model has been sround so long.

B004HO6I2O|5.0|This is the funniest movie I have seen in a while!  My friends and I go to the movies weekly and I must say we all laughed so hard, we were literally in tears.  When I left the movie theater I knew I would purchase this video. At times I laughed so hard I could not catch my breath.  Ryan Reynolds was great, but Justin Bateman was superb.  This is not a movie for those who are uptight or overly conventional, but if you can take it for what it is...a comedy...you will not stop laughing.

B00005V9IL|5.0|With Academy Award visual effects, we plunge deep into the world of The Abyss. Tension coils around waves of suspense, and the depth of mystery carries across a brilliantly written storyline. The heart of drama flows through the talent of actors that bring to life characters both conflicted and driven, and we dive further in-between the lines of struggle and fate. And as we drift down into the end, we find ourselves lifted up by music that pulls at the fabric of our being, and inspiration lights up before us in a vision created across the silver screen.

0553381695|4.0|What can you say about this series that hasn't been said already? A Song of Ice and Fire series, of which this is the second book, is amazing! Mr. Martin has an astounding command of narrative, able to keep the story moving forward even though each chapter is seen through the first-person perspective of a different character, nearly all of whom never know what else is going on in the fictional kingdom of Westeros. And, like an accomplished juggler, Mr. Martin never drops a ball, even when he is writing about a war that includes 5(!) kings and nearly 5 different wars. Of course, this also makes it difficult to remember things as putting the book down for a day can mean that you forget key plot points from even the previous chapter. Also, the cast of characters is so huge and spread so far apart from each other that it can be hard to remember who is who and who is doing what. But, what keeps this from turning the narrative into a mess is Mr. Martin's ability to keep you on the edge of your seat, even if you've cheated and looked at the outcome of future events online (guilty). I'm putting the series aside to attack other books on my docket, but I can't wait to get back to get back to the kingdom of Westeros.
0767817478|3.0|When this movie premiered, my local town also premiered a 21 screen theater with digital Dolby stereo auditoriums that was soundproof from the screens on the next walls. That complex is still up and running, but Godzilla seemed to be a great way to break in a mammoth complex with state of the art screening. There is also an IMAX next door. So this movie holds fond memories of a giant way to begin a new era of multi screens, and those screens now boast 3D viewings for many movies. Popcorn & hot dogs never tasted so good. Edwards, Fresno, still rocks for the new century. Godzilla did me proud for the mind blowing effects, and anyone who takes the premise seriously shouldn't be living in America.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The DVD arrived promptly in very good condition.  I had no problems and the DVD was good.  I enjoyed the movie and plan to listen to the Audio version also.
B000093FLA|5.0|This movie is the best. Such a classic and great for quotes.  Beware of any man with a large number of pigs.
0307959856|2.0|To preface, I love Pride and Prejudice. I've read the book multiple times, and I will only watch the 2 disc BBC version of the movie (the new one simply wasn't thorough enough).  I read the sample for this book on my Kindle and was moderately interested after the first chapter. The writing was fairly similar to P&P, so I bought it. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. Elizabeth and Darcy's characterizations were very weak. Elizabeth is no longer the strong, independent woman of P&P but more of a simpering, scared housewife. Darcy is less of a commanding presence and doesn't seem very intelligent. The writing was poor. The style was lost in the attempt to piece together a decent murder mystery. The first couple of chapters and the last couple of chapters read as if they could be in totally different books.  The beginning is built on romantic, typical P&P elements which are totally lost and never re-captured in the attempt to tell the murder mystery portion. The mystery held no suspense. It was more like reading a court document.  I started reading a Regina Jeffers (a romance novelist) P&P mystery sequel, and it is actually better so far. This does not speak well for P.D. James...
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Nicholas Sparks has provided some amazing fiction over the last few years.  He is a talented author and I encourage you to read some of his early works; however, feel free to skip this one.  If you have read The Notebook, Dear John, and A Bend in the Road, you've already read The Best of Me.  Elements of several of his other works built the framework for this one.  There were some new ideas that could have been worked into something readable, but I got flashbacks to previous novels throughout this one.  It's predictable from the start.  Why did I read it?  Because I'm still holding out hope that the author will find his way back to his writing roots.  I suppose what is most telling to me personally is I used to go buy these books the very day they came out.  I literally was on a plane after four weeks abroad and wanted to ask the lady beside me if I could borrow her copy of a recent release I hadn't gotten yet.  This one sat for weeks before I decided to give it a shot because I was worried about being disappointed again.  I'm sorry to say that is exactly what happened.  I may start trying to catch these new releases once they hit the bargain rack...
B002UXRGLG|5.0|For anyone that has the slightest appreciation for life around us, please buy this DVD.  The filmography is done fantastically and there is no substitution for a David A. narration.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Like him or hate him, Michael Moore stuck to the facts regarding 9/11.<br /><br />This documentary truly shows our government's dark side in \\"false flag\\" operations in order to further their sinister agenda.<br /><br />This documentary is a must see because our government would like for you to believe one thing but Mr. Moore makes sure you know the truth.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have this and the Weather Channels app so between the two<br />of them I have ALL the info and more for our area, a bonus<br />that it is free and works well on the Kindle Fire!  I like<br />it a lot, its a keeper for me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|most of the mini games aren't that fun, but once you find the one game you like its all worth it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is so fun to play on the Kindle Fire...honestly you can lose<br />yourself in playing some of these game apps...for HOURS!  This is<br />fun, easy to play and free...that really is a great option!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game was first released in May of 2009 for PC. In Feb of 2010 it came out for iPhone. Over a year after it first came out, it was released on Android in May of 2010, which I quickly snatched up but was unable to play because it didn't work on the original Droid. Here it is, the middle of Jan 2012, and I still can't play this game on my brand newly released Galaxy Nexus. Almost 3 years of hearing about how great this game is, and I still can't play it.<br />The developer is terrible. Don't waste your money on them, they don't care about you.<br /><br />Should the developer ever think to bother reading comments, the game doesn't work on the Galaxy Nexus. It often will hang when loading, or in the middle of playing. I can't even get past level 1-2 because of this.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|very happy with on time delivery.  The DVD was in great shape and is still one of the best action movies every.  Thanks Amazon.
1451648537|5.0|It was an excellent, very compelling book. It details his life in great detail. After reading, I gained alot of respect for people like bill gates. It does however, almost completely ignore many things. These include iPod touch, the laptops, and other various iPods. This may be due to the how fast they published the book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i love this app. it is simply informative and accurate. very user friendly and customizable. looks great on my golauncher home screen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app.  Lots of translations.  I take my kindle with me to Church, makes it so quick and easy to search scripture.  Wouldn't be without it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this totally rocks...I loved it...level 35 first time out...lots of fun. so good. loved it. so good. that was great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|his is a lot of fun I play this game all the time it is a God time eater and all around game
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for Christmas for my son-in-law.  Over the holidays he played most of  the CD's and now I will be getting a set for myself just as soon as the budget allows.  Great  music, great selections and wonderful classy packaging.  Can't say enough good things about this collection.  Amazon got this collection to me in record time which I really appreciated.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game, especially when you are bored and have nothing to do. You may even be riding with someone on a long road trip. A very addictive game!
1607053888|3.0|This is a good collection of bag patterns, but many of the patterns are sold individually on the ithinksew website or via Etsy. If you own several ithinksew patterns, you may well be paying for the convenience of having all patterns in one place. With that being said, there are a few new patterns in the book, so the purchase price might be worthwhile. But I would have done better buying another bag pattern book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is great! Not had ANY problems with it on my kindle fire. Just wish they would get rid of the advertising.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This collection of games more than surpassed expectations! Not only extremely is it entertaining, but the variety of the games always insures one can easily find and play a game of interest at that particular moment. The only fault I can find with the game at all is that my daughter likes it so much.  . . I often have to hide my device!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|well worth .99 keeps me entertained, ran great on kindle fire, two thumbs up from me, I Got it as free app of the day, would of paid for it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is reaaally fun and great for passing time. I personally think you should try it and I promise you will love it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is the best thing i've payed for. best game on my kindle. its hours of fun, though a little boring when you finish it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The product arrived on time, and exceeded expectations.  The folding cover/stand is very easy to use, and makes viewing simple.  Highly recommended
B005N0PJJO|5.0|4.5 stars!  After the cliffhanger that was Fifty Shades of Grey I was so thankful that Darker was already published and I could go right into reading it. Anastasia has started a new career but she hasn't completely moved on. Christian still haunts her. Seeing her go through missing him is really heart breaking but I am glutton for punishment and I love angst. All Ana really wanted was for Christian to open up to her but he wasn't willing to do so. Since Fifty is in Ana's point of view it's hard to know what he's thinking. The angst lover in me wanted him to suffer, to miss her like crazy and to come crawling back, begging for forgiveness.  I also wanted Christian to see that he deserves to have someone love him and to be happy in a 'stable' relationship. I think he had a lot of fear locked inside himself -- definitely afraid that if he let Anastasia completely into his heart he would wind up hurt. Or that he would hurt her. So many times I wanted to just shove them both in a closet and lock the door until they talked it out.  There is a part of Ana that can't get over Christian's past 'relationships' too. It ate at her until she couldn't do anything but think about it anymore. She was so desperate to have every part of him that she didn't really see that he was giving what he could. I guess in a way, he was only giving what he would allow himself to give. He definitely could have been less controlling of his emotions. In the past, he'd also controlled Ana, but she's not going to allow that any more. She's going to bring him to his knees.  Not only are Christian and Ana struggling to find a common ground - between her fear of punishment and his fear of a 'vanilla' relationship - but someone from his past can't seem to let him go. Ana is faced with the ex that made Christian the man he is, as well as an ex that turned out to be a stalker. Her life is in danger and Christian does everything he can to protect her. There's also Ana's struggle with wondering if she's enough for him. If she can be what he needs in the play room - submissive enough.  The intensity and heat are still so easy to feel with these two. Even with all their struggles it's obvious their hearts are truly twisted up in love. It's up to the two of them to find a median where they can both get what they want. Love and acceptance, BDSM desires. Sigh. I wish I could just blog every single detail of this story. So many characters in this book that are easy to fall in love with. I want to read both this book and the first all over again.  As I stated in my review for Fifty Shades of Grey, this is a BDSM book. If that doesn't appeal to you, consider before reading.  [...]
B005ZUR724|5.0|The game is great. Very nicely done WoW clone. Makes you wonder why you need such powerful compluters when something like this runs on a tablet. Runs great on the Fire. Very smooth, no lag, not buggy, easy to understand, not a bad UI, pretty good player base there's always people on the first server and some have decent sized guilds from what I've seen so far. Currently has PvP areas with arenas coming soon. With 3 months free and $3 for 6 months of membership its an absolute MUST BUY for anyone who wants a mobile rpg!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app tons of fun! stayed up for hours playing it . I cant put it down. I would highly reccomend
B0034G4P80|5.0|As with all the Marvel films this one remains true to the comic and being an old Marvel fan I was not disappointed.  The special effects and acting was top notch - this film was pure entertainment for me and I hope they make more in the Thor series.  I am not a movie critic and don't pretend to be but, for those fans of Marvel - you are in for a treat!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was looking for a good book to read and asked around. What I should have told people when I was asking around,\\"I need a good book to read; I will, however, be on a plane for 7 hours and hate when people stare at me.\\" I thought this book was hysterical; literally laugh out loud. Hence the people staring at me on the plane. So, if you are looking for a good book to read, I would strongly suggest this one. It is both funny, and heartwarming. If you have tendency to laugh out loud(perhaps even snort) when you think something is funny, then I would recommend not reading it in public but in the privacy of your house.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|Not a bad movie but not in the same category as Marvel's efforts to bring their comics to the big screen.  I enjoyed the movie from an entertainment point of view but it wasn't anything special.  If a sequel is made I will watch it but I won't buy it - then again you never know - with all the Green Lantern background out of the way (which was hurried in my humble opinion) it may be better than this one.  Still worth watching if you are a comic book fan and I am sure kids will enjoy it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is great fun!! simple yet challenging! the difficulty scales nicely, and i could help but laugh at how quick i ran out of missles to spam at around level 20.. needless to say, that's when i lorst :D
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has a beautiful voice and her music is so heartfelt that I feel that her type of music is what was missing in the music industry. I look forward to Adele's next CD. Simply lovely!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Games are ok, although I only played the first dozen. The ads were too often and poorly timed to make for a fun game.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I love Tina Fey and started reading this book with pretty high expectations. While it didn't completely live up to the hype, it was certainly an entertaining read and I found myself laughing out loud many times. A great book for someone who doesn't take life too seriously!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|many games so u never really get bored of any of them and its a game in it self trying to get more tokens
0307949486|5.0|the beginning was slow but when it picked up you couldnt put it down!<br />i am sure you all saw the movie, so no need to say more!

0606089446|4.0|I couldn't find this book in hard cover anywhere so I ordered this one since I let my students read my books as well. The library binding makes the books more durable, but there is no dust jacket for them. It's that point that makes me give it 4 instead of 5 stars.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|i love this amazing movie series its packed with alot of good storytelling awesome directors and producers this movie series has everything and more its worth buying and watching!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B001EJGJ5G|3.0|I feel for young people in America who associate the mental state of our society with post-9/11 mentality. I remember the 80s growing up and how people had hope and were going places. How people aspired to something. How people were having fun. This movie showed that like most other movies of its time. But like most other movies of its time it didn't have a fully developed script or plot. I sat here wondering what the inside joke was at points during this film where characters would recite (and I use that word purposefully) a line and the camera would stop on their faces . . . like a blooper reel where they were about to burst out laughing or something. It was a little surreal. Then after the movie rolled along through all of its subplots I realized this was just poor acting and directing and script writing etc. And that \\"Im so precious I can't move my mouth but only in slow motion\\" that some of these people were doing was funny too. But again I don't think it was intentional. Regardless this movie at first seemed to be a movie about Rolling Stone magazine, not the health craze of the 80s. (I did look up some of the characters afterwards to see what they had been up to since as I didn't recognize them. I realized that this was intentional probably as that Mark guy actually founded Rolling Stone magazine. But why would he attached the rep of his mag to THIS movie? Bad move I would think--to show them unethical and sleazy.) Then it transformed into a picture about, not so much the health clubs of LA, but trashy people. Some of the stuff in here is commonly heard in movies and tv today (e.g. \\"gang bang\\", plastic surgery, etc). So I'm sure it was shocking back then. So maybe it seemed fresh back then but it was kinda stale now. Dunno. Anyway you can see a John Travolta when he was slim and good looking. You can see a Jamie Lee Curtis when she was young and fresh faced (without that crazy wirey hair she had in that Halloween movie). You can see all these young slim people all over the place back when America was genuinely like that. Anyway it was a walk down memory lane if nothing else. Besides the confusing point of the movie it had a lame premise to the love spat too.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great and addicting! great time waster! would strongly recommend to have in your apps drawer for those down moments or jusr to pass time, be carefully addicting!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great buy.  My son stated this was the best christmas gift he has ever recieved.  It was a last minute idea but got here on time for the big day.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I purchased this video for my son as a Christmas gift, as I knew he wanted it. He had seen it in the theaters when it was first released and raved about it to me. We watched it the day after Christmas and I was as impressed with the action and plot as he was. The dynamic between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson is great, and the special effects and stunts are amazing.
1594744769|4.0|The vintage photographs make this book!!! I've always been intrigued by early photos and this author creates an entire spooky story around them. A little bit time travel, a little gothic ghost story, a little circus sideshow...this book was something original and intriguing. I look forward to the next installment!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|My adult son has been asking for a copy of this movie since he was in HS. Back in 2006 one of his HS teachers compared the movie to Macbeth and he wanted to watch it, which is when he found out I had passed it on to one of my nieces for her children. He has  asked for the movie every Christmas since then and I was thrilled when Disney rereleased it this year!  It is still as wonderful as when we first watched it-a timeless story indeed.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I was extremely pleased with this seller.  I got the DVD's in plenty of time for Christmas & my grandson loved it.  thank you.
030746363X|5.0|This book is well written, very thorough, and huge close to 600 pages. The diet does work I'm an in shape person and I even noticed differences, the exercise plan is simple and well detailed and it's just an interesting read Timothy is a very normal guy that probably suffers from OCD and ADD because he is just an extremely curious guy and his main focus is doing things quicker and more efficient. Which is great for people like me and you because he's very good at researching and pulling valuable information off experts in nutrion and sports training. All in all I give this a 5 stars there are flaws but for the money it's worth it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this app is the most amazingly addicting game ive ever played its amazing!!!!!!!!((: it was worth the $ unlike many games.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great product and delivery was very fast, im very happy with everything and will recommended this product to friends and family and will be shopping with them again
B004P98QZ8|5.0|Got this as a Christmas gift, was very nice. Somehow mine was missing two pieces, but fortunately I had the same pieces from previous sets. The mechanism where the temple opens up when the dragon sword is pulled out doesn't work all that well though.
B005VOMXKA|1.0|I was given this new 2011 version as a X'mas gift. Although I was not a big fan, I did buy this CD back in the old days. After I listened to the 2011 version three times, something sounded odd -- some songs were louder than others, some songs were brighter than others. I digged out my old Cd, I realized: the 2011 version largely sounded like the old CD, only a few tracks were remastered (not necessary sounded better, were possibly remastered for some compilations.) Buy the old CD instead.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great! i dont know what all the bad reviews are about!  this game is perfect for somebody who gets bored with one game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is addictive.  Most of the games are easy, some are more challenging.  There are lots of ads, which makes it a bit annoying.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don't no had I got this 4 free I love itits chslinging and fun difrent and o wish I could play all day I love it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I was a little disappointed by the fact that one must play games to earn points which are then used to open other games in the app. That seemed to be misleading to me. But the games are not difficult &amp; points rack up quickly. So far I haven't been bored, which is what I was ultimately looking for.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are fun and addicting, a challenge to beat and you can't stop until you beat each one. the challenge in unlocking each game is just part of the fun
0374275637|5.0|Kahneman has done what so often seems impossible - written a book pertinent to everyone, supporting it with carefully screened scientific evidence, making it accessible to the non-scientific community, and making it entertaining to read. This is a very smart book, and will change the way you think - in more ways than one.
B006SV2LWA|3.0|Interesting story, but the way it was told and the way the movie is presented could<br />have been better.  Good movies keeps me awake...i fell asleep on this one. Was it<br />the music, the acting..the pace....  Ill give it another shot in the near future<br />and edit this review.
0307390349|4.0|Some of the deepest exploration of character out there today, all with a deft and delicate hand. This collection is powerful and compelling.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Reacher. Puller.  Hard to miss the connection.  I'm a big Reacher fan, but I can also say I really enjoyed this book. Not as over the top as Reacher, but in many ways, more enjoyable. The ending was a bit lacking, but overall a solid effort. Were it a Reacher tale, I'd put it in the top third.  And much better than anything Baldacci has done in years, imho. Kind of reminds me of his earlier books, which were much better, again imho.
B002GYVRRI|4.0|Fantastic product, I love all of the material on the album generally, all good progressive Rock pieces, all over great album.
B0068RHGJM|4.0|Anyone who knows me knows I am a huge Nightwish fan.  I discovered them with Oceanborn when I was in middle school, and have been obsessively buying their albums ever since.  I eagerly awaited Imaginaerum, though with a bit of trepidation -- what if I didn't like it?  I'm happy to say that this is not the case.<br /><br />Imaginaerum is a very bold, over-the-top album -- very Nightwish, pretty much.  It does have some flaws, however.  I think the best way for me to write this is to go through it song by song, though I will try to keep it as succinct as possible (I failed.  After the list I have a few general items about the album if you just want those).<br /><br />1. Taikatalvi - 3.5/5 - I'm not a huge fan of slower songs, and Nightwish's in particular tend to leave me wanting more.  I agree with another reviewer who says that this song doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album.  It reminds me of a creepy lullaby, though, which IS pretty fitting as an intro.  But it's not a song I can listen to every time it comes up in my playlist.<br /><br />2. Storytime - 4.5/5 - This song grew on me.  When I first listened to it I was a bit thrown off, but it didn't take long for me to be impressed by Annette's singing, the lyrics, and the fast-paced music.  The song is very captivating and helps to further drive the story introduced by Taikatalvi.  I only took 1/2 a star off because it DID take a few listens before it really grew on me.<br /><br />3. Ghost River - 5/5 - I don't know what it says about me that I immediately latched onto this song and listened to it constantly.  It's a relatively heavy song with vocals from both Annette and Marko, and it came out very awesome -- the child's choir adds an excellent creepy aspect to it, and the music just sounds amazing.  This, I think, is the kind of music I expect from Nightwish -- bombastic.<br /><br />4. Slow Love Slow - 4/5 - This is another song that had to grow on me, though I still can't listen to it every time it shows up.  This is a random Jazz beat, which honestly doesn't really flow well after Ghost River, and while Annette sounds fantastic in it, it is NOT what I associate with Nightwish at all.  I would have liked if they tried to turn it into a jazz metal song -- this is Nightwish, I expect them to do crazy things like that.  So overall, it is a beautiful song, but a bit too slow and unexpected, especially at first.<br /><br />5. I Want my Tears Back - 4/5 - A Nightwish folk metal song.  There are strong folk influences throughout this song and the instrumentals are fantastic, while both Annette and Marko sound great.  My main problem is with the lyrics; at first I heard them and I just couldn't associate them with Nightwish.  But it grew on me pretty fast; I can't resist folk metal of this quality.  It flows surprisingly well from \\"Slow Love Slow\\".<br /><br />6. Scaretale - 4/5 - Around this time I start to think Nightwish is on drugs.  So I think this song is supposed to be creepy and haunting, especially considering the lyrics and Annette's impressive performance (how does she sing like that?).  However... I just find it hilarious.  No offense meant to Nightwish at ALL, as the song is extremely well-done and has great atmosphere.  I just can't imagine Marko as a crazy circus dude.  This song is somewhat heavy with some great imagery, with that circus feeling being most present in this song.<br /><br />7. Arabesque - 4.5/5 - This instrumental comes rather abruptly after \\"Scaretale\\", but is very atmospheric of some Arabian desert, and sounds great.  I don't have too much to say about it since it's a bit short except that I do enjoy it, I just wish it was a bit longer and perhaps had more a Nightwish-type sound.<br /><br />8. Turn Loose the Mermaids - 3.5/5 - Another song that had to grow on me, this is a pretty ballade with some pretty fascinating lyrics (\\"I checked your teeth and warmed your toes\\"?) with I think someone said Celtic influences?  It reminds me of \\"The Islander\\" from Dark Passion Play now that I think about it.  Again, though, I'm not a huge fan of Nightwish's slower songs, and so while I do think it's nice, it's not something I can listen to all day long.<br /><br />9. Rest Calm - 4/5 - I don't even know what rating to give this song because, uh, it just seems like a NIghtwish song to me.  Nothing about it stands out too strongly, though if I recall correctly this is the song that I was not expecting to be as heavy as it is (which isn't much, granted?).  I think the ending of the song is quite lovely; I thought the repetition worked out, and I enjoy the lyrics.<br /><br />10. The Crow, The Owl, and The Dove - 4/5 - This one is slowly growing on me.  I enjoy the lyrics and the music fits them quite well, but it's another slower song, and I feel like this album has too many slow songs, especially for Nightwish.  Edit - I'm not sure why I call this a slower song?  It's more like soft rock, but certainly not like \\"Slow Love Slow\\", for instance.  Just thought I'd clarify -- there definitely drums and guitars in this song, and it's very pretty overall.<br /><br />11. Last Ride of the Day - 5/5 - Why do I love this song so much?  I don't know.  I think it's because it's very traditional Nightwish -- bombastic music, soaring lyrics, interesting lyrics, overall just awesome.  More like \\"Dark Passion Play\\" than the rest of the album, to be sure.<br /><br />12. Song of Myself - 3/5 - Okay, I'm sorry.  But this song?  The first half is awesome.  It sounds similar to the last track, being airy, soaring... And then turns into spoken poetry.  I don't mind the first minute or two of it.  But then the guy says \\"Stop saying 'I know how you feel'.  How could anyone know how another feels.\\"  I'm sorry but that sounds like it came straight out of Tumblr and from then on I found the poetry mostly boring.  Also the children in the poetry section REALLY grate on my nerves; they sound like nails on a chalkboard.  And the lyrics overall are a bit too melodramatic for my tastes, ESPECIALLY when spoken as opposed to placed with music.  I can listen to it once in a while, but I often just skip the spoken part.<br /><br />13. Imaginaerum - 4/5 - This is okay.  I like how it takes elements from the entire album and puts into one soaring conclusion.  It doesn't really catch my interest often, though, even though musically it's pretty decent.<br /><br />Now for a few things I noted as I listened to this for six hours straight (In the car, it was a long drive)<br /><br />a) I LOVE the many unique things Annette is able to do with her voice -- she sounds haunted and insane in \\"Scaretale\\", sweet if a bit melancholy in \\"Turn Loose the Mermaids\\", and powerful in \\"Last Ride of the Day\\".  Annette's singing definitely helped make the album as solid as it is.  Marko also did an excellent job -- his voice has finally grown on me, and he was great in \\"Ghost River\\" in particular.<br /><br />b) Where is the metal?  I missed the band in a lot of the songs -- \\"Slow Love Slow\\", \\"Turn Loose the Mermaids\\", \\"Imaginaerum\\"... I almost felt like this album was more \\"orchestra with a back-up metal band\\" than \\"metal band with an orchestra\\".  Songs like \\"Ghost River\\", \\"Last Ride of the Day\\", \\"Storytime\\", and \\"I Want My Tears Back\\" at least convinced me they were SOMEWHERE, but having six out of thirteen songs be ballades or \\"slow\\" really threw me off.<br /><br />So onto what you guys want to know.... Will YOU like this album?<br /><br />For Old Nightwish Lovers -- Be patient with it.  It IS different from their original stuff, but there are some worthy songs on the album.  Is it their best album?  I don't think so (I don't know what is).  Is it better than, say, Oceanborn?  Probably not (I'd rate them about even).  But I DID enjoy it, and I do think it is worth buying.<br /><br />If you like the band mostly, note what I said above: about half of the album is more orchestral than metal, in my opinion.  It's still very pretty, but asa metal addict, it threw me off.<br /><br />So overall?  I think the album came together pretty well, with some gorgeous musical genius and only one or two songs that I honestly can say I did not like that much.  I then rate this as an average Nightwish album for me, and thus I'm sure it will appear in my playlist for years to come.  If you like Nightwish's unique sound and would like to see what crazy things they've thought up next, I recommend you pick this album up.  Just be sure to give it an open mind.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review, and happy listening!<br /><br />(PS. If there are any obvious grammatical/spelling errors, please let me know!  My meds make me mix up words in rather hilarious ways, but I'd rather not confuse anyone.)e, but I often just skip the spoken part.  13. Imaginaerum - 4/5 - This is okay.

B005XQLBU4|2.0|took an hour of playing before it got challenging at all. very glitchy. not happy. I am going to delete it. I don't reccomend it.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Excellent concert.  By far, the best of the series. I didn't need to know much when I purchased this.  Clapton is always good and so are his friends on this one!
0062082353|5.0|I read a lot of ficton. But this book has captivated me. IT makes me feel like I am really there. Yesterday I was planning on reading more of the book during my lunch, so when my boos invited us out to lunch I was happy, but dissapointed at the same time. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to understand the life of a Navy Seal Sniper.

0316098329|5.0|What a mesmerizing novel!  Emma Donoghue does an outstanding job telling this story from Jack's viewpoint.  So many aspects of daily living are presented from a different perspective. A must read
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how easy it is to switch translations!! Great reading plans and makes it easy to keep my Bible with me without the weight!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good Game! Lots of fun. Best game behind Angry Bird. Can be expanded to different backgrounds and types of missiles and defenses.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great game, lots of fun.... definitely worth the money!  So much better than other missile defense game on the market.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Got this for free on Amazon. It's a great challenging game that keeps you thinking about rebuilding and upgrading to last a few more rounds. My best so far is 14...
1569242739|5.0|I have searched so long and hard for good cupcake recipes, none of them beat the ones in this book! This is a great book to have if you're trying to get creative with your baking without using any eggs :). I would highly recommend this to anyone!
B00006674X|5.0|Received in great condition. I enjoyed the movie. It was fun to watch.  The movie came from MovieMars they do a great job every time.
B006Y5C5XA|5.0|From the opening note of the pilot, this show captivated me. The music, acting, and plot are all completely fabulous. This is ten million calibers above Glee. It's good to see some real Broadway talent on the show as well. I was nervous about Kathryn McFee, but she is stunning just like the rest of the cast. I am so excited to see what the rest of the season has in store. The quality of this show is great. It's definitely a tv show worth watching.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I got this set for my husband for Christmas and he loved it.  He loved the way it is all packaged and he loved everything it comes with. You won't be dissapointed.
B001J1O83E|5.0|Much more graphic and hard-ass than the States version. It took me a while to find it after seeing it online, but well worth the hunt.
0140177396|5.0|My daughter needed this book for school and enjoyed it and re read it many times.  I took it for a trip and read it and it was a great book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|awesome game and it does get addicting however there are some games that seem impossible to finish and as other reviews say it does get kind of frustrating trying to save up enough points inorder to unlock all the different games but there is a nice variety of games and overall the directions are easy to follow
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is only my second time seeing this film after MANY years.  Stands up very well, just like Young Frankenstein does.  It has many really good laughs and it's a fine addition to any comedy collection.
0451457994|4.0|As I expected, it was a very mind-opening story. It complements very nicely with the movie by explaining all the little details and symbols from the movie. Many people do not like it for the lack of poetic dialogue/literature, so it's probably best for people like me that think very scientifically.
0545265355|5.0|Had to buy these books in the box set after already reading the first book. Great quality, covers, and stories.   Starting off with book one, I felt as though this one was the best. Original stories are usually the best for me. The story builds as you wonder what will happen with these characters. The author really paints the world clearly that when the movie trailer arrived, it was exactly what I envisioned. Its definitely an intense read.  The second book, Catching Fire, did drag on for a bit initially. It definitely built up to a great climax and set the tone for the third book. The third book was definitely a close tie for the best book of the series. I felt a very Captain America-esque storyline and I enjoyed watching the characters grow.   It is an amazing series that I still think about from time to time. A great book should leave you thinking for a while after you finish it, and these surely do.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|a facinating concept with great musical selection. a trip around the world riding american music that begs the question \\"which has greater global reach? Diplomacy or rock and roll and 501 jeans\\"

Albums in this set include \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"With The Beatles\\", \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"Beatles For Sale\\", \\"Help!\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt.

In addition to the original mono versions, both \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" also feature their original 1965 Stereo mixes, as well.

B004SIP7S0|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies  - anyone interested in arts and society should own a copy.  A work of art in its own right and a tribute to a facinating figure in the arts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is pretty fun. you don't really play a single game too much. has a fun beat stuff and unlock other stuff kind pf setup to it.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I got this from Amazon the day it came out.  So I sit down, open the package, and decide to redeem the digital copy.  It's Ultraviolet.  I don't need to get into it, look at the other reviews here.  The plan was to watch the movie on the plane on my iPad.  Warner Bros fails at that.  One star for poor execution.  Instead I got the movie from Amazon.ca.  No Ultraviolet up north yet.  Downloaded the digital copy and it worked like a charm.  Didn't get it in time for the plane ride but I DID get the iTunes digital copy.  Stay away from Ultaviolet.
0765316889|1.0|I purchased this hardcover book from this company.  It took a very long time to arrive and when it did arrive the book had no cover.  It was aggravating because I was expecting a cover.  Anyways, I have wrote the company and amazon.  So far no response from company and no refund.  :( DISAPPOINTED
B005K17RU0|5.0|Seems to work great for me. I don't mind the minimal memory it uses to keep me up to date. Nice app.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|very happy would recomend this to anyone who is a beatles fan.  Amazon shipped in just a few days even at X-mas time.  very pleased
B002ZG9968|5.0|If you love NYC and a great feel good love story, then look no further. Doesn't break world records with originality, but a really good movie to watch with the girls, or on a rainy day.
B0052U59F4|5.0|i'm sooo glad i tried a sample of this book. the story was lovely. a little hardcore but there is a story behind it. overall... wonderful, wonderful book. read the second book also and cannot wait for the last one.

I know fans of Jimmy Page who never got to see him in concert were slightly disappointed because the scenes in the movie did not show how he played the guitar all the way through. Watching to see how he plays each song. That's is exactly why The Song Remains the Same is a movie. This documentary takes you through how each musician got to where they were and how the guitar is part of their life. In detail of showing each guitarist characters. I enjoyed seeing 3 different generations show their unique style through one instrument from different cultures. I would recommend this movie to those who worship great guitar playing. Those who worship guitar gods and those who love seeing guitar gods as regular human beings.  This documentary at times made me feel like we were peeking in on famous musicians who were getting together to just talk and we were able to listen to it all. Thrilling and exciting for a fan like me!
B005N0PJJO|4.0|came by the first book by accident. loved the sequel too. a little lag on the story at the beginning, but picked up again. overall a very lovely and touching story.
0553801503|1.0|The first three books in this series really drew you into the characters.  You had your favorites and you rooted for them.  Then in the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, most of them disappear and there is no closing.  Arya's ending in this book is ridiculous.  It's like the author wanted to get rid of 80% of our favorites and bring in characters that we have no interest in and I have to admit I lost track of the outrageous plots.  It was very hard to get through this book and I truly have no desire to go on to read the 5th one.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|WOW this book is really great. I feel like I now know the real Steve Jobs, this book does not come even close to the other comics. It is super detailed and is a great read. It also was AMAZING and took me 36 hours to Read the book I promise you will not be disappointed
B0063IH60K|4.0|like it very much would recommend it to my friends very user friendly.  i like the many options that are available.
0439023513|3.0|With this series meeting its end I find myself at a bit of a crossroads. The tragedy that strikes in Mockingjay is so immense, so heartbreaking, and deep rooted that it required me to step back at moments and just breath. By no means would I expect or require a false portrayal of this story's end. I don't want to feel lied to anymore than Katniss does, but it was arguably the hardest book in the series to get through.<br /><br />The plot is thick and entrapping, not letting you go until the very end and even then, it still holds you hostage. The characters that we've grown attached to have come to suffer in some of the worst ways imaginable and for some, the fight will never be over. This story is sad yet eerily on point with what could very well be a scary reality. It isn't sugar coated or censored to save its audience heart-ship. This book is a testament to pain, suffering, and the cost of freedom.<br /><br />As far as characters go, I found it very saddening to watch Katniss lose herself and all that she loved to The Game. A game it seemed she could never fully escape. I watched helplessly as she suffered and fought against herself and others to find hope or love or anything worth holding onto. I've read in some review that she is viewed as a selfish girl without love in her heart. That she is weak or that she is cold and unlovable. I see Katniss and I can't help but disagree. Who, if put in her shoes, could ever come out as whole as she manages to? She never had the chance to figure out if her love for Gale was an evolving one. She was forced into extreme situations that made her question her love for him and then soon thereafter run into his arms for comfort.Peeta was a boy she never noticed but found could keep her alive. Did she love him? Yes, of course, in some way. But no matter how this story ended I see Katniss as a woman stripped of the ability to choose and love wholly. She must survive and that is all she knows how to do anymore.<br /><br />It's a sad story with a satisfying ending all things considered but I would argue that Katniss never made any choices in life but to stay alive. Not in anything, not even love and that in my eyes makes this series a true tragedy.<br /><br />So many people swoon over Peeta or Gale and I can see why they'd choose either but I couldn't stop myself from seeing this story through Katniss' eyes. They both played vital roles in her life but they both hurt her just the same as they kept her alive. She wasn't given the choice so as a reader I wasn't able to pick \\"a team\\" either. This story isn't about love, it's about survival. Survival of a race, a people, and a girl named Katniss Everdeen.ing all things considered but I would argue that Katniss never made any choices in life but to stay alive.

B0000062Y2|5.0|This is a masterpiece of Andre Prévin and Andrew Lloyd Webber. The movie and the original sound track are amazing! It is great... i dont have no more words to describe this. Just listen. Perfect! Single piece. Especial attention to Yvonne Elliman singing \\"I don't Know How to Love Him\\".
B001HN6918|4.0|I bought this for my little brother, but he didn't really like it too much. I also bought him Cars 2 and he really enjoyed that one, but it was actually an OK movie. So it all depends on what your child is into. I liked Kung Fu Panda 2 better than Cars 2.
B0053R3J7G|5.0|This set is perfect.  With three separate, full-size designs, it has given my daughter hours of enjoyment!  I would recommend this set to any parent of an age-appropriate child, boy or girl.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app but where I use it on the kindle fire. I wish it did not need the wireless to use it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good app.  I have several games and movies for my Kindle Fire but it seems like I alway end up playing Solitaire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome  app. I love the convenience of the full bible, with many different  versions,  at my fingertips...I'm so happy to have it!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good classic game, can play this game for hours. This is a must have! And to get it free is even better!
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|...but it helps. This isn't strictly speaking a baseball movie, since it's focused on the business side of things. But there's still a lot of baseball talk and baseball footage, so being somewhat of a fan certainly helped me appreciate this movie. The main thing however, is that I really enjoyed Brad Pitt in this in a way I haven't in along time. He was perfect for his role as Billy Beane, General Manager for the Oakland A's in 2002 who revolutionized the way players are recruited and even the way the game is played by focusing on complex player statistics, as opposed to 'soft' factors. Pitt played the right combination of cockiness and desperation, and I thought it was one of his better career performances.<br /><br />Jonah Hill was also great as the Yale educated economist/statistician he hires, and the entire supporting cast worked. It's a fascinating story. The only thing that kept it from 5-stars for me is that it did drag a bit at times. I felt it could have been shortened a little in the middle, to keep the momentum going. But other than that this is a great movie for anyone looking for a mature adult drama...and if you like baseball, all the better!
1451627289|1.0|As a life long Stephen King fan, I was pleased to get this book Christmas.  While I am a diehard kindle fan, I did enjoy getting this book as a hardcopy, something to read around the house, add some bulk to the coffee table.  I fell for the hype, for this book has been positioned as something different, unique by King standards.  This much is correct, it was different, albeit in a bad way.   The first third of the book is engaging, a new idea that sucks you in, making the implausible seeming plausible.  But then it felt as if the author had a quota on characters, pages, or some volume driven financial objective, for it just got ponderous. I found my self speed reading the last 150 pages just to get it over with.  Frankly, I don;t think I missed much by scanning the pages, looking for the punch line.  Maybe I set my expectations too high, but the vast middle of the book bogged down in predictable, repeated story lines that didn't anything to the story except bulk.  The literal rush in the story at the end of the book felt as though the writing was rushed, just to get it done.  After the \\"big event\\" I found myself hoping the alternate present had more content, storylines, twists.  But alas, the alternate present was a microcosm of the the overall book, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing - full of promise, hollow. It was this end part that truly got me to write my first review for Amazon - true King opportunity, but constrained to such a limited and hurried part of the book.  Guess deadlines were calling.  The Oswald story line, while a good hook, never had any meaningful content, other than a historical gotcha.   I struggled with the 1 star, and I may be unfairly critical of the book...especially noting my comments on the first 1/3rd of the book.  But I expected more, and was sorely disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really enjoy these games. they keep me busy and entertained for a long time. some of the games are kind of hard but so far not impossible
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app because I can play so many games in just one app! I rate it five stars
B001E45XT4|5.0|was not sure if my hubby would love it but turns out these are the BEST headphones he has ever had!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|We have had a lot of fun with this game. I downloaded it to keep the kids entertained while we are out and about and it has done just that.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|My son really liked it, thank you.  It arrived on time matter of fact is arrived ahead of time listed. Thank was GREAT  !!  Thank you again
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love to read the Bible and this is great. my only dislike is that you HAVE to have wifi but its still good
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an ok game. I would tell a friend about it. It is a good game. it is very funnn.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is totally fun!! It gives you like 8 games to start with and when ur playing the games u earn tokens! and when u pass a game u earn bonus coins!! and the locked games can be unlocked by, buying them! they cost 3,000 coins each!!
B005OCFHHK|2.0|This set is just a hodge-podge of extra discs that were laying around that didn't sell. They ARE blue ray. They are legit movies. The Order of The Phoenix disc says Disk 1 on it. The Hallows Part 1 looks like a photocopy label. There isn't a Main Menu in the first 5 disks - You have to use the remote to bring it up. Very Disappointed. It's all the movies in one box - that's all .....
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works well with my Kindle Fire where I'm at in the Portland, Oregon area. Hour by hour reports so you can preplan activities. Love the Fire also!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Danes did an outstanding job portraying Temple. The movie provides amazing insight into the Autistic brain in a way that everyone can understand.
B00009MGGI|5.0|I saw the trilogy when it first aired on PBS and loved it.  Ian Richardson was fantatic and this production is worth watching more than once.  If you like political drama this may be for you.  Keep in mind that violence  committed by the PM is extreme but that's all part of this great story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! glad I downloaded instead of hundred individual games. this nails it. it makes you want to continue playing to earn points to open other games.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|My daughter loves this neoprene case.  It helps protect her new Kindle from scratches and minor bumps.  It has decent quality zippers.  The overlay is easy to grip and helps keep the case from sliding around on slick flat surfaces.  Just realize that it's a case, not a cover.  That is, this is a storage pocket, not a book-like case or folio that allows you to read while the device is inside.  All in all, a fairly good case for the basic new Kindle.
0783230079|5.0|This was the first item i ever ordered from Amazon! I had watched the movie with a friend and just had to have it. GREAT MOVIE!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I spend hours enjoying this game!  It really challenges your mind.  Tell all my friends to play too.  They enjoy as much as I do.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is lots of fun! Everyone loves it and all the games! It has a big veriety of games my son loves to play!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is very interesting at First, but after a while it gets boring because you have to keep playing games over and over again to unlock other games
037582913X|5.0|True story - at the preschool I attended someone had ripped out the last page (a secret so good they couldn't share it? too much excitement over the build up and resolution? I guess I'll never know). So for years and years I never knew how this book ended. To tell the truth I had completely forgotten all about it until one day I was out picking up some books and I saw Grover's happy little blue face and wide eyes staring out at me from across the room where he had been wedged in among the other LGBs. Picking it up I started flipping through the pages again and finally, finally, 20 long years later, found out what surprise had been waiting for me all along.<br /><br />I'm not sure what kind of reaction I should have expected, but what I got was pure joy. Looking down at the last picture of my favorite blue monster, hearing it in my head just as he would have said it, filled me with a kind of pure, giddiness that I haven't felt in a long time. Sesame Street to me will always be the perfect place of happiness and harmony and I want to share that with my own kids. I just made sure to buy multiple copies this time lest something unspeakable befall the last page again.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Brings back memories of the old arcade game, &quot;Missile Command&quot;.  Great adaptation. The touch interface makes this a joy to play and the ability to upgrade defenses and repair damaged buildings is a cool feature.  Well done!
B005T87QCI|1.0|Don't know how good this game is. It doesn't even load after choosing the arena. I would like a refund!
B000H2MTUA|5.0|I recently bought this book for my father because I read it and fell in love with it when it first came out in 1996.  It is one of my favorite books in the world and the one that really touched my soul.  For the ones that missed it, now it's your chance to see the greatness of Frank McCourt up close and personal.  His prose is elegant and beautiful but that's not what you will remember about this book, it's his courage and grace in confronting a painful, devastating childhood that nonetheless went on to shape a great writer.  Frank McCourt didn't write this book till he was in his sixtees, the right time in my opinion because his talent and genious only matured through the years making all the more exquisite.  The legacy of this magnificent writer was well established when he died but generations after generations wil go on discovering him long after we're gone because with \\"Angela's Ashes\\" he entered the realm of immortality.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love that the weather is right at my fingertips anytime and its very detailed. You could also see what the weather is in other States/locations.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This gameis a lot of fun. You can lose time in a hurry with it. Like missle comand meets tower defense.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I loved the look of this case!  It's a nicely made cover, doesn't feel flimsy at all!  It was a little mit of a fight to get the elastic straps to stretch securely over the corners of my Kindle Fire but once I got them all into place it wouldn't budge.  The cover doesn't quite lay all the way flat but I'm going to leave it upside down and see if I can't let it mold into the correct position after time.  Overall a good buy and I would definitely recommend if you're looking for an attractive cover for your kindle.  UPDATE: Leaving it upside down overnight fixed the cover issue perfectly!
B000I0QL82|5.0|I love the classics and this is a classic, the singing and the dancing, and the acting is great, love this movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love love love this game!!!!! some challenging games that are fun. worst part is no directions to the games. but at least they are fairly simple
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am late to playing angry birds anything, but I love love LOVE it lol, great game, this version is my fav :)
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is the same as on my desktop....my only complaint is that the cards are smaller so its harder to focus....but the app is fast and fun, with no glitches
B004XWLN20|5.0|Love, love, love this collection! Can't get enough of it! I would recommend this to any Superman or Smallville fan! Even our kids are enjoying it!
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|Really should not waste your time with this game. Atari was awesome in the day but this game is lame.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app allows me to create notes as well as tasks and journal entries. love it, I use it every day!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This cover works like a charm. Snapped right in the device. I got a white one, so it got dirt on it pretty fast, and the corner started to peeling off too. I advise getting the black one. *Note that the cover is not a magnet, it would stick to your screen like smart cover for Ipad.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I don do not know what to say but can say iit was good price and on time at  my door.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is SO much fun and my favorite game in the whole app market. I have it on my kindle fire and it is just amazing!!
B000MXPE7Y|2.0|The two stars is for crackling and stoppages, too bad to continue. I never saw the movie. NOTE: The price paid was $3.99?
B005I64U34|5.0|Yes well all I have to say is I had my doubts about buying used but I was not disappointed , I saved over half price and the blu ray was in its original case with all the materials.  Even the digital copy was unused and I took advantage of that.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I think this app is very good, it is easy to use, and very usefull. BUY IT! Great for pranks and tricks too! People will think its magic! The computer is opening things by itself!
B000063COX|5.0|As a fan of hard rock, it's my opinion that this album is one of the best records.  It's not as good as the first 4 Black Sabbath albums (not much is)...but this is certainly as good as some other records that get a lot more attention (.e.g Metallica's Kill 'Em All).  Love this album.  Personally, I like Paul DiAnno's voice better than Bruce Dickinson's.  DiAnno sounds more like a full-on rock singer.  Dickinson is much more refined and artsy...not my favorite.
B005HSL626|2.0|Everytime I went on it it would just go back to my main screen. Mabey if they fixed this problem the game would not be a waste of time.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Solid weather app everything you need is easy to acess. Good intuitive interface.  Background mode on the Fire gives you weather alerts and quick access.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been looking for programs like this for awhile and this is as good as it gets. Simple to install and use. It's like you're at home in front of your desktop. Some of the finger commands aren't the most responsive especially the page scroll function, but that's a minor complaint for this amazing app!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I've watched almost all of these episodes on TV.  I bought the DVDs for my nephews who LOVE animals.  They enjoy it very much, their only \\"complaint\\" is the lenghth of the epsides...but I suppose at 7, it's hard to sit still for an hour.  :-)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games need to be a bit easier but other than that this games is good I recommend it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you read the Bible this is the app to have.  the reading plans are great. version selection is great too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|the game functions perfectly,no problems at all... and it brings back memories of playing this back on my really old win 98
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Once again, Michael Moore commentates on a serious crisis happening to ordinary American citizens. My daughters & I were devestated watching this documentary that hits so close to our own situation with foreclosure and greed. We rented this from our public library, but we would love to buy it to show support towards Michael Moore.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|this is going to sound off topic at first, but please bear with me.  usually in scifi/magical fantasy there is a caster class character with unlimited powers of a god and no weaknesses and yet we are supposed to believe they can't do something.  This is going to feel sacrilegious, but here I go, even though Tolkien gets an exemption due to being an early adopter, how many times have you seen an all powerful wizard capable of defeating the immortal demons of ages gone by, recruit a merry band of nobodies to defeat a monster which compared to the demons of days gone by, is barely a mosquito?  Really why wouldn't Gandolf(Don't hate me I love Tolkien and re-read the series about once a year) just cast Smaug into the fiery belly of the earth?  With Mistborn you get a far more pragmatic system where the wielders of power suffer from many shortcomings and the use of magic can be as detrimental as any other facet of life.  The characters have individual flaws and their world has global problems which get address very well in later books.  Rather than super wizards you have a bunch of people who can use magic to some degree with huge limitations, and rather than good and evil, the series pushes a varying shades of gray theme.  the give and take of the whole series and the tie in of seemingly mundane details through the complex magic systems makes the series very rewarding to read.  I'm not bashing the same old thing, there is a reason why the conventional plot has lasted for about 5 thousand years, but if you'd like to see the story go wrong, and the plot get caught in the realities of the world, this is a great read.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|My daughters and I found this documentary heartbreaking, informative and Michel-Moore-entertaining. Entertaining for such a serious crisis in our country. Every once in awhile, we put this DVD on to remind of the plight our ordinary citizen go through to get healthcare in America.
1423136802|4.0|This book series is great! I bought it for my son, but I've read it as well. The price was really good as well - I looked all over for the set and found the best price on Amazon.
B005FITIIC|2.0|2.2 stars<br /><br />I was in this den of thieves for a while and Margin Call doesn't even come close to telling the truth. Tuld is clearly a play on Lehmann's Dick Fuld, and he takes a few light knocks, but writer/director Chandor lets the whole bunch off way too easy. Goldman was the worst but all the WS slimers knew exactly how crooked those mortgage tranches were, and that it would all collapse sooner or later. They also knew they'd get bailed out for being \\"too big to fail\\"...after they let Lehmann go down in flames first. Oh, and they shorted their own damned and doomed-to-fail recommendations.<br /><br />Nothing too criminal there. Just the moneylenders back in the temple...<br /><br />This movie conveniently sidesteps all of that with vague references to \\"warnings a year ago\\", and in the end nobody really plays the villain, when almost all of them were. Add the soft-pedaling of the enormity of these crimes to the often glacially slow pace of this flick and you've got a pretty bad trade.<br /><br />Plus there are soooo many looooong scenes of guys gazing out the window meaningfully as the foreboding music heralds the looming disaster; that's grade-school tension-building and it just makes this film harder to sit through as it goes.<br /><br />Denby calling this the best Wall Street movie ever made is a joke and a half; the first Wall Street blows it out of the water in every single way. There are some decent performances here, especially Quinto, Baker, Spacey and Irons, but Stone grasped the Street's inherent criminality in way that Chandor refuses to. Predictably: his father was a trader at Merrill for four decades. Thus we get the \\"blameless\\" traders here, just following orders.<br /><br />But there was no Nuremburg for WS in 2008, was there? Hell, even the king scumbag whore Lloyd Blankfein sneered and laughed at the feds and was allowed to walk scot-free, and he was the worst criminal of them all, no mean feat. Still is. But Bush and Obama are bought and paid for by these crooks, and we all just laugh and say, \\"Oh well, what can you do?\\"<br /><br />Well, you can throw the lot of them in jail, for starters. And you can make art that really shows what's going on. Instead, we get this weak pablum that people call \\"hard-hitting\\". Uh huh. Hard hitting is exploring how many millions of families these filthy thieves bankrupted, not making us feel sorry about their \\"tough decisions\\". Hard hitting would also be taking a closer look at how viciously bloated the derivatives market still is, as we approach the next, much much worse crash. Hohoho, like that's going to happen. Hold on tight...<br /><br />The only really good films about the Mortgage Tranche Scam so far are documentaries; let's hope someone makes a semi-fictional version a heck of a lot tighter and more honest than this insipid WS-approved commercial for sharing blame, blame that can be laid very accurately at a few feet.paid for by these crooks, and we all just laugh and say, \\"Oh well, what can you do?\\"<br /><br />Well, you can throw the lot of them in jail, for starters.

0525478817|5.0|This book is fantastic! One of the best books I've ever read. I love all of John's books, but this one has a level of emotion and depth that really surprised me when I first started reading it. Whether you're a fan of John's, or have never even heard of him before, I suggest that you buy this book. And then buy it again for your sister, or your dad, or your niece or nephew. The Fault in our Stars is for everyone. DFTBA :)
1439102732|4.0|From the very first moment I picked up a Jodi Picoult book, I have been one of those fans who wait with abated breath for the next book to be advertised so I can pre-order.  Jodi Picoult has not disappointed, while I do have favorites books of hers, I must say I enjoyed this book.  Jodi Picoult has this way of writing that makes you question the fundamental of your beliefs. Does religion triumph happiness?  Are gays born that way or is it life that changes them?  Does God want us to be happy and gay or miserable and married to the opposite sex?  Her books are not only controversial, but touches on the everyday questions that surrounds and even touches us. We either know someone, is related to someone, read or watch this story about someone experiencing this life.   This book touches on politics and law and religion and the emotions of a divorced couple. More importantly what should happen to the frozen embryos of Wade and Zoe.  Straight from the headlines. And like her other books, you always even though you may not want to, feel yourself irresistibly drawn to empathize with people who are the enigma of everything you despise.  Yes, Jodi Picoult is that good, she gets you every time.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very happy with this product. It is well made and good value for the money in my opinion.
1400069181|5.0|Companies that care about environment or people as much as lining their pockets are companies I like to support and frequent. I suppose that's one of the reasons I like to buy organic and local.<br /><br />Start Something That Matters intrigued me because I think Tom's fits that category. I actually don't own Tom's shoes but have supported their effort and watched them explode. So when I saw a review copy of the founder's, Blake Mycoskie, book available I jumped on it. My 20-something daughter grabbed it and read it then passed it along to her friend to read before I got my hands on it. The pages came back to me dog-earred and underlined and I understand why.<br /><br />Not only does the reader find out about Tom's modus operandi, we are introduced to other companies and individuals who have embraced a different business model of thinking.<br /><br />This book gave me a sense of hope and a renewed trust in corporate America. There is a new mindset on the fringes of our materialistic world and I'm so glad for it.<br /><br />This is a quick and short read. But I think anyone seeking to dive into something bigger than themselves, something that could maybe provide an income and be a positive benefit to others should consider putting this on their must read list. Start Something That Matters might be a little simple or a little too creative for black and white business text book readers. But those who are chafing against the standard business model might welcome the refreshing splash of color Blake offers. Overall I recommend this as a thought provoking, uplifting and entertaining read.
B004XW6AGO|2.0|I stopped being interested halfway through. That's too bad, because I liked the story, but it got repetitive, not moving  fast enough. I skipped to the end, but by that time, I did not care aymore.
193413712X|5.0|Anyone who thinks that he or she has tapped into the realm of great literature needs a Paul Harding Reality Check. \\"Tinkers\\" is the little mighty novel of the century, teaching all involved in any kind of literary quest to take a deep breath and plunge with nude courage into the metaphysics of the English language ... to open their eyes and finally betake the true depth of the world around them and inside them. Paul Harding's metaphysics take the reader deep into the inner life of a relationship between a father and son with a tour de force multiple narrative that ignites the memories of two generations, two old men's rich lives ... one a tinker by trade, both tinkers of memory. This is a beautiful story about not just a father and son but the haunting fragility of the simplest things that we often overlook. As the reader turns the pages, tears of joy and sometimes wistful sadness make Harding's novel truly unforgettable. His  flawless, perfect ending speaks to the inner and the outer connection between the two men, both old, both young. Wow.
141694737X|5.0|My 22 month old son loves this book, he is really into books with flaps that he can interact with and this works for him just perfectly! Flaps and pages are very sturdy and well constructed to handle the rigors of a small child. I definitely recommend this book.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This movie is a great relaunch of the Batman movies . Christian Bale is a great Batman and all the idiosyncracies of the various characters make for an intriguing viewing. Heath Ledger is absolutely stunning as the Joker in what would turn out to be the last performance of a brilliant but troubled actor.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|We don't own any of the Harry Potter movies so we purchased this set. The price was well worth it, and the marathon Potter sessions are fun for the whole family. Thank you!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I used to feed lots of quarters into Missile Command but the trackball often got the best of me. the touchscreen is a much more natural interface.
B0063IH60K|5.0|really enjoyable and the hint button only  adds to the fun and cuts down on the frustration.  highly recommended... have fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is an excellent deal and a lot of fun to play.  Would recommend to anyone looking for short games to play when you have minimum time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's really addicted and challenging. I like this a lot because I can switch to a different game when I get bored.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|This is one of those rare Hollywood remakes of a good Euro film - in this case the Swedish \\"Let the Right One In\\" - that is actually better than the original.  While I liked the original 2008 film, I thought it left too many questions unanswered which drew away attention from the main story.  This includes the controversial vampire he-or-she question.  More on that later.  This film which was brilliantly directed and written by \\"Cloverfield's\\" Matt Reeves, smartly avoids the question for the most part.<br /><br />The best thing about this sweet, tender, violent, bloody movie is the 2 young leads.  Both should go far and I expect Chloe Moretz will break a few hearts along the way.  The film does closely follow the predecessor and even repeats some dialog word for word.  Transplanted to remote Los Alamos, New Mexico, the film works on every level.  At times you forget you are watching a \\"vampire movie\\", but instead watching a budding young love relationship.  Don't get too comfortable however, there's enough blood to go around.<br /><br />Finally, this question from the original movie of whether Abby (this movie) ne Eli (Swedish) is a boy or girl.  This film wisely removes the question.  The original leaves it open for discussion.  My research comes up with numerous theories, none of which made much sense to me.  Since this is an adaptation from a book, I checked it out.  In the book, the author says Eli is an androgynous boy from centuries ago castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman.  Yeah, that won't work for us Americanos.<br /><br />This Blu ray transfer is flawless with beautiful dark night scenes and clear view of blood splatterings.  The Dolby True HD 5.1 surround is perfect.
0800141660|5.0|I like this version! I was tickled to see the awards ceremony speech Emma Thompson gave included in bonus features. Enjoyed the costumes and locations. Brilliant work!
B003UESJIS|3.0|I was certainly looking forward to seeing this acclaimed Mike Leigh film.  We are introduced to a middle aged London couple enjoying each other and their lives.  Tom (Jim Broadbent) is an engineering geologist and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) a psychologist/counselor in a medical center.  They have a 30 year old son, Joe (Oliver Maltman) who is an attorney.  The couple spends all of their non-work hours talking, reading and working in their city garden.  All is well, so where's the movie?<br /><br />Tom and Gerri (yes they get it too) each have their drunken friends who border on being sociopaths.  Mary (an excellent Lesley Manville) is a co-worker/secretary whose life is in shambles due to her husband recently deserting her.  She is probably in her late 40's to early 50's and is having a hard time coming to grips with the fact that she may not be marrying material again.  So much so that she flirts and hopes that something romantic will occur between her and the much younger son of her friend.  When that doesn't work she even comes on to Tom's older brother fresh off the funeral of his wife.  Mary is a mess and a burgeoning alcoholic.  But kind Tom and Gerri put up with her.  But Mary won't put up with Tom's best friend Ken (Peter Wight) who is a card carrying alcoholic, heavy smoker and non-stop eater.  He has his baggage as well.  Gerri and Tom put up with him as also.  That's about it.<br /><br />Leigh (who also wrote the screenplay) moves around the interaction between the characters, mostly in the kitchen of Tom and Gerri's home.  I doubt most of us would have the patience to handle these social misfits, but I guess that is Leigh's point.  At 2 hours and 10 minutes I certainly had enough. As you would expect, the Blu ray disc looks great.  While there are a few exterior shots, most of the film is shot inside on sound stages.  The DTS-HD surround is fine with the dialog clear.  Nearly all the action is in the front speakers.
B002APU580|5.0|I am a big fan of this version. I especially adore the music. Some soundtracks just make a show valuable! This is one and The American President is another.
0525478817|5.0|Yeah, its that good.  The characters are amazingly real and you REALLY feel for them.  I cried at about the 2/3 mark and I'm thankful for it.  Just buy the damn book already, you won't be sorry.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Poohey to those who can not enjoy this show simply because it is not just like the book. Maybe the title could have been different to reflect that it is inspired by and not adapted from the book. But I for one turned out to like it very much! And purchased it for myself after watching on a streaming service. Give a chance!
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Hugh Grant certainly does make this an appealing version of the traditional Bourgeois commitment to the ideal of FAMILY AND CHILDREN as the only basis upon which a happy life can be achieved. Amusingly, 98% of the film is devoted to depicting all the reasons why that rationale is rotten to the core. Never Mind. Most of the film is very easy to take....on the screen. If one was not in the land of enchantment the production creates, it would be nightmarish. Credit an ably written script and production and, particularly, the role created for Grant, which he plays to the hilt. All-in-all, the average viewer is likely to be captured by Grant and his young friend, the 12 year old boy who adopts him, and, thereby, enjoy the film, and leave it feeling good.
030726999X|5.0|This is a wonderful story, but you really need to read the two books that come before it.  It is exciting and full of suspense.  I heartily recommend this series.  Carolyn Simpson
B003L77GG0|5.0|this product came to us in great condition and the price was great. we love smallville we enjoy watching an episode a night before bed. also another good Christmas gift thank you
B0045I3EJC|5.0|Awesome movie.  Too bad it was not released in the US. Loved the idea that life is nothing but a choice--so true. Loved it. Jared Leto's best....
B006GG1KOC|3.0|It is an okay game and runs well, but some of the &quot;lists&quot;are very obscure and even I as an adult couldn't figure out what was similar except by trying every option as the one that was different.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This is by far their best album.  I have all and this is the one I listen to the most.  Every song is so full of emotion.  Gets you going that's for sure.  Love it, Love it Loveit.  listening to it right now.  Echelon.....
B0049P1VHS|5.0|If you love zombies, you will love this! Story is great and the makeup makes them look so real! -Kristen
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very good way to keep occupied. Perfect for when your on a long car ride or just bored at home. Whenever I have time, I like to play this game. Challenging, but addictive.
B005KELS6Q|3.0|We have several Kindles in our house, both Keyboard and Touch, and one thing we insist on is that they be kept in some form of protective covering.  I was a bit skeptical while waiting for this one to arrive - how could a good, protective case truly fit both a Kindle and a Kindle Touch? But, when I opened the package and tried both Kindles in the case, I discovered both were a good fit. The Kindle is a tight fit, but not one that is difficult to manage (my eight-year-old was able to easily manage getting the Kindle in and out of the pouch). The Touch slips in much easier, but still is held in place well and does not have much room to slide around once it is inside the case.  My sole complaint about this product is the lack of protectiveness. Although the case itself does feel very durable, I am not convinced that it will do much more than protect the screen from being scratched. Even just a layer of cardboard inserted between the layers would have given a slightly greater level of protection for the Kindle. There are other Kindle covers and cases for similar or lower prices that offer slightly more protection for the Kindle, and I would be inclined to purchase those instead of this one. But, it is protective enough that, since we have this one (and the daughter using it loves pink!), I'm not going to discard this one in favor of purchasing another one.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this app is the bomb. really great grafics. the little bug thing is so cute. this game is worth it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is really fun. it has really fun games. I tried doing the free points thing but it didn't work so that made me mad and it has just TO MANY ADDS
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game reminds me a lot of the arcade version,  only I live longer playing this one. I downloaded it on free app day; but it would be well worth the .99! It works really well on the kindle fire.
B0002Y69NQ|2.0|There was no photo of this item on the Amazon page where i purchased it.  Had there been i would have kept looking for the collection in a box.  Seriously.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This a collection of fairly fun games. Some of them can be a little frustrating at times, but you can build up points for new games each time. Definitely worth it for a free game.
1419701533|5.0|My nine year old granddaughter loved these books and read them all the first week.  I hope more In the series will be forthcoming soon.  Amazon makes it easy to buy and ship....even to our military overseas.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of challenges. My teenage children and husband both enjoy playing. I would recommend downloading. There is multiple levels of challenges.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far I like the game, but the ads are annoying they pop up too frequently.  The games are fun and short.
1451648537|5.0|Well written, informative book.  I gave this book to a son and my brother-in-law.  My son is a teacher, and one of his students was reading it too,  and said 'I can't put it down'.  Good praise, indeed.
1592332803|5.0|This book is so perfect for any baking kitchen, vegan or not.  I've made many of the recipes and they are simple and easy to follow, as well as yummy and vegan.  I appreciate the index in the back.  Whenever I have extra fruits, I check the index for all the ways to use them.  But this book isn't simply recipes.  Its the ideal resource for vegan baking.  I've cross-referenced it with other standard recipe books to create vegan recipes.  But wait, there's more!  My meat-eating boyfriend sat down to find a cookie recipe out of here and spent the next hour or more reading the introduction!  Now he's bought the 30 Day Vegan Challenge and is researching veganism and animal activism.  This is the first product I've bought from Colleen and it won't be the last.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion provides extremely convenient reading plans for daily devotional times.  We are blessed to have this opportunity to read God's Word.
B005I6EU48|4.0|I really like this cover. It looks like a leather bound book. It's durable and protects my kindle. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a holder for my digital pen. it has a pocket inside to put my screen cleaner cloth which is very handy.  no complaints...
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Been waiting for this to be released forEVER! Ordered at a great price from Amazon (iTunes had NO CHANCE at this price) and now I have it and am enjoying the series as this is written. Purrrrfect!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|while you can gain tons of points for adding and using some sites and apps I am leery. so it takes awhile to clear games and gain points.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|What an incredible set. I was very happy to see this product when it arrived. It arrived in excellent shape because amazon took great care in packaging it so it would not get damaged in transit. The product itself was to say the least more than expected.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This Game Is Fun,  But Hard, Has Diffrent Games (; Its Just Fun To Play When Your Bored.  It May Slow Down Your Kindle Fire And Sometimes Cause It To Freeze.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)was a great buy. Not only did the price beat anything in the retail stores, but to get it in amazing condition was a Plus.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its an okay game. Definantly not one I play everyday. But it is one to play and keep your mind goin every once in a while.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|I got this toy for my son when he was just 2 months old.  At that time he would accidentally bump it and stare at it when it lit up.  This toy helped a lot when he was doing tummy time as it helped him have something to look at and he loved seeing the little face light up.  Also, the music is not annoying, which is a major plus in my book.<br /><br />My son is now 7.5 months old and STILL loves this toy.  He often knocks it over and then tries to scoot across the floor to get to it.  I think he will continue to love it and play with it daily as time goes by.  Even to this day if he is surrounded by toys, this is his favorite by far!  I can't recommend this toy enough!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Simply a great game. Responds well, works great on the kindle fire. I recommend to all who are looking for relaxing, challenging game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is challenging and fun! I love that the game can use 1 to 4 decks at a time so you can vary the level of complexity.
B003R50FRI|5.0|This book has you hooked from start to finish even if it is a bit unbelievable!!! It just goes to show some people make it in the end.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a lot of fun. I have it on my Kindle Fire and my son loaded it to his ipod after he saw the game. I'm not sure if it is a kindle issue or game issue, but sometimes when playing it seems slow to respond to the plays I'm trying to make.
B00466HN86|5.0|my dad and I watched this movie. I never saw my father cry till he saw this movie. I will support this church so they can continue making movies. God bless
B000QCS8TW|5.0|lst of all, let's make it clear, I think the HBO series, Game of Thrones is the best show ever, period. Also, Sean Bean was one of the best reasons to watch it, but thanks to a great cast and story, I am still looking forward to Season 2 tho my heart is still broken for Ned.  Ok, the lst book, this one, was the best so far and I am about to start #5. Books 2-4 I found to have a lot more characters, but I got bored reading about most of them as I didn't know where they fit in the big picture and I was more interested in what the Imp, Arya, the Kingslayer, Jon, and Bran were up to, and there was not a whole lot about them in those books, but still I enjoyed reading those. However, Book One definitely gets you hooked onto and into Westeros and the Wall and a whole lot of interesting individuals. Worth the read, for sure.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little thing is a wonder, I use it to sharpen up all of my blades, it's not AMAZING as a sharpener but it puts a quick clean edge to any blade in a hurry. The two sharpeners are great, the carbide takes the blade down to a good edge and the ceramic make its pretty fine. I suggest this to anyone who goes on long hikes and/or camping trips and needs a quick reliable way to sharpen a blade. It works well on straight blades mainly but can optionally sharpen gut/seatbelt hooks, and some types of serrations.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great for those times when I'm bored. I love having the option of autofinish when I win a game!
B005I6EU48|4.0|I like this cover but the only thing I wish it had was a clasp to keep it closed. If it had a clasp, my Kindle Fire would have better protection if I have it in my purse or carry-on while traveling.
B00003CXDD|5.0|i could not wait to get this movie in the mail.  it was just like when i was a child...i even laughed more as an adult because i understood some of the adult jokes.  it was so much fun, and im so excited to own it on dvd
0553801473|3.0|i have now read all the books in this set and i am a huge fan but... as the books went on i found mr martin lost his way a bit. I often lost interest in new caracters who seamed to come out of nowhere and was always looking for my favs eg jhon,sam sansa ect. Dont get me wrong i did enjoy these books but the first two were considrubly set at a faster pace and i just wish the others were like this. There was just too much history,sigils and turnclocks for me to keep up with and often found myself wondering why was i slugging through some of the chapters. On a good note Mr martin is one of the best story tellers of all time and iwould read the next instalment (whenever that is relised?) but i would like all the cliffhangers finished off and at least someone to have a happy ending please.
B000001FV1|5.0|I was in the tenth grade when I bought this LP at FW Woolworths for 4 bucks. It was unusual for a young boy in 1973 to be a Traffic fan, but they were my favorite band and this album changed my musical tastes forever. At first its kind of hard to get whats going on here, but the music is just addicting. I couldn't wait to get home from school so I could listen to it again. It's just a unique sound to this band and they perfected it on this collection. The bass of David Hood and the Drums of Roger Hawkins really add depth to the sound from the Low Spark album.   The title track is a rock and roll classic and the one most played off this LP. I think its the worst song on here and its a good song. \\"Roll Right Stones\\" is Traffic at their best with good horn work from Chris Wood and excellent playing from the rest of the band. Steve's vocals are top notch and to me this song isn't too long at all. It's hard to believe it is a 14 minute number. I never get tired of hearing it. \\"Everybody is going insane, the only thing that will sustain are the roll right stones.\\" The keyboard and drum work at the end of this is a treat.   \\"Evening Blue\\" is my second favorite Traffic song and proves that Steve can sing the blues better than most white men. It sticks in my head for days after I hear it. \\"If I had a lover whose heart was true, I wouldn't be alone in this evening blue.\\" Chris's sax brings tears to your eyes, this is a beautiful song. \\"Tragic Magic\\" is a Chris Wood jazz number, less melodic than \\"Glad\\" but more polished and an excellent try at classic jazz. Nice percussion work by Rebop and Roger.   \\"Sometimes I Feel So Uninspired\\" is my favorite Traffic song and though I prefer the version on the live \\"On The Road\\" album, this one is excellent too. This remaster is excellent and really brings out the sound of this wonderful album. I wish all remasters sounded this good and it really adds to the enjoyment of this classic song.   This is a 5 star CD all day long and at these prices a steal. I got mine 3 weeks ago and I'm sure glad I did. For less than 5 bucks with S$H and that's one dollar more than I paid for the original 4o years ago. It  made that 16 year old boy happy and it still makes this 55 year old one happy. If you like Winwood or Traffic and haven't heard this one in a while, BUY IT.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love playing the games had some good times figuring all the new things to do its a nice break from standard games would recommend its fun to play against your kids
B00007J5VN|4.0|This is a movie about a dance hall girl simply wanting to find love and to improve her standard of life. It is probably the original Pretty Woman and I enjoyed its humour, music and simplicity. Great for a rainy afternoon with catchy songs. Shirley MacLaine is loveable and easy to listen to and her work associates are quite endearing showing a softer side. I enjoyed the choreography and unlike your average love story the ending is not what you expect.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Cover is beautiful, and well made. I didn't notice until after I purchased it that the actual product itself does not say its made for the \\"Kindle Fire\\" however, amazons product description says it is. However, it fits (snug) but seems secure. I have the same concerns as the other member about the elastic strapes. If one of those were to break the whole thing would be shot. But for now, it's beautiful, durable, and does the job! I also looked in stores and other shops online and nothing came close to this one. Well done. I love my Kindle Fire!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Its the best DVD eveeer!!!!  I really enjoyed it!! it has also a CD. Adele is a great singer and I do not regret having bought... :)
1419702238|5.0|As always, Amazon delivers without a hitch.  The book is a gift for a godson and I have been looking for it in bookstores everywhere.  Amazon had it and had it at a reduced price. Perfect.  The Whimpy Kid series is a good collection for early readers.  This book has been requested by nephews and godsons alike.
0879309210|5.0|This book is a great place to start for anyone attempting DIY guitar repair / maintenance.  Even if you never need the repairs covered it's still a great read and makes you appreciate all the hard / skilled work luithers do. Both electrics and acoustics are covered in this book.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I thought this was a great series, cool perspective. I really enjoyed these books from the 1st to the 3rd. :)
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss (with a double s), did it again. In \\"4 Hour work week\\" he hacked businesses to liberate time for leisure. This time, in \\"4 Hour body\\" Mr Ferriss shows the 80/20 principle with a vengeance; pragmatic, practical, achievable, these are the adjectives that best describe his recommendations on changing your physique.<br /><br />You don't fall off the wagon with his guidelines, it would be very hard to miss how his collection of tips and tricks is very easy to implement. This is the real value of the book, in my opinion. Fans of Getting Things Done will love this book.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Another book, my daughter asked me to read of her's. I \\"really\\" enjoyed it. How blessed we are to have the freedom's we do!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Its ok but would be more fun if you could do more with upgrades. Its pretty straightforward and not one that you want to play much more than a couple times.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game its the best game ever made. my big brother played it and loved it he got almost all blades he needs three more my friend loves it too her mom loves the game. me my brother my friend and her mom loves this game. don't listen to the people who rate it one star its the best game ever made.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the first book of the trilogy! It was exciting and frightening and I'm waiting anxiously for the movie. I've seen the trailer and it's going to be edge of the seat, just like the book. Kudos to the author.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game..a great time filler!! I play as much as my 6 year old does. controls and instructions are easy to understand. We recommend it. 4 Stars!

0393338398|5.0|This isn't some inspirational story of rags to riches. It's a book for people that want to understand the details of how baseball teams scout players and can become successful even without a salary cap in place. David vs. Goliath, if you will. I listened to the audiobook version and found it quite interesting and entertaining the whole way through. I can't wait to check out the movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great source with several translations. one of the best app of android. it is very easy to follow. one of its kind
B001KTRFRG|5.0|The item arrived as described and as promised.  The price was great and I was very happy.  Thank you very much.
0439023491|4.0|I read the first book in the series (Hunger Games) back when it first came out - absolutely loved the first 90% of it, then felt so irritated by the last chapter that I ended up letting this second book in the series sit on my shelf for a year before reading it. When I did pick it up, though, I ended up going back to th first one and then blazing through all three books in a day and a night - the series as a whole, and especially this second book, were just that compelling for me.<br /><br />That said, I also felt even more irritated and \\"cheated\\" by this book than I did the first, for two intertwined reasons - and both are issues I had with the 3rd book as well. First, too much of the story for me is other people doing things for Katniss, or setting up elaborate situations where she will have no choice but to do exactly what is needed. For me, this took away a little too much of her own power and agency, and almost cheapens the value of her efforts and sacrifices. Secondly, the book does this great job of ratcheting up the tension - and then having the actual climax to the arc happen while Katniss is unconscious or whatever. Again, it feels like a bit of a let down, like going up this steep hill for a roller coaster only to find out that the creator found a way to skip most of the downhill plunge.<br /><br />Despite these issues I had with the books, I still felt pulled in enough that I read all three books in succession and ignored everything else I was supposed to be doing. Truly they were very enjoyable reads, and this one was the best in the series for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Pick your version.  Pick a reading plan.  Have it read to you.  No more excuses ... dive into God's word!  Fantastic!!!!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This handy 2-octave app helps me to figure out the key of tunes, helps me work out chords.  It is the most useful app I have seen for music people.  The sound and options are much better than that little one octave app.
B006QVRVJK|2.0|I have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to Roman Polanski films. Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, and The Pianist are all patiently biding their time in my Netflix queue waiting on me to get around to them and watch them for the first time. The Polanski films I have seen had the potential to be great, but kind of let everything they had going for it slip through the cracks as the film went on. I remember being fascinated by The Ninth Gate, but was extremely disappointed once the ending rolled around. There was also quite a bit of praise being thrown around for The Ghost Writer last year and it just didn't affect me the way any of that praise did for other critics. So while Carnage has gotten many accolades as one of the funniest movies of last year, I took it with a grain of salt. People seem to generally love Polanski and that's fine. His films are genuinely a pleasure to look at as the cinematography is always fantastic, but it certainly seems as though he may not be as great as everyone makes him out to be.<br /><br />Carnage is basically a 74-minute discussion between two couples whose eleven and twelve year old sons got into a fight. Penelope (Jodie Foster) and Michael Longstreet's (John C. Reilly) son Ethan was struck in the face with a stick by Zachary, the son of Nancy (Kate Winslet) and Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz). The parents get together to try and find a way for Zachary and Ethan to talk things out, but everything eventually falls apart and the two couples are eventually at each other's throats.<br /><br />This was not the hilarious movie it was made out to be. While the other people in the theater seemed to be howling at everything on screen, it mostly just felt slightly snicker worthy at times. John C. Reilly is pretty funny. His views, the things that come out of his mouth, his character, and his performance are probably the closest thing to hilarious Carnage has to offer. \\"Is cobbler cake or pie?\\", the flush mechanisms conversation, \\"You certainly perked up after...\\", the hamster story, the doodle nickname being ridiculous, and \\"YOU'RE BLOWING THIS OUT OF PROPORTION!\\" are all mostly entertaining thanks to John C. Reilly's over the top performance. Michael Longstreet is probably the closest you'll come to relating to one of the on-screen characters, as well. The film is mostly a competition between four egomaniacal individuals competing for the spotlight though. Christoph Waltz's \\"god of carnage\\" speech is pretty amazing as is the \\"disfigured his schoolmate\\" conversation, but you want to slap the hell out of Alan Cowan the minute you realize he cherishes his phone more than anything else in the world. Kate Winslet is mostly nauseous and drunk the entire film and you probably won't walk away from this without thinking of Jodie Foster's bulbous, veiny, pulsating neck. Seriously, that thing will probably haunt your dreams the night after seeing this.<br /><br />Carnage is very short. It feels like it ends as soon as it begins. It's like Cloverfield length. It also has one of the worst endings ever. How many films can you name that stop with a phone call? Nothing is resolved. Everything just stops. Despite a wonderful cast and a few chuckle worthy moments, Carnage mostly falls flat. It comes off as more of a contest between two married couples that become more interested in pointing out the flaws of their marriage rather than the task at hand. Maybe it's because I work in retail and I witness these kinds of conversations on a daily basis, but it just wasn't very entertaining at all. Carnage stumbles on the thin line between being extremely annoying and being mildly amusing.\\", the hamster story, the doodle nickname being ridiculous, and \\"YOU'RE BLOWING THIS OUT OF PROPORTION!\\" are all mostly entertaining thanks to John C.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun but very tedious to get from some of the levels could use a bit more variation in game play type.  but its free and fiun
0062101897|5.0|This product was originally bought as a Christmas present but when it actually arrived I ended up buying one for myself. It is a brilliant book and I would recommend it to any fan of the Harry Potter series.
B0055SWM08|4.0|great app for the price. would rate a 5,but puzzles are kind of easy. the music and game are relaxing.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|As others have said- these is not the original movies and there is no reason to go forward further with this charade.  Please give this needless tinkering with some of the greatest movies ever made one star so we can all stop buying it like LOTR and get the message across to the studios and George that we will not participate in this collossal mistake until they restore the original unmolested versions.

0525478817|5.0|Dear John Green,<br /><br />Did you start out writing The Fault in Our Stars hoping to break every reader's heart into tiny-tiny miniscule pieces? I guess it doesn't really matter, but you succeeded John. At least for me and I'm guessing anyone else who picks up your book, they will be emotionally crushed when they close TFiOS after reading the last page.<br /><br />John, fellow Hoosier, I enjoyed an Indiana setting. Even though I live in a part of the state that some people may feel is more a part of Chicago, Illinois than Indiana, I still enjoyed a story written set in my home state.<br /><br />Thank you John, for including those couple of charts/diagrams in TFiOS. In many ways, I think your readers expect to have those or footnotes in your stories. Honestly, I almost wish you would have included more of them...just because you can.<br /><br />John, you are probably the most quotable author I've read. You've probably been told that on numerous occasions, but I figured I would stroke your ego a bit and tell you once again. I won't be sharing my favorites with you today, because I think people need to read your quotes while reading your books, not beforehand.<br /><br />John, I think I love Augustus Waters more than I love Tiny Cooper from Will Grayson, Will Grayson. I always knew Tiny was a character I will never be able to forget, but I just added another character to that list. You made such memorable characters in Hazel and Augustus and I thank you for that. You made me wish I was more like them when I was their age, besides the having cancer of course. I enjoyed the witty banter between the two of them, it made me smile while other parts of the book left me in tears.<br /><br />John, thank you for signing the first printing of The Fault in Our Stars. You are the man! Just a tip: Maybe next time, include a travel size package of tissues. They are a necessity.<br /><br />After you finished writing TFiOS, did you know it was the best novel you've ever written? In my non-expert opinion, it is the best book I've read of yours. I guess I should be honest and say I haven't read Paper Towns yet, and word on the street is that's your best book to some. I hope you win some big kick-ass awards for this book. If you don't, I will be completely ticked-off.<br /><br />John, your book has made a lasting impression on me. I'm sitting her writing you this letter feeling emotionally drained and replaying your words again and again through my mind. I will not soon forget what was written in The Fault in Our Stars.<br /><br />Keep on doing what you're doing because it works,<br /><br />JacindaI should be honest and say I haven't read Paper Towns yet, and word on the street is that's your best book to some.

B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game is fun but you can't keep up with defense upgrades and building repairs without falling behind. The game needs to chance to actually beat it or cheaper upgrades.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is the best game ever. it is so wourth. it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think it is great for kids like me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and navigate.  Love that there are multiple tranlations available. Works great on the Kindle Fire. Awesome app.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I love the books. The movies can't & I don't think ever will be able to portray the books the way we all see every detail in our minds as we're reading it. Just wish there were more!
B006GG1KOC|2.0|it was ok, pretty entertaining. I had a lot of fun geussing,and finishing the game quickly it was bot really worth the money.
B0041T4ML4|4.0|I found the book fascinating. No fossil fuels, the ocean has risen enough to swallow New York City, and genetic engineering has resulted in plagues that threaten humanity's existence.  On the negative, I found the multiple main characters made the novel hard to follow. The scope sometimes seemed so large as to be off-putting.  Not a relaxing, fun read, but awesome if you want to think hard about where we're headed.
0374275637|3.0|I know I'm not a Nobel Prize winner, and I don't always understand things like statistics, but this book was touted to be understandable by laymen. Wrong! I am struggling,<br />rereading almost everything and still have trouble getting it. I'm reading very slow...ly! I promise. And thinking even more so, it seems.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|It doesn't support filters or any other the other basic features that make amazon.com easy to navigate. This is far inferior to the mobile website.
1603425381|5.0|I'm so inspired,that I'm going to try them all. It is a convenient size, too. A must have for variety.
0439023521|4.0|i read these books long before i knew they would be movies and i thought that all of them were great!!! They  make you become emotionally invested with the characters involved i am ready for the movies although i am sure they will not be as good as the books. Young or old if you like the idea of the book then you will most likely fall in love with all of these books
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its very fun..I love it!! I love that it contains so many games and I will never be bored because it has over 100 games and I can ply these with friends. it also reminds me of my wii
B0036T32LQ|5.0|Like others, I was expecting a low budget teenage slasher flick.  I was looking for something to kill a couple hours while I multitask but I ended up getting really immersed in the story.  While it is definitely low budget--as evidenced by the terrible ocean liner CGI in the beginning--it is definitely not some dumb teenage slasher flick.  The whole movie has a very creepy feel to it, even though it is not scary or very suspenseful.  This one will make you think, and if it does what it is suppose to do, may even leave you feeling a little uneasy by the time you finish it.  Loved it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun without all the bugs and ads that pop up in the middle of the screen like many other games.  twenty words yet?
B0015DROBO|2.0|I was intrigued by the movie previews and I'm a firm believer that the book is almost always better than the movie, so I was ready to enjoy this one.<br /><br />The book was extremely slow getting started, and never reached the status of \\"page turner\\".  The author has a very annoying habit of going into painful detail often on subjects of no significance.  I don't need to know what processor, how much RAM, how big a hard drive, and other details to grasp that the girl has a top of the line computer...he already said that in the first sentence.<br /><br />It also commits the all too common sin of coming to the climax, and then continuing on for chapter after chapter wrapping up all the loose ends on what was essentially a minor side story.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this one, but wish I had started in the middle and quit after the main plot line wrapped up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has easy controls it is the best game you could ever play so come on people get it already.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I ordered this 8DVD set blue ray for a friend. I bought it from Amazon at Christmas time. I could'nt get over how beautiful that dvd showed on tv. And of course my friend loved it, she was happy as a lark. I also noticed that this set cost so much more in other stores.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game a lot and how you can get different games, but some of the games are too.difficult.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|One of the best mobile apps.  Better than Colornote note.  What I like the most is to use my PC and then my Kindle Fire and my smart-phone.  Strongly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this wuz a beast game with action arcade and just some plan old fashioned fun...enjoy!!! :) P.S. its amazing how its FREE!!!!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game (these games) are great :) Some of them aren't the best, but most of them are downright ADDICTING! I'll be playing these for a while, I'm sure of it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I could not stop reading this book once I started.  I enjoyed the suspense-filled story and often wondered how the characters would be joined in the plot.  I often read suspenseful books, and this is one of the best!

B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is fun on my phone. can't wait till I put this thing on a tablet, it will be amazing. started playing a couple of weeks ago, and I am still having fun. Definitely recommend.
0545123275|4.0|The book was well told and switched points of view I really thought that it was a cute love story
0545265355|3.0|I don't wish to be too hard on the author, as the books do keep you interested.  In fact, after you read the first one, you have to finish the series.  I compliment the author for dreaming up this \\"future world\\", but in all honesty, if you are looking for happy endings, or clear cut good concurs evil story lines, you will not find them here. As I am one of those people, I found myself wishing I hadn't read them.  The good news is there is a very good chance the movie may be better than the book (for a change), as they have the opportunity to render an ending without so many un-explained loose ends, meaningless deaths, and a future with a positive resolution.  I see enough negative approaches to life watching presidential campaigns.  I don't need additional ones.  It is also difficult finding someone to cheer for while reading.  There are a number of likeable characters, but don't get too attached to them as there is a very good chance they will not survive the end of the story, and their demise will be gruesome.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is an excellent app. The word editor is great for typing documents, and the pdf viewed works very well.
030746363X|5.0|This is a great book, you don't have to be a heath freak like me to get something out of this book. I also think it is written very well, not once did I get board when I was reading it.

145162445X|4.0|A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING BY LAWRENCE M. KRAUSS  A Review by Tim Campbell  Something from nothing!  The title alone will give the hard core fundamentalists conniptions and will confuse most other religionists.  But the universe according to Dr. Krauss does not require a magic being in order to exist and the \\"nothing\\" of which Dr. Krauss writes is anything but nothing.  In fact, \\"nothing\\" refers to the vacuum of empty space, which, rather than being an empty nothingness is actually teeming with energies and particles and stuff, all of which contribute to our universe, and us, being what and how we are!  Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss is a well-known and highly respected theoretical physicist and cosmologist. He is Foundations Professor and Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University.  He is author or co-author of more than three hundred scientific publications and eight books including a best seller: THE PHYSICS OF STAR TREK.  And yes, to be forthcoming here in this review, Dr. Krauss and I are both unbelievers in tribal gods, including Yahweh, the god of the Hebrew Bible and alleged father of Jesus.  As Dr. Krauss has argued before and explains most eloquently here, \\"Forget Jesus. The stars died so you could be born.  A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING does not answer definitively the question of how the universe originated.  The book offers the best and most plausible natural explanations for the existence of something rather than nothing, and Dr. Krauss explains in fairly easy-to-understand terms how science has arrived at it conclusions and what enormous pillars of evidence support the likelihood of its conclusions.  Gravity, Gravitational lensing, Type 1a Supernovas, Clustering of Galaxies, Inflationary Theory, General Relativity, Einstein's Cosmological Constant, Hubble's Constant (which ironically changes over cosmic time due to the effects of Gravity), the age of the Universe to four digits (13.72 billion years), the certainty of the Big Bang (supported by three pillars of observed and predicted evidence:  the Hubble expansion of the Universe, the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation with a current measure temperature exactly as predicted by BB Theory, and the almost exact agreement between the predicted abundance of light elements and the observed and precisely measured abundance of these elements: hydrogen, Helium, Deuterium, and Lithium) are all covered and explained.    As a side note, Dr. Krauss points out that these \\"light\\" elements are the only elements that could have been produced in the course of the Big Bang and the subsequent expansion and cooling of the Universe.  ALL of the heavier elements--carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, and so on, in other words the things that make US--could only have been produced later by the atomic effects of exploding stars. These are the Supernovas, the result of giant stars burning through their hydrogen fuel and dying in a cataclysmic explosion of radiation and newly formed heavy elements.  As he puts it somewhat poetically, our own Milky Way Galaxy has seen more than two hundred million of these supernovas since forming billions of years ago.  The matter formed by these explosions became the matter that then formed our planet and then us.  The atoms in your left hand most certainly came from a different star than the atoms in your right hand.  We are all stardust!  These ideas and topics and much more are discussed and explained throughout the book.  Dr. Krauss does an excellent job of making these powerful  and complex concepts accessible to the layman.  While a background in science would certainly be helpful, the average person can still read this book and be both entertained as well as educated.  Dr. Krauss is one of a number of renowned scientists who have taken time away from their own work in order to bring their work to the rest of us.  Along with Neil deGrasse Tyson, Evalyn Gates, Richard Dawkins, Jerry Coyne, and others, Dr. Krauss is following in the tradition of Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov as an \\"explainer of science\\".    The book is written in a clear and concise manner and not laden down with difficult-to-understand math or jargon that would be understandable only to another physicist.    The future of the Universe is also examined.  Not the silly theological predictions for May, 2012, or any of the infamous Harold Camping oopses, but rather the eventual fate of a Universe in which normal matter and energy (Us) comprise only about 4% of the actual stuff of the Universe with a whopping 70% being comprised of an unknown, but pretty darn certain stuff that physicists amusingly call Dark Energy.  And it is this DE that makes it possible for us to get \\"something\\" from \\"nothing\\".  This is the energy of empty space, the force that fills the vacuum and pushed the universe (space itself) to expand and to expand at an even faster rate, so that one day, in about two trillion years, whoever may be around at that time, will not know what the universe actually is!  As Dr. Krauss puts it, \\"We live at a very special time...the only time when we can observationally verify that we live at a very special time\\".  Another poignant side note:  the late Christopher Hitchens was supposed to write a forward for this book, but his health had deteriorated to the point where he was unable to complete the commitment.  Biologist and also best-selling author Richard Dawkins stepped in and wrote an afterword.    Writes Dawkins (referring to the theologians' arguments of design): \\"And now we can read Lawrence Krauss for what looks to me like the knockout blow. Even the last remaining trump card of the theologian, `why is there something rather than nothing?' shrivels up before your eyes as you read these pages. If ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES was biology's deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING as the equivalent from cosmology. The title means exactly what it says. And what it says is devastating.\\"  Eloquent, entertaining, funny, and ironic, A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING represents the triumph of reason and evidence-based science over irrational and revelatory-based superstition.
1451627289|4.0|I am normally not a King fan nor a time travel fan, but this book...WOW! I have always been fascinated with the JFK assassination, which is why I couldn't wait to read this .. From the first page, I was sucked in and found myself planning my day on when I could get some reading time in. Stephen King is a master writer.  I was thrilled to see this is going to be made into a movie - can't wait to see it! Do yourself a favor and set aside a week or so out of your life to read this book!
B003UESJFG|4.0|I like this movie. I watched with my 4 year daughter but it was a bit too long for her. Also I have a Samsung Blue Ray player that it did not play it. Had to use DVD.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I was sceptical but heard good things from a friend. This is as advertised!  It does a great job. We have loved this new \\"tool\\".
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very cool and challenging games. I like the reward system and how it makes you work for new games. Games could be cheaper though.
B001GKJ2F2|4.0|A scene appears in the bonus DVD that was either cut or never put into the movie. The line is \\"There are two limiters to human performance - lack of preparation and fear of pain.\\"  The lack of that one line really hurt the movie.  Suddenly Wesley (McAvoy) is \\"preparing\\" - researching - like crazy and from square one he's getting the bejeezus beaten out of him, which made no sense without this one scene. It was a little excessive even with it. I hope this will help anyone else watching the movie to understand why things are happening as they do.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my mother who loves The Sound of Music.  I grew up watching the movie and listening to her sing the songs.  When I came across this I knew I had to get it for her.  She loved it!!!!  She is now teaching my daughters the songs and sharing the movie with them.  This makes a great gift and keepsake.
B005K17RU0|5.0|accurate and nice looking on the fire. one of my favorite and best looking apps. updates often not interruptive. would be with a small fee
B004LUS390|5.0|I bought this for my Fire to be used with a $5 stylus from five below.  I needed to draw something for my son and after playing with it for ten minutes or so I quickly created the drawing I needed for him.  The compass used for setting opacity or pen size takes a little getting used to (I'd prefer to forego this option in the tablet version) but outside of that one quibble it performed beautifully.  I have not yet exported to .PSD (photoshop) format to see how it looks there but the finished document in PNG looked fantastic.  If anything, I'd like to see a pen tool added to this in the future.  For $1.99, this is app a no-brainer for anyone interested in graphic design.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this  app works wonderfully and is easy to use. it it easy to save and check other locations making it wonderful if you travel a lot. the menus are easy to navigate making this app a snap to use even the first time. I like the live feed in the corner that tells you the temp outside without even opening the app provided you have wireless available.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars was one of the best books I've ever read. John Green's characters are great. Reading the book brought me surprises and feelings I didn't know a book could bring. I totally recommend it, specially if you like John Green. DFTBA
B005SJIP2S|4.0|Is this really not Jon Anderson singing?  If not science must have perfected cloning techniques because I swear it sounds exactly like Jon Anderson is singing.  In particular i very much enjoyed the slowed down version of \\"And You and I\\" which highlights the impossible beauty of this song.  Honestly, is there another song of such otherworldly beauty and elegance as this piece of music.  The version of \\"South side of the Sky\\" is also stunning and evergreen as is the rest of the material here.  This record is beautifully recorded and although some of the tunes are slowed down I think this actually works to an advantage.  Yes made a record without Jon Anderson several years ago, I don't know why this continues to happen.  I understand why a lot of people give this recording low marks because of Jon's absence.  But if you can look beyond that I think you will find this is a recording worthy of the Yes name.
B004TTMYQG|2.0|i am very upset with this application. when i first downloaded this (when amazon gave it away for free) it worked like a dream...did everything i wanted.

0756686970|5.0|This hard cover book features one Star Wars character per page and goes into detail about the design history of each LEGO character, up close pictures are colorful.  This is just as spectacular as the companion Star Wars LEGO Universe visual dictionary (hard cover).  I price shopped and Amazon was cheaper than Walmart, online AND in store.  My boys have read it so much, the binding is already wearing out.  Awesome product.  Comes with Minifigure.

B001QL5MAA|3.0|Huge fan of Banks and Egan. Hungry for something similar or better, I found Reynolds. It's got many of the elements that I enjoy - quasi immortality, near FTL travel, ridiculously powerful weaponry. I love all those things. But there are a few problems I have with the way they are used. First, no display of power really had me riveted the way Banks does. The more important deficiency for me is in mustering empathy for the characters.  I cut my teeth on Card, and so character development for me is paramount. I like the concepts, but RS feels more like an extended short, where the characters started as sketches and never went much beyond. This probably has more to do with emotional touch points that are missing than Reynolds capability. The writing is adept, but I wanted to care more.  It doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the read. I think he did a great job of taking the plot off the rails toward the end. I will probably read several more of Reynolds works to see if what I missed is just a case of rough beginnings.

B0036EH3WK|4.0|Loving this so far, reliving all of the fun from the first watch. Though I must say, 2nd time around, I find myself disliking the main characters I loved and loving the main characters I originally disliked. My issue that keeps this from 5 stars, is that 2 of the blu-rays came from the factory fairly scratched, about 20 minutes of unwatchable tv show. Going to call and have them replaced, but Hulu plus keeps me chugging along through the bad sections with HD streaming.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Graphics are lively. Action is smooth.  Puzzles are challenging but not so much as to dissuade one from playing.  Very enjoyable.

0307949486|1.0|I was very excited to read this book; with all the hype surrounding it I expected to be reading an amazing read. Boy was I wrong. This book was a task to read and I almost put the book down because I was so incredibly bored but unfortunately I am one of those people who can not start a book without finishing. It seemed to drag on for the first 400 pages, and then finally got interesting towards the in (but still was very far from the entertainment level I was originally expecting). While I got about 200 pages of decent reading, it was not worth it considering the aggravation I felt trying to reach an interesting part. I became curious as to what happened to the characters after the end, but I do not think I could bring myself to open another book of this series again.

B00650SSWG|3.0|This movie was exactly what I expected it to be, a moderately funny RomCom with a few giggles, but of course not Oscar Worthy. I do have to say that I enjoyed the cast and writing of this movie better than its similar counterpart, No Strings Attached. (I also thought it was funny that Justin Timberlake was in this movie, yet No Strings Attached was the name of N'Syncs album...missed opportunity J.T!)<br /><br />The real problem was with trying to play this movie on my computer. It started off ok (when we made the movie full screen the picture was extremely fuzzy)  then the video just stopped working, and there was nothing we could do to remedy it. My boyfriend and I ended up having to watch it on my Kindle Fire together. The picture was very clear and the playback was great on the Kindle, but I had really wanted to watch it on a bigger screen and without having to hold the device the entire time.

0060873027|4.0|As a lifelong Michael Crichton fan, I received this book with mixed feelings.  I was sad in that it reminded me that this would be the last Crichton book that I ever read, but still very excited to read it nonetheless.  As I began reading the book, the pages were turning in typical Crichton fashion, but after about chapter six, things took a little turn for the worse.  The story became more unbelievable than anything Crichton I've ever read before, but it was still a page turner.  It remained this way throughout, and even though the ending felt rushed, I still left this book feeling more educated than when I had gone in.  Clearly, Crichton's goal was going to be to leave the reader with a bigger appreciation for nature, and I believe it was a success in this regard.  As you can tell I've been fairly vague in this review because unlike other reviewers, I refuse to include any spoilers.  The important thing for you to note is that if you are a Crichton fan you should undoubtedly read this book, just don't expect it to meld fact with fiction as believably as has been done in the past.  If you have any particular questions, feel free to leave a comment and I'll get back to you (Note: The comments might not be spoiler free!)
1401233376|4.0|I liked this story because it gives a different twist on the regular DC superheroes, but rather than having it take place in an \\"Elseworld\\" or a \\"Crisis of Infinite Earths,\\" a choice someone from the future made by going back in time affected Barry Allen's present, and it was up to Barry to change it back. From beginning to end I couldn't tell what was going to happen next!<br /><br />The artwork was also exciting and not too busy. Even though it came out shortly before the DC Relaunch, it really had no connection with that, and it's a good stand-alone story.

B005HSG3TC|1.0|I really like the size and weight of this protective cover.  The materials used as the cover is like rubber, and will last a really long time. I thought this would be a really good cover - light weight and durable - durable enough, anyway, to make up for the ridiculous price.  However, I have had it for less than 1 month, and the elastic that is used to hold the case shut and the vinyl used in the construction of the hinge are both already showing signs of wear.    While putting my Kindle into my coat pocket, the elastic closure on this item came into contact with the Velcro pocket flap closure of my jacket.  Kryptonite!    Then there is the hinge. The hinge has gotten looser compared to new, by opening and closing the lid a required motion.  The hinge is so loose, now, that the cover flap does not lie flat over the screen.  It's like a book with a broken spine.  I would suggest spending extra for a more expensive case, but this case is already at the very high end of most shoppers' budgets for an item as simple as this - very expensive.  Maybe, don't be taken in (as was I) by the appealing characteristics without looking a the whole package.  <1 star

B0042J6VUS|2.0|The success of this tripod depends on your device. With my Kodak Playfull camera (similar to a Flip), it  worked fine if I wanted to shoot a \\"vertical\\" video or take a portrait shot. But once I tried to shoot horizontally or take a \\"landscape\\" shot, it required the camera to sit basically beside the tripod (as shown in the picture). Sadly, the weight of the camera instantly tipped over everything--the tripod was not heavy/strong enough to keep everything balanced. But if I held onto the opposite leg firmly, at least the camera was stabilized. I know it's not expensive, I just wanted others to have fair warning.

0312641893|5.0|The audio was sent to me from Esther Bochner from Macmillan Audio, thank you for this great treat.  This book was very intriguing it's the story of Cinder a second class citizen living with very self absorbed Step-mother, and 2 step sisters.  They rely on Cinder for income when her father died and left them without money.<br /><br />A plague is raging through New Beijing killing many people.  Cinder finds herself being an oddity to the situation.  She can't recall her life prior to New Beijing other than to know she is from Europe.  Her stepfather was killed by the plague but her body seems to adapt to it.  She also meets the Prince Kai while working in the market when he needs a droid fixed and is told about her.  Cinder does her best to keep her cyborg information private from him.<br /><br />As like Cinderella she has a evil step-mother,  who sends Cinder off to be tested for the plague.  Was quite a great story to hear.  I enjoyed learning about Cinder and New Beijing. Cinder finds the Prince Kai finding her in different situations and making an effort to try to get her to go to the ball with him.<br /><br />The Luna Queen wants all Luna's punished and destroyed over the inability to control what they see, her glamours don't work on them, and decides Cinder needs to be tried as a Lunar criminal.<br /><br />What a great book with adventure, romance, loyalty.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|A KID'S REVIEW:  2002 was a year of worldwide success and acclaim for Britney but it also had its bad moments for her (for example: breaking up with her boyfriend Justin Timberlake), and after her Dream Within A Dream Tour in support of her third album 'Britney' ended in July 2002, she announced she would take a break from her career for half a year. Britney had written new songs while touring that year for her next album but didn't know what the new album's direction was, so she decided to take the break. In November 2002, she started going to the studio to record some of the written songs for the album and knew the album's direction: Lots of dancing, with touches of empowerment and mature themes. The songs that came out in the first sessions were 'Touch Of My Hand' and 'Everytime' (this one being a response to Justin Timberlake's 'Cry Me A River', both talk about their breakup). Sessions continued throughout 2003, and in May 2003 she previewed some finished songs to MTV including 'Touch Of My Hand', 'Everytime' and 'Brave New Girl'. In September 2003, she made the first live performance of one of the album's songs 'Me Against The Music' and promotion for the album started. She continued to make live performances of the album's songs and eventually released 'Me Against The Music' as the album's first single in October 2003, which was a duet with Madonna. The album was released in November 2003, and I'll review the songs now and give a conclusion:  1. Me Against The Music - The album's first track and first single. This is a duet with the queen of pop Madonna, and both did it very well. The song is awesome, and its video is awesome as well, excellent choice for the first single since it totally fits the album theme about getting in the zone and letting go on the dance floor. I give it a 10/10  2. (I Got That) Boom Boom - The album's second track. This song features Ying Yang Twins, and they do it amazingly together with Britney. This song is urban, and for me it's one of the best on the album. I give it a 10/10  3. Showdown - The album's third track. I think this song together with 'Boom Boom' makes a tie because both are great and my favorite songs on the album. This song just has great vocals and great beats, and it's perfect. I give it a 10/10  4. Breathe On Me - The album's fourth track. The beat is great, but maybe I have listened to it too many times so it's not as great as the first listen (it was like the best song in the world when I first heard it). I give it 9/10  5. Early Mornin' - The album's fifth track. Very good song about messing at night and then it's suddenly morning, it's kinda hard to explain it, it's just pretty good. I give it a 9.5/10  6. Toxic - The album's sixth track and second single. This one is obviously a classic, Britney has named it as her favorite song of her entire career, and she's right, this also ties with 'Showdown' and 'Boom Boom'. She had to fight with her label for it to be released, because they wanted 'Boom Boom' as the second single, but since both are my faves I would have been happy with either. I give it a 10/10  7. Outrageous - The album's seventh track and fourth and final single. This is the only song I hate, it's just repeatitive and it's boring, and that's sad because the whole album is a masterpiece. I see this a filler and a terrible choice as a single, and to make it even worse, this song ruined Britney's career because when she was filming its video she injured her knee and that made her cancel the remainder of 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of 'In The Zone' (which was one of the best tours ever!) and affected her dancing forever. This song SUCKS, and I'm not ashamed to admit it, this should have never made it onto the final cut. I give it a 0/10  8. Touch Of My Hand - The album's eighth track. I really like this one, despite the lyrics and meaning, I really like its eastern, Oriental sound and this could have been a MUCH better choice as the fourth single ratherthan 'Outrageous', I just imagine her with a Chinese or Japanese outfit like a kimono and dancing to the song. I give it a 10/10  9. The Hook Up - The album's ninth track. Catchy song, catchy beat, not much to say about it. I give it a 9.5/10  10. Shadow - The album's tenth track. This is a ballad, and its lyrics are cute, but it's not her best or most powerful ballad, but it's still very good. I give it a 9.5/10  11. Brave New Girl - The album's eleventh track. I find funny how this kind of song is included on this album, considering she's heading in a more mature and serious direction and image, instead of touching themes about 'girls' like she did on the previous album, she's supposed to be a woman right? But I understand it, this was one of the first songs to be written and recorded for the album and of course she still didn't know the album's direction, and the song is actually great, her voice sounds funny and overall it's not bad at all (a masterpiece and even a good single choice compared to that 'Outrageous' trash). I give it an 8.5/10  12. Everytime - The album's twelfth track and third single. This is another ballad, but this one is one of her best and most powerful and talks about her breakup with Justin, responding to his song 'Cry Me A River'. This song is just really heartfelt and her vocals sound like fragile and show how she was really affected by the breakupthis is MUCH better than the cheesy 'I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman' from her previous album, but it's obvious since she wrote this with her friend Annet Artani and she doesn't write cheesy songs (except for 'Dear Diary' from the Oops! album, but it's understandable since it was one of her first attempts at songwriting). Overall, this is a masterpiece as well and a great choice as a single since it's the highlight ballad. I give it a 10/10  13. Me Against The Music (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix) - The album's thirteenth and final track. A remix of the original song, this is an amazing remix and the best of this song, it's just as awesome as the original is. I give it a 10/10  My conclusion: This is Britney's best album to date, and I think it's very underrated (I can't believe how people say 'Blackout' is her best album when that album was just ok but nothing very special, way overrated album). The only bad thing about this album is that 'Outrageous' song mistake, it sucked and ruined Britney's career permanently since she's just not able to dance like before (she does great dance moves, but she's lost confidence because she's afraid of messing up and having another accident so she just makes simple moves), but ignoring that song this album is a masterpiece and doesn't have any filler, it's just too sad the era had to be cut because of the injury and all the promotion ended in June 2004, because this album had the potential to make awesome hits that would mark Britney's career (at least it made 1, I'm talking about 'Toxic'), but anyways... this album is a masterpiece and Britney's best album to date, and Britney wrote/co-wrote almost all of the album's songs and even was one of the producers, so obviously she's connected to it and it's more herself. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed (except for that annoying and stupid song I've been talking about).

B00006AW2M|4.0|I'll admit that I prioritized the purchase of this Stones' remaster much lower than stronger efforts from their 60's catalog but I am so glad I finally picked this up. Overall, the sonic upgrade is fantastic over my CD copy from 1990 & if you're nut for the killer bands (Stones, Beatles, Pink Floyd, etc.), you want the best sounding recordings in your collection.  Sure, this is not 12x5, Aftermath, Beggar's Banquet, or the monumental Let it Bleed - but it is a must-have in my opinion. Nowhere else have the Stones dared to be this strange and footloose. I also admittedly have a very soft spot for this LP, having grown up with it (& its original 3D cover) in the late 70s. It was holy grail, mystery of rock and roll, black magic kinda stuff to me as a kid. I recall entranced listens to it & occasionally it can reach that effect still - many dozens of listens later. It may or may not \\"deserve\\" it, but in my love of 60s pop-rock, I put this right up there with Magical Mystery Tour, Axis: Bold as Love, Freak Out!, Pet Sounds & SMiLE, Mr. Fantasy, Notorious Byrd Brothers, Disraeli Gears, Anthem of the Sun, and others cut from the same psychedelic cloth. It's simply a fun, cool album... from an era of fun, cool albums. I think some fans need to give it a break and enjoy it for what it is.  Now on with the DSD remaster...  Sing this song all together: A \\"welcome to our trip\\" kick-off, much like with The Beatles' \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\". The separation of the tracks is greatly improved over the old CD release. The stereo imaging of the group vocals is excellent (is that Lennon in the mix?) & the percussion in the middle instrumental is groovy.  Citadel is one of the few Stones recordings of 67 where you can really bridge the mid-60s contemporary art-rock to the power of their renewed return to their roots rock n' roll later in 68. To be fair, there was no Jimmy Miller directing production efforts at these sessions. Citadel retains the Stones' riff-based sound, thanks to Keith's creative hook. This song really stands out on the DSD remaster. Charlie's kit really explodes, the layers of overdubs & early synth reach out in the mix better, Mick's vocal is less muddled.  In Another Land is just a fun listen. I can't tell if they want the listener to take them seriously on this one or not. Regardless, holy %#$, it's cool to listen to. Amazing recording techniques & effect for its time. The Moog \\"wind\\" behind Wyman's vocal captures the imagination. Too bad the lyrics are just so damn campy.  2000 Man is a sleeper on this LP. I absolutely love the track. Funky drum track, awesome lyrics, backwards tracks, and a totally rockin' chorus. A Stones classic. Like Citadel, this one is a gem and really reaches out toward where the Stones were inevitably going with Beggar's Banquet. 2000 Man sounds great on vinyl, the old CD mix, and here as well. What you may notice is more dynamics between the verse and chorus.  Sing this all together (see what happens) is definitely not a focused effort by the future Glimmer Twins. Anything that starts off with Brian Jones asthmatic hacking cough isn't destined for greatness. Keith's layered parts are anything but inspired. The middle riff that kicks off the brass is a cool touch. There are a few other funky 4 bar \\"chunks\\" of music infused in this otherwise tripped-out mess. But really, this is just too much acid for anyone not on acid to really dig it. I'd assume they included it on the LP as a treat for those listeners who were as utterly wasted as they liked to get. The \\"aliens have landed\\" (and are saying, Merry Christmas?!?!) bit at the end of the first side kind of redeems 'See What Happens'. It's freaky and I like it.  She's a Rainbow is a beautiful piece of psychedelic pop. Sure, it's kind of the Stones' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds - but I'm completely cool with that. The remaster sounds a bit cleaner. Nicky Hopkins & John Paul Jones' efforts really put the shine on this one. I can't believe I'm saying thisabout a Stones track, but the string arrangement really is tasteful. Rainbow is a cornerstone for the LP & was the right choice in kicking off the second side. Even with all the trippy flavor on this one, it's Charlie's playing that seals the track as a Stones work of art.  The Lantern is another under-rated Stones nugget. It's right up there with Dandelion and Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby?. The track certainly benefits from the newest remastering technology. The tape hiss is greatly reduced & the vocal harmonies are great. A close listen discloses (you can hear the bleed) that they decided to drop Keith's riffing through the first minute or so of the track - I suppose for dynamic effect. It's not super catchy but the bass/lead guitar interplay, drum fills, and sparse orchestral touches really make this song consistently enjoyable.  Gomper. The one song on the LP that's grown on me over 30 years. The song has pop structure but is bold in its experimental daring. When it's time to freak out, they go for it. My only complaint is that the hand drumming doesn't build enough to push the track through the madness.  2000 Light Years... is the strongest song on the album & one of the best Stones songs of their 60s catalog. The band's really grooving, Mick's vocals are amazing, and the synth effects remain cool and much less dated than many other recordings of the time. Play this one loud. A great match with the Floyd's Astronomy Domine on any mix/playlist.  On with the show - I've just never cared for this one but in the context of the record, I guess I get it. It's in line with Buttons & Something Happened... on a good note, the remaster of this does sound good. I'd much rather have had them include We Love You and pinch this one though. Let the LP end with 2000 Light Years From Home. That's just another Stones-head's opinion though.  Even if this can't touch Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile - it's worthy of inclusion in your Stones and/or 60's collection. Lightsome candles, embrace your inner freak, and enjoy the Rolling Stones like they only sounded in 1967.  Oh daddy, your brain's still flashin'   Like it did when you were young   Or do you come down crashin'   Seeing all the things you'd done   All was a big put on...  Oh daddy, proud of your planet!  Oh mummy, proud of your sun!

B005IU1OMA|5.0|T Rice and his snowboarding buddies have yet again pushed the boundaries on what can be physically achieved on a snowboard. These guys are really pushing the envelope. In addition to the amazing riding the cinematography of this film blows away anything I've seen in a ski/snowboard flick before. The soundtrack includes some really great songs too. A must see!
0439023491|5.0|I loved this book- the story was innovative and set in an \\"imaginary world\\" but the parallels to our own screwed up society really hit home. The characters were realistic and I definitely connected with them emotionally. The pace of the book was perfect-kept the pages turning, but not feeling like we missed something vital along the way. It felt like there was literally no \\"junk DNA\\" in this story; every word was perfectly edited! My animals got mad at me because I read all three books in like 4 days- sorry, but I couldn't put them down! I'm already hoping the author has more works in motion because I love her style and narrative. I believe this book, and the rest of the series, is well worth your purchase.

B006DQ1J0K|5.0|Sony has recently been releasing Met broadcasts with a sticker that falsely proclaims \\"first time on CD.\\" While they might mean something like \\"first authorized time on CD\\", that's not what they say giving collectors the false impression that they're getting something that truly hasn't been available. This release of the 1 Dec 1962 broadcast has been available in the past but no longer. If you have the release on Movimento Musica, there's no reason to get this one. In all the ones I've compared (Sony to previous releases), the sound on the Sony release is identical to previous releases and the Sony CD contain no extra material such as announcements by Milton Cross or Peter Allen. If you want to find whether a broadcast has been released on CD, look it up Frank Hamilton's excellent website \\"[...]\\" and click on \\"Metropolitan Opera performances on CD\\".<br /><br />That said, if you don't have the earlier release, grab this one. Bergonzi, del Monaco, and Corelli were the three best Ernani performers of the 20th century and you can hear why in the broadcasts available on several labels. Yes, I know Domingo and Pavarotti sang the role but neither of them come anywhere near these three. While Bergonzi may not be as high-voltage as Corelli or del Monaco, he has power enough as well as a beautiful tone. Schippers propels the score very well and the sining of all is first-rate as well as each making the roles their own. Leontyne Price was one of the greatest sopranos of any century and her powerful, richly burnished tones bring the role to life. She and Bergonzi recorded this opera for RCA but the live performance in fine sound is even more remarkable with its theatrical feel.<br /><br />Grab it while Sony is still releasing it.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Have had this watch for little over a week now and love it!  It is very easy to use and the HR band that goes around ur chest is fairly comfortable, do not notice it when I run!<br /><br />I'm in Managua Nicaragua and picks up Satellites with ease. I called Garmin and they told me it should work all over the world<br /><br />The software it comes with FREE is super!  Automatically connects when the watch is near the plugged in USB stick.  And yeppers, thanks to Google maps, I can see my route online.  Very impressive.  Keeps track of my pace, best pace, avg HR, highest HR, calories, etc etc!  Really like the program, especially that it is FREE!!!<br /><br />Rugged--Yep!  While running I took a nasty tumble and the watch hit the ground and it still worked!  When I looked at the results, I could precisely tel when/where I fell, lol  BIg drop off in performance for 30 seconds (laying on the ground in pain,lol)<br /><br />Some say the bevel is to sensitive and to solve that, they lock it.  I do not find it to sensitive at all.<br /><br />Thus far I have no complaints!  It is comfortable and does exactly what it is suppose to do!  I guess the only negative woul dbe the battery life if ya left the GPS on all the time, but you can easily shut it off.  2 thumbs up<br /><br />UPDATE MARCH 18 2012.<br />Everything is still working great. Watch is easy to use and so is the online Software!!  Very pleased with the purchase!!<br /><br />UPDATE MAY 17 2012:<br />Watch is still working great and VERY happy with it.  As other shave stated the touch dial can at times be very sensitive!  To defeat that, one can simply lock the bezel by pushing simultaneously the two silver buttons on the right hand side.  To stop ur time, just press the top one!<br /><br />UPDATE SEP 4 2012:<br />Still working great!!  Have used it in Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Canada!!  Always best to lock the touch dial!!  And make sure you have NOT just stopped the time---so take a look after u have locked it!!  Very happy with it!  The FREE online software is great!!<br /><br />Update Nov 27 2012:<br />Still working great, no problems at all (Just lock the bezel)  Just ordered my wife the new Garmin 410 as it is suppose to be a bit smaller.<br /><br />UPDATE March 01 2013<br />Still working great!!  No problems at all!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It gets a little repetitive but overall it is a fun challenging game. Would be neat to see more power ups available.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game play is smooth and accurate. Increasing speed and difficulty of play as expected. The upgrade weapons is unique in that it is from the same budget so to speak as repairing sites. As you work your way to the more difficult levels, additional strategy comes into play whether you repair your sites or upgrade your weapons. Highly recommended.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is a great movie, my copy was bought used, but it was in near prefect condition, just as promised. I will be watching it over again for a long time.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Loved the cover. Good price and not cheaply made like others. Definitely one to buy! Hotty toddy! Km just typing words now
B001FB55HQ|5.0|This movie is great, if you liked the other terminator flicks, you'll love this one. They said it was a new type of terminator this time around, and they weren't kidding.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|box came in great time. my boyfriend absolutely loves it. now i get to listen to the smiths all the time!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|ok game. some upgrades, but in general it feels like it needs more weapon variety. ability to split missiles, shield over a building, etc.
0440241901|4.0|All the reviews that hated this book all claim to say \\"I hate chic lit...\\" So this is what I don't understand - then why would you purposefully read a chic lit book? This book was hilarious. Emma was a completely realistic character, and her \\"secrets\\" and her reactions to things made me laugh out loud. It was a funny, quick read. But it is chic lit. But I love chic lit... and it was good.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I almost wrote a terrible review of this album after 2 or 3 listens and then I remembered I wasn't a fan of Brothers after the first few listens and end up loving that album. It happened again, it grew on me. This is a very cool album.  Like so many other reviewers I have been a huge fan since the Big Come up. I saw them warm up for Sleater Kinney imagine that a warm up act for an unknown band. My wife and I were the only ones there to see the Keys and they were awesome. They have gone far away from the music they were making then and if you don't appreciate what they are doing now, it isn't surprising. This music is keyboards and layers of music. That said, I love it. I loved them then and I still do.  I hope they can grow into something else as well. I am very happy they are still around and one of the coolest acts out there.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|good way to burn some extra time when you are bored or waiting at the airport or the bus station
0451232577|2.0|Follett's writing is event-driven and weak on character development. The book consists of thinly developed characters facing some dramatic events largely in the context of the Russian revolution and World War I. For a better written non-fictional story of the former try Alan Morehead's \\"The Russian Revolution\\" or John Reed's \\"Ten Days that Shook the World.\\" For a detailed, well-researched and well-written account of WWI try Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Guns of August.\\"   Follett's best character, Maud, could have been so much more engaging in the hands of someone like Jane Austen or Anthony Trollope. Too bad.  As historical fiction Follett falls way short of the exemplary standards set by Colleen McCullough in her Rome series.   Follett's book fails on many levels. Save your time and avoid it.  Milt Garber
B003HEWSZ6|5.0|Wife got this for me for Christmas. I'm a shaprener snob, but i must say this little gem works great. Easy to keep around (most of the time it's in my jacket pocket or somewhere near by). Great at touch ups and bringing back blades from the dead. Nice piece to have handy.
0062082353|5.0|One thing you need to know before reading this book is; the author is a sniper, not a writer.  I think this book is an excellent read and shows the average American what our troops go through, but the writing style of Kyle needs improvement.  I appreciate the fact that Kyle gives credit where it is due, to his team members.  I remember most of the battles Kyle refers to and hearing about them on the news.  But I remember only hearing about how many US soldiers were killed or wounded.  It's nice to know that Kyle rid the planet of a decent number of Islamofacists.  Too bad he had to stop.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it because it has so many games and is FUN! It is a very great game and has many features.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I am not ashamed to say that I spent an entire summer obsessing over Paul Simon after purchasing this CD last spring. It's an album I still have trouble explaining why I love it. Maybe I'm just not very good at words, or emotions.  All I know is as I was running down a hill in the middle of a marathon, \\"Love is Eternal Sacred Light\\" started playing and I just wanted to stop and shout \\"yes! this is what music can and should be!\\" I didn't, because people just don't do that in the middle of races, but this album is lyrically and thematically (and musically) beautiful. Don't get turned off by the opening track - while I have since come to love \\"Getting Ready for Christmas Day,\\" (most impactful line to someone in my mid-20s stage of life: \\"if I could tell my mom and dad that the things we never had never mattered we were always okay.\\") in my opinion the real album starts on track two with The Afterlife.  By the time you hit track 5, \\"Love and Hard Times\\" you should be hooked - at the very least, you should be hooked by the final lines: \\"Thank God I found you in time. Thank God I found you. Thank God I found you.\\" Maybe I'm getting too sentimental when it comes to the music I listen to (especially without any romantic attachments of my own to apply this to!), but...sometimes...isn't that how we all feel about the songs, people, and experiences that come into our lives?
1907590331|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books.  It is seemingly a simple story, but with amazing depth marked by terrific prose.  I'll never forget reading this as a younger man and its warmth has stayed with me.
B000JVSUS4|2.0|The poor picture quality has been addressed elsewhere, but my major gripe is the lack of subtitles.  People who are deaf or those of us who have hearing loss due to age can't really enjoy this movie.  What a shame.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I had the regular dvd version of this collection, but got the blu-ray when I got a fancy tv. Totally worth it! Some of the minute extra features are missing, but there are some great commentaries, and the enhanced picture quality alone makes it worth it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun at times but games linked to tasks are low class efforts to hawk products, but its fun for those who will like 2minute games
8862937148|5.0|I love moleskin planners! This one has the days of the week on side, and plain lined paper on the other so you can write notes (I use it for writing to-do lists or grocery lists). Size is perfect, and the cover material makes it durable even though I just throw it in my purse.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is the best!!! I love it since their is so many games to choose from!!! This is one of my personal favorite games. I think that you willblike it if you get ot. It rocks.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great puzzle gameplay, picking up right where Quell left off.  Adds some great new elements that add some new twists and challenge.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good ap to use it is fun yet hard to play and takes awhile to ger use to. very good for being free.
B005KELS6Q|4.0|The Belkin Grip Sleeve is useful for protecting your Kindle, but doesn't protect your kindle while you are using it. You have to take the kindle in and out of it. If you want better protection while your using your kindle then pick up a different case.
B004J4WKDI|5.0|As a fellow author I found Erin's writing superb, fascinating and unusual. This isn't the typical YA novel and for that I love it more. It is also not everyday were you find a book with 2nd person that is captivating to read. Well done Erin!<br /><br />R.Lynn author of Vanity&Valor and Descendants
0385474547|5.0|\\"Things Fall Apart\\" was one of the defining books for my Ohio University college experience in the early 1990's. It opened my eyes to writers from other countries; especially Nigeria and Ghana. The diction of Chinua Achebe is short, yet flowing and meaningful. He writes only what needs to be said, and yet his descriptions make you feel part of the background, looking in. I read all of his other books after reading this one, and also started reading Nadine Gordimer, from South Africa. If you appreciate short, meaningful fiction, with a timeless message, than this is the book for you.
B0050R0XEG|3.0|The Lego series is a worthwhile project for our eight year grandson. It took him all night to get the van put together but it allowed him to follow easy to read instructions and accomplished a major project for a third grader and it brought a big smile to his face when he completed it. This will be a great addition to his lego sets already completed.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you haven't watched it yet and are considering it stop, and purchase it now!  I highly recommend it and in Blu-ray it's even better!  I always thought of this film as three different stories told in one and when I re-watched it I thought the same thing.  Again a great movie and a great Blu-ray.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|We love this movie! We wanted to watch it so many times, we finally just bought it.The shark scene takes a little longer than expected to begin, and lasts longer than I expected, but still ok for kids (though they may need a reminder that she'll be ok!) Great ending!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Vary good time waster. Also good games. I have not yet got the update yet but I wont get it from what I hear.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have always liked solitaire and I like being able to play it on my kindle fire! this is a good app to pass time at work
B004RJMUJO|5.0|best fruit game evah!! must have game, I can spend hours doing it! you have to get this game,coolest thing ever made (app wise) .
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I'm really glad this product exists. I use with Otterbox Defender cases on an Iphone 4S and on an Ipod Touch, hooking up to a Sonos Dock. Works very well, plays and powers up devices. We'll see how this holds up. I'll admit I'm a bit worried about how my Iphone and Ipod no longer sit snug in the dock, but instead are propped up and can be pushed back and forth. SendStation makes a product that I also considered. But so far, so good.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Me and my lil sis r always playing this and taking turns. its a great pass time and its really fun. there is some ads but u just cancel out of them real quick. get this app! its not a waste of time!
1451627289|5.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King and I love this book so far. The scenario is very unique and it really makes you think, \\"what if\\"?? Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a really fun game, but there are way to many adds. If they could change anything get rid of the adds;)!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|_haven't had the problem with ads like others.  is a mindless, fun game.  would definitely recommend. as long as there isn't a problem with ads popping up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|You can play this over and over again because you don't always win.  It becomes addicting. Plus it is free!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|After several hours of research I found that Amazon offered the best price for the Nikon SB-700 AF Speedlight Flash bulb. Item was shipped out immediately, delivery was quick & on time! I haven't yet figured out the Wireless flash control with remote but I'm working on it! I was just in Mexico over the New Year Holiday and our pictures came out AMAZING!!!! From the color of the ocean/sand to the most gorgeous sunset pictures this flash definitely surpassed my expectations.  I love the Option to choose from 3 light distribution patterns.  The flash head rotates 90 Degrees up and 7 Degrees down with a 360 Degree rotation, this is a great feature because the bounce flash you are able to get from the flexibility of the flashes head is outstanding, it also makes it easier to pack in your camera bag, as you can adjust it as you need!!!! I did notice the amazon posting said that batteries were included however i don't remember mine coming with batteries... in any event though I am very happy with my purchase on Amazon & would recommend this item to any and everyone! The Flash bulb was nicely packed, brand new & works great!!! :) I would recommend purchasing the wireless remote when purchasing the Flash the price is reasonable when purchased in a buddle, and you will need the remote if you would like to use wireless lighting, which comes in handy! :)
B00004Y6OA|5.0|This album came out in 1980 and had success with THE CREADLE WILL ROCK and EVERYBODY WANTS SOME, but have you ever heard FOOLS or TAKE YOUR WHISKEY HOME? If not, you have missed a couple of Van Halen's best gems from that era! Edward Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, vocalist, David Lee Roth and bassist, Michael Anthony bring out their punk/metal sides on this set.This album is highly under-rated and worth the purchase price to own one of three of the best and heaviest overall albums by VH to date!!! The other two greats are VAN HALEN (1978) and FAIR WARNING (1981).
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is one of the best adaptations of missile defence I have played in years. Well worth the cost if you enjoy games like this.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is pretty cool, builds on the old missle defender. Not much else to say. Amazon's minimum word policy is lame.
B004UID2LC|4.0|seems to work as advertised and videos uploaded quickly via wifi on my broadband connection it's going to be useful
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Droid X has no problems.  The improvement over the original make the game much more enjoyable.  Definitely worth picking up.
0553582038|4.0|Reading this book the first time, I was disappointed.  A lot of this had to do with the fact that we don't hear from so many of the main characters at all.  In addition, you do get viewpoints from other new characters.  This causes the sense of \\"Why are we with this guy, I don't care about him, what's happening with Tyrion/Jon/Dany\\"?  That naturally biases you against those chapters and the book in general.  After reading it the first time, I would have given it a weak 3 stars.  But I have just recently gone through a re-read and have a much different take on it.  I've read the 5th book, so I know what happens to all the missing characters.  I could just read the book and enjoy it for what it was.  I found it a very good read, and found the new characters very interesting.  I actually really enjoyed re-reading it, which I wasn't expecting.
B0045IPOPE|3.0|I'm not really a war movie kind of guy and had to watch this for my English class on the Vietnam War and the literature and media related to it. The movie was confusing at times and probably needs to be watched twice to catch somethings you miss but seeing how it's a fairly long movie it's probably not something you want to sit through again. Overall it was just ok but I wouldn't bother seeing it again.
B00656C6KK|5.0|My mom is a HUGH Doris Day fan, and this made her Christmas!  Upon searching for another singer that was on her list, I came across that Doris Day had this new CD coming out around Xmas, so I ordered it for her. She was so happy to get it, and has been playing it alot.  Anyone that loves Doris Day will definitely enjoy this.  I have to admit although I am not from the era, the music was so much nicer!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Maybe a little too easy. Fun little time waster.  Interesting power up concept for a missile game. Would play again.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun little game! Made it all the way night 35 before I died. Would love to see more upgrades in the future so I could get even farther.  :)
B006FLGBGA|5.0|I really enjoyed this reboot of the series and am looking forward to more. The acting by Andy Sirkis as Ceasar was exceptional, and made the movie for me.
0226039331|5.0|With all of the programs online available, sometimes we forget that paper is permanent. Long before you could work with your Greek texts on your computer, this valuable aid was all that you had.<br /><br />Each Greek word is defined, both on its own, and within the context of each location where it is found. While it is a standard, it is best used by those who are serious about working within the Greek language in the New Testament. Novices might be best advised to use the computer options that are available for translation assistance.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just a good app to have fun killing some time. with some interesting games, you're sure to have fun. deuces
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I would recommend to anyone.  The mystery and excitement of what's gonna happen and what clues to find.  Makes you feel like you are living a thriller movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book.  However, pages missing..just not there.  Really ridiculous and negatively affects the experience with all the plot drivers missed.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I watched this when they were showing it as a part of a limited theater release, and I've been aching for it's blu-ray release since! There are few words that can describe how awesome this movie is. The animation is beyond top-notch, with an art style that pops with every frame and keeps your eyes watering from not blinking.  The best way I can describe this film is that its like taking the visual flourish and high-adrenaline action of the live action [[ASIN:B003M5AXN4 Speed Racer]] film, smashing it against the entirety of what made [[ASIN:B003P3PQNA Gurren Lagann]] one of the most beloved Japanese anime series of the past decade, mixing the two together and cranking all of that up to 11, and then condensing it into an hour and a half experience of visual and aural orgasmica with all of the goodness, none of the filler.  Plus, there's a cute love story in it for those so inclined.
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|IM VERY WELL SATISFIED  WITH THE ITEM IN THE TIME IT WAS SHIPPED AND RECEIVED. THIS MOVIE HAS MADE MY TOP BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR WITH IP MAN A LEGEND IS BORN BEING NUMBER ONE, REIGN OF ASSASSINS, THE SORCERER AND THE WHITE SNAKE, WUXIA, AND STORM WARRIORS. IM LOOKING FORWARD TO PART2.
B000I2J2WM|1.0|It is an \\"HD DVD\\"; i.e. it cannot be played on any normal DVD player, except for some 5 + years old Toshibas. There wasn't any hint to this fact from the seller; thus for me the video is completely useless and I have bad feelings about that seller.
1576875776|2.0|I would love this book if it were not missing pages. Some are just completely blank. I had read some reviews that mentioned this problem. I was hoping I'd get lucky, but I didn't. I had planned on giving this as a gift. I'd like to return it to get a new one, but they are out of stock, so I am not sure what to do now. Just very disappointed.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|There was no damage to the packaging and it came in earlier than I expected it to. Great cd if you enjoyed the movie like I did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it passes the time and addicting I played this game til midnight last night that's crazy then I had a bball game
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works very well on kindle fire. follows the story line of the movie. the graphics are astounding. playing it is addictive.  obstacles are very creative. well worth 99cents
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A lot of fun. An easy time killer. The higher levels are really challenging.  I wish you could save your game and pick up where you left off though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great time filler. short, one-objective games. you have to beat games to unlock new ones, and some take quite a few tries.
0345529057|2.0|So disappointed in the quality of this set of books. Although pleasing to look at these books are cheaply made with poor quality materials and pages that fall right out in your hand, but the worst part is the extremely small print. I would have never ordered these if I had held them in my hands first. Amazon's shipping and packaging was excellent as usual.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|I don't understand how I can play the free game on my new kindle fire and then purchase of the full version was not compatable with the kindle fire????? Makes no sense. A waste of money... I want reimbursed or an explaination please!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've had a lot of fun with this game. They have a lot of settings you can change up to better suit how you would like to play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wow is this game a lot of fun and I love it a lot because it is fun and my real name is drew peacock
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game. Looks and plays great on the Kindle Fire. No surprise it has such high reviews. A must have.
B004U52VPS|4.0|This is a great little game that gets that my kids love. The pigs however are a little less than to be desired, they are plastic with sticker faces (lame), i was expecting much better quality.
0300169787|5.0|If you are an Alexander McQueen fan, you will love this book. If you love fashion, fashion as art, and haute couture, then buy this book. This is a great buy - the book is large and the pictures are beautiful and glossy - a great coffee table book. If you are looking for some substantive, exhaustive review of every show he ever did, then this is not the book for you. However, you would be hard pressed to find a better book. So just buy this book. You won't regret it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book manages to suck you in right from the get go - it showed a lot of promise. Despite borrowing themes from Battle Royale and the Chuunin exams from Naruto, the action scenes were exciting enough that I couldn't put this book down... until it started turning into some sappy, predictable love story. I didn't want it to go there, but it went there. It feels like a lot of young adult fantasy books end up like this. I'm guessing Twilight fans would love this book. I am utterly disappointed, felt a bit cheated, and somewhat regret purchasing the next two books... but I will read them anyway since I bought them. I can't help but be reminded of the movie The Adjustment Bureau, and how it captures you in the beginning, then turns into something completely different. Overall, it's still good light reading. It's more enjoyable than disappointing, hence the 3 stars.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Thus has to be one of the \\"best\\" books I have read in years!  I was 9 years old when JFK was killed and I can still tell you where I was and what I was doing when I heard and saw the news flash!!  It has had a life long impact on me!  This book took me back to those days.  As a kid I played like the kids on the streets named in SK best book ever!  It took me back to the sites and sounds of my youth.  I have read almost everything on JFK since I became old enough to understand the impact his lfe and death had on me and our.country!  SK melds fact and fiction into the most compelling story I've ever read. Well Done Mr. King!!
B0036TGT3E|2.0|This is fine if you have a BluRay player. They make it sound so great having two formats. But if you've only got a DVD player and you REFUSE to buy a BluRay player then you're short-changed. All of the extras are only available on the BluRay version. The DVD doesn't even have the normal extras you'd find a the rest of Disney's DVDs. Sorry but that isn't convincing me to drop several hundred dollars are yet another piece of electronic equipment and then spend a ton of money replacing all of the DVDs that I just bought to replace all my VHS tapes.<br /><br />I'll be selling this turkey and replacing it with the two disc DVD ONLY version. Lucky for me this was a gift (some gift) so I won't be out any money.<br /><br />Anyone want to buy a brand new, never played version of the LIon King, cheap?
B005KELR3A|3.0|The Belkin grip is a very good product for protecting the kindle. Very handy for travel and transport of the kindle.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|Best Foo Fighters in years.  In may ways, some of the best QOTSA in years as well.  Many of the songs would fit in well with Songs for the Deaf.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this after hearing it was a small, quick sharpener w/ the advantage of the diamond flip out for serrated blades-this option works well.  On plain edge knives I've found it sharpens them quickly using the carbide and ceramic sections, though not quite razor sharp. The diamond edge used as is on a plain blade, or the removable carbide and ceramic, could of course be used to obtain a much sharper edge if needed
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's a great game if you spend time with multi kids. Everyone finds their own favorite,great for long road trips.
B005DOKL3E|1.0|After I received the Kindle Fire Slip Sleeve, I discovered that I had to take the Kindle out of it, not just open it like a book.  My Daughter got me one of those for Xmas--put in your Kindle, and it opens like a book.  I now see you have advertised another new one that opens up and sets up like a stand.  I just wasted $29.99 on something that is out of date.  Can I still return my Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve?  Oh, and no invoice was included in that box.  Thank you.  Barb
B0033B5XCS|5.0|The first disc was mis-labled as Wes Cravens New Nightmare and Freddy vs Jason on reverse side, strange. But in turn out OK. I checked the first disc and it was the first movie. I was worried that I got the box set without the best of all the movies with it. This is the best box set of the series.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Watched the entire Season 1 in less than 24 hours! Stayed up all night...couldn't tear myself away! Riveting storyline and brilliant acting. Can't wait for season 2!!
1904633021|5.0|Love Jane Austen!  Book was delivered in great condition and by the date that it was promised.<br />This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she was very happy with it.  It has joined all her<br />other Jane Austen books on her new bookshelf.
B0006JGFNQ|4.0|Nice toy, our 4 year old really loves it and has played constantly with it since Christmas. It does get a little old listening to it on long drives but apparently her playing with it that much shows it is good.
1593083807|5.0|A CHRISTmas gift for my daughter who loves Jane Austen.  The book arrived in excellent shape and by the date promised.  It now sits on the top shelf of her new bookshelf with her other  Jane Austen books!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so much fun and helps me pass time I just love it and I'm so glad they.made it!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I luv this game. it is sooooooo much fun. But one problem it got all frozen up and its been like that for a couple days. All the rest of my apps r fine? oh well it was still an awesome game when I played it.
B0053FP1PQ|3.0|It was a gift & I haven't asked them how they like it.  I did get it in a timely manner and when I need something, I usually go to Amazon to check out if they have it & the price & whether it is free shipping.  For the most part, I do not pay for postage.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun time killer. get the free apps to get more points to open games and just delete the apps after
B005FQ2H8W|3.0|Don't go into this expecting great special effects.  I've seen this a number of times and just rewatched it on Netflix in high definition.  That was a lot better, but I just didn't remember the opening scenes being so dull and unimportant.  They were.  My first reaction, having not seen this for at least 15 years, was that the hair styles are straight out of the early 80's and not fitting at all for a sailor in the 40's.  I also recognized Bobby Di Cicco, who was one of the main characters in 1941 (which is far better) and wore the same sailor suit and had the same 1980's hair for a 1941 period film.<br /><br />I think the action is pretty straight forward and the premise interesting.  The actor for David Herdig (a Patrick Swayze wannabe, but dumber looking), I found not nearly as believable as the earlier times I've seen this film....again, the blow-dried hair look of the 80's. Bobbie DiCicco was pretty well caught in the act of acting in the scene just after arriving in 1984. Overacting that is.  Nancy Allen is as hot as ever...and I can see why she was popular for that period...also appeared in 1941 and was hot in that too!!!  The story sort of grates on you after awhile because some of the actions by the guys make no sense and they don't do rational things half the time.<br /><br />Either way, it's worth the watch, if you don't pay too much for this.  I can't comment on the DVD, but the Netflix version was clear as a bell with decent sound and had captions available.  Probably not worth a blu-ray price though...unless they can't come up with a cleaner copy on DVD.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is addicting and I recommend this to any one who is bored and wants to be entertained get this game you wont regret it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are fun and they keep you trying to earn points so u can unlock more games ... hopefully more games will be added soon
B005TMSN4E|5.0|This FT1 Mount adaptor is amazing.  I now have a fully portable system using my Nikkor and Tamron lenses and my V1.  My 300 mm now gives me 810 mm results and frankly amazed by the sharpness of the images.  With the lightness of the body and the range of lenses I now have this is a great investment and works really well.  Pleased to see that my Tamron lense works with it, albeit in manual mode.  All my Nikkor lenses work really well utilising the autofocus of the V1.  This completely transforms the V1.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an amazing Bible application. I am ever so thankful for it. The daily devotions are eclectic and inspiring.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|thid is a lot of fun. I like that theresp multiple games all in one andthat it provides a sense of accomplishment after completing each game and virtually purchasing a new one
0446691437|5.0|This book was originally recommended to me by an acquaintance after I expressed some exasperation with how to approach my own creativity. The brilliance of this book is that its approach to writer's block is not mundane or ordinary. In essence it builds up to explaining that what we create is not of our own doing but a reflection of a higher plane, or what I have always called a higher plateau. In other words, what you create already exists in the divine nature of the universe, you are merely the vessel by which it is revealed.  I once new a guy, back in high school, who looked at some of the art I did and he said it made him want to quit trying, himself. I asked him why and replied that he wasn't an artist and he could never make anything as good as what I had shown him. Well, this book conquers that notion because if creativity is just a reflection of a higher plateau then it means anyone can be creative if they learn for themselves how to tap into that higher place. That's a beautiful idea.  I have long felt that I have been naturally tapped into a river, of sorts, that flows through the universe and gives us glimpses into what is beyond the human perception of the physical world. In my opinion, that is the source of creativity and this book taps into that. Although the backdrop for the author is writing, this book is a short yet great read for anyone interested in creativity of any sort.  As you'll no doubt see there are some negative reviews, especially regarding the spiritual aspect of this book. All I have to ask of prospective readers is, who seems happier? The cynics who write those reviews, or the people who recognize the beauty of illumination?
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have played several hundred games and it is a very good game. I have also played many different types of solitaire games and this one is as good as the best.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I get up for school, and I go on this app and check for weather that day, just like that. So far I have noo problems! I love it! Works out great for me on my Kindle Fire! (:
B0058VW36U|5.0|I'm a 40 something stay at home mom and my kids no longer have clean clothes or dinner on the table thanks to cut the rope.  It is pure maddening genius.  I will soon need s support group.  HELP.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it and it is an awesome set.  So much better than the double VHS set we purchased centuries ago.
B003UESJFQ|5.0|I loved this movie from the get-go. When I first saw the trailer, I told myself that this was going to be one of my all time favorites. Being raised by a single mother that worked in a Wrangler blue jeans factory during the day and washed UPS trucks by night, it made me realize that women are so very underrated and non-appreciated in the workplace. I was so very happy to see a movie about women fighting what is rightfully theirs. Equality on ever level in the workplace. This movie takes me back to my childhood and seeing Norma Rae for this first time. WELL DONE!!!!
0307279189|5.0|Arrived in perfect conditions and well in time for Christmas; as it was a gift I haven't read it so I can't comment on the contents. However, I will be getting another copy at 7 bucks since the first one turned out so nice.
B005P9SLES|5.0|Very good images of Hawaii locations, a team fo actors that holds the attention on amazing plots, all this in Blu-Ray.Outstanding!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|by far my most favorite app.  limitless radio choices from around the world.  and its free!  thank you! thank you!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nice quick game to pick up in line or waiting for your significant other to complete their shopping or other business
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I have been reading this book over the past 4 days or so (I had hoped to be finished by now!) and I'm only half way through.  I have fallen asleep several times while reading it because it goes pages and pages about details that I don't think are necessary to the book.  I loved the first two books and couldn't put them down but I'm having a hard time picking this one back up.  I will continue to read, as I am supposing that the ending will be worth it, but WOW,it carries on a long time with useless information.<br /><br />Will re-review it once I'm finished - next month or year.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Totally worth the 5.00, the app isnt necessary, but sooooo cool to play with and also to prank your wife lol
0385738773|4.0|I really enjoyed this third installment of The Maze Runner Series.  It was satisfying and exciting.  Like the other books, it was tough talking, action packed and full of mystery.  Again, there are Cranks, who are people infected by the deadly Flare virus.  I like this kind of take on zombies and the dilemmas dealing with them.  The book started off fast and managed to give a lot of back story from the other books without seeming repetative or overly narrative.<br /><br />Thomas grew in this book, though there were a few times where I thought he did reckless things just because he was not thinking properly.  Maybe that makes him more human.  There was one point I just wanted to yell at him to stop what he was doing.  He gets faced with some tough decisions and not everything is completely rectified for him, which is interesting.<br /><br />The friendships were done really well and were, for me, some of the best parts of the book.<br /><br />There are so many juicy plot twists and moral issues that come up in this book that it keeps the reader turning pages.  Then there are times when I felt that everything goes from bad to worse to even worse.  Then, just for fun, even worse than that.  Certainly, near the end of the book, I was rivited, waiting to see what would happen next.  Some things also come full circle, which is quite satisfying and I have to say that I liked the ending, but won't say any more than that.<br /><br />I would recommend this series for late middle school and young adult readers and think that it will especially appeal to boys.
B0034G4P9E|4.0|A nice performance driven film,a good family drama,using the MMA as a backdrop,has a 'Rocky \\" style feel good ending as well.<br />Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte performances will stay with long after the movie is over,what an emotional roller-coaster mixing a family drama and fight film combination, it succeeds on every level,everyone could relate to these characters in this film,the fight scenes were well executed,but the drama overrides that!I hope we see more of Tom Hardy this guy is a Beast on the screen,he chews up each scene he's in! Another keeper in the collection....remember this \\"Honor thy mother and Father \\"regardless of anything they have done<br />because blood is thicker than water,and life has a way bringing order and resolution as displayed in this film.
1416562605|4.0|This book carries more brilliance than initially meets the eye. I admit that the story does not grab you from the very beginning, and at times sounds predictable and repetitive, but it delivers, and beautifully so, a simple truth of life from a society most people know little about; a society that only symbolizes many other societies foreign to the Western world. Beyond that, the book transcends good or bad, and forces you to re-evaluate moral standards. A powerful, yet non-pretentious writer, Adiga makes no effort to sell his characters to you, or to convince you to see things a certain way. Characters are presented in all their glory, often to extreme, and the writer gives you, the reader, a unique chance at a totally uncensored human encounter...
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Rise of Apes was a pleasant surprise I did not expect much based on the trailer promoting this masterpiece,First of all the most impressive thing about this film was digital acting of Andy Serkis, the expressions and emotions of Caesar,you felt his anguish,fear,aggression and most of all his love for those who cared for him,quite an amazing feat.to accomplish without seeing the real actor.I don't believe the production team for this movie did not expect the  positive response this film got!The level of intelligence that Caesar had and displayed thru out the various scenes was great!The Apes battle for freedom on the bridge was pretty epic,especially when Caesar rode the horse thru the chaos,like a General leading his army to victory,man! that was straight dope!<br />A Must have film in the collection,my favorite American science fiction action film of 2011....Caesar for President!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best series I have read in a long time.  All three books are gripping.  Wish there was a #4 to look forward to!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|A straight to the point crime movie, a very interesting character study of criminals, the movie itself was not an action film ,but it had elements of violence in it based on circumstances,which the director did a great job of injecting for shock value!bravo for that,it caught the audience off guard,and propelled you for the great finale.Ryan Gosling reminded you of a young \\"Steve McQueen\\" as the anti-hero Driver, his interactions with the other characters was masterful,the supporting cast was well chosen especially Albert Brooks as the old gangster,Ron \\"I'll be in every movie\\"Perlman  as the buffoonish gangster,Cary Mulligan was great as well!A hard not to like crime drama,had a lot of European styled elements to it and the zany 80's soundtrack was kinda cool and weird at the same time which helped move the movie along nicely.My choice of being my favorite film of 2011.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I started shopping for headphones and discovered all of the reviews made mention of using a headphone amplifier. I realized on a previous pair of headphones, and, by way of comparison, on the Apple iBuds, that my iPhone 4 did not really have good audio. Sure seemed like you had to crank up the volume to catch all of the music- I'm not an audiophile, and I won't pretend that I am.  But, I have had good headphones in the past, but simply needed a low-end pair that would insulate me from sound in the library. I use a pair of ATH-M40fs and the FiiO L9 with my iPhone 4. Of course, you have to listen to the iPhone with and without the E11 to catch the difference. Just delightful!  The real test, however, was using the E11 through the Aux function in a rental car. Here again, I tried both: without the E11 and with. Astonishing how clear, and the volume was clean when I used the E11. Even in driving a 2012 economy car, i.e., very little acoustic insulation, the E11 made the music coming from the iPhone glorious.  I haven't been able to make it work with my MBP, although I think you'll find in earlier reviewers some who could get their Mac to play through the E11. That would make watching movies a real treat, if you don't have 5.1 plus in your home.  So, I'm really delighted with the purchase of the E11. I'd definitely recommend it to my family and friends.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. Addictive. Easy game play. I especially like being able to upgrade missile capacity,  speed,  etc. to different levels. It reminds me of Axis &amp; Allies.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|I will not spend your time or mine writing and reading a long review.  I do not think I have ever seen a film about a competitive sport better than this.  The story behind it, as well as the action and pain, both physical and emotional, exhibited by the two stars are what set this film apart from its typical predecessors.  I will not disclose the heroes in this film because that aspect is a significant part of the story.  I do not write many film reviews, but my appreciation and overall enjoyment have not reached such levels for quite some time.  I hope you have an opportunity to enjoy it as well.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Program works great on my incredible.  Can even run video on media player without lag. Makes it nice because I can watch a video and run it through my video output to my tv. Watch movies picture everything without having to burn a disk! Love it.
6300214826|5.0|A classic! The photography and screenplay are magnificent, and clever use is made of colour and shadows. The subject material leaves food for thought, and leaves one thinks if such a thing could that have really happened? Given the confusion and complexity of the Vietnam war such a scenario may well have been possible. Who knows? We are still unearthing declassified information of that era. The movie itself comprises snapshots of shocking detached cameo scenes linked together by the common thread of events which ultimately lead to the final confrontation. At no stage is this movie boring or stereotyped. One scene continually rolls into the next. After an amazing build up the climax is slightly unerving or maybe even disppointing, but does not detract from the epic movie, on the whole. I will watch this classic movie many more times in the future!
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|Great gift for kids. Picture quality is the best compared to other children's cameras. The flash is also a plus.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty good for a freebie, though it is hard to be precise with the touch aiming. Would recommend it as a time waster.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|how can I delete off my phone it won't delete and it won't download its crap . so please it's been on my phone 4 months ..make it, ,go away
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good app, fun to play and unlock new levels. sometimes hard to figure out how to play but when you finally get it its fun
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I was torn by the various good and bad reviews on this cover. For my K1 I had a gorgeous M-Edge leather-like cover with pockets and a slot for a light. Though the cover was very nice I kept a lot of junk in the pocket and never noticed just how much weight it had gained!  When I moved to a HP TouchPad I used a lighter cover, but the hardware was heavy (over 1 pound). As someone who spends as much time as possible reading, the weight was a noticeable factor weighing against the TP.  I wanted a cover that wouldn't add noticeably to the weight of the Kindle Fire and this met my needs perfectly. It is nothing more than described \\"lightweight microshell\\". It covers the Kindle Fire, includes an elastic band, and allows the KF to stand horizontally.  There are myriad covers/stands out there. This one is for those of you looking to protect your KF while not adding noticeably to it's weight.  I'm quite satisfied the product was just as advertised.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Hey, I have an idea!  How about we write a book about kids (little kids) killing each other, and then see if anyone is stupid or immoral enough to want to read it!  Unfortunately for our society today, people are a) not smart enough to know when writing is bad b) not moral enough to know that this is not entertainment.  So if the idea behind this book is ok for you (i.e. kids dueling to the death on live tv) then are you ok with children having sex? Oh no, you say! at least not on live tv anyway.  i find myself sickened by the fact that someone would publish this, and even more by the fact that not only do people read this, but now its a best seller and a movie?????  God help us all.
0525478817|5.0|To be honest i was a bit worried about this book, I had been disappointed with Green`s first book Looking for Alaska (It was good but I felt every one of my 23 years. It is definitely aimed at a younger audience and it just had too much sex, drinking and swearing for me) However this is definitely of of those books that crosses over ages. I feel like a teenager would enjoy it, the language is complex and as a prospective English teacher I love that it is not watered down. Even I had to think for a min about some of the words meaning. The story makes you think and is of a serious nature (life, death, cancer, love)but it still makes you laugh. I feel like the story has a different dynamic for me because I am a parent and I can identify with the parents as well as the main characters,  I would highly recommend this book to older teens and adults alike, best book i have read in quite a while.
142311339X|5.0|The Lost Hero is the ideal followup to a smash hit series that was Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Going through lower and middle school those books, including Harry Potter, were the source for much of my joy. After the last Percy Jackson book ended, I was devestated. When I learned of the new series, The Heros of Olympus, I was overjoyed. This book is an incredible followup to the last Percy Jackson, introducing new characters and keeping you tied into Camp Half-Blood, but...without Percy Jackson. Don't worry, he does become a major part of the series. The new characters, Leo, Piper, and Jason add to the thrill of demigods, especially Jason, who is mysteriously Roman. The quest is great, and the storyline is written to perfection with plenty of humor and unending action. Rick Riordan continues to amaze with his marvelous novels. The book is worth reading a million times.
B000WD54VK|5.0|I watched this through my ROKU. It's a great way to purchase tv shows! I love that Amazon saves your purchases for you there. Adore this episode! Robin Sparkles.
1423140591|5.0|the son of neptune is a fantastic follow up to the lost hero, which in itself was a superb book. rick riordan continues to amaze with his books. it seemed that no books could ever best the percy jackson series, but these are neck and neck with it.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|just watched this last night - definity worth watching - had to turn on the lights at some points it was scary - about time there is a movie that scared the beejeeves out of me lol
0545265355|5.0|These books are something that only comes around every so often. They are a tale about a young girl who has a tough life, but looks at everything like it's nothing more than an obstacle she needs to get around. She plays the hand that she's dealt as best she can. Katniss is a character that is easy to fall in love with and truly can feel the passion and love that burns inside her. I have never loved a trilogy as much as I did this one. I can honestly say that I will read these books more than once. They are beautifully written and would recommend them to anyone who is interested in reading a truly amazing story. You will be begging for more at the end.
B005NF2UE6|1.0|Howdy folks! I LOVE rock n roll more than most people do and I just wanted to say that Ive been a Dedicated Nickelback fan since the days when they used to play for 5 bucks at the local high school :)  But anywho, Nickelback definitely deserve to be in the rock n roll hall of fame... they have been pumping out GREAT albums , 1 after another, for over a decade! I think Nickelback has done more for rock music than any of those old junkie bands from the 60s and 70s...  Remember folks, support Nickelback, and avoid stupid bands like AC/DC , Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Boston, The Eagles, Kiss, Bob Seger, Dire Straits, Cheap Trick, and Santana!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great way to keep up with my Bible reading. Also good to look up Bible verses. It works great on my phone and kindle.
B005DKLPF6|1.0|Hey hey hey! I love all types of heavy metal.. my favorite bands are Slipknot, Disturbed, Atreyu, As I Lay Crying, Godsmack, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and of course the death metal giants Jonas Brothers... but lately I've been hearing talk about this new band called Mastodawn..  I decided to give them another try since their debut \\"Crack the Skye\\" was an utter dissapointment... After 3 tracks I had to give up!!! This band lacks EVERYTHING a good rock/metal band should have! Where are the Djs? The techno beats? The screamo vocals? This band did not even come close to grabbing my attention!  The guitarists don't know what they are doing... and the singer sounds like a dying 115 year old man!  For good heavy metal, avoid Mastodawn and listen to Korn and Jonas Brothers.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Chuck is the best dramadey on tv since M.A.S.H. It as all the drama of a Bond movie, with all the comedy of a pink panther movie. Minus the accents. I love the characters and the actors; they'er, for the most part, the same. There real people who live in our world; say but some comany name, that for legal reason.
B005CM9DX6|1.0|I'm a big heavy metal and rock fan. My favorite bands are Limp Bizkit, Korn, Jonas Brothers, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, and Nickelback. Well anyways, a couple of days ago someone at work told me I should check out Opeth's \\"Hertiage\\" album because they feel its a good album that blends genres. I figured that genre blending is great and my favorite bands mix genres all the time! LOL!! However, after the horror of putting up with this album i can definitely say this is NOT a good album.  Opeth doesn't have the capabilty of writing complex music like my favorites Nickelback and Limp Bizkit do.  The guitar work is nothing to brag about and the vocalist doesn't even rap or use autotune... plus, what's up with all the jazzy garbage!? Jazz has NO place in top 40 or MTV hits countdown!  For good music, AVOID Opeth and stick with anything on the radio, MTV, and TOP 40.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I purchased this item for my wife for Christmas along with the Kindle Fire. She loved the case and function of it, especially the elastic band to keep it closed. Unfortunaely the coating on the base began to flake within 2 weeks and looks awful and gets all over the bed or chair in which she is reading. I will hopefully be able to return the item to Amazon for credit. As for the kindle Fire, she couldn't be happier, and I love the price versus an I-Pad.
B0068RHGJM|1.0|What's up fellow metalheads? I LOVE metal very much, some of my favorite bands are Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park,Justin Bieber, Korn, GodSmack, Ludacris, Disturbed, As I lay Crying, and Atreyu... but lately I've noticed a trend of these weird metal groups trying to pass off as being talented!  I decided to check out Nightwish becuz of all the hype they have been getting...I went ahead and bought this album with my hard earned cash and I REALLY regret it!  Where are all the dubstep bass drops!? Why aren't there any DJs or drum machines? and what's up with the singer!?  The singer needs to take lessons from Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit because singing like that will get you nowhere in the competitive metal scene!  Not to mention...why isn't there any songs with Limp Bizkit or Linkin park?  For good metal avoid this excuse of a band and stick with...........  Justin Bieber, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Oasis, Five Finger Death Punch, Attack! Attack!, Celine Dion, Dixie Chicks, Hanson, and anything by Green Day!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love that you can play so many diffent games at one place!! It is alot of fun and my daughter enjoys them as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game, I mean, its free and has some good games. But a lot of the games are really cheesy and lame. But otherwise, its good.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|This lap top holder is very helpful in getting my laptop up to eye level and does a nice job of keeping the fans open so it stays cool.  It's not as sturdy as I hoped, but it gets the job done, and I'm happy with it.  I wouldn't get for a laptop over 15 inches.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are Aa bit annoying but the nice thing aabout this app is that youhave so many to chose fro<br />. Some games really are quite fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game of solitaire, and customizable too! I only wish the advertisements were at the bottom of the screen instead of a separate screen before each game...
B000YJ54DU|3.0|I want to be Jack Reacher when I grow up. I found Lee Child the first time rather by accident, and I'm glad I did. All of his books are 4 or 5 stars in my world. Well, ALMOST all of them. NOTHING TO LOSE gets 3!
B006JTS5OO|1.0|Watched this last night and nearly wept, no not for the nostalgia, but the disappointment. Realizing the heart of The Muppets is truly gone. I understand why Frank Oz would have nothing to do with this poorly written film.  -minus the famous \\"Rainbow Connect\\", all the songs was dull and forgettable  -too many scenes of people dancing, just people with no Muppets and rather bland dance numbers  -yes, it's a \\"family\\" movie, but the plot too, too thin  -some cameos felt forced, like someone at Disney demanded their tween stars appear, utterly painful  -oddly dark Kermit at times... not Henson humor, like blowing things up or monsters eating people, just creepy unappealing dark  -so much of the attempt at humor feel flat, at times, I felt embarrassed for the Muppets.  Don't buy this film, skip renting it, wait for Netflix/Amazon OnDemand and fast forward the majority of the film.  R.I.P. Jim Henson
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I want to be Jack Reacher when I grow up. I found Lee Child the first time rather by accident, and I'm glad I did. All of his books are 4 or 5 stars in my world. GONE TOMORROW follows a previous disappointment, and it gets 5 in my book!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|but in a good way!  Classic gameplay where the game takes no mercy, and none of this coddling you with achievements.  UPGRADE MISSILE SPEED EARLY!  UPDATE: Lowered the review from 5 stars...  I've noticed that once you get to Missile Speed 3+, the missiles no longer detonate where you've touched, instead they detonate a little beyond that point.  I don't know if this is a \\"feature\\", or a \\"bug\\", but it's annoying, regardless.

1401922414|5.0|I have this calendar in my office and I like reading the daily affirmations. It's a nice little boost of encouragement to start my day. I like the fact that is NOT religeous. I purchase these calendars every year for Christmas for myself and my two kids who look forward to them.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I've been playing around with my new Behringer XENYX 302USB Mixer and so far my impressions are positive.  I was nervous about buying it because there were no reviews at all, so I opened the box carefully and took out only the 302, using my own cable and on-line documentation. That way, if I had to return it, packing it back up would be easy.  I use Audacity (with a single core, Pentium 4 PC running XP Pro) to record, and the program recognized the 302 (as USB codex), no problem.  One thing I wanted to do is record from an iPod Touch 4G to Audacity, then play that Audacity track back and record another track against it from the iPod. I used a mono cable that is 1/4 inch on one end (plugged into the mic jack of the 302) and 1/8 inch on the other (plugged into the headphone jack of the iPod).  I used an app called Chordbot to play a progression on the iPod, which was recorded through the 302 into Audacity. I didn't care that the track was mono, but if I wanted stereo, I could have used the line input on the 302 with RCA cables going to an 1/8th inch stereo plug.  Once my chord progression was recorded on an Audacity track, I played that back by using an RCAs to 1/8 inch plug to connect the line input on the 302 to the headphone jack of the computer. By pushing the red button on the 302, which selects input from the USB (the computer), and the black button next to it, which sends the signal to the headphones, I could hear the Audacity track playing as I recorded a new track, this time using an app called Thumbjams on the iPod.  It worked very well. No hiss or other unwanted noise present.  The 302 assumes (incorrectly, in my case) that I want to hear the mic input through the earphones as I'm recording. I don't. I never monitor myself when singing or playing guitar, but listen only to the backing track.  I got around this by using the pan slider on the 302, panning my live performance all the way to the right. I then removed the right earphone from my ear. I panned thesound coming from the computer all the way to the left. This way I could hear the backing track but not my voice in the headphones.  My Audio Technica AT2020 microphone recorded fine--with no hiss or noise--with the 302's gain set at 12 o'clock, the mic volume maxed, and the main mix volume at about 2 o'clock.  I could generate hiss with the AT2020 if I cranked the 302's gain and volume all the way up, but I can do that with most any mixing deck.  I could not get as loud a hissless track using the 2020 and the 302 as I would like. A preamp is probably called for. But the signal was usable if I increased the gain a bit in Audacity after recording, or if I doubled a track.  In addition to the iPod experiment, I recorded a nylon-string guitar, then recorded a vocal track against it. Used the AT2020 for both tracks. Worked fine.  I have an old Radio Shack dynamic mic with a built-in TSR cable that I tried. It also recorded well, for what it is. (I sound terminally depressed when I record with this mic, so only dig it out for experiments such as this.)  All in all, I'm liking the 302 and plan to use it instead of the XENYX 802/UCA202 USB interface rig I was using.  WOWSERS. Important update. The USB codec that Windows installed when I first plugged in the 302 doesn't play nice with Audacity. Often when I try to play back or play back and record, there is no sound through the 302, even though I can see audio levels in Audacity.  I went to the Behringer website and downloaded the ASIO 32 bit driver. Now things are great. Except. Whatever USB slot you install the driver to is taken over by the driver and can't used by any other audio codec.  This means that if you unplug the 302 and plug another audio device into the same slot, it can only play--if it will--using the Behringer ASIO codec. Other slots are unaffected. It's possible to undo this by running the setup file again and choosing to uninstall the driver.  I'm willing to give up a USB slot to the 302 because I'm liking it so much and will probably use it every day. YMMV.

Documentation is lacking other than for very simple examples.  Lots of promise, but it's got a long way to go.  I'll try it again in a year.

B0008ENHTE|4.0|McQueen is always watchable and this was one of his best.  Being an older film though, it does suffer when transferred into a modern medium.  I had expected the movie to be as I remembered it, but after all these years it didn't quite have the same edge. Great to watch occasionally, but I don't recommend buying a copy. Better to rent it once in a while.

0812992792|5.0|In The Orphan Master's Son Adam Johnson brings to life the concept and reality of North Korea as only a master could.  He knits together reality with one of the great fictions of movie history (Casablanca) but transcends even Rick's character with that of Jun Do, the orphan master's son.  Jun Do's character starts at the lowest rung in North Korea, an orphan, at least an orphan due to the denial by the orphan master to even acknowledge him as his son.  Jun Do's launch outside the orphanage starts with  carrying out clandestine missions for the State (as directed by the Dear Leader Kim Jong Il) where he shows promise in learning foreign languages, then moves to high adventure at sea where he rises to hero status only to fall from grace.  His subsequent incarceration exposes him to a camp where exhausted workers suffer their grisly terminal exploitation as unwilling blood and organ donors.  Then almost by accident he manages to transform himself to a new identity as the second most powerful person in North Korea, one regarded with paranoiac fear even by Kim Jong Il.  It is the last transition that allows Jun Do the pleasure of finding his Ilsa, the most beloved actress in all of North Korea for whom Kim Jong Il personally writes scripts and secretly loves.    Along Jun Do's winding trail, Johnson introduces a myriad of heterogeneous characters extending from two American women rowing around the world to North Korean fishermen pressed into service to sponsor spies and carry out absurd personal missions for the Dear Leader's whims.  Jun Do and his fellow cast members reveal a state that most of us can only imagine--one devoted entirely to Kim Jong Il and his obsessions, his world view, his total control of information, his complete disregard for common morality.  Fear permeates and dominates every person's single day, their every action, their every \\"private\\" conversation.    Johnson's lively writing uses diverse strokes to paint this wide ranging action to evoke both acceptance and rejection by his characters' anima. Using fascinating style and imagination, he weaves together so many emotions and conditions from despair to cautious hope to probe a culture with which few of us are at all familiar that his book deserves a read, maybe two to savor it fully.

I placed them all on the side of my child's closet going up the wall from the floor and there were more than enough.  They are true to color and stick well.  There is a crease in the butterfly and caterpillar but it's barely noticeable after a few days.  Buy them :)

B005KELS6Q|4.0|I received a Kindle Touch for Christmas and feel I'm really lucky to be able to try out this sleeve case for it. Being a girly-girl I loved the pink color of it, it's an attractive case for sure. I've used it for almost a month and really haven't had many problems. When I first got it and put my Kindle in, the On button was accidentally pushed but I brushed that off as it had a bit a stiffness from being new. I haven't really had a problem since. I love this case and whenever my Kindle is not in my hand, it's in the sleeve case. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is looking for something to keep their Kindle (newer Kindles only) dust and scratch free.

B006MHWXMS|5.0|I had been looking for a tasks app since day one of receiving my Kindle Fire. Every one that I tried were too complicated for me to figure out easily. Not so with Tasks N Todos. From launch I easily added tasks, reminders, repeating tasks, set dates, alarms and all. Tasks N Todos is really easy to use. It looks great on the Fire, I love it!  I did not have any issues as other people have mentioned in their reviews. After using this app for months every other task manager fails to meet my expectations ( these include Pocket Informant, ColorNote, MyLifeOrganized, Cozi Family Organizer, MobileLife Family Organizer which is the same as Cozi,  Remember the Milk which i still like, and noodles - To Do List which I'm still testing)  I am glad that I got Tasks N Todos Pro as a part of Amazon's Free App of the Day, otherwise I'd still be looking for a task manager (which would probably only dissapoint)
B004O3YGMC|4.0|There are only a couple of really good Android apps to do remote desktop, and this is one of the best. Besides the simplicity of just connecting to a remote desktop, the UI provides all sorts of quick and easy ways to access that remote system (e.g. substitutes for your Windows hot keys). I was amazed to find that when I connected to my desktop -- which runs a dual-monitor configuration - I could switch between monitors with a single tap.<br /><br />All operations use standard touch screen gestures (so zooming, for example, uses the pinch gesture), and there are substitutes for all things like mouse scrolling, right-clicking, etc. (I have not yet discovered a way to access running processes on the Task Bar.)<br /><br />My only concern - and the reason for a \\"missing\\" star - is that the app constantly gives a \\"connection lost\\" error (even when I have a strong signal, and all other lnternet apps continue to run just fine. Hopefully this will be resolved in a future release.
1451627289|4.0|The premise of the book is very intersting.  However, it is apparent that the protagnoist drank the Kennedy Kool-Aid, believing that JFK wss than answer to America's woes.  JFK was certainly in the right place at the right time.  He certainly did server America and we are better for it.  However, whether or not America would be better had he lived longer, is all speculation...and that is how this book gets FUN!  It is very obvious that Mr. King did his homework.  He has the jargon of the era, the clothes.  He also pays too much attention to the segregation of the South.  It is a sad blight on American History but not one that needs to be rashed today.  So just enjoy the ride!
B005VPLZ76|5.0|gonna make it short :<br /><br />* Pressed at Record Industry (this is the 2nd album I bought that was pressed and it's in the same class of Palas).<br />* it's 180g Double LP<br />* it's not a gatefold cover (only thing bad in this purchase...but not a big deal).<br /><br />soundwise :<br />compared to the Original CD that I own and it sounds a lot better !!! (the original CD sounds great as well)<br />the Vinyl has better soundstage, better defined bass, the drums are cleaner and you can hear every little riff that Frusciante Plays.<br />I don't know who did the mastering but the rumor says it's Bernie Grundman (?), anyway they did a very good Job...this is a true audiophile Vinyl.<br />(I own some more expensive ones so I can compare)<br /><br />Cover :<br />this is the only negative stuff I have to say about this purchase...I don't like the cover !<br />it's simple, cheap...I expected Gatefold cover, with some art or something...but they put all the money on the sound and pressing (I guess).<br /><br />so should you buy it ? YES !!<br />I'm not a big fan of RHCP, but this album is great and they made a high quality Pressing here - Highly recommended !!

B0015DROBO|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I read it, but the book reviews were very good. I though the depth of the characters was excellent, especially Lisbeth. It look less than two days to read it, I couldn't put it down. I had to read the entire series.
0553801473|3.0|The first three great forth not so much this one better than the last. The character development is beyond anything I have read before. Most notably is the character Dany or as some call her Daenerys. Now her character seemed have some great character growth. However continuing from the previous book she begins deteriorating into a foolish person loosing focus on her goals. That was the worst twist I have seen in this series.<br />Lets get to my favorite character Arya and if you read the previous book you may have (like I did) been a little sad at how little she was in it. Well rejoice she gets more in this one doing exactly the same thing for the most part. Now there is also the Tyrion chapters but I don't care for him so read another review if you want to know about him. Jaime is alright I hope in the next book he has a mustache. John Snow what can I say he is a cool guy and you get to see his day to day exciting tasks running the Nights Watch. Last but not least of the notable characters is Cersi never liked her much and nothing really happens to her in this one still leading up to the trial. You might say wait why is she taking two books to go to trial? Well it's building up the suspense and if you can't see that you must need to reread this book as I have many times and yes it gets better with each reading. Who could expect more from the modern day Tolkein and their love for mustaches.

B0055SJVPW|1.0|I'll never understand how women can claim to be so much deeper than men, yet watch something, that in 5 minutes, I could plot out for them.  I'd say it was formulaic and predictable, but honestly, the characters were retarded and the plot was predictable.  My first clue should have been Kate Hudson.  The Meg Ryan for the new generation.  Fortunately the movie was for my wife, so I was able to go upstairs and play Galactic Samurai Sword Chicks with Machine Gun Laser Boobs III instead.<br /><br />Guys stay away; girls if a guy sits through the whole movie with you, he loves you, cuz chances are he'd rather be playing GSSCWMGLB III.  Well, there's also the chance he's sitting there out of guilt cause he slept with your best friend...<br /><br />The picture and sound were fine, blah, blah, blah techie techie techie.  Happy ever after, yeah!!!!<br /><br />Spoiler Alert, Kate Hudson gets bi-sected by one of the laser boobs, or maybe that was just my imagination.<br /><br />Oh well, consider yourself warned.

B003ZSH606|5.0|Jamiroquai's career for the past twenty years has been a long and curious one. First starting out as offering one of the few funk/soul based musically genuinely based in live instrumental productions with heavy songcraft and arrangements,the band gradually shed members at the end of it's first decade and relied more on heavy production and dancibility. Their previous studio set [[ASIN:B000B5XZLU Dynamite]] was not 100% up to their standards. And a compilation released not long after only featured two new songs. Seemed Jamiroquai was over. Newer bands/soloists had arrived to fill the void they left. Taking several years between the last few album releases have given them a chance to figure out what kind of music they can deal best with. And that it might just be possible to extend on their peak period without looking embarrassing. Now Jay Kay has reuped with a new Jamiroquai band that's quite a bit larger and self contained than the original including bassist Paul Turner,guitarist Rob Harris,keyboardist Matt Johnson and original member Derrick McKensie on drums along with a horn section and backround singers.<br /><br />  On this album Jamiroquai have a sound that doesn't have much to do with the sound of their earlier recordings. And certainly not the previous two. While Jay's voicals,whether due to his hard living past or overeaching vocally over time,is continuing to lose the range and volume it once had the material here is unique and diverse. Sure the digeredoo sound is of course long gone. What is here is a sound that,overall blends Jamiroquai's funkier and more soulful influences with stronger elements of singer-songwriter and pop/rock. The upbeat title song and the pretty ballad \\"Blues Skies\\" are basically built around acoustic guitars.  \\"White Knuckle Ride\\" and \\"All Good In The Hood\\" are the kind of Rod Temperton/Steve Arrington influenced sophistifunk  Jamiroquai have always excelled with. Again,both have a somewhat subdued undertone even still. The arrangements of \\"Smoke And Mirrors\\",\\"She's A Fast Peruader\\" and \\"Hey Floyd\\" are a reminder of the type of polyrhythmic \\"united funk\\" style instrumental power they were always able to insert into their sound.<br /><br />  While \\"Hurtin\\" does,to an extend replicate the sound of \\"Virtual Insanity\\" a little other songs such as the mildly 70's light rock influenced \\"Lifeline\\",with it's almost Beatle like refrain as well as \\"Two Completely Different Things\\" and \\"Goodbye To My Dancer\\" return to the singer-songwriter type pop funk of the title song. It all rounds out with another smooth groove in \\"Never Gonna Be Another\\". Lyrically Jay is resolving a bit of sewing his wild oates with this album. Not only that but as much of a return to form in terms of live instrumentation it is,the production is rather subdued by Jamiroquai standards. In some ways it's a return to the form of their first four albums. On another end it actually represents a completely different group-a more understated and somewhat adult Jamiroquai.  Not sure if this is the end of the band,since they have signed to a new label or the start of a new beginning. Hope it's the latter. The band and their creative vision are more than worth it.Smoke And Mirrors\\",\\"She's A Fast Peruader\\" and \\"Hey Floyd\\" are a reminder of the type of polyrhythmic \\"united funk\\" style instrumental power they were always able to insert into their sound.

0439023521|4.0|I read through the entire series in the last three days, and regret waiting so long to read it! The story is so interesting, and the writing is so descriptive. Collins really creates this whole other world, and actually makes it seem so believable. I also love the characters. I love Peeta. She paints him as that one person that everyone knows that is almost too good, that person who we can never compare to. Katniss is a complex and interesting character. I find her likeable, but not overly so. I think she is to represent the average reader, someone good, but no where near perfect.  The reason why I felt I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I sometimes felt that emotions and/or reactions were way over the top. I don't really know if anyone else felt this way, but it happened a lot in Book 1. I can't think of any specific examples, because I've already finished reading the other two books, but I do remember something between Peeta and Katniss seeming almost ridiculous in her reactions. Maybe Collins just wanted to add more drama (like it really needed it), or just wanted to express the pressure that is going in throughout the book, and the entire series. I'm really not sure. But it made Katniss seem bratty and overly emotional, which now that I think about it describes pretty much any 16 year old girl. Honestly, that was my only complaint, but it did happen numerous times, enough so that it bothered me throughout the whole series.
0525478817|5.0|I was really cautious about all the great reviews before reading this book. I did not want to be let down as so often happens with things that get such great hype. However, I was not let down, and this is a book I will cherish for years to come, if not for decades. I don't want to write anything specific for fear of spoiling, but it is heartbreaking and beautiful and life-affirming. Sometimes you read books and you can tell that the author didn't really give it their all, but it is very evident to me that John gave everything he had telling this story. Nothing about the story telling is lazy or disappointing. Not a single word feels wrong or out of place. As an adult, I want to encourage other adults to read this. It may be categorized as 'young adult', but great authors transcend labels and categories, and this book is much better written than most of the adult fiction I have read.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Here it is.  A direct, no nonsense review.  I have read several reviews from those that loved it, hated it and in between.  The simple truth, regardless of what genre you like, this trilogy of books are a quick read, highly entertaining and have a lot of controversy to offer.  I am not going to get into details about the books story or characters because I think there are just too many ways to spoil it for you if I do that.  Here is what you really need to know.  1.  This book isn't for anyone who is easily affected by negative images or violence as the book contains a lot of both.  So for young readers, especially those under the age of say.... 14 or so, this is not an ideal book for them to read.  The story has several graphic scenes by which leave a visual impression on your mind that can be difficult to shake and for those minds that are too impressionable, reading material like this is a mistake.  That being said, even if you are an adult who is deeply affected by such imagery, be forewarned.  This book has several scenes that can be disturbing but in my humble opinion, isn't that why we read books?<br /><br />2.  I have also read reviews that balk at the details concerning the hunting and the idealistic aspects regarding mining for coal in a world that is so far in the future with technology, mining for coal is unrealistic and I think, really?  Is THAT what you are going to pick at.  Whether or not a futuristic FICTIONAL book is going to come across as REAL?  This book is a non-stop thriller, filled with vivid imagination, characters leaving lasting impressions and several topics that lead to discussion and controversy.  IT is ENTERTAINING! What else do we really want?<br /><br />As for those readers that complain about it's violence?  Our history is filled with nothing but.  It is part of the human evolution.  If you want to put  your head in the sand and believe violence is not part of our growth, think again.  I am not condoning violence but to say books should be absent of it is completely unrealistic.<br /><br />In summary, this trilogy is popular because the story is compelling, the characters are interesting and the plot is controversial.  It is written clearly, concisely and with intense visual imagination.  I wonder if some readers have given it bad reviews because their ego's simply refuse to be one of the masses.is completely unrealistic.

015206057X|5.0|I bought this book when I was pregnant, because I appreciated the message that everyone is the same, no matter where they were born. We started reading to our daughter pretty much right away, and I tried reading this one to her without attracting much of her interest for a while. But for the past few months (she is 19 months now), it has been one of her favorites. She brings it to me to read and says \\"Ten!\\" She loves the pictures of the babies, loves pointing out their fingers and toes, says \\"night-night\\" when it shows them in a crib, and at the end (my favorite part, and hers) when it gets to the mama and the baby, she says \\"Mama!\\" and points to the mama. In fact, this was the first book where she recognized a \\"mama\\" in a book, even though it doesn't actually say the word \\"mama.\\"<br /><br />As for me, I love this book because it never gets old. It has a nice message throughout, and at the end it makes me feel a surge of love for my own baby girl who is \\"mine all mine\\" and hug her a little closer every time. This is one of the few I'm happy to read over and over and over!

There's a good story, great visuals, and excellent costumes and pageantry. I found that the first time I watched the film I just concentrated on how awesome it looked, then on the story the second time around.<br /><br />Trust me, watch it twice. It's worth it.<br /><br />The special features are also worth a gander.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy this app. definitelg very addictive. I wish there wasn't as many ads,  but all in all very fun.
B005UKK4Y2|1.0|I think this script was written by a juvenile.  Really stupid, gross humor.  I almost had to force myself to laugh.  I'm amazed that they were able to cast such big stars in this movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a decent app, but the games are all so short. Its quite amusing for short periods of time though.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|As great as the book!  At the end I had the same reaction as when I finished the novel - I wanted the story to keep going!  Lovely story, beautifully told.  The trailers on TV did the movie a disservice though - my husband and son thought it was going to be a movie about a bunch of gossipy housewives.  They found out differently - they LOVED the movie!  I think it's a realistic portrayal of a very important time in our history.  Very poignant. The acting was SUPERB! I would watch this again and again.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great game! worth the download. good graphics, accurate touch control, and good game mechanics. helps waste time and pass it all the same. just like the original.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is fun yet challenging and I like to play so o can beat the different games its awesome
B0036T32LQ|2.0|What's keeping me from giving this movie 1 star is the assumption that Christopher Smith's film is simply a drawn-out, exaggerated metaphor for a young mother who continually finds herself trapped by the cycle of abuse that passes from parent to child, from one generation to the next. That would be about the only saving grace that I can attribute to this movie which, if not extended that benefit of doubt, would be a complete and utter mess of abstract nonsense with absolutely no tethers to explanation or common sense.  It's great when a movie throws you more curves and plot twists than a single viewing can be used to comprehend; Memento, Shutter Island, Inception for a few examples. It's frustrating when a director gives you an open-ended disarray of contradictory plot movements and 'what the fu..' moments and then never bother to even attempt an explanation. You're just suppose to go with it, reason be damned. Well, that's just not good enough.  Triangle wants desperately to be something provocative and intellectually challenging, forcing the viewer to question what's happening onscreen both during and after the film plays out. Problem is, the whole idea behind it is so incredibly stupid it begins numbing your brain not long after the first few questions arrive. Instead of drawing you in and making you care about the story with interesting dialog and cleverly constructed plot twists, the script actually pushes you away through it's own impenetrability. It makes no sense and three quarters of the way through, you no longer care anyway.  Don't listen to the 5 star reviews, or ones that proclaim they understand this movie. It doesn't deserve 5 stars and, other than Christopher Smith himself, there's no one that really understands it.

You will not be disappointed.
B005TQAI6G|4.0|I only give this review a 4 instead of a 5 because of how Epix dubbed over her live vocals with studio versions. I loved the concert when I went and saw it in Portland, and I can tell you at our stop she sang live to nearly every song, it was amazing, but this DVD is kind of saddening to me since they take her live vocals and just throw most of them out the window. Despite this though, this DVD was amazing. I watched it and it really rushed back the feeling of going to this concert, and now I can experience it over and over again. Overall I really do enjoy this DVD! And to everyone whining because there aren't any bonus features, get over it. The concert itself should be enough, it certainly was for me.<br />*The bonus CD was great too!
B004132HZS|5.0|Do you like a challenge? Here's one for you:  15 minutes.  That's all I need to convince you to watch this show.  Start with Episode One: A Study in Pink and watch for 15 minutes.  You will not be disappointed. If you want to stop watching after 15 minutes, go ahead. Walk away. Please respond to my comment and tell me why the first 15 minutes did NOT intrigue you, seduce you and otherwise convince you to keep watching.  I know they will.  So go...watch it. You will not regret it.

B005TBN3EU|3.0|Hangover I and II are the anthesis of Chick Flicks, and near the outer end of the Dumb-Guy Movie and/or Dumb Guy-Movie, without being aimed at teenage boys, which is a level or two below even that.  These guys are old enough to know better, and should be smarter, well all but the chubby guy who never grew up, but they aren't, and the keep on partying long after their brains have gone to bed.  I've done that, and I've lived to talk, so far, and I don't want to do that again, but it can make for some funny stories.  So we're not talking great cinema, but it should still be funny.  Where Hangover II outshines Hangover I is that there are funny parts that weren't in the trailer.  Every single funny part of Hangover I was in the trailer and nothing was left for the remaining ninety minutes.  Otherwise, both films follow the same format:  Someone is supposed to get married, and the guys lose someone and the rest of the movie is spent looking for him;  along the way we learn most of what happened the night before, and what we don't learn is hilariously filled in at the end, in photographs that someone took...  At least in this film funny stuff keeps happening, the scenery is great, or at least very colorful, and you don't have to be wasted to get through it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is pretty cool. we've been playing unblock it and it was starting to get old. the levels in this game seem new each time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|At first glance, 11/22/63 appears to be a relatively standard Stephen King journey. Strong characters enliven a world that becomes ever-darker as a man pushes to change the past. However, 11/22/63 is probably Stephen King's most mature book to date, one that doesn't veer into horror territory but instead focuses on questions of what implications there might be if we changed history, and more importantly, is a beautiful love story.  11/22/63, in a quick overview, is about Jake Epping, a teacher in Maine who is approached by the owner of the local diner with a proposition - go back in time and stop the Kennedy assassination and in doing so, hopefully stop Vietnam from happening, Martin Luther King, Jr. from being assassinated, and more. Though reluctant and unbelieving at first, Jake learns of the ability to go back in time through a warp in the man's diner, and takes on the challenging task of fighting against history that doesn't want to be changed. In the course of his years-long journey, Jake meets and falls in love with a beautiful, young librarian in a small town in Texas, and while he continues to track Lee Harvey Oswald and attempt to stop the assassination, he battles with his false identity in thepast, his mission, and his love for this woman.  The love story in 11/22/63 is beautifully carved out, and 11/22/63 was one of the only times I've had tears in my eyes reading a book. It is an excellent love story, an excellent thriller, and gives great nods to readers of King's other books such as \\"It\\" and \\"The Langoliers.\\"  It is one of his finest books, and that's saying something considering how diverse and incredible a catalog he has built up. I highly recommend to anyone interested in a great novel devoid of horror and filled with excitement and joy.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother for Christmas, but wanted to see it myself. It was such a great movie, wonderful acting, powerful message about strong women fighting oppression. So glad we own this movie and can share it with the rest of the women in our family.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is simply one of the neatest apps in have.  I can run my Windows Vista 64 computer at home using my Android Thunderbolt 4G Lte. It works great,  and only required a small change to my firewall to forward the incoming port to the correct computer. I have a more complicated system than an average user, so normal users do not have to do this.  It actually found the correct computer just by having me sign into Google. Now I can run a Windows application on my phone... Well at least it seems like I am. The application displays the image from my home computer on the screen and I can control the computer remotely. Very cool.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|First, this book reads like several interview transcriptions assembled together to describe the events that take place. Once you understand how the book is setup the story itself is great and hard to put down. For me what made this story so good is its a very realistic type look at if there was a zombie outbreak, this is likely how it would happen in today's society. This book can be hard to follow at times but if you can follow it the story is just great.

0307959856|2.0|I was intrigued when I heard that the venerable mystery writer, P.D. James, chose to set her latest novel, Death Comes to Pemberley, in the place, time, and characters of Jane Austen. Curiosity brought me to this novel, and James' skill at mystery writing kept me interested. I suspect that both Austen and James fans are likely to come away from this novel with some degree of disappointment. Darcy, Elizabeth, Wickham and others are familiar characters to most readers, but they are set in our minds from Austen's writing. James may be true to many aspects of these well-developed characters, but she sets them in a situation that is unlike anything that Austen would have done. Along the way, readers get an interesting mystery to read, but one neither great nor memorable.<br /><br />Rating: Two-star (Mildly Recommended)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|live. love. awesome. app! so helpful and thankful its a free app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! any body would the ability to use this in everyday life or business
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this app on my iphone and my Kindle Fire. I currently use it to keep short, work related, journal entries. I also use it for pictures I take on my iphone that I want to reference later (example - today at the supermarket checkout I saw a nice dessert on the cover of a goodies magazine - I don't need the recipe to create something similar - I just need a snapshot of it to save the idea of it) I listen to the Evernote Podcast (Smuckers - it's gotta be good) and get more out of the app than I would without it. Wish I could afford the premium service - simply not in the budget at $45 a year.
B005TMSN4E|2.0|I have a NEX 5 but got the V1 because I have the Nikon primes.  1st problem - the v1 firmware was not updated so the ft1 couldn't work.  The 35mm DC f1.8 worked fine bur when I got home after work and put on the AFD 85mm f1.8, the AF was sloppy, hesitant and often failed.  Maybe the 85mm is too heavy for the FT1 to af? Funny thing is, when I tried a Tokina 20-35 ATX f2.8 on the NEX 5, no problem at all,  I got the V1 so I can have super telephotos but so far, it's not been that good. Sorry.
B005AUWXZ0|3.0|Movie was not as good as the first cars. I did enjoy some of the extras on the disc especially the toy story short
B0019N8P2W|4.0|MTV obviously made compromises to release this DVD set. As everyone knows, the original music is replaced by generic songs, and the 2 movies are the abbreviated versions that were designed to air as reruns on MTV. With that being said, I'm not going to argue whether or not MTV should have tried harder with this release. The fact is, it's a show that's been off the air for a decade that was never as mainstream as say, South Park, The Simpsons, or Family Guy. As fans we are lucky to finally have something of high quality, instead of the poor quality VHS rips or Censored-for-content \\"The N\\" versions that have been floating around on the internet for years.  The lack of the original music is disappointing - as someone who watched the originals when it was on MTV, and then watched the modified versions on this DVD set, I do notice the difference. The music did help pull the viewer in to a Late 90's/Early 2000's timeline. But, they honestly didn't do a horrible job with the replacement generic music, and new fans to the show would probably not even be aware of the change unless they did some research on the fan sites. As a compromise, go to a website like \\"Outpost Daria\\" and pull up the song lists from each episode and make a custom \\"Daria\\" playlist to listen to before or after watching the show.  With regards to the actual DVD release: The disc case seems a bit poorly made. The front plastic cover came a bit warped, causing the cover artwork to look distorted. Not a huge deal, because most of the time this is going to sit on the shelf wedged in between a bunch of other DVDs. The extra content is nice, although a bit minimal. It would have been nice to see more from the behind-the-scenes production of the show. But back in 1997 I doubt the staff even considered that some day people would be interested in seeing them work their day to day job on a bonus section of a video disc.  The only major problem I have with this release, is that the 2 movies are located on the last disc under extras. If you watch the series straight through, you will miss out on watching the movies in the proper order. The first movie, \\"Is it Fall Yet?\\" should be watched after the episode \\"Dye! Dye! My Darling.\\"  The last movie, \\"Is It College Yet?\\" should be watched after the last episode of the series, \\"Boxing Daria.\\" Even if they couldn't find a way around needing to squeeze the two movies on the last disc under extras, they should have at least included some type of note or warning for viewers who want to watch the series in order.  All in all, Daria was a great show that truly was unique, if not misunderstood by many. Despite the flaws of this DVD release, I feel that any fan of the show, whether new or old, should pick up a copy. And who knows - maybe in another ten years the music industry will have changed enough where the episodes with the original music can be re-released. I doubt MTV would pass up an opportunity to sell it to us again!

B006N9XHLQ|4.0|Fell head over heels in like with the first book in the series. As the series progressed and plots became more and more farfetched...I still remained a devoted fan. I'm a fan of the Jake Adrien dynamic and it rarely let me down...until this book. While the book and the characters are extremely interesting, the love affair between the dynamic duo is starting to become more of a liability to the plot by slowing down the pacing. We get it, adrien loves/hates Jake but jesus don't drag this mini plot through five different stories and only resolve it near the end of the series. By the end I just wanted to have that piece of the story all nicely resolved so I could stop hating the protagonist.  Also some dialogue...was really hammy. You'll know what I'm talking about when you reach that point.  Still, Adrien retains his charm and really isn't that what we enjoy about the book?

0439023521|3.0|This book has so many reviews, I didn't intend to write one. As it is, I'll skip the plot introduction and setup and go straight to my thoughts.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this book is a page-turner. Indeed, the same is true of the whole trilogy; I blew through all three books in a weekend. And it was a great ride. I liked Katniss well enough, and while I was reading I was certainly invested in the tale.<br /><br />In retrospect, though, this trilogy was compelling to me mostly because it's so fast-paced and action-driven. Not that that's the only thing it has going for it: Collins does a good job of developing the society, there are some intriguing plot elements and I liked the angle the book takes with the romance (in the first book, at least). And I liked that the book doesn't make out-of-place references to our current society or give infodumps on what happened between the modern day and its futuristic setting. But already, looking back on the trilogy I'm underwhelmed. So, a few of the problems:<br /><br />- The characterization is a bit iffy. I liked Katniss, but she didn't ever feel like a real teenager (except maybe in the third book). Peeta is sometimes sweet, but way too perfect. Gale seemed interesting, but we never saw much of him. The secondary characters aren't awful, but there just isn't much here that's memorable.<br /><br />- The premise seems specially created to give the characters serious moral dilemmas. Only, the book neatly avoids those dilemmas. The setup seems to require Katniss to kill basically nice people in order to survive.... the actual plot sidesteps that.<br /><br />- Speaking of the plot: a bit too gimmicky for my taste. I'd like less reliance on monsters and magical obstacle courses and such, and more conflict arising from the characters themselves. Your mileage may vary. The first book isn't too bad about this, but there's more and more of it as the trilogy continues.<br /><br />- And speaking of the setup. I simply never bought that forcing a couple dozen randomly-selected teenage (and younger) boys and girls to kill each other on national TV would be a good PR move for any government. Especially with all the efforts to humanize them--the pre-Games interviews, having viewers witness every moment of their struggles, strength and suffering, interviewing their families and friends, and so on. I bought that the Districts had to accept this because they were oppressed. I didn't buy the people in the Capitol thinking this was all good fun.<br /><br />- Finally, I could never figure out why, when there are so few people left in the world, they'd confine themselves to such small areas. District 12 only has 8000 people (the size of a small town) and seems to be the only settlement in all of Appalachia. So, why does everyone live within a fenced-in area as if this was a zombie book? Wild animals (the reason given in the book) didn't necessitate such a drastic response from either the Native Americans or the original European settlers, so I assumed it was a political ploy to keep the people under control.... but that didn't make a lot of sense either. With such abundant land and natural resources, why would the government want to keep the population small, starving and with little to lose when it could instead take credit for a growing population and improved standards of living as they made use of the surrounding area? And would controlling a wider area really be a problem for a government that already exercises such tight control over such vast distances? Presumably they're already capable of controlling it, or dissenters would just run off into the wilderness and create their own societies? This is simply never addressed.<br /><br />Anyway, this trilogy is entertaining enough, but if somebody asked me to recommend an exciting series about teenagers fighting a bad government, I'd recommend Marsden's Tomorrow series before I'd recommend this.nger) boys and girls to kill each other on national TV would be a good PR move for any government.

0385535139|5.0|What do you get when you cross a young, burned-out, corporate lawyer with two ham and egg, ambulance chasing, bickering street lawyers?  The result is John Grisham's thoroughly entertaining legal thriller, The Litigators.  The Litigators doesn't quite have the seriousness of purpose as The Pelican Brief or The Firm.  Still, this book deals with some serious issues and imparts some important lessons.<br /><br />David Zinc is a young, high-priced lawyer from one of Chicago's prestige firms, Rogan Rothberg.  Going to work one day, Zinc has a meltdown and when he arrives at his firm's lobby, he's seen diving head-first back into the elevator.  After spending all day drinking, he ends up directing a cab driver to an address he sees on an advertisement, the law firm of Finley and Figg.  Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are barely scratching out a living chasing ambulances and handling no fault divorces and DUIs.  Finley \\"was still married to his first wife, a terrifying woman he wanted to sue every day for his own divorce.  But he couldn't afford it.  After thirty-two years of lawyering, Oscar Finley couldn't afford much of anything.\\"  The younger Wally Figg struggles with alcoholism, has been divorced 4 times, and has more than a few DUIs under his belt.  Both lawyers took three tries to pass the bar.  The Harvard-educated Zinc begs for a job, and they offer him one at a ridiculously low salary.<br /><br />Figg has big dreams of a tort lawsuit with a big payout.  The firm gets a chance when one of his clients dies and his family claims his death was caused by the cholesterol drug, Krayoxx.  Figg files a $100 million lawsuit against the third largest pharmaceutical company, Varrick.  Yet the firm has never filed in federal court and has never appeared before a jury trial.  Varrick sees the Chicago-case as a weak link, and they decide to test the waters by going to trial against Finley and Figg.  The lawyers are so out of their league that it is a hoot, but Zinc tries to bring some sanity to this insane situation.<br /><br />The Litigators is funny, but there are some lessons to be learned here.  When something is too good to be true, it usually is and that it's possible to be too greedy.  Also, that despite good efforts, it's not always possible to change people--as Zinc tries to bring positive change to Finley and Figg.  We also learn that not all companies are sleazy and that some do own up to the damages caused by their product. You will also fall in love with unlikely hero, David Zinc, who learns more working for Finley and Figg than he ever did at Harvard Law.<br /><br />John Grisham is one of our best storytellers, and The Litigators will not disappoint.insane situation.

0525478817|5.0|BUY THE BOOK!  I'm not a writer per se, therefore any review I give it cannot do it justice. I honestly have no words to describes this book's absolute brilliance. Short and to the point, this book is easily on of the single best written of all time, a modern-day Shakespeare of sorts. As I said, I am not the most creative of people when it comes to writing, but if anything look at the sheer numbers: 1 person who voted 1 star (ZERO of 19 people finding it helpful), 3 people rating it 3 stars with very little support shown from others, 6 people giving it 4 stars, not bad, and the a whopping 213 and counting 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good good good game really like the gameplay easy to win the games one thing it is kinds.slow but overall a good game
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I consider myself a watch connoisseur. I have had a love for watches and for a long time; I thought that my watch love could only be given to Swiss watches. A week or so ago my friend tasked me to find him an awesome watch for $50-$150. I told him I would look, but I was skeptical that I would find one in that price range that I would consider awesome. I stumbled upon this watch on Amazon. I didn't think much of it because of the price and it was a Japanese movement. Well, then I started reading the reviews. There is almost a cult following behind this watch. It's crazy! So I started researching the Seiko 5 line, and everything I read was positive. I found this review on cheapwatchreview.com (youtube.com/watch?v=EaQdjp2vbaE) and I was sold. I told my friend about this watch and I bought one for myself. When it came in the mail, I was blown away by the simple beauty of the watch. Seiko didn't cut any corners making this watch. Seiko really is making a watch of the quality of a $400 watch for a fraction of the cost. For the cost, this watch gets my highest recommendation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is the best time waster. one of the best points is that you never need to put your own money to use every feature of the game. The second is that when they set a goal to get points it gives you a reason to play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game but it gets boring. I reaally liked it overall its addicting but then boring. etc
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really good game I enjoyed it. I recommend this to a lot of people. its really entertaining
B000ROALCG|5.0|highly recommend buying this.  very latin sounding.  authentic.  my wife is cuban and loves this album.  total enjoying this late night!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|One of the staples on my phone.  I love the widget too.  Perhaps the best free app of the day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun.  I love this game. I didn't have to download anymore games after I downloaded this game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great. Been a longtime fan of accuweather and was impressed how well this app is.  I make sure I have it installed on my devices. I wish I can install this on my GoogleTV but I had no luck.doing so. hopefully they will have one.
0691126887|4.0|I had only found a few problems with the text and maps, and I used this in conjuncture with a friends local guide to birds - the illustrations are amazing and accurate.  I did find that a few other poses would have been helpful, but then it wouldn't be a field guide, would it? Great size and weight, the book really held up to 4 months of abuse. I'm considering getting the guides to passerines as well.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The Help in its idea alone is perhaps one of the most original ideas to come along in recent film history. I mean to say, a movie based on the hardships and life of African-American female housemaids during the 1960s? Not only that, but their Caucasian house bosses and all the social borders, stigmas, prejadices and love that intermix. The Help stars a stellar cast who some by no surprise are up for 2011 Oscar nominations, not to also mention the film's Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the Year. A very well-deserved achievement.  The film takes us into a fairly well off suburban neighborhood during the 1960s, when the first few ripples of the civil rights movement was beginning, and how it affected the always strict relationship that these Caucasian homeowners had with their maids. The film stars the up and coming Emma Stone as Skeeter, the single, headstrong, and brave writer who is on a mission to write a book detailing all the stories of the African-American maids around the neighborhood, to create a piece from their own point of view. This of course causes much controversy as not only are the maids hesitant to take part, as doing so may cause them to get into heaps of trouble, as well as risk their ability to ever be hired again, but also frightens her Caucasion relatives and friends, as writing such a book would risk bringing a dramatic change to their comfortable and stable domineering relationship with their housemaids. Viola Davis and Octavian Spencer play 2 other housemaids with their own house bosses - the spoiled, trite and cruel 'Hilly' played by Bryce Dallas Howard and 'Celia' played entertainingly and adorably well as the bubbly and joyful yet strong new-girl-on-the-block by Jessica Chastain. Viola and Octavian put on Oscar-nominated performances and truly steal the show, bringing us humor, compassion and stellar wit to their characters. Their Oscar nominations are extremely well-deserved. Veteran actress Allison Janney plays the insecure and emotionally struggling mother of Skeeter, who is most on the fence about her firing of her oldest housemaid, struggling with her love and compassion vs. her social status.  The film brings shows us all the troubles and tribulations of the housemaids (there are others besides Viola and Octavia in more minor roles with their own homeowners played well by other supporting cast members), but not only that, the film also displays the tension between the Caucasian homeowners themselves, thus showing us that even though they are at a socially sigmatic position as the white \\"slave-drivers,\\" they do not embrace such a status, yet struggle to show as much compassion to their housemaids meanwhile maintaining the authority society tells them they must have.  Our star, Skeer (Emma Stone) encounters tension from both sides, as well as from her mother who can't stand to see her single anymore. She eventually begins her work with writing her book and things flair up from there.  What makes this such an incredible film is its love for the characters. Dialogue throughout is extremely precise in terms of dialect and tone, not to also mention interesting and very well written. The amazing performances only highlight this aspect, and we grow to love the characters through all their struggles. The most vital being 2 in particular - Skeeter's frustration with her family as the firing of their oldest maid to her is akin to the firing of her own mother (as the housemaid for the most part RAISED Skeeter herself), and Aibileen's (Viola Davis) struggles with overcoming the death of her son and all the scars that has left her in terms of virtually all Caucasians; she walks the line between humility and deeply embedded anger, meanwhile always walking in a state of ongoing sadness.  The drama with the homeowner side of things eventually grows as more of the comedic relief throughout the film, but the audience will be much more interested in how the housemaids overcome their side of things. If there was any flaw, I felt that towards the end, while the struggles with the White homeowner's relationships build to be more entertaining and not so much heartfelt, things felt a bit forced by the end, yet it never goes so far as to step over the line of unbelievability.  The pacing and editing in the film is spot-on, and even with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, you'll feel the need to watch this one again and again, simply because the setting, pacing and dialogue in the film is simply either too entertaining, passionate and soothing as a whole.  Lastly, for all the guys out there worried about their girlfriends or wives dragging them to see this one, please keep in mind that this is NOT a \\"Chick Flick.\\" Far from it. No, this is a realistic fiction (although based on the author's true life story) film about the struggles of people trying to live through an era where they were being both pushed down, intimidated, yet freed from years and years of segregation. Instead of this being a film displaying the civil rights movement as a whole (as in the film Malcom X), this scopes in on one suburban neighborhood, showing us what everyday people did to deal with the societal changes, and all the inner struggles as they now had to find a line between tradition and societal progression.  Overall a fantastic, heartwarming, gritty, and truely moving film.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very challenging but fun and soothing. I love this game.  l could. play it for hours. very interesting concept.
B0068MNO4S|1.0|This film should never have seen the light of day. It is the \\"Prince Tudor\\" theory which suggests that Elizabeth the 1st, widely considered the finest monarch in England's storied history, was nothing more than an empty-headed trollop  who could not keep track of where she'd farmed out her bastards. Most major critics recognized it for the tripe it was and reviewed it accordingly. Who am I to disagree with The Rolling Stone?  Try to avoid this if at all possible. Look away!For your own sake, look away!

1594200823|5.0|\\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is an eye-opening account of what our food system looks like today. He analyzes the various elements that have created the food chain that exists today, one where American's are so far removed from where their food is created, they don't even have the ability to understand what it is made of. Pollan hasn't created another frenetic meat-hating autobiography, but instead, he has presented all sides of the story for one to come up with their own decisions. He has crafted a memoir about the food industry -- one that will give you appreciation for every morsel you put in your mouth moving forward.  Read my full review at [...]
0198326769|5.0|When I saw how short this story was I figured I had nothing to lose by reading it. I finished it in two sittings because I hated to put it down. The author had me from the first mention of the 'Hopeless Case'.  I felt myself smiling as I read the first half of this book. Then it became more serious.  It seems logical to me that an innocent, sheltered 9 year-old boy in 1942 Berlin does not know what is happening in the world around him.  I'm lucky that I remember when JFK was assassinated, let alone all else that was happening in the world when I was 9.  I have read thousands of books, many of which I can't remember two days after I've finished reading them; this is NOT one of those books. I will never, ever forget this haunting story.  A wonderful, thought-provoking books for all ages.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|fun game when you are travelling and have no Internet connection.Really easy controls and the boards are really  interesting so 5 stars.
0307477479|3.0|There are many great reviews of this book on Amazon and while I can agree with many points stated by the reviewers who gave this book 4 or 5 stars, I found myself rushing through it after the first 150 pages. I really wanted to like this book. I was thinking about buying it for my fellow bookworms in my circle since it is the 2011 Pulitzer Prize winner in Literature. Alas, I became bored with the characters, their flaws, and the variety of voices (especially the Jules Jones chapter with footnotes.)There are many great insights on aging, self-destructive behaviors and loss but overall this is not a book that I would rush out and recommend to friends. Heck, I don't even care about keeping it on my bookshelf. I don't think I would even give it away just in case my friends think my taste in great literature has waned. I bought into the hype surrounding this book and I will chalk up all the accolades as hipster hype. Too bad. Congrats to Jennifer Egan on the many awards she received for this book but I am hopping of the bandwagon...
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. It allows me to write stories, poems, and songs. And when I need to link something, it shows up blue and underlined...unlike some other note apps I've tried. I can lock certain notes...and I have reminders, addresses, and such saved.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Great Artists, Great Songs, & Bringing back Carter Burwell was the smartest thing for the Saga as well!  There is such a variety of music artists on here, Bruno Mars would have been the last artist I would have envisioned for this soundtrack, but it all came together beautifully!
B002ZG975Q|5.0|Movie was well done and kept my interest throughout.  The characters were well-cast and fit the parts perfectly.  I highly recommend this movie!
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|love the cd shipper was very fast probably one of the fastest deliveries ive ever gotten just as described in the listing highly recommened
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I read the first book in this series and couldn't wait for this one to come out. When it did, I wasn't disappointed! This book is very good. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This is a great case for the kindle fire. works like it says, installs easily and it holds itself up without any problems.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|it is a great program with so many features. It helps me do so many different things. I love the design and look.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|definiteley read this book. i really liked it a lot. it had the perfect amount of humor and tradjety. i can assure you that all teens and most adults will enjoy this book (i have read it twice!)
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I am very pleased with the HDMI connector. It is very price but does an amazing job connecting my IPAD to my TV so I can watch movies, NBC apps and other Internet Videos. It does replace the APPLE TV. Also since I travel often I can watch my shows downloaded from my Tivo to the IPAD.
0670022705|5.0|I first bought this book after reading a review in the N Y Times. It seemed a perfect birthday present for my daughter. While she is a very hard working securities lawyer her undergraduate major was physical anthropology. After glancing through it I decided to buy a second copy for myself and later a Christmas present for my also hardworking son. He commented that he appreciates the way the book is divided into a few pages for each item, perfect for bedtime reading. All of us find it fascinating and particularly enjoy how the artifacts are from all over the world.  The book contains beautiful pictures so even if you heard the original BBC4 series you may wish to purchase the book to see the artifacts described.
B00005JO5L|5.0|This Al Pacino doing what he does making us believe he is the person he is playing very true to the book, and if you haven't read the book your missing a great ride the end shows you that there is a new killer in town but you have to pay attention. A suspense filled edge of your seat movie.  Just when you think you know whats going on you realize your wrong.  And it shows what was really going on in the 70's in New York.  As a Gay man from that time let me tell you it only scratches the surface of what was really going on in New York at the time.  I highly recomend you read the book after you watch the movie.(Like most books it lets you into the mind of the people involed.) It's a good story about a serial killer, who happens to be gay.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app works great on my kindle fire and aneroid phone ( sanding galaxy ) ! You should try it this is a very good app manager it doesn't delete your apps it kills the memory from after you use them!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|It was a good production. I loved watching it in my home, good quality, could dance and sing along, and not wait for intermissions.  Worth the money, great for younger folks who never experienced this play on the stage years back, really can't be redone as exceptional as the original run.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|****THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE BLU RAY EDITION****  This film is one of my all time favorites of Alfred Hitchcock. This has to be the best black and white film i have seen on Blu ray so far. The quality is phenomenal! In the scene where Marion is driving her car in the rain, i actually had the sensory reaction to be worried about getting wet! I am so glad i updated to Blu ray on this one. Some films on Blu ray are disappointing...not this one!
B001NLKT60|3.0|I LOVED the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  The mystery was engaging enough to keep me reading and not ever wanting to put it down.  From the very start, The Girl Who Played with Fire was pretty much a let down when compared to the first.  The story line is just not as engaging.  It doesn't have that \\"drive you to madness until I know the answer\\" mystery of the first.  Hope the next one is better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game Is a really good game, works just fine on kindle fire. I think everyone would enjoy this ap!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I loved this movie!!!  My husband couldn't understand what all the fuss was about until \\"he\\" saw it with me!  He loved all of it!  I only wish that Christine would have chosen the Phantom in the end!!!  That somehow he would have made a perfect life with her!  Wow... I sure would have!  I too cannot stop thinking of all the scenes (especially with the phantom in them)and of course the beautiful music.  Gerard Butler was the perfect Phantom...just someone to fall in love with in my dreams!  The entire cast is superb...  everything was!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|responsive controls and a leveling system make for many hours of good wasted time. Old school games are the best!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|It's the Old Wild West and locals are putting aside their conflicts to battle the \\"demons\\" or what we would call aliens. Seems that the aliens want gold just like us humans and they're high tech is mining it while they abduct people to figure out their weaknesses. There's an actual story in here which I appreciate and some of the characters are beyond the typical archetypes but the focus is really on the action with meaty fistfights, lots of gunslinging, saloon drinking, fights on horse back and, of course, aliens with high tech and aliens that are gigantic compared to humans and move at an incredibly fast pace. How will the humans win? What's going to happen? Well, you know what's going to happen but it's all in good fun so don't act too surprised. A fun flick that has some intelligence to it, starring Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde (13 from HOUSE M.D.). Loosely based on a graphic novel by the same title. The budget was roughly $163M but as of October the Box Office yield has only been a bit over $140M. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B; WESTERN SETUP/FLAVOR: B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B
B0030IIYYS|4.0|Ok, not as good as 1 or 3 but pretty good and another facet to explore in a toy's story.  Woody's arm rips off a bit and it becomes apparent that he's getting old.  Kidnapped from a rummage sale where he is accidentally placed, Woody ends up with a toy seller and discovers his forgotten history, He is a character from a 1950's TV puppet show.  His old compatriots are introduced and they learn that they will be sold to a toy museum in Japan.  What is better?  Being preserved in a museum in Japan or being Andy's toy?  What will Woody and his new friends choose?
B005FITIK0|1.0|I'm not kidding. Cody wrote this movie for the trailer, all the funny parts are found in the trailer. Again another movie with no story, the protagonist doesn't change from beginning to end, she's despicable in the beginning, in the middle and in the end. I didn't have any sympathy for her, I didn't relate to her. I found her to be a self-indulgent, spoiled pathetic one dimensional. What was the point of even making this visual monstrosity? Since I don't watch the idiot box I'm not used to vapid meaningless visuals that pass for stories these days...
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Simply put, awesome! Adele has now put out, in my opinion, two of the strongest albums in recent memory and her Sophomore effort \\"21\\" actually surpasses the first. Adele has an amazing voice, of which much has already been said, but I think her songwriting is even more impressive than her voice. A must have!
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|Not writing a review--like the other reviewer don't want to waste anymore of my time. Frankly even if I wanted to write a review it was so forgettable, that well I forgot it. It's a great movie for insomniacs, I do remember that. Just rating it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I can credit this film in making me a fan of Jane Austen. I had seen other films produced from her work previous to my first seeing this but none of them had ever made me want to go and read the original novel until this. I quickly became a thorough fan of Ms. Austen's work. This is a lovingly crafted telling of what I think is her best work. The cast is perfect, it is beautifully shot, and the script is very true to the spirit of the book. I have since seen other filmed versions of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but it is this one that I continue to come back to. My advice is to book yourself a quiet weekend day (it's LONG - approx 5 1/2 hours), snuggle up on the couch, and sit back and enjoy!
1451627289|4.0|Ive read many of Stephen King's novels, but this has to be up with his best. He makes traveling back in time come alive. I was a young adult in this period covering Kennedy's assassination;this book brought me back to that time. Reading it was like being there. But the story is much more than about JFK, it is also a very romantic and tender love story that spans over 50 year. It's a long book and hard to get into it at first, especially the premise of time travel. But after the first several chapters, he succeeds. His story line is backed up by impressive research such as contacting noted presidential historian Doris Goodwin regarding the possibilities if JFK were not assassinated. To what extent he took her advice I don't know but doubt King ever took it. His version of what could have happened is the one criticism I would have about the story. Of any plausible prediction of the future after Dallas, I would put his as the least likely and most questionable. Fortunately, this did not detract from enjoying the book on whole, but it did make for a major disappointment in an otherwise absorbing tale and prevented me from rating it 5 stars.
0821221841|5.0|I am by no means an accomplished or experienced photographer but I enjoy taking pictures of my surroundings. In particular, nature and architecture. I got \\"The Camera\\" because I figured that if I wanted to pick up some tips on nature photography than I may as well learn from the master. If you shoot digital than there are parts of the book that aren't particularly useful but it is still very interesting to learn a bit about how Ansel Adams produced all of those amazing pictures. If you are interested in photography at all as an art form than I highly recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very nice app. it provides 101games in just one app. i spended a long time playing it
B005HSL626|5.0|this app is amazing and i have not had abyss problems at all.the app is addictive. this app could not get any better. my friends play it every toke they see me with my kindle.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|it is a great app but it wont let me create an account. so I really cant do anything on it which really is frustrating cuz I cant use the app that I have downloaded. but other than that it is really resourceful and really helps me understand the Bible instead of just reading it daily and not knowing what the heck it is saying.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great game to play. My wife and I play it all the time. Pretty much the old standard version. It is fun to play as the original was. Its a must have game if you are prone to like the original.

B006GG1KOC|4.0|Opposites games are really good for kids to learn various objects, got this as free app of the day, and our toddler enjoyed it! Only gripe is the visuals are just okay, but it's still a great learning tool, and fun for kids to pass the time!
0071373586|1.0|I wish I had known that this book was first published in 1981. If you look at the publishing date in the book it says copyright 2001, I think this is misleading. And talk about dated information. If you're looking for info on social networking, internet marketing or anything newer than 30 years ago, forget about this book.

B00005M989|1.0|Here's the best example of throwing the egg straight at the consumer's face! WB continues to cook up half brained and last minute money making schemes on the public by releasing half ass products. This particular and unnecessary Prince collection is a brazen example of why he left WB. Roll back to 1993 when Prince was fighting over his publishing rights with WB and the beginning of the end. Prince had unreleased material he wanted to publish and WB put that on the backburner for their Bsides collection. This collection formed the 3 disc set and in the fall of 1996 WB released the Ultimate collection with a second disc of maxi singles originally available back in the day on vinyl only. Push forward a few years and now this dumb collection of music already made available twice in its edited format! The only thing that sets this one apart is the album cover and that's about it. A reviewer asked before as to why The Most Beautiful Girl In the World was omitted since it was another number 1?! The answer is somewhat confusing since TMBGITW was originally released under another record label (Bellmark records) back in 1994. The reason for this was because Prince and WB were now on a full battle over several issues. In return WB accused Prince of hiding hit material from them.  The single TMBGITW was added to the 1995 WB album The Gold Experience (now out of print thanks to WB)in order to boost sales to an album that WB didnt think was going to sell. They were also not that interested in promoting anything by Prince and they continued this trend with Chaos and Disorder released in 1996 with little promotion and ending Prince's contract with the company. A true collection of Prince music would take about 5 or 6 discs since his output has not only been amazing,profound but prolific. The music from the Batman Soundtrack 1989 will never be issued on any of these collections because WB made Prince give up those publishing rights when they bought DC Comics. The only song he retained rights to was Scandalous and that's the reason why it appears on some collections. It's a pitty that WB has yet to show its appreciation and respect to both Prince and the MILLIONS of fans that made millions of dollars for them. I doubt we will ever see a remastering of his WB catalog anytime soon but we can always hope or start a campaign to do?!!! It's about time and speaking of time, WB has forbidden The Time and The Family from touring the country using their actual band names! Gee, could this get any worse??? By the way, Did you know The Family has a new album and the under the name FDeluxe or that The Time are now known as The Original Seven? Or how about Brenda Bennette of Apollonia and Vanity 6...she has a new wonderful album available for 2012! Check them out!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had this book on my 2nd Gen Kindle but had not read it yet.  When my DH got the Fire for me for Christmas I was amazed to see all of my books from the 2nd Gen appear on my new Fire.  When I saw Hunger Games I thought I'd give it a try.  WOW!  I was captivated!  I read the first book and was so glad that I could immediately download the 2nd and begin reading right away.  I ended up reading all 3 books between 12/25 and 1/8.  I thought this was a very interesting series.  I'm not usually into the Sci-Fi genre, which I guess this would be, but I loved these books.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games are simple in nature but good to pass the time.  Some require more thought.  Includes some generic versions of the classics like snake, galaga.  Also has more logic related like Sudoku.
B003F3NDP8|4.0|This season of \\"Housewives\\" is by no means their best season; with a good blue print for a mystery, they did not fully execute the story. However, I did enjoy the majority of it.  Drea De Mateo is underused, and should have been held on to longer than just a \\"one season wonder\\" I'm assuming that that was out of ABC's control, so I cannot hold that against them. The new packaging of this 5-Disc set is not as bad as most are complaining about. I'll put it this way, they could have used the \\"slim packs\\" in which case, I would tend to agree, but that's besides the point. Is season 6 of \\"Housewives\\" as addicting or intriguing as season one? No. Is it still a guilty pleasure that you can enjoy on a rainy saturday morning? Yes. I enjoyed season six & have bought all the seasons thus far.
B005SAZFWK|5.0|The first half of the movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen. The second half is fairly depressing but,because of the first, this is one of my new all time favorites. I think it's one of those movies you'll either love or hate but, if you enjoy dry indie films, you should love it. Unsure? \\"Dear Jordana, thank you for letting me explore your perfect body. I could drink your blood, you're the only person I would allow to be shrunken down to a microscopic size and swim inside me in a tiny submersible machine. we've lost our virginity but it wasn't like losing anything. You're too good for me, you're too good for anyone. Sincerely, Oliver.\\"
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|I was instantly addicted to this teen soap melodrama. I'll start off by saying that I have not read the books. That being said, this show is not \\"amazing\\" or  \\"incredible\\". It is what it is & it doesn't take itself too seriously. What this show is is pure fun. Suspenseful, addicting, my guilty pleasure. While this show might not be everybody's cup of coffee, this show will please those who are fond of the (young) mystery genre.  Some content might raise a few parents' eye brows, but let's be honest, it was never meant for \\"family friendly viewing\\".
B006HH5Y6K|5.0|This CD is worthwhile as it is a reissue of the [[ASIN:B000002KP3 Reprise CD mastered in the 1980s]] with the artwork reproduced, front and back, with more dynamic sound than later remasters of the album including the [[ASIN:B00005NWZ2 30th Anniversary Edition issued in the UK]], even though the UK remaster linked and the [[ASIN:B00008A7QK Rhino remaster]] have bonus tracks and being supervised by Tony Visconti (in the case of the UK remaster, not the Rhino which was done by Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch), this CD has the album in very lifelike sound quality, even though it did NOT come from the master tapes.  The UK remaster is very heavily compressed to the point that the dynamics are virtually non-existent unlike this CD.  Good job to Rhino for putting this mastering of the album back in print.
B005KAH7QU|1.0|It was intriguing at first, but as the movie went along it was terrible.  It made me sick to watch this young girl create such violence. The other problem was that it was hard to really root for her because the plot didn't connect you with the actress, such as in good movies where you're really cheering the good guy on---I never knew who was the good guy or who was the bad guy.  Would definitely NOT recommend this movie to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game i play every day just wish it would be easier to get points. its a good game for all ages and very challenging
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My problem with a lot of the covers and cases out there was that they were all so big and seemed difficult to clean.  This one fits like a glove and protects the Kindle without adding extra bulk or weight.  It's very easy to wipe off if it gets wet or dirty.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|There are quite a few games that are good in this app I play this when I'm bored and it can be very fun to unlock more stuff.
B001U0HBPG|1.0|I really couldn't find any point to this movie. There is no plot to it. I just don't see the point of it. What were the producers trying to convey? I love movies with psychological twists. You know, those types of movies that take you into a world of possibilities. Besides the reverse aging idea, I can't think of anything that stands out from this movie. I can't even see myself watching this movie again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|to pass the time. could use work. but if you reveiw you get points. good overall game for all ages.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Gets very fast, very soon. Fun, but not a lot of variety. Lower end graphics. Make sure you have two fingers ready!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Loved the movie!  It reminds me of \\"The Goonies\\" Very action packed! It will keep you on the edge of your seat!
B000ICLRIE|1.0|The reason why I through this movie in the garbage.<br /><br /> Parading a man beaten and handcuffed looking like Jesus Christ on a donkey in front of an army of Muslim soldiers. This movie contradicts what the muslim bible teaches. This movie also portrays Christians as evil and muslims as good. They never showed muslims killing innocent people who wont convert in the name of Alah but portrayd Christians as the evil \\"occupiers\\" and bandits. Islam means to submit, that I am not willing to do.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I made this purchase even after some people were saying it's not the same controller as the one that comes with the PS3. After getting it and using it I can't tell which one is which. It is the same controller as the one from the factory and works great
031261246X|4.0|Suddenly, for no apparent reason, an airliner drops from the sky. The pilot is able to pull the plane out of its spin and bring it safely to land. Elsewhere, an atomic reactor begins to run out of control. Financial systems around the world find difficulties in transacting business. A virulent virus has been released into cyberspace and is propagating itself across the planet. Enter Jeff Aiken, erstwhile government government analyst who thinks there is something more afoot than mere cyber mischief. Written by Mark Russinovich, a global security expert for Micosoft, \\"Zero Day\\" poses a chilling \\"what if\\" question to a world so completely reliant on computers and so openly vulnerable to cyber terrorism. Extremely well written, this piece of fiction is a must read for anyone who has any knowledge of computers and the awesome power of the internet.

0312641893|4.0|Cinder: Book One in the Lunar Chronicles is a truly imaginative retelling of the classic Cinderella fairytale.  Cinder is a cyborg - as such she has limited rights.  However, she has a talent which buys her a little more freedom than what she would normally have had.  She can fix things.  Mechanical things.  This talent is abused by her guardian, who keeps Cinder working at the marketplace in order to pay the bills.  It is just this abuse of her talent at the marketplace that allows her to meet the handsome Prince Kai.  But it also brings her into contact with the deadly plague.  Soon her stepsister is infected, Cinder is captured and readers are wondering if her friendship with Prince Kai can save her.  Throw a bunch of truly evil aliens into the mix and you've got a page-turning adventure.  Author Marissa Meyer has done a marvelous job of creating a truly original story inside the trappings of a classic fairytale. Her characters shine with realism, and the plot's twists and turns will keep readers glued to the page and guessing at the outcome until the very end.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Flawless game. Very addictive. Superb graphics. I would recommend this game. So many levels. Some levels really challenge you. Timing is essential. Not for kids who like to tap everywhere.  -HTC EVO 3D.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Seller was priced very reasonably. Delivery was super fast. Product was perfect. Personal childhood favorite at Christmas time in England, years ago.Evoked just the same special feeling 25 years + later!!!  I am so glad that I bought two, one to share with a dear friend and her family.
0749942010|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this novel but I found quite boring and it took me ages to finish it!!What can I say maybe I expected too much and it usually goes like that, the book can never reach my expectations in the end. And writing to her sister ok explaining the story but I found myself jumping lines because I was so bored..Anyway fortunately it seems that most people found it interesting so it cant be that bad..
B0041I0N9A|5.0|Is a very good product. As a nice decorative detail to a larger size is a good product. The disadvantage of the white brick discoloration problems.
B00498XP1K|5.0|My zombie bar is set high, but Dead Set far exceeded my expectations, especially for a television miniseries. A worldwide zombie outbreak has left the contestants on the UK Big Brother reality show oblivious to the horrors outside, and safe (for the moment) in their locked down \\"house\\" on a studio lot. Contestants consist of the cliched personalities typical of these shows: the dumb jock, the blonde Barbie, the sassy gay guy, the creepy outcast, etc. The series is a perfect blend of suspense, horror, and comedy. Yes, comedy. The scenes between the loathsome producer, Patrick, and Pippa, the unbelievably stupid Big Brother contestant, will have you laughing out loud.<br /><br />The survivors eventually need to make a decision: do they stay trapped in the house that is at least somewhat secure, despite the hungry zombies massing outside the studio gates, or do they make a run for it, not knowing where to go or how far the infestation has spread? Not surprisingly, the group has differing opinions, and a couple of idiotic moves with catastrophic consequences, forces their hands. As the outbreak catches up to our survivors, you will be rooting for some to escape, and hoping that others (Patrick and Pippa come to mind) become zombie food.<br /><br />As the zombie attacks started halfway through the first episode, I started to worry a bit that all of the dark lighting and quick edits were a sign of very cheap special effects. Not too worry though - things really picked up by episode 2 and stayed that way to the end, so stick with it!<br /><br />And speaking of the end....just WOW. It was absolute perfection.
0792162803|5.0|My dvd arrived soon after I placed the order. I am happy with their service and would buy from them again.

B005LJITS0|1.0|This movie could of been great. Early press of the movie sounded interesting.<br /><br />But here's the low down. How do you make a good Green Lantern movie? First, don't hire Ryan Reynolds. Hire Nathan Fillion. Second, the core story of Green Lantern can be translated as Training Day In Space.<br /><br />This movie was a total fail, and this comes from a big Green Lantern fan
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I have shopped online and in stores for a Kindle case with not much success with the styles. I have found my \\"Happy\\" with this one!  Love, Love, Love it!

B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is thrilling end to the filming of a masterpiece series of books by one of the most wonderful authors in the world.  It is both thrilling and sad to have this series come to an end, but end it does and in the most awsome way.  J.K. Rowling has given us an amazing ride through the world of Harry Potter and leaves us wishing for more.  Loved every moment of the entire series.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time on my sisters phone. However, I can not buy things on my kindle fire. So could you make this the free game of the day sometime?? It would be awesome!!!!! I would love to have this on my kindle!!!
B00005K3NR|5.0|Another great horror film of the 1970's. Sissy Spacek's portrayal of a girl with a talented power is amazing to say the least. Other cast member's include a very young John Travolta, Karen Allen, P J Soles, and Amy Irving. These stars in turn became successful actor's after this film. But the main star in this film is Piper Laurie who portray's the mother of Carrie. Piper Laurie brings a wealth acting talent to her role in this film. If Carrie would ever ask me to the prom, I would say yes in a minute. Because in the end, I would go home ALIVE!!!.
B005TTEFRG|5.0|so damn gory love this movie way better in blu-ray then sd lots of boobs that about sums it up
B0006GVJEE|5.0|A very young Natalie Portman star's in this film of love and death. If he wanted to Leon could be a father. But because of his background, that form of career will take a backseat to what he really does for a living. A believe me , he is a better assassin than a role model. Maybe Natalie's character say's differently. But this is a very good film. Jean Reno who plays the assassin, is remarkable to say the least. Leon may not know how to read, but man can he KILL!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|challenging and fun with helps when you get stumped.  have to earn the helps by successfully completing puzzles. works great!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app because it keeps track of where I am in my devotional. I can get reminders and even accountability emails. The greatest thing is having a ton of translations at your fingertips. If I don't understand it in the KJV I can switch it to the NIV and back again. I love it.
B000088E6D|5.0|Great voice.  Nice background music.  Michael has a wonderful voice and engergy.  Its so nice to hear a young person who can really sing.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Misspent.Command ++  Missile defender is an update on the classic formula and well worth the price! It adds feature such as upgrading your defensively capabilities and rebuilding your destroyed buildings. The best part is the touch interface, which suits this type.of game very well.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Hearing this album always brings me back. My brother had this album when I was a kid and he'd play it every morning when I was a 6-year-old getting ready for school. It was the beginning of what remains my personal favorite lineup of Yes- Jon Anderson's unique vocals and spiritual lyrics, Chris Squire's melodious and loud bass (not to mention his harmonies were a great match for Anderson), Steve Howe's versatile guitar work, Bill Bruford's jazz-flavored drums and then-newcomer Rick Wakeman's incredible keyboard orchestra. It was also the debut of Roger Dean's artwork with Yes. He designed a ready-to-fall-apart planet on the cover and some cool paintings which would grace the photo book. Some of the classic rock stations here in the USA just aired an episode of In The Studio With Redbeard, which featured this classic. And of course, one of my favorite scenes in School Of Rock is that where the father of one child holds up a CD copy of Fragile and asks \\"How is this music supposed to help my son?\\" Read on and you may understand.<br /><br />It all begins with one of Yes' 1st big hits \\"Roundabout,\\" an 8-minute tour de force, with features Steve's classical guitar work and the lyrics speak of a trip Yes took in a car through Scotland with roundabouts and mountains that came out of the sky. Next is the 1st of the \\"personal ideas\\" quilogy- Rick's \\"Cans And Brahms,\\" a short but sweet take on the 3rd movement of Brahms' 4th and final symphony. This has my vote as the most innovative of the \\"personal ideas\\"- one friend of mine said he was playing this and his father (no fan of rock music) found it interesting. Following it is Jon Anderson's \\"We Have Heaven\\"- the most fun of the \\"personal ideas.\\" Jon uses several vocal tracks singing \\"Tell the moondog, tell the march hare\\" (whatever that means) and then sings in high tenor \\"We have heaven\\" and later \\"Yes, he's here\\" (the moondog or the march hare?) and a few other things until a door slams on Jon's multi-choir piece and you canhear someone walking away. \\"South Side Of The Sky\\" speaks of an excursion in Antarctica \\"Were we ever colder on that day, a million miles away.\\" Wakeman has an exquisite piano solo in the middle. Getting to side 2 of Fragile (on the LP, that is), Bill does a brief 16 bar track \\"5% For Nothing,\\" supposedly a tongue in cheek jab at the negotiations set up, so this has my vote as the most sarcastic of the \\"personal ideas.\\" The music sounds like something you'd hear right before a commercial break in a talk show. Next is Jon's spiritual \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" with a lengthy jam session between Rick and Steve and Chris and Bill join in. Chris' \\"The Fish\\" segues into it, where Chris adds a number of bass tones and plays his instrument like a lead guitar, the most popular of the \\"personal ideas\\" since it gets the most airplay. And don't ask me what \\"Schindeleria Praemataurus\\" means. Steve has the final and most exquisite \\"personal idea\\" with a classical guitar piece called \\"Mood For A Day.\\" It inspired me to learn it on guitar. Concluding Fragile (well, almost...) is a mindblowing finale \\"Heart Of The Sunrise,\\" Jon's ode to the environment. There is some fine duelling between Chris and Bill (with Rick and Steve later joining in, think the opposite of the mini-jam session in \\"Long Distance Runaround\\") at the intro before Jon's voice mixes between soft and attention grabbing. \\"Love comes to you and you follow. Lose one onto the heart of the sunrise. Sharp distance.\\" Then as the final notes chime (after 10.5 minutes of jumping between G sharp minor and B flat minor), it ends fast and furious. Don't get up and change the record (or CD or tape) just yet. Listen for a reprise of Jon's \\"We Have Heaven.\\"<br /><br />So there you have it- 5 solo pieces and 4 tracks of pure musical teamwork that has hardly ever been repeated in musical history.
0156012197|1.0|My husband bought this \\"classic\\" to include in our home library for our grandsons.  Surprisingly, neither of us had ever read it.  I picked it up, hoping to be charmed.  After 48 pages, I was shaking my head.  Yes, the king was amusing with his political theory of contributory rule, but not for a child.  The story of a geographer who never went anywhere would also not mean much to a ten year old.  I continued reading with my young grandsons in mind and know without a doubt that they would describe this book as \\"dumb\\" or \\"boring.\\"  I am mystified by all the rapturous praise I have read here on Amazon about this book (translation irritations notwithstanding).  I am troubled by this kind of breathless panting over books that the illuminati have declared \\"wonderful\\" (Frantzen's CORRECTIONS comes painfully to mind) and the rest of us stand back and swallow our words \\"but the Emperor has no....\\"

B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game.  It plays best on the kindle fire but even on my little Motorola ATRIX screen it is very playable.  I highly recommend this game.  Well done!
B004FOA84A|3.0|this game was fun but much to short. I finished it in just a couple hours. I love these detective type games and have played all the games amazon offers. it had good graphics and music was fine too. there was a couple of times I wish there was a hint button but I made it through ok. worked real good on my kindle fire no problems. glad it was only 99cents. would have been mad if it cost anymore than that bc its so short. 3stars for the short game.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Really enjoyed the puzzles but want more.  Even if it's another story.  Could be a bunch of stories that get progressively tougher.  Sorry it's over!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Please stop the complaining about this trilogy not  being the  \\"originals\\"-this is BY FAR the best looking bluray  transfer I've seen on 30+ year old films yet, not forgetting the Ten Commandments and the Wizard of Oz. The  colors from the  laser cannons on the star destroyer pop out at you and are very vivid on bluray and you can see every scratch on C3PO'S  costume. Quit your complaining and watch your grainny dvd's then.
B005K17RU0|4.0|No problems loading it on the kindle.  Great and easy app that will help with our upcoming driving trip through Ireland.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game to play. Like having to earn points to proceed and that there are extra rewards to earn to keep playing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Beware...This game is very addicting! This is a great game for people who get bored easily and want something challenging.
B005TOW9JM|5.0|Some of the reviewers seem to accidentally bought this album thinking it was Cross. I hope they are able to utilize the Search feature more effectively next time.  Can't say enough about this album. Though it goes against a lot of things we learned about JUSTICE from Cross, Audio, Video, Disco is a masterpiece in it's own right.  Pro tip: To get the full experience, listen to the album from beginning to end.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game is pretty confusing overall,not the best game but its not the worst.Decent arcade teaser. You should probably download the game.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. I got it for the kindle fire and it's a great and fun way to pass some time. The variety in games keeps it from getting monotonous and its pretty easy to earn points. The games are easy to get a grasp of and remind me of the old stark style games with their simplicity. Would definitely recommend it, especially since it's free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I wish the points were more easily attained. But over all it is a fun game. I recommend it to people that would like an easy way to beat the boredom! It keeps me occupied well enough.
0689878451|5.0|I was 13 when the school bus driver said that she would \\"kill\\" her son if he \\"turned out gay.\\" I was so confused. I went home and asked my mother who sighed, sat down, and said she's been wondering how long it would take me to figure out that some people had a problem with gay people. In my mid-30s I still don't get it. I mean, I grasp that this is a fact of life (at this point in time), but I just cannot figure out why or how. If every little kid grew up reading this- nothing preachy, just totally normal and positive about something totally normal and positive- really people? who doesn't love love???- the world would be a better place. Plus it manages to be a completely charming book instead of a book for the purpose of sending an important social message. I bought it to save for my as-yet-non-existent children.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Fantastic in every sense.  The storyteller's imagination is boundless and life affirming.  I fell in love with Pi, as wonderful a character as you are likely to meet in life or pages.  He is so full of love and wonder, as a child and later as a man, I couldn't resist him.  Clever, sly and exuberant, his respect and affection for the animals in his world, his inclusive spiritual impulses and his joy for living all combine to delight.  And that's just the character.  The story is so unexpected and fantastical, in turns harrowing, brutal, sorrowful and joyess ... it just doesn't get any better than this. Hold onto your hats and jump in for a wild ride.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a captivating drama thriller film centered on solving the Vanger Family secrets.  Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist and magazine co-owner who is disgraced by a dubious unfavourable court ruling, but despite negative headlines he is hired by Henrik Vanger, after a process of meticulous due diligence, to try and solve the disappearance of Henrik's niece Harriet whilst masquerading as writing Vanger memoirs.  Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is presented as a highly troubled young adult, but is actually a talented investigator with special computer hacking and research skills. Her demeanour is icy cold and at times vicious, yet this is simply a shield of protection from the abuse she has suffered. At first Blomkvist learns of her as a faceless person who hacked into his life at the request of Henrik Vanger's security advisor, yet Salander and Blomkvist come together as research partners. The mystery of Harriet becomes their project and they uncover the shocking truth at the risk of their own safety.  Rooney Mara gives an explosive performance as Lisbeth Salander, and Daniel Craig is warm yet quite steely as Mikael Blomkvist. The entire cast present unique and convincing characters.  The film is at times graphic and contains themes which may dislodge some viewers from their seat, with a sensational narrative that engages the viewer in a search for the truth.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B005HSG3TC|2.0|I hadn't had this cover for more that two weeks before the grey finish on the shell portion started to peel off.  While this cover is light and seems to provide adequate protection, I was very disappointed in how quickly the case began to deteriorate.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|best movie of 2011. more heart than the fighter, amazing fight sequences, excellent acting and a great soundtrack. had a chance to see this at an ESPN screening and couldn't believe the amount of teary eyes at the amazing climax.
0143119680|5.0|I love this book so much I want to marry it and have its babies. Scratch that. I want to marry Matthew Clairmont and have HIS babies. Even if he is a vampire and can't procreate...or can he?? Hmmmm...  I cannot rave about this book enough. It was so well-crafted, the characters were rich and so real to me - even if some of them were demons and vampires - that I felt as though I could reach out and touch them. Being a practicing witch myself, I was even able to let go of the \\"We can't really do that!\\" thoughts when Diana would perform magick.  To say I am obsessed with this book would be an understatement. I have told everyone I come across how wonderful this book is. I cannot wait for the second one now.  I read a review where it was pointed out that we got to see too much of the mundane activities the characters did. For me, those things placed me in the scenes with the characters. I felt as though I was right there with them, seeing what they saw, feeling what they felt, hearing and even smelling what they heard and smelled. It made them real, it made them tangible.  This book is absolutely amazing and admittedly, I am so jealous of the writer. I wish I could craft something this brilliant!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|There are many Bible apps out there but this is one of the best.  Works really well on the Kindle fire.
0525478817|5.0|This review is hardly a review, but more of a praise. This book is just hauntingly beautiful. It just feels like every word of every sentence was carefully contemplated to insure that its reader felt everything the characters felt. I apologize for the lack of eloquence, but honestly, this is just one of those books that is destined to be read in high school English classes for the next 50 years. This book is important.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an ok game, glad I didn't spend money on it though. I have an update for it but after reading the reviews there is no way I am going to update them.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the best solitaire we've played - hands down.  This is thought provoking and a challenge.  Would recommend this to all.
0525478817|5.0|John Green may be a genius. Scratch that, he IS a genius. Never has an author been able to pack so much into one novel, you'll be laughing one second and then in tears the next. I think that this is to par with his first and in my opinion best novel (based off true events) Looking for Alaska. For those of us who are aware of the events of Esther Earl, this will bring back memories of the lost but not forgotten beloved Nerdfighter.  This star will not go out.
0071762345|5.0|I just finished Dave Kerpen's book and have to say it surprised me. I went into it considering myself quite social media savvy but after seeing how Kerpen tweaks even the most simple concepts so as to be more engaging I can see I still have a lot to learn. My favorite part of the book was that it applies to any size business and as someone with an interest in a neighborhood pub I can assure you it truly does. I recommend this book for anyone looking to improve their social media presence.
0439023513|2.0|Finished this book last night.  I was disappointed in the character development in this book.  Katniss just seemd like a vehicle for the author to share her views on war.  Katniss is absent and Ms. Collins is now here.  Where did the main character go?  Mostly she is sleeping, hiding, recovering, etc and not part of the story.  I found it hard to imagine how someone could be the face of the rebellion who was not around much.  Lastly, her and Peeta suffer from PTSD and eventually carve out a life together.  The End.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This movie has such a sweet story of love and sacrifice as well as some great humor. I was so happy to finally find it on dvd.
B004LWZW24|4.0|This movie is scary, but there is no blood shed although there is some blood.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.  Insidious held my interest throughout even though I found myself scoffing.  I couldn't help but wonder if this movie had been done several times before.  The plot seemed to borrow the same formulas we saw in countless other thrillers like, \\"What Lies Beneath\\", \\"Poltergeist\\" and \\"Paranormal Activity\\".  A child goes into a coma, but we soon discover its not a coma and more that he's got the gifts of astral projection and just travelled away too far where evil lurks.  A family moves into a home only to move out into another home because the mother senses there is something evil in that house.  Only problem is that whatever the evil is has followed them to the new home.  I always wondered how easy it would be to simply pick and move again if one felt dread in a house you just bought.  Her husband who is a teacher and has never worked late a day in his life, but is suddenly working late every night and she notices.  So do we.  This serves no purpose except to get him out of the house long enough so she can experience the evil and he can come home and tell her she's crazy.  Then there is a ghostbuster medium (think back to Poltergeist).  She almost gives this couple the same speech as the Medium in Poltergeist did about the whereabouts of their child and who is with it and why.  Still, regardless of all the obvious cliche's I enjoyed watching this.  It was fun, creepy and the cast does a well enough job that it feels believable and almost too real.  This makes for a fun scary night, but don't expect Shakespeare.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app offers far more than any other.  It's my absolute favorite.  I use it in chuch and I love the reading plans.
B001E45XT4|5.0|These work way better then the 30 dollar set of Logitech usb headset i was using before this, Like other have said i have a big head i wear a 3 xl atv helmet and have to remove the padding from the sides lol and there comfortable use them for hrs and hrs at a time while gaming and watching movies, 1 thing i will say i was disappointed in is i though being closed ear they would block the background noise more. Would definitely recommend these to anyone to be used from gaming to music and videos.

1932100385|4.0|It's a must-read and I think, even if you don't buy into its startling conclusions, the reduction of meat and dairy in favor of whole plant foods is without serious controversy a good thing.  Want I wanted the book to address:  (1)  How animal protein differ from vegetable proteins  (2)  What is it about those differences which lead to such profound differences in results  (3)  What does evolutionary biology have to say about this, for example, differences between predators and herbivores
B0060ZJ74O|1.0|Don't get suckered by this product.  If you care at all about digital copies... you'll be very, VERY disappointed.  Movie was good, too bad it's bundled with crappy product.  Boom!  #ProductReviews
B0064Z62R0|5.0|I don't buy too many movie soundtracks, but this is one that I had to get. I just saw the film last night and every single song not only fits perfectly with the scenes, but also the storyline. I can't say that I've ever really listened to Hawaiian music, but these tunes are just so peaceful and relaxing. I can imagine myself listening to this soundtrack all day at work just to help pass the day.<br /><br />I also have no idea what the songs are about, but that's part of the mystic for me. If you get a chance to see the film, do it. Not only will you get lasting memories of the story, but this music will stick with you and it's likely to make you want to travel to Hawaii!<br /><br />For those of you downloading the MP3 version, it comes to you in VBR format with an average bitrate of about 200Kbps.

B006FE17Q6|5.0|Talk about an emotional, intense episode! I disagree with others who say season 2 is slow. I think you need some time for character development and to breathe a little bit. I think this episode was well worth the wait. Can't wait til February! !
B0055SWM08|5.0|This puzzle game is simple, elegant, very entertaining, and completely deserving of my money.  I'm glad I bought it.  :)
B006GH6IWU|5.0|A very good documentary - told in two chapters (you can watch them individually or consecutively) on the standard DVD. It's interesting to hear Brian May and Roger Taylor talk about Freddie's illness, and although they don't specifically say how early Mercury knew he had HIV/AIDS, they hint that he may have known as early as during the pre-concert rehearsals for LIVE AID in 1985. And Queen did rehearse - a lot - for LIVE AID, which I hadn't heard before. Some of that rehearsal footage is seen here.  Highlights include music-video \\"rushes\\" that feature alternate angles, takes and behind-the-scenes shots of Queen making their videos. The most shocking is a frail Mercury, in pain, standing up, for the \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\" video. The on-the-set color footage, showing Mercury waiting for the camera to start, is haunting. His sharp jawline (from AIDS) looks like it could cut through steel. Mercury's left eye is noticeably blood shot, and he looks plain ill, yet he pulled off one of his greatest on-screen performances for the music video.  It's nice to see the black-and-white film footage of Queen actually recording part of their \\"News of the World\\" album in 1977, and the 1976 live Hyde Park footage, although shown only in a couple too-brief segments, is magnificent. Footage of Queen's 1977 tour also is examined, through footage that wonderfully blends old videotape footage with film footage of the same gig.  I also learned of Roger Taylor's hatred for the \\"Hot Space\\" songs that sported dance-like beats, and how Queen almost broke up in 1982/83.  One of rock's greatest mysteries, though, has to be a now-missing-in-action John Deacon, Queen's bassist, who, for some reason, refused to take part in this documentary, as he has in all things Queen-related over the last several years. Is Deacon still alive? Anyone seen or heard from him? Supposedly Deacon gave May and Taylor his blessing to carry on with the Queen legacy, yet there's no word at all from Deacon. Wasthere any bad blood? Taylor was quoted a few years ago saying something like \\"You'll have to ask John about that, and I don't think he's in the right place to talk about that now.\\" Maybe a bit of bad blood exists on John's part?
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been playing with the various free remote desktop options for Android for a bit, but so far none of them are as flexible or as powerful as this one has been.  Heck, my wife was able to login and even PLAY WoW on my phone last night.  Although it was hardly something she would raid on, it was more than sufficient for trips to the auction house, etc.  I can imagine this being tremendously useful for media streaming, too, for those who have yet to migrate to the cloud.  Well done and well worth the price of admission.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok. games a little to kiddies. take to long to open other games, other than that its pretty good. worth a try
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great utility that let's me store, revise, and improve my ideas.  It's also a great post it note replacement.  I cannot say enough good things about Evernote.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Loved this movie!!!  The stars were great especially Stanley Tucci.  A movie for family enjoyment.  Captain America was a real hero.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I am very pleased so far with this processor.  Just upgraded from a pentium 4 old dell manufactured system and built my first computer with this as the heart of it and it is awesome.  Just wanted to say, a person I know had warned me about intel's heat sink fan that comes with the i7 being faulty and causing problems overheating, and I found very little to support that while researching it online, but rest assured my system has been operating nice and cool around 37-40 degrees Celcius since I put it together last Friday.  Just thought I'd throw that out there in case anyone else heard the same thing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of fun... I like that each new game presents a new challenge. Most games are replayable so there is an endless number of games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|gives me a couple of minutes just to escape and rewind. great way to focus on something other than work.
B006RED4GA|1.0|Junk movie, awful acting, story and scares. The scariest part is that I paid money to watch this junk. This movie was incredibly predictable to say the least and was more amusing than scary.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen all year.  I never realized that this was such a \\"home grown\\" movie until after I saw it and read more about it.  Superbly done!  Well worth the time to see it.
B001GU04MM|5.0|Perfect! Couldn't find this anywhere then remembered Amazon has EVERYTHING!!! This was a gift, he loved it & couldn't believe I found it!!! Thanks.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|This is a strange spot the difference game. I found it a little too hard for my little one because the items are sometimes very similar in shape and color, but the theme is what determines what makes on of them different. For example, one was three items from a bathroom and one that was not. but to a young one's eyes these things all look visually the same. I wouldn't buy for a kid under 5 years old, and even then some kids might struggle with the concept. Over 5, it is probably a good game for them to practice difference in theme/style as opposed to color/shape differences for a younger child.
0525478817|4.0|I ordered for my daughter.  For some reason she thought this was a signed copy but it is not.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read a story that kept me so immersed that I couldn't stop reading. It is even rarer that a story comes along that makes me want to review it. \\"Ready Player One\\" is one of those stories. It is the perfect adventure.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like the game overall, but it sometimes is very slow on my Kindle Fire.  I am terrible at it!  I still like it and play it a lot.  That says something for it because I won't usually play a game that I'm not good at.

0060873027|1.0|I was looking for something entertaining to read during a long flight, so I picked Micro, my first Michael Chrichton book.  If Richard Preston wrote the book, or not, I really don't care.  I found it terrible, and here's why:  The characters were so poorly developed I wanted to cry.  The plot was unsuccessfully \\"embellished\\" with scientific details that I found annoying because they didn't lead anywhere.  The main character....wait a minute.... which one was the main character? Was it Eric, who died at the beginning,or his brother who died halfway through the book?  Was it Rick? I'm confused.... I don't think there was a main character!  I could keep going, but it's too much of an effort for a not-worth-it book. Suffice it to say after I read the last sentence of the book, I turned the page to continue reading, and was surprised to find the bibliography.  Don't waste your money.... really
B006ID6UAW|5.0|I am just at 7% of the Kindle edition. I have a Hungarian hardcover translation but it was too big and heavy to carry around for reading. This is where Kindle's edge comes in.<br />The book itself is a masterpiece, also a must have for international relations students, and I am happy to be able to read it in English on Kindle, tough I regret that there were two typos (Page 70 Location 1158, Page 69 Location 1146) in the first 7%... - there might also be others which didn't catch my attention. I do not know weather it is an OCR issue or those typos also do exist in the original US edition. Relative to word count the typo count is marginal.<br />Whatever... just pour premium content items like this also to Kindle!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|many challenges just what I need for breakfast is a must have app if you want to kill your boredom
B004FRX0MY|2.0|needs to integrate the wish list and recommended for you features from the amazon web site and amazon android app.  it's a pain to constantly switch between the amazon app and amazon mp3 app to preview recommended songs and refer to my wish list.  the fundamental features of the mp3 app are implemented well though.  the cloud storage service works great for purchases.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|At first I was dissapointed in the retail price/package of Goonies on bluray.  I was in need of a replacing my scratched DVD.  Well thanks to Amazon.com I saved %60 off retail and enjoyed the monetary benefit of free shipping.  The extra reading material is fun for the Goonies superfan such as myself.  There is also a board game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Can't stop playing it. With 200+ levels it still never repeated itself! Puzzles range from very elegant to brute-force-hundred-times-try impossible.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|If you are an Adele fan, you are going to love this! If you are not a fan, you will become a fan! It is a wonderful DVD! She sounds as good live as she does in recordings.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I was never a big fan of Missile Command back in the day but with this app it lets me quickly point exactly where I want my missiles to go making it a lot less frustrating. Very well made game!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The strength of this game lies in the ease of control.  No roller ball and fire button.  You just point and it fires a missle.  Nice graphics and sound.  The ability to upgrade missle speed, missle number, explosive area and duration, as well as rebuilding destroyed buildings, is a nice enhancement.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|I bought this storage bin for my daughters Barbies. It is a great way to pick up the clutter and she enjoys zipping up the sides and putting stuff away.  The best part is the two in one function of also being a play zone for her Barbies and other toys. She has so much fun creating adventures with her toys walking the runway or swimming in the pool. Great toy and storage bin!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good gameplay.  Responsive with good multitouch.  Graphics are rather basic (as others have pointed out) but it works very well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I recommed this game if you like having fun. This is by far the best game out there. Only a few things are dumb
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Without this app I would have been bored silly on my plane ride to Hawaii. If you are looking for an app to either pass the time or challenge friends this is the one for you. I will warn you though that its super addicting.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|nothing too special. bunch of real quick games that are beatable and not very challenging yo be honest. overall alright
B003EYVXXW|4.0|The film depicts Roman Egypt in late antiquity and tries to tackle all of the most important developments in that era: the collapse of decadent Pagan society, the growing and unsustainable inequality between the rich and poor, the rise of Christianity, the rejection of religious pluralism, the decay of the Roman Empire, and the decline of Greco-Roman science and learning. Obviously it would be a miracle that any 2 hour film could tackle so many topics succesfully without employing cheesy dialogue so I knew this film would be cheesy before I watched it and it certainly was.  On the plus side the film does an incredible job of depicting the various competing factions in a fair light. Both the Christians and the Pagans are depicted with their merits and flaws. The viewer gets a real glympse of how so many people became attracted to Christianity amongst the back-drop of the decadent Pagan society. The Christians are shown as just as zealous in their destruction of learning and science as they are in ridding the city of hunger and disease, whilst the Pagans are shown as obsessed with pursuing pleasure of the body and mind and having no regard for the poor or their slaves.  The film is incredibly careful with facts which is quite rare in the genre of historical epics. It is careful in that it does not show St. Cyril as directly responsible for the murder of Hypatia though a connection can be inferred. It also clearly explains that Hypatia's writings are lost so that we can only speculate on what exactly she wrote about. Every scene has been carefully weighed to insure historical accuracy for the sacrifice of entertainment. Thus there is a scene in the film where Hypatia's father discusses his daughter with other elder men as not a typical \\"woman\\" who will never marry a man and lead the normal life of a woman. The only reason this scene is included in the film is to insure that the viewer is not led into thinking that Pagan society was inclusive of women in the academic field and that Hypatia was the exception rather than the rule. The scene is educational but does nothing to add to it's entertainment value.  In summary the film is incredibly cheesy and not very entertaining but as an educational tool it gets 5 stars. I would recommend it to any teacher or parent for shedding light on an era all too often ignored by both Hollywood and the Western school system. To anybody who has never heard of Hypatia or has little knowledge of how and why Paganism was replaced by Christianity this film is also a great launching pad for further research.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This is an amazing movie.  Joe Wright, the director, did a great job selecting the actors and with the cinematography.  He managed to capture the story in a two hour time frame and so this one shouldn't be compared to the 1995 BBC mini-series version.  If Wright took another 15-20 minutes, I'm sure the audience would not have minded.  Knightley and MacFadyen had wonderful chemistry, and there would have been more time for dialogue between them.  MacFadyen had much less screen time than you'd expect for this story, but he was convincing and filled the role of Darcy extremely well.  This movie definitely belongs in the video library for the romantics, and Jane Austen fans.  I've had a DVD copy of this movie since it's original release, and recently decided it was worth it to have a Blu-Ray/ digital version too.  The Blu-Ray version looks great and there were a couple more bonus features compared to the original DVD release.  Amazon delivered it quickly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played this since I got my Kindle Fire for Christmas.  It has been great fun, just like the original on my PC.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Plays great on Kindle Fire.
B006P0FD4W|4.0|First off, I should say that I LOVED parts one and two. The first two relied more heavily on very slow-building tension. These predecessors basically \\"taught\\" viewers how to watch these movies in the first 20-30 minutes by offering numerous subtle, relatively unimportant objects moving as if a spectral breeze had shifted them. This way when such production devices became important, the viewer had a trained eye--not unlike what was done with White Noise. These movies convey a style that is very unusual. So it came as no surprise to me that there was little middle ground in people's opinions of them; they loved'em or hated'em. I love'em. Why? Because my senses are all on full power; I'm all in; I'm practically concentrating on the screen and listening to every creak trying to sleuth out the next clue that something fishy is going on in that house. Some people may call this \\"work\\". I call it cool. [But people chatting during the movie are a much greater distraction than normal under the circumstances.]<br /><br />This third installment was my least favorite, but I can totally understand why it may be others' favorite. While it still employed subtle moving objects, it did it less, instead relying on more mainstream devices to provoke scared jumps from the audience. It also borrowed more heavily from the Poltergeist movies than the first two--not that I minded. The characters' investigation into the strange goings-on was more methodical and plot-driven. The first two were more event-driven and investigated more out of fear and curiosity. The differences between 3 and 1 & 2 were subtle, but numerous, chief amongst them being that \\"the paranormal\\" functions as a character in this movie, rather than a mysterious \\"force\\" in the first two. As such, the actions of \\"the paranormal\\" were more blatant and felt more like \\"it\\" was doing something \\"to someone\\" whereas in 1 & 2 it was more like \\"something was happening\\" to someone in a haunted house.<br /><br />The plot is simple. A family lives in a house. Weird things start happening. Step-dad starts putting cameras around the house. Things get weirder. And from there anything more would give too much away. But while the first two movies' endings left us largely to wild speculation, I will say that this one ends with something of an explanation of the paranormal activity.<br /><br />It doesn't really matter in which order you watch these movies. However, each sequel (or in this case prequel) was designed to mold over the events of the previous installment. So watch them in order if it's convenient. I also demand you watch these with the lights off. It makes it easier to avoid distractions while you're concentrating on the screen.use. Weird things start happening.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|Okay, I needed a free, basic note tool for my Kindle Fire that would save on my Kindle for offline use, and sync when it is online so I have a back-up and can use the app on my work and home Windows machines.  Evernote has great reviews, so I thought I woud give it a try.  I think the biggest problem I had was user experience on my Kindle.  I found the interface a bit confusing, and everytime I tried to add a notebook, it would look like it was saving the new notebook, but would not show up on my list of notebooks.  I could be wrong, but it looks like there is a limit of three notebooks for non-paid subscriptions (or for offline use maybe).  The buttons didn't seem very intuitive to me either (placement or look/feel).  Anyway, I wasn't using it because it was taking me too long to figure out, so I went looking for another app.  I found SpringPad, which seems a little less popular than Evernote, but for me, it is exactly what I have been looking for and more.  So if you are looking for an alternative to EverNote, try SpringPad.  Its free, and it is great for organizing personal notes!
0307891402|5.0|I mainly got this collector's edition for the online interactive map. What I got was an amazing player's guide full of information and beautiful pictures. The book also has checklists for armor, quests and weapons, so the player can check off (in the book) all the things they have completed.  I had gotten the players guide for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was some what angry by how that guide was arranged, sometimes confused on where to find some of the miscellaneous quests.  I will say that Prima has made me change my mind on buying their products. I will from now on buy only Prima game guides. This Skyrim guide is the best.  I have read on here that some people have had issues with the removing the map from the inside of the book. I had no issues with removing the map, it was simple and nothing get ripped.  Greatest Guide ever!

This app eats up an inordinate amount of my time as I have trouble putting it down. Every time I get an empty moment I start it up. This app is really user friendly and works well on my incredible 2. It scales very nicely to my Xoom as well. The only change I'd like to see is the ability to change difficulty level - sometimes I feel like it deals a bit easy.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|Action packed, typical cage movie. the acting was good could have pick a better person for female lead, but a good movie, enjoyed it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My children and I play this games everyday its interesting to see who can win a game and who cant. It gives us a chance to be together and have fun as a family!

B004EPYZSK|5.0|THIS Movie is great, the actors where good in it and the action is up there, it did have a few slow spots, but it is a great movie which deserves to be watched again.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|For anyone who uses Google Calendar, Calengoo is hands-down the best calendar app on the market.  I use it on my HTC Evo, and it works flawlessly.  Far better than the stock app.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|this movie deserves a squel, story is good, the action is great. a little more back ground would have been nice but all in alll it is worth watching.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|Stargate died with this show. And it wasn't that bad a series , it was just different and if they'd have had atlantis still on when this was airing. People would have been much more accepting of this show as a experiment.  That wasn't the case though and this season was much better than the first one in many ways. The is only a vague ending though. For this season they didn't bother with a blu ray release which is unfortunate. Still the show is engaging and the characters were interesting. And this season had alot more action than the first. But it was hopeless as scy fy was more intent on weekend movies than maintaining a tv series like this one.  There's extras on this and that's a good thing but this show never had a chance and that's a shame.
B005WM6RUS|5.0|Sarah's Key by Tatiana De Rosnay takes place in France This book is about a journalist name Julia. She is researching about the Vel D Hiv as she investigates about the round-up Sarah Starkynski the ten-year-old girl story intertwines with her investigation. The Vel D Hiv takes place in Paris, France in July 1942. It all began in Sarah Starkynski apartment where her family and her lived, During the Vel D Hiv the round-up began, the polices started to gather all the Jews and take them to concentration camps. In Sarah's apartment there was a secret cupboard, which there her brother hided since Sarah and her family were taken to the concentration camps, she promises to come back for him as soon as they release her. As years pass by Julia researches about the Vel D Hiv and discovers more about Sarah in 2002.   The book revolves around two stories, Sarah's life and Julia's life. Sarah's life becomes a disaster when she is separated from her mother in the concentration camp, she becomes very ill. There she meets a girl name Rachel. They become good friends and help each other out in the concentration camp. In the concentration camp there's a guard that helps Rachel and Sarah escape but they had to rip their Jew stars from their clothes. Sarah and Rachel start discovering the world, try to look for food and help but also be careful to who they talk too and hide from the police. They find an elderly family that protects them from the police and helps them but sadly later on something terrible happens to Rachel, which hurt Sarah sadly. After the Vel D Hiv round-up Sarah went back to her apartment to look for her little brother that was hiding in the cupboard but when she opened the door to the cupboard it was too late. The family raised Sarah like her own, after all the circumstances Sarah went through she was a serious young lady she showed no emotion and always wondered more from the ocean horizon.   Julia on the other hand is expecting a child but her husband Bertrand deeply doesn't want her to keep the baby but Julia insisted to keep the baby so she did. Julia was so attached to Sarah's story and researching about her that it caused her family problems. As Julia researches more and more about Sarah's life she discovers she got married and has a child and lives in New York. So Julia quickly flies to New York to look for her but finds nothing. Later on she finds out that Sarah had an accident two years ago but also finds out her son is living in Italy so she goes look for him. Julia interviews him but all the shocking stuff Julia is telling him doesn't match up to what he  knows. Sarah's son finds out shocking stuff about his past and notices that all his years he has been living a big lie. Two years later Julia has her child and names her Sarah.   In my opinion I personally recommend you to read Sarah's Key By Tatiana Rosnay. I read this book for an assignment for one of my classes and I absolutely fell in love with it. It's an amazing book words can't explain how amazing this book is. It's beyond interesting it will keep you entertained every single time you read it more and more. It will make you cry and remember.  It will stay on your mind even after you finish reading it and put it away. It's a book full of mystery, curiosity, and suspense. Trust me if you read this book, you will fall in love just like I did. If you get the chance you shouldn't think it twice, just read it, it's definitely worth your time.

I found the story gripping.  I could hardly put the book down.  I found it sad, but redeeming.  This is a wonderful read.  Janet

B001OSIV62|2.0|I have no idea how this has been rated so highly. Maybe the people who rated it are huge fans of tightrope walkers and it maybe deserves five stars compared to other tightrope documentaries, but compared to other documentaries this is a two star production.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Reminds me of the good old days...but with a touch screen. It was an amazon app of the day so i figured I'd give it a try. It's definitely a great free game, and i wouldn't have been disappointed if I chose to pay for it.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|i love this show. i have been a fan since the books first started filtering out and the show is just amazing. i do find it funny that season 3 isnt even finished yet and they are already advertising for pre-sale lol.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Oh my gosh I cannot believe so many thought this was a good film.  Stanley Kubrick knew how to show on the screen man through the ages.  This was the worst waste of people's time I could think of.  Yes art is in the eye of the beholder.  I aknowledge this is art but for me it is bad film making.  What plot?  This is as far from a normal film as can be made.  I  stayed until the end to give it every chance to redeem itself.  Until now I thought Trip to Bountiful was the most boring film I had ever seen.  This was far worse.  Don't waste your hard earned money buying this DVD or seeing it in the theater.  There are so many better movies out there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love that there are so many games just in one app. It makes the time pass by and keeps me entertained.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|You think you've seen the worst movie ever made, that nobody will ever make a movie that bad again.... And then Roland Emmerich makes another movie. How can so many excellent actors and a huge budget be combined to make such garbage?<br /><br />The special effects are good (though the green-screening is not up to the effects). Some are outstanding. But this movie requires a lot more than suspension of disbelief. It requires a full lobotomy. Absurdly bad.<br /><br />Then again, who needs a plot when you have a budget of $200 million and a really terrible but really well-connected director? The saddest part is that Danny Glover, John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson are phenomenal actors and the rest of the cast is fine; it's just the filmmaking that really sucks.

B0033KR5XY|5.0|Bach organ works have long been one of my greatest passions. I ordered this set after considerable research and thought. It has quite simply far exceeded my expectations and hopes. I am inexpressively delighted. I would pay six times the price for it and know that I got a great buy.<br /><br />The playing is fresh, intelligent, revealing, and creative. Preston's rhythmic sense and articulation are rock solid and musically satisfying. I found the registrations to be especially wonderful, and their effect is greatly increased by the exceptional quality of the recordings.<br /><br />I began listening to the set by choosing the great C minor Passacaglia and Fugue [BWV582], and was astounded. For someone who has yet to grasp the reason for the passion many serious musicians feel about Bach in general and Bach on the organ in particular, this performance of this piece makes the most compelling of arguments. I was seized, swept up, enchanted, and then simply astounded by the composition (yet again, for I know it well), the sound of the organ, and the intelligence of the playing. It is by a considerable measure, the best performance of it I have ever heard.<br /><br />I could say more, I would be repeating myself. For me, great music, performed, must speak to the heart, by whatever means, and regardless of style or instrument. This music, this performer, these recorders have mine, completely.<br /><br />I think you will not be disappointed, and indeed will be most pleased if you decide to acquire this treasure.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|Heath Ledger in The Joker make-up would have been a more believable CIA agent involved in a top case. Clare Danes was great as a manic wild-eyed lunatic...however, she was awful(the writing)as anything resembling a big time CIA agent. This overblown glob goes downhill early on, but the pace it achieves makes for a catastrophic plot crash at the end. We won't talk about the plot twist that defy brain cells.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I would have given this app 5 stars if the sync between PC and Kindle Fire works better.  I created several notebooks on my PC after installing the app on Kindle Fire.

B0000CABJ1|1.0|Upon my request, I received this sealed disc from my daughter for Christmas.  I was very excited to listen to it as I am a Donna Summer lover of her music.  Upon opening, I noticed that the main disc was missing and only the bonus disc was included. The bonus disc is mostly drum music and little if no singing.  I was extremely disappointed. Certainly, a waste of money on my daughter's part.

B001R0KH3W|4.0|I am not a big fan of Stevie Wonder but have to say he is a talented musician and this is a great concert.  Most of his hits he performs here with really good camera work.  To think how long he has been in the music business and that something is finally released is quite an injustice to him.  Even though I did not keep this concert after watching it, it is for sure a keeper for any fan of his.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
145162445X|5.0|This well written book gives a nice and fairly comprehensive tour through recent developments and the problems that face Cosmology. Krauss coherently guides the reader through some pretty tough concepts, giving some idiosyncratic metaphors along the way. With such a short book the depth of some topics is not as great as I expected, so readers new to the topic may want to read this book with Wikipedia on hand.<br /><br />EDIT: This book has stirred up quite a storm in the blogoshpere and beyond. As can be seen by the reviews here, readers are largely split between loving and hating the book. Having a read through the negative reviews here the book appears, unsurprisingly, to have struck a nerve with theists and philosophers. What is also clear is that either many of these negative reviewers did not read the book, or did not read it carefully. The theists claim he claims to have disproven god, which he did not, and the philosophers seem angry at him for not answering a question he did not set out to answer... As a scientist he approaches the question such, he is using real physical law in his arguments (with careful caveats and provisos where our knowledge ends).

B0000047D5|3.0|The Oscar Peterson Trio / We Get Requests:  A very subdued set of songs that are perfectly suited for background music.  These gentlemen are capable of much more than this and I guess I expected more than this.  This is not a bad album; it's just that it draws your attention with the same effectiveness as the playback music of the last restaurant you went to.  Use this one at your next dinner party, it won't disturb the conversations.  Three Stars.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|I thought \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was rather morbid, gritty, and heart-wrenching.  Well, surprisingly, A Clash of Kings surpasses all of what GOT was by far.  While GOT is definitely not what I'd call a constantly up-lifting tale, the thoughts of the days where Ned was the Hand of the King, Sansa a gullible, starry-eyed young girl in love with Joffrey, and Arya taking lessons with Syrio were always something to smile about, even when things started taking a dark turn.  However, this novel managed to shatter all of that entirely into pieces.  There are no safe places, no safe characters, and the brutality of it all goes way beyond anything we read in GOT.  This is all-out war, in it's most sickly and realistic form.  Treacheries of the worst sort, fratricide, continued incest, rapes, torture, and all of the bloody and horrific parts of war....this isn't a fairy tale or for the faint of heart!<br /><br />Obviously, with an incredible amount of people calling themselves king and even more scheming to become king, there is going to be war.  At times the book is a little slow moving, but at around 70% through (Kindle version), the action elevated quickly.  Some of the things in this book will just make your jaw drop, and for me, the absolute disgustingness of one particular character was bone-chilling.<br /><br />Fantasy plays a much bigger role in this book than a GOT.  While we were only given small glimpses of fantasy in the first book, A Clash of Kings has its fair share of warlocks, pyromancers, supernatural things (sort-of) beyond The Wall, and dark magic.  I think fantasy will play a much larger part in future books, and I like how Martin eases us into it.  I'd write more on that, but don't want to spoil it.<br /><br />HBO<br />I cannot wait to see what HBO does with this book.  I would have to guess it was even more expensive than the first to produce, with constant war scenes.  Hopefully, they won't scale the world of Westeros down as much as they did in the first season, where everything seemed to be on a smaller-sized scale.  The vastness of Westeros in a really key part of the series, and I want the show to reflect this.  It will also be interesting to see how bloody and sexual things will get.  While I doubt they'll tone down the sex and nudity much, some of the violence was just horrific (that kindly Ser Gregor...).  I hope they show it all though, and stay true to the book, which I feel confident they will.<br /><br />If you enjoy books that have more \\"grey\\" characters rather than one-dimensional black and white ones, have a strong stomach, and love amazing, captivating writing that will keep you entranced, you will love this series.  Some people complain that it's too much of a \\"downer,\\" well - if you're concerned about that, you may want to check into reading a more archetypal \\"good vs. evil guys\\" fantasy book than this one.  Regardless, this book isn't a total downer.  It's just real.  There are plenty of good things you can take from this book.  It's all about how you interpret it.eason, where everything seemed to be on a smaller-sized scale.  The vastness of Westeros in a really key part of the series, and I want the show to reflect this.

B005K8QIS0|5.0|It is a wonderful series, and I am glad I bought it. But I must agree with the reviewer who said he missed the great blues that were on the television series. Why on earth would they be removed? I really wanted to find out the titles and the artists who did them Does anyone know?  It is a terrific series of stories, well plotted and excellent acting. I plan to read the novels.

B00006IM9Q|5.0|Bottom line....if you're a fan of the generally popular Blondie songs (and that fun 80's punk rock genre) and you only want one definitive disc, this is a great overall album which compiles their most successful/popular songs. There may be a few less commercial ones you don't know (Rip Her to Shreds), but even those are quite good.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|If I remember correctly this movie when it came out to theaters wasn't very well received.  Not surprised.  Sci-fi is a genre that is sometimes hot, sometimes cold, and war movies without romance are a guy's thing.  And this movie is both of those things: sci-fi by way of war.  Even though the scenario is familiar and people might be thinking \\"ID4\\" this movie is focused on being more compact.  It follows one man (Sergeant Michael Nantz played by Aaron Eckhart) and one platoon over the course of a day as they make their way through LA with initial confidence in order to rescue stranded civilians and, with each seeming alien encounter, their confidence is eroded as the aliens demonstrate that they are adapting their military strategies; at first they are just a ground force coming out of the ocean but soon they have air support and then unmanned drones via a central broadcasting hub.  These bugs adapt.  And this is what makes this grimy, compact movie more interesting.  This could be a metaphor for a new virus attacking populations; it could be a metaphor for a well-planned war against governments; or it could just be any invading force that is going to give us a run for our money.  The military is played straight and makes our fighting men and women (though vulnerable and being pushed back in the film) look intelligent and sympathetic.  The film doesn't try to make any grand statements about anything really; you can take it for what it is or sprinkle in your own interpretations.  It is well-acted, fast paced, with good special effects and a sustained level of tension.  Going into this one with lowish expectations I came out of this very pleasantly surprised.
0439023521|5.0|I downloaded this book to my Nook over 6 months ago. It was recommended by a friend. After hearing several people talk about how good the book was I finally read it. It started a little slow; setting up the story but once you hit the second book within the story it really takes off. It's a great story about a teenager named Katniss who lives in the future. The US is no longer. It is now named Panem and is divided into 12 districts which are governed by the Capital. The Hunger Games are games where a boy and girl from each district are chosen through a lottery to compete against each other in a life and death game. Make sure you have the second book available when you start reading this book because the ending makes you want to immediately start reading the next book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I just recently watched this movie and it was absolutely wonderful. It was as wonderful as the the other movies-Facing the Giants, Fireproof and Flywheel. You just can't find movies like this anymore. Recommend to everyone to watch all 4 of these movies.
0439023491|5.0|I immediately started reading the second book after finishing the first book. The ending of the first book made me want to start the second book right away to find out what was happening. The second book is the same and left me with questions that had to be answered. Catching Fire is even better than the first book. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie for Hunger Games which is coming out in theaters in March 2012. I highly recommend this series to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app has replaced my Bibles on Kindle. I like it because it's easy to navigate. I haven't done a lot of exploring of the other features...yet.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This was not just better than book one. It was better than the subsequent books as well in my eyes. It worried me since Eddard was killed off and a dragon appeared at the end of book one, but in the end it was great. The great focus on Tyrion in this chapter was really well done. In fact, this book fleshed out the Tyrion character so well you appreciate his wit and wisdom more than anything else in this story. After this part of the story it starts to go astray, mainly because I think the author bites off more than he can chew and kills off too many characters. That said, this portion is engaging, exciting and draws you in from beginning to end.  If you watch the HBO series, be prepared, because this book will have a lot of opportunity to explode on screen. There are so many key pieces in this long book that there is no way the show will do it justice. This may be fine for the casual fan, but I was disappointed in gaps the first series left (more so on what was added instead of key portions of the book). How they will undertake the many key elements here remains to be seen. If they do it right though, Peter Dinklage will win more awards. This book was written to make that man shine.  Aside from the series, this is the book you need to read in the series. Lucky for you it comes early! Read book one and two. If you do not want to trudge onward, then shut the doors there and wait for HBO to try and do the remaining books justice. This one is solid gold.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is good but when you finish games it takes too many points.my favorite game is when u stab the sushi.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|A very well told fantasy story without the extremes of the fantasy world. 90% of it could be reality, so if you are interested in \\"old world\\" tales without too much extreme, out on on the edge, concepts, it is a great tale. It is a very enthralling story. If you like the HBO series, read the book. A lot of detail is left out due to the encapsulating effect even a mini series can have, such as the details of battles and relationships in particular. It is also essential to read the book in order to fully understand the characters in depth, but that is typical.<br /><br />Just as a side note, I was surprised by the difference in the amount of sex in the mini series compared to the book. I am not offended by it, but the series adds entire characters and story lines related to this that are not in the book. I find this rather odd. There is so much depth to the book that it is sad they added these elements instead of elaborating on missing portions of the book. As an example, not enough is made clear in the series about the importance of the direwolves and their role. This is crucial in the book. Instead, the side story of Greyjoy and the path of a local prostitute is added? It will hook the lusty, but adds nothing to the original story.

B0064T6LV8|4.0|this game isn't as bad as other people say it is.  It's the type of game you download and play for about a week, but its worth a download.
B0068RGVMK|3.0|Tuomas reached for the stars on this one but bit off a little more than he can chew, this is part epic, part epic fail. Let's start with the vocals before I address the musical compostitions. As far as the Tarja/Annette camp rivalry goes, having seen them live 3X , twice with Tarja once with Annette, I can say unequivocally that Tarja blows Annette away on EVERY level: technical talent,vocal tone, emotiveness,range, stage presence and just plain good looks, Tarja sounds EXACTLY as good live as on CD, whereas Annette sounded like a shrieky whiner that could barely sing her own songs live and outright butchered the older material. Annette comes across as a phony in every way, including her name which is also fake, the 40 yr old mother of 2 with naturally straight short blonde hair and the body of a 12 yr old Philipino boy looks outright ridiculous in her \\"Goth Girl\\" outfit.  The real problem is that her vocals are now the limiting factor of the band and aren't up to par with the above average musicianship and songwriting of the rest of the band, while I found them at least tolerable on this release and not as much of a distraction as on Dark Passion Play, you can hear that they were heavily layered, or layered with Marco's vocals to overcome the shortcomings and Tuomas really squeezed everything out of her he can get, her average \\"one-dimensional\\" voice is about as good as it's going to get here, no room for growth.  Now onto the music: they have gone as full blown symphonic pop/goth metal soundtrack sounding as they could possibly get on this release, some of it works well some doesn't, the first half of the album starts off strong , if a bit schizophrenic,strangely starting with a Finnish lullabye then onto the catchy single \\"storytime\\"  followed by the decent \\"ghost river\\" the strange jazzy ballad \\" slow, love slow\\" though it works well, then the Celtic sounding uptempo \\"I want my tears back\\" followed by one of the two best tracks on the album \\"Scaretale\\" a heavy unique Tim Burton inspired number, then the very enjoyable middle eastern instrumental \\"Arabesque\\" , unfortunately the album completely loses steam in the second half and it becomes one intolerable bore of mediocre slow to mid tempo numbers , with the one exception \\"Last Ride of the Day\\" a very catchy uptempo and uplifting number that is my favorite track on the album. The last real song on the album \\"Song of Myself\\" should really be titled \\" Victim of Itself\\" because that's what it really is and this is really Tuomas's biggest mistake on the album, the song starts off very strong and promising then devolves into a nearly 8 minute narration that renders this song virtually unlistenable for repeat playings, there should have been two versions of this song, an edited album version that does away with the narrations and the \\"special edition\\" movie version that includes them.  The album basically ends on a whimper after the boring narration there is the instrumental medley \\"Imaginaerum\\" and that's it.  If this album had the proper editing of the boring parts, a few more catchy heavy numbers and a few less slow/mid-tempo numbers, it would have been 4 stars, and the addition of a proper female lead that can push vocal boundaries would have gotten it to 5 stars.  If these guys really want to progress from here they need to mesh this new highly produced symphonic sound with the heavyness and metal sensibilities of the \\"Wishmaster\\" album and either bring Tarja back into the fold or hire another stellar female vocalist, I would suggest Floor Jansen, the best and most underrated female vocalist in the biz right now and the only one with the vocal chops to take this band to new heights.

B000BVMAJ2|5.0|I purchased this Duplo set along with another larger Zoo set for my kids for Christmas.  The animals are adorable and the kids love them.  While this set does have a few blocks, it really just contains the animals (and a zookeeper).  I would recommend purchasing this set along with another set that has more blocks for building and creating purposes.  Great buy.
