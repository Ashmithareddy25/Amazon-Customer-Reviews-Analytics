B009UX2YAC|5.0|coolest game ever you need to get it.I can almost never put it down. If you want a good game pick this one.
0061906220|4.0|my boy (17months old) loves this book!.. its now probably in his top two. It reads easy and fun, and the illustrations are pretty good as well. My only beef is the moral of the story should be worked into the story.. not just explained ie. &#34;this is the moral of the story&#34;..... sorry if my explanation is poor. Read Jester Has Lost His Lingle and you will see an excellent example of how the moral of the story was woven into the story. Regardless of that little thing. I highly recommend this book!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game freezes and kicks me off before I can play. I do not recomend this game. The graphics are so different from temple run 1. Very confusing.
0805047905|4.0|great stuff.. very simple and fun.. my 17 month old boy loves it! but we need more stimulation! time to move on.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is really stupid it did work on my kindle but know whenever i select it it takes about 20 mins. to load then it just hoes back to the home screen
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the most addicting game ive ever played i strongly recommend it you will fall in love with it!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|These games are fine for young kids but not for the average person.  And you HAVE to play the beginning games before you can choose others.  Not open to all games to choose which is decieving.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wonderful! I love stories that are bookended with a chronicler a la \\"In the Name of the Wind.\\" If you've read Rothfuss, you'll like this guy. I couldn't put this book down. Also, I noticed none of the editorial mistakes referenced in other reviews, and I think the story may have undergone some sort of editorial process since the first reviews were written. Very much worth the read... I've already recommended this book to several friends.
0765325950|5.0|One of the things I hate the most is a really good story that has a horrible ending. Book 14, the ending of the Wheel of Time, is anything but a horrible ending. It was amazing! A full action packed non stop story covering the Last Battle. It definitely feels epic enough to be considered &#34;The Last Battle&#34;. I especially liked the way it worked out for Rand in the end. It really worked for me. Despite the fact that everyone knows what is coming. There were still some pretty unexpected twists that keep the story interesting.<br /><br />If I had any complaint, it was that in trying to finish such a massive gigantic story there were a few storylines that their resolutions felt a little weak. Seeing as how big the story was though, and the desire to finish the book in a reasonable number of pages, I don't think there was much getting around this.<br /><br />If you have gone through and read all the other books in the series don't stop now, this is the most exciting action packed book of the series.
0307949508|3.0|Was sooo looking forward to the sequel to Dragon Tattoo, but wow what happened to Salander in the intervening year?  The character which was appealing in such an oddball complex way becomes a genius with mathematical ability off the charts, a phographic memory and a prize fighter.  In one scene she at 90lbs demolishes two hardcore Hell's Angles single handed.  In another scene she gets shot in the hip, chest and head, then gets buried alive - manages to dig herself out of the grave, go back and ax her poor old dad (who it turns out she had tried to burn alive when she was a pre teen) and make her way back into the home of her crazed half brother who is a muscle bound giant of enormous strength who feels no pain.  All very realistic of course and totally believable.  What a gal.<br /><br />I cannot imagine what Larsson was thinking when he developed her character to such an outlandish extent.  I got more and more aggrivated at every turn of the page from about half way through.  It began well enough with a nice twist and some payback to old baddies, some unexpected twists and turns, a bit slow at times and a meandering plot and then it became the race to find more and more outlandish things for our little heroine to get up to.  One minute she is crawling through the woods en route to kill pappa and big bro, when suddenly she solves some old mathematical problem that has been driving one genius after another crazy for 100 years.  She stops crawling to LOL at how simple the final soluton was.  I mean come on.<br /><br />It was nice to reconnect with some old favorites like Blomkvist who is not much changed and other characters who did not morph into Marvel heros.  However I got very tired with the use of B surnames for characters.  For example we have Blomkvist, Berger, Bjurman, Bjorck, Bublanski, Bohman, Beckman and Berringer - when so many of the major characters have similar names it can be a bit confusing at times.  Not only B but he had problems finding aliases for the letter S.  So we hve Salander, Sivarandan, Sandstrom and Svensson.  Two cops were Ekstrom and Hedstrom.  Is this some kind of joke on his part??<br /><br />The plot meanders along for over 450 pages and then it is as though Larsson got fed up of the whole project and just threw the ending together as fast as he could.  On one page we have no facts about the murders and then suddenly and seemingly out of the blue the whole plot is laid out in a couple of pages.  A character who had been a bit player suddenly turns out to be the baddie and if I thought she was a cartoon character he was an even bigger joke as a character.  Too silly to describe.<br /><br />Oh did I mention that she has a twin sister that gets mentioned a few times but with no flesh to the character other than her name....... and a 25 million kroner penthouse, and a sparring partner who was a world champion boxer.<br /><br />I did finish the book and to some extent I did enjoy it BUT not a patch or even a scratch close to the first book.  In fact in the end it just got plain daft.  The sex trade sub plot was so sub it disappeared.  I read some comments about the social justice side of the book - must have dozed off on that page.  All in all a big disappointment.r the letter S.  So we hve Salander, Sivarandan, Sandstrom and Svensson.  Two cops were Ekstrom and Hedstrom.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addicting. I'm always playing this game and I love the updates and I just cant collect coins fast enough to buy new characters. ; )
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game both my son and I love the game. We play it just about every day. Once I beat his score he plays the gsme until he beats my score.
0307887448|3.0|This is a fun read with lots of trivia and an almost encyclopedic list of video game history and the 1980's.  The main characters are likable and believable, though there is not much depth.  The plot is where this book falls short.  It is good (an unwilling hero and his pals) versus bad (greedy corporate suits) with a lot of holes.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This book will keep you reading to find out the real reason for the 24 hour book store.  However it rapidly evolves into geek science fiction that stretches its story credibility
B00007AJGH|5.0|I've loved this film ever since I was a kid of 5 years of age and I'd got to say this film became a instant classic that I fell in love with for so many years after I first saw this film in the theaters. I would recommend this film to all of my family members and tell you will enjoy this movie just as much as I did. I still fall in love with this film simply because of the fact the wife of Roger Rabbit...Jessica Rabbit! She is so funny and beautiful at the same time, that's why the movie is so unique and hilarious, that's why I feel I fell in love with this movie at such a young age. I hope everybody enjoys this movie just as well as I did and learn to  have a laugh with family your loved ones.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This movie is worth viewing and I do recommend it.  The performances were good - I liked the cast.  It wasn't glamorous so the story plot is believable.  The humor is entertaining - but I was hoping for more humor.  The movie was not fully a drama nor fully a comedy.  But I guess I was hoping this would be like &#34;As Good As It Gets&#34;:  a good balance of drama, comedy, great script/story line, superb acting and highlighted by enough &#34;belly laugh&#34; moments.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Where's the postage reimbursement you promised me ???<br />You replaced a faulty cable at no charge and I paid the postage on it. You said you wouid reimburse the postage and I've been waiting for a month and still haven't  heard from you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Although some of the scenes in Season 3's episodes were a little dull, on the whole I continue to be a fan of DA.  Those scenes that were a little dull in the script were offset by the acting, costumes, and scenery, which has always been excellent.  I continue to highly recommend DA and look forward to Season 4.  My only comment to the powers that be, make it possible for the US fans to see the broadcasts sooner than later.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. It's not like other Nicholas Sparks's books but it  is still great. A definite must read.
B004G6009K|5.0|Its a great movie for kids. It is well animated and looks good in 3D. Still hate the singing tho.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game gets you hooked instantly.Great game for competition with friends.The game is so simple but so hard.Subway Surfers is simple enough for any age group.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I saw it in the movie theaters and I liked it, so I bought the 3D blu ray. I enjoyed the movie as well as the first 2 movies of Transformers.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like the game but I don't like how it changes where you are at.SO CHANGE IT! I HATE IT!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|It is a good movie that anyone can enjoy. It looks good in 3D and its a good interpretation of one of Marvels well known superhero.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it better than temple run it is awesome I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) best game ever made thanks for making it
B003NFM3JU|5.0|My girlfriend wanted this movie for a while, so I bought it for her. She loves the movie and so does her family.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Suffers is an exciting game and it can be very addicting. I highly recommend getting this game. The only problem is at times it will freeze my device for a while. Overall this game is great fun for me my sisters Cassy maebell mya aryona Jamie and my brother lucas.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|They should be beaten for what they did to Firefly.  Showing them out of order, or sometimes not at all, then cancelling after one season they screwed up?  Thanks for nothing, Fox.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love subwy surfers. i surf all around those subways. i love how every 10-25 days there is a new character. i realy wanted tony and now i really want carmen[rio].it should be .99 wonderful,addicting,fun game. well done well done
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The introduction does not indicate the explicit perverted sexual content of this book. I feel filthy, cheated, and ashamed that I downloaded this book to my Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that the new minecraft is way better than the last and has way more cool stuff you should definitely get it!!!!!!
B00138J234|5.0|This is by far Clash's best music.  If you don't own a Clash album, this is the one to buy!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|This one is better than the last few Resident Evils. Much improved. The action sequences are better coordinated and enjoyable to watch.  Huge nostalgia moment when I heard the Red Queen say 'You're all going to die down here'!
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|All these movies build up and the ending just cuts off! Worst money ive spent on movies! It builds up to nothing!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|wanted to read this for years. At first it is a bit hard to read, need to focus on the wording, but of course<br />Victor Hugo is amazing and the story timeless.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|The Old Breed, The Greatest Generation, none better has ever been sent forth in the defense of our Nation.  I deeply enjoy military history, and I was privileged to live among some of these men in San Diego, 1949-51as a Navy brat.  This is just an outstanding book about the courage and will of this generation of men and this country.  RIP, Mr. Sledge.......  Job Well Done.
B0015DROBO|5.0|If I had known about all the sex I would not have read this book. Having said that, it was a great read! Lots of twists and turns and some surprises. Don't know if I will read the next in the series but this was a great read.
B0004Z33F0|5.0|This was a great gift for my son.  He loves this movie and he enjoyed this as one of his Christmas gifts.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Susan has a lovely voice and is deeply appreciated in this topsy turvy world... Given as a gift, but appreciated the listening experience.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The gameplay and new features are very nice. Although it does glitch out sometimes. Overall, great game I would reccommend it.
B004P12SSW|5.0|The music gets in you, the dances will make you get up and dance, and Cher just makes you love her all over again. Stan Tucci is fantastic as usual. Christina...I've never heard such vocals in a musical; she is brilliant in this genre of storytelling through song, and she brings it when she dances!! Not only do you have to see this movie, you have to see it again and again!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read the Sinhala translation of this book when I was fourteen years old as a school supplementary. I enjoyed it very much, but when I read the English book, it is more fascinating. I purchased this book to my ten year old daughter. I think this book must be read by all kids.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great cast, well done! Great humor, loved seeing Leonard Nemoy again. The special effects were fantastic! For those that loved the old series, it takes you back. For those that are too young to remember the old series, it's a fantastic ride and hopefully it prompts you to want more.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|So far I've only watched Raiders, but it was spectacular! Cleaned up, shined up, but not overprocessed digitally, at least to my untrained eye. It was great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game play it every day!yup should too many levals and very cool .just down loaded the Rio subway and I am liking this ad well
B0053O89KG|5.0|Only part way through this, and I am well pleased in how the makers of Castle keep the quality at a high level season after season. There is exceptional work presented here, by the writers, directors, crew and actors.<br />In the episode where Beckett is experiencing panics flashing back to the day she was shot---Stana Katic's work deserves an Oscar, and should get an Emmy. She is that good. Everyone else is exceptional also; the newcomer, Penny Johnson Jerald, has the tough job of replacing a well liked actor. And acting as a 'heavy' to counterbalance the leads. I just checked her imdb and it was from the Larry Sanders show that I remember her best, though she's had quite a career.<br />Long/short: Castle is a great show which I love to revisit on DVD. Season four is as good as the others. That is a miracle on television!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|At first I was not interested with this until my family members told me to try it out. I fround at the idea but then once I got it for my kindled I thought it was so much fun lol. Trying to draw and also guessing what someone elses was drawing was fun. I like the idea that I can play family members and others in other places. The graphics and coin collection that allows you to purchase with the coins you gain makes it fun as you really want to get new pallets of colors to get more closer to what your trying to draw. Nice time killer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|having a blast and love this game. fun for kids and adults. easy interesting way to pass the time. all in all a great free game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Played some games the graphics are nice and much to choose from. I gave it three stars only because I don't get to use it much and really have no time but I still have the game. I would think this will be fun for many, choice for everyone.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I always liked surround sound,and when this collection came out I had to have it.<br />This album was made for surround sound and the the different versions are incredible
B004I744AS|4.0|I have several dictionaries but love the app. Works well, graphics are well and easy to use once you  adapt to getting around in its usage. I would suggest that others give it a try to see if it will be resourceful to you.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love it but hate starting at the very beginning every time you loose. Should be a way to continue until 3 lives are exhausted like Pac man and pinball then be asked to purchase gems.  Still love the game, very addicting.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this a lot. This is a very nice app which allows you to write notes and allowes your color choices of your pad, ability to title and you can edit what you write. It is easy to use once you get the hang of it very please with Social & Mobile, Inc for this app. Thanks
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book in the expected style of Grisham.  The characters were well defined and story was captivating.  Highly recommend it for a cold winter day.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Who doesn't appreciate a calculator that will help you? Very nice and works well, the graphics are nice. If your a person who likes to have the ability to have quick access to a calculator in your mobile device this will be a plus. Digitalchemy, LLC did a good job and service providing the Fee app...Great job!
B00280LYIM|5.0|THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a great book! It's a  funny book also. You'll have to read it. Get the book.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This will be beneficial to one who understands chess. I don't. However, the graphics are clear and good and if you have an idea what your doing or ambition to figure it out (unless you know already) then you will enjoy it!
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|Anyone who has ever read a Reacher novel would know that Cruise is the last person you would cast as Jack Reacher.  Terrible casting makes for a poor movie.
B008OOYALE|4.0|My son plays this more then I do, the graphics are very nice and good and the sound effects. The animations of the dragons are very creative and entertaining. I gave it a four star  because I don't get to play it often since everyone else does but TeamLava did a good job.
B0000B1OGD|4.0|Half of this movie is a brilliant rip-off of other Ray Harryhausen films (it's perfectly all right to copy from oneself).  The other half of this movie is a western of sorts, another treatise on greed.  Most of the characters are scheming to get rich, get the girl, get the Eohippus.  The rest of the characters are working to sabotage everyone else's scheme; in the end, all motives are suspect (especially that of an old gypsy woman no one takes seriously............\\"DOOM!\\").<br />The first part of this movie acts as filler until we get to the good stuff, when they actually go into the valley of Gwangi.  When the Pteranodon shows up it only heralds more wonders to come: an Omithomimus, the fabulous Allosaurus, and of course the persistent Styracosaurus.  Naturally, they have to capture the Allosaurus (Gwangi) and bring the souvenir back to civilization, where, for a price, you can take part in a stampede.  The final battle sequence is spectacular.  On the whole, not a bad effort.  The acting is par for the course; it didn't make or break anyone's career.<br />This has the distinction of being the last `prehistoric' movie Ray Harryhausen made.  As far as I'm concerned, the man didn't make nearly enough movies of this nature.  100 wouldn't be enough.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like this app. The sounds are very relaxing and if your interested in taking out time to get into a relax mood after a hard day then this is nice to listen too on your bedside. I downloaded it for my kindle Fire and I really enjoy the sound choices. Good when you just want your mind to take a trip from a stressful day or to relax you prior to resting. Ignos Software inc. did a nice job, I think others will enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Was challenged by some of the Youth at church to play this game.. and now when I have a free moment I find myself playing it. Pretty fun game. More fun as I play.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun & addicting. I love it & my kids love it. I think changing the scenery on the game helps keep it fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was not sure my daughter would like this or not, so I took a chance.  She seems to like it BUT WHO CARES??....I LOVE IT!  LOL.  Honestly, really cute game that any girl would love.  Good job guys!!
0307352153|5.0|Oh how I wish I had read this book 20 years ago when I was in my twenties! I won't bore you with personal anecdotes other than to say that as an introvert who grew up trying to be an extrovert, and as a parent of a very beautiful and talented 13 year old introverted daughter, for the first time I have the tools to guide her through this minefield. Now when she comes to me and says \\"Mom, I am too shy and I don't know what to say, I wish I was louder...etc...etc\\" I can say to her \\"You don't need to change, it's the world that needs to change.\\" That might sound idealistic and simplistic but I see the weight of the world lift off her shoulders. She is, of course, also a perfectionist and a talented writer, she now appreciates that all of these characteristics that society tries to stamp out of her, are in fact, wonderful gifts. It's up to her how she uses those gifts but at least she no longer views them as some sort of handicap in life. From that perspective I can honestly say that this book really is life changing.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Hands down my favorite album of 2012.  So much goodness in here!  Couldn't beat the price, and I would have paid more honestly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I think u should too it did not help me to much to know what I am doing but love that
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like minecraft...I would do anything just to let ot update in kindle for in my android it was already updated pls update now man for I would really freaking gonna call Sky now
B000JMKQX0|2.0|At first it was cool.  It is structured as a series of interviews, so it's really a whole bunch of first-person narratives of the same event.<br /><br />The problem is they got boring.  He cuts off every one of these interviews to leave the story incomplete, really because he's out of fresh material, so they become boring.  He leaves them incomplete because after setting up the scenarios, he doesn't develop any characters that we care about, so he cuts the scenario off right after the beginning.<br /><br />I hope the movie is better than the book.<br /><br />I wanted to like it but I got so bored, as there were no characters to care about.  All the stories in the book get cut off in the middle, and that's exactly what I did with this book.  I got about half way through and removed it from my Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer it is so awsome . Me and my buffs love this game.Hay make a Paris one.it would be so cool. So please make one.
030758836X|2.0|I picked this one up because of its rave reviews, but sadly I am one of the few that does not like this book.  I kept asking when it would get good.  I never cared about the characters- not even enough to hate them.  At one point in the book I did get interested in how the author would finish the story.  No book is for everyone, and the book itself was well written just not a story that I could enjoy.
B008476HBM|4.0|Realmente un cl&aacute;sico, que he le&iacute;do varias veces y puedo seguir leyendo. Digno representante del romanticismo, describe las costumbres de la &eacute;poca en la campi&ntilde;a inglesa
B009CV7IIA|4.0|I typically don't read many books in the Sci-fi genre, but this one was recommended to me by many friends so I picked it up and I am glad I did.  Its a good read! There are countless references to the 80's which added a bit of fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so worth wild you jump on trains coins and many more. I love it. It is my most FAVORITE game ever!!!!!!!
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|If you like the series, then you will like the movie. If you've never seen any of these movies, then this one does explain some of what has happened previously.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is awesome and can't stop playing it. It's similar to Mario and very fun to play all day. I recommended to everyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great and addicting but when are they going to bring out update 0.6.0 on kindle fire it takes a while for updates but it is a great game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game all my friends were talking about it do I tried it and it is the most amazing game EVER!!!!!!!
B009XY97VC|5.0|I've been a big fan of ISFH for a couple years now, and I loved Invincible and Archangel. But Skyworld takes it even further. As much as I love the first two albums, most of the songs still felt like trailer music. This isn't an insult; I love it. But Skyworld is even better, with tracks that sound more like modern classical music, than simply music designed to accompany an epic trailer. Each song is far more distinctive than on the previous albums. (And I loved the surprise dubstep on the first track. So unexpected, but such a great use.) All in all a great album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You get do any thing you want change skins i love it.<br />here are some seeds herobrine ,minecraft pe ,<br />And life 360

B000MRAAJM|2.0|The blue ray quality was not what I was expecting I don't know why it isn't but it's not I feel a little ripped off. And it does not come with the future disc witch is the fifth in the series if you buy it on regular DVD.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|This is great, all the great music of the movie. But I wish they put all the songs in, repeats and what not, it would have been even better.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. Hard to put down. Loved it!! Definitely a keeper. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for s little romance
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Really just amazing music. When I first heard it I wasn't super thrilled, but the more I did the better it got.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My favorite installment of the trilogy was the second one, because it had those ATAT's on Hoth and the Tauntauns.  Thank you for reading.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Hunger games was pretty awesome too.  I read all three of them in like 2 weeks
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This is a excelent knife for the money. It will bring many yours of use. IT is 50$ less than any other knife in its group.. You must check this out before buying other survival knives.... I would much rather buy american made. But not untill buck or other affordable knife maker comes out with one like this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because i always wanted a horse and  this is the game the game to play if u want horse
B009RH9FR6|3.0|Great cover, great protection.  Puts the Kindle to sleep when closed.  The problem is that the Kindle does not lock into the case, falls out if not very careful.  Prop the holder up to watch a movie, the Kindle falls out.  Otherwise a great product.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I can't stop playing. Thumbs up . This is a great game. One of the best that I have played.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love it its a great game besides the 12 hour wait but its still definitely 5 stars this is a must get game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it means that the world is a good thing.I have to get all of the version of this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is awesome. I moved on to Rio I also got luce I love it is awesome.So cool. You should get it.<br />People be nice.(get it) it rocks. It is extordnere.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is out of this world I can't help but get addicted. When I have nothing to do I play this game and I end up playing this game for bout an hour or two. Guess what I'm trying to say is that I love this game!!!
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|There was nothing scary about this movie. There were so many missed opportunities to scare. I liked the other movies but I feel like this one was a complete waste of my time. Such a shame.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's Downton Abbey - what could better - great product that streams well. Good choice buying a season pass and then receiving the remaining episodes earlier than their appearance on PBS.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As many books as I have read on the history of World War II, Ken Follett's insertion of credible characters into the events and circumstances has enhanced my understanding of the period.  My only reservation may be that Follett's personal politics, with a left-wing bias, seem to come through.  I have read nearly everything he has written and never before had a hint of political bias.  Nothwithstanding the political bias, I eagerly await the third volume of the series.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is perfect for my kindle fire. Runs great and does what it's supposed to do. Very happy. Would recommend this product.
B008YCMM2A|4.0|Don't get me wrong....I love the fact that Sony is finally releasing some of the live Miles performances that they've stored for decades.  Keep 'em coming.  The first Bootleg volume of live European recordings of the 2nd great quintet they released a couple of years ago remains one of my favorites.  And this one is nice too....but if you're lucky enough to have the Japanese Sony mid-90's release of the first July Antibes show (the one on Disc 1 of this collection), hang onto it.  The mix on that disc has some occasional distortion, but is SO much more \\"present\\" and exciting to listen to than this newly mastered version.  It was a breathtaking first listen when I picked up a copy at the old Virgin Megastore on Times Square over a decade ago.  And look online for a used copy of the 1992 JMY (Jazz Music Yesterday) label release of this quintet's November 3, 1969 concert in Paris...it's also superior in sound quality and performance to these shows.  It's very nice to finally have the second Antibes show that's on Disc 2--I've read about it for years, and now get to enjoy it.  But I think this package could have been much better in a number of ways.  (Including the ridiculous format of the folded poster liner notes.)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A must read for anybody who's lost, or is about to loose a pet. Be prepared to laugh, but also to cry.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It starts out a little slow but once you get into it its a very good book! The ending was very surprising and unexpected!
0312944098|5.0|I was so pleasantly surprised by \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" which I listened to in audio book format at my local library. The narrator did a wonderful job!<br />I read \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" some 25 years ago, in French (since I'm French), and loved it, especially the long section in the dungeon. What a wonderful novel, what a great storyteller Dumas was!<br />While the plot of \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" was not entirely believable, I was totally willing to go along with it and give it all the necessary license as I was so entertained by the twists and turns in the plot.<br />The court scenes were thrilling and I really liked Danny and cheered for him.<br />This novel inspired me to look for more Jeffrey Archer's titles.<br />Highly recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very addictive game, once I start playing I just can't stop!  Graphics are very colorful and each successive level is challenging.  I had no problems with the download and the play action has been problem free.  Plus, the game is<br /> free!!
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|I've still read very little of PKD's work so a novice on him.  I really enjoyed this one.  Felt liek it was a natural progression from the psy books by Asimov, Van Vogt and others in an earlier age.  Wish there were more stories written like this today.  I kept feeling a connection to the movie Inception.  Very similar feel to it.

0761169431|1.0|My son is a huge fan of Tom Angleberger's Origami Star Wars books, and he asked for this book for Christmas.  While searching for a lost iPod, I came across the book with his attempt to make the Yoda origami.  Unfortunately, I assumed that he hadn't suceeded because he hadn't read the directions or tried hard enough.  Sounds pretty parental, right?  Anyway, in my superior Mom moment, I insisted that the poor kid read the instructions thoroughly and then try one of the easiest origami projects, the Sandcrawler.  God Bless Him, he tried to tell me that it was too hard, but did I listen? Of course not! After watching him struggle unsuccessfully, my superiority started to crumble and a wave of compassion came over me.  I decided to help the poor kid.  After about 10 minutes of helping and failing, I told him to work on his homework and tried to muddle through on my own.  I thought that if I could figure it out, then I could go back and help him learn how to succeed.  After a half and hour, I gave up.  I recommend this book only to those who already have a solid understanding of basic and intermediate origami folds.  The two-dimensional instructions just don't work for beginners.  Perhaps if I had spent some time watching the techniques on youtube.com, I might've figured it out, but when I bought the book, I wanted him to be able to do it himself without having to take a course at MIT first.  Editorially speaking, the book needs organizational help.  If the projects vary in difficulty, please arrange them in the book from easiest to hardest.  In addition, it was even hard to figure out which paper to use.  There are no identifying marks on the origami paper linking it to the project itself (October 2016 update: As Evelyn pointed out in the comments, there are very small identifying marks on the paper between the spine of the book and the perforation.  I apologize for the error).  When I started writing this review, I gave the book three stars.  While typing, the flood offrustrating feelings came back.  I am going to drop it to a one star review especially considering that we really have no use for the book whatsoever.  After writing this review, my son and I tried the Klutz Origami Star Wars book.  Wow!  What a difference.  The step by step, color-coded directions are fantastic.  We easily completed the Naboo Starfighter in 10 minutes.  I highly recommend the Klutz version!

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|well I think lep's world 2is wonderful.  I think it is one of the best games yet. I think a lot ofnpeople will get it.  it is wayyyyy better than the first one. I rat lep's world at a 5stars because it is a fantastic game.
B004EYRIBC|5.0|I saw this on the MP3 store and I realized that I just HAD to get it!  My son is into Star Wars and he LOVES it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great app. Temple Run 2 is like the original Temple Run, but with a few cool additions, like gems and riding on mine carts through tunnels. This is a great game, and anyone who likes the original Tempe Run will love Temple Run 2.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I love these movies and i always said that whenever they came out for a reasonable price i would buy it. I never get tired of watching this because it reminds me of the many conversations my grandfather and i would have about when he lived and saw the things the mob did. he lost friends to the mob and this just brings me back to those days when we would talk about that. miss him a lot. (rip grandpa)
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This was great for our son and for us to sit through.  Some times the kids movies can be rough but I enjoyed this one.  Clever and funny.
B000002KJM|4.0|I have a bunch of ZZ Top on 8 track tapes, albums, and CD's.  Somehow, I never owned First Album until now.  ZZ Top really sounds young and different than they do today.  I think this album shows their inexperience, but there are a few songs that I love on this album.  That inexperience is actually a good thing.  They're just playing the blues the &#34;old-time&#34; rock way.  There is only a hint of the ZZ Top personality there.  But Certified Blues and Brown Sugar are great songs.  There's also some almost country sound to a couple of songs.  Billy uses the slide so well; I'm not sure why he has abandoned it today.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|super fun! great use of the theme! great way to pass the time and the kids love it too yay!
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I've never seen a single episode of 21 Jump Street. That didn't matter, because this movie was absolutely hilarious. The hero of the film is Channing Tatum, who is (somehow) funnier than comedy veteran Jonah Hill. This Blu Ray is awesome.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this game with out knowing what the first game was even about and I'm glad I downloaded it. I play it all the time now! It is better that the first temple run (graphic wise). If you are looking for a game to play when ever you get bored, this is the game. Although, some people might think your a little crazy constantly twisting your kindle fire around... but this game is worth it!
B000002I6X|4.0|Enjoyable album with a variety of style and song type. From a phase of his career that was very productive.  For me a phase where he was at the top of his skill.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You guys will love this game. You might need to remove it from your device and install it and click on the game again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|awesome like the other reviews. But has a bug on Kindle Fire where it crashes back to main Kindle adrenalin when using a SaveMe gem and takes the gem count away before the crash. otherwise it iis well done game.
B007SGM084|5.0|This  book serious is now forever one of my favorites, I highly recommend it!!!! This bundle was with the money. You won't regret it!!!
B0083V2VW8|5.0|My dad and I watched this movie and were blown away by the quality of the Criterion Blu ray. I have watched a couple of the special features, as well and this is a must-buy for fans of the Who or the Criterion collection.
B008B92U32|3.0|My 6 year old son and I had a good laugh swapping our faces. It's cute but there are things that I would change. Using the Kindle Fire HD, it really annoys me that the program constantly zooms in if I touch the screen. It makes it hard to adjust the box around the face with it zoomed in. I wish I could choose to zoom in myself. I also wish I could adjust the brightness or coloring of the faces. A face in shadow doesn't work. Also, even though you can rotate the face boxes, it's very difficult to get the face at the correct angle so it looks right. This program basically just makes copies of each face and puts it over the other (so the original face is still underneath.) The edges of the top face &quot;copies&quot; are transparent, which can be a problem because you can see the face underneath. If that face has something like glasses on, it doesn't work very well. Overall as FAOTD it's an okay app. I personally wouldn't pay $2 for it though.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I can't get the 0.6.0 update it looks really cool but....I CAN'T GET IT!!! I think Amozon should fix this little problem.<br />  Other wise its a great game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun game. I play it every day.  I want a different game from this from the producers.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is an OK app. It wasn't as good as expected. I thought it would be little better. I do like on the other hand that you can take pictures of the horse.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I was pleasantly suprised at the quality of this case. Much nicer than the one's I saw at the Big Box stores. Gets the job done for a  reasonable price.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Finally, the Blu Ray remaster of Jaws. The fact that it took so long for them to put together definitely shows, since the quality is (besides maybe E.T. and Criterion releases) unmatched with other Blu ray remasters. The special features are also excellent. This is a must have for even the casual Jaws fan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is a great temple run two. it has ziplines, caves, jungles, bridges, etc. if you love temple run you adore temple run two
B005LAJ16I|5.0|VEry exciting!  I tried very hard to watch one epicode per night as I was on vacation.  It was not easy.  I could have had an &#34;all nighter&#34; and watched the whole season.  Can't wait for season 2.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Interesting read, not what I expected<br /> Interesting read. Mysterious fiction. I enjoyed it, nice change of pace, good quick read
B003UESJHO|5.0|This is a great movie. Its one of the best Ive seen in a long time. Trust me you will like the movie.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I've made my usual mistake and picked up this book only after I watched the movie, and yet, I couldn't put it down.<br />I can't really say my life is anything like Charlie's, but I found myself connecting very strongly to Charlie's character. Maybe it's the style the book is written in, or maybe it's because I could see myself in some of the same situations, but the book really drew me in, so much so that in some point I actually found myself speaking in the style of Charlie.<br />There's nothing much I can write about the story itself, it's very different from what I usually read, and I rarely get drawn into such stories (I'm more of a fantasy/Sci-Fi guy) but everything in this story felt very real, like it actually happens. I have to admit the ending was a bit of a spoil for me, but that's probably just because I can't put myself in that position, whereas throughout the book I've read it as if I myself was experiencing everything that's going on.<br /><br />Bottom line: I can't give the book 5 stars, but only because I don't think it's for everyone. But if you ever felt a wallflower yourself, If you were that shy teenager, this book will be great for you. Even if it's only for the fun experience of  coming out of that shy shell again.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|As a huge fan of the Ocean's Trilogy, I would love to see a collector's set sometime in the future. This set, however, is quite alright. Each movie now has its own commentary and there are some fun featurettes thrown in. I recommend this to anyone interested in the trilogy since, at this price, its pointless to buy them individually.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I totally agree that it is kid appropriate. I love it. So addictive. Buy it. Should be at least 5 cents.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game on the Amazon app store!!! The only thing is I that I cannot find out how to update!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Ive just buy the apps and for my surprise is NOT the new version 0.6.0/0.6.1 ..... WHERE IS THE NEW VERSION????????????????????? no updates detected and the update where release 01/30/13 .....
B001JV5BIA|5.0|This is a milestone movie due to the fact it pushed limits and for that era it was extreme. The remake was a lot more extreme but it doesn't hurt to check out the original
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I originally downloaded this for my daughter. I started playing it to help her through some obstacles now I play it more than her!
B000TGCR3S|4.0|The art and animation in Tekkon Kinkreet is reason enough to see it. The story, however, is just okay. As far as anime goes (and I'm far from an expert) this is some good stuff. Endlessly creative.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Nice story line, however, by the description I thought it was going to be something more.....older.  It was a good book though, if you need to quench your thirst for a quick read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the quick pace and twisty plot<br />Great characters that make you want to shake them and make them behave but what fun would that be?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game almost like temple<br />It is different though by being in a subway station<br /><br />And free all of u should doenload now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is probably the best game ever on the kindle or any device and here's the only bad thing everything is so many coins and other item things.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love the fact that they didn't start the best part until the end. So many movies like to throw in the climax of the movie more towards the middle, thus making the end of the movie bland. There were so many different ways they could have gone with this movie, but this ending was the best one I have seen in a while. There was no what I like to call many exciting parts with music that bumped, but it wasn't boring either. It was intriguing.<br /><br />When I first heard of this movie on a commercial, I thought it would have been more of a comedy with the few funny clips. Now I haven't watched this movie in the theaters at all and that made me a bit disappointed. It made me even more just after I watched it. It was a great movie. I love the fact that there was actual footage of the balls movement. You were able to tell if the pitch was a breaking ball, change-up, or fastball. I really love the fact that they got all of the ball moving from the pitchers hand to the catchers glove without losing sight of the ball. As a baseball player, this is good graphics.<br /><br />For the movie overall rating was five stars because I thought there was no part in the movie where there was bad quality. There was the right timing for all of the action, and the fact that Clint Eastwood did a heck of a job.
B009K45Y62|4.0|the movie is definitely a 5/5 for me. I was very eager to by this broken cowl edition and was not disappointed with its quality. However, I was disappointed with the way the actual blu rays were packaged. They are in a small, annoying case that slides into the back of the cowl. I thought an actual Blu ray case would be inside the statue; not the case. Since I'm a huge fan of the trilogy, I will be buying the collector's trilogy that is supposedly coming out later this year, so its not a big deal. If you are a huge fan of the movies, I definitely recommend this edition, however if you just want the movie to complete your trilogy, then I'd grab the regular Blu ray which contains the same features.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There was no story to this but a little too much sex (enough).  I think it ruined it for the other two books.  I'm just wondering if she woke up to see what life and love is all about!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i could spend hours at a time playing this game!!!!! jUST NEEDS MORE LEVELS so you can continue to accumulate doser dollars

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so addicting. But not in a bad way. I would reccomend this game to people who have quick reflections
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a really cool game to be honest this is the best game I've ever played. It is adventurous and awesome. This game can keep you busy for a long time.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|This set is a gift from the old gods and the new. I honestly can't think of a TV show that has put together such a packed box set for a single season of something. Commentaries, episode-guides, and AMAZING picture and audio quality. I couldn't recommend this set more if I tried.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This processor works well. It's reliable and fast. I was surprised to see that it was only rated 7.6 on the Windows Experience Index. I have no complaints with it and the processing speed is up to my expectations.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new Temple Run 2 is awesome!!! There are new adventures and everything changed, on how it looks. You will love it. :)
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is a great game. Iike that it moves fast. Several challanges.  I highly recommend it. Due to the time limits it's geared more for adults.
0761171703|5.0|The photos in this are beautiful. This is a great gift for any dancer. I teach dance classes and gave this as a gift to another teacher... she loved it!
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|In simple terms explains most of the things you need to know about the HTML5 standard also has the plus that was for free on kindle :)
B000FKP4BU|5.0|This movie is incredibly original. Rian Johnson is one of the greatest up and coming directors and his debut feature film tells us why. JGL delivers a fantastic performance with some of the best dialogue in recent memory. The DVD is fine, but I want a jam-packed Criterion Blu ray. One can hope.
B00973902K|5.0|How can you get this song out of your head? It's fun and silly and has been endlessly parodied. Give it a listen and relax.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game. It is very addicting and sometimes frustrating, but for the most part it is fun. (:
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and very addictive! It is a little like temple run but the colors and scenes are better!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I liked this game at first but after I exited out it wouldn't work when I tried to play again. it would be a great game if that were fixed.
0321127420|5.0|I buy this for a friend and is a really good book that goes deep on the subject of the enterprise patterns
B000H1RFKA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I know a lot of people agree. However, not enough people know about it. If you like well-written movies, this is one. If you are looking forward to the next Iron Man film, guess what? Same director. Pick this movie up now at a great price.
1616550414|4.0|I consider myself an extremely hardcore Zelda fan. I have almost every entry in the main series; I own Ocarina of Time on Wii (Virtual Console), N64 (regular and Collector's Edition), and GameCube (Master Quest). I've been playing the series for years and am intrigued by the characters and the saga. I am thus happy to have purchased the definitive history of the series.<br /><br />Yet the priorities for this book seem a bit off. It's easy reading and great for a coffee table. Non-fans could enjoy the pretty visuals and simple summaries. Hardcore fans, though, have been demanding a thorough and comprehensive historical account. I want text; I want explanations; I want depth. This book is not as probing or revealing as I had hoped.<br /><br />The \\"Historia\\" in the title does not ring true in practice. In addition to the lore history, I was looking for some history as to the creation of the series. Where are insights into the mind of Miyamoto? How about in-depth interviews about the origin of the series? What inspired specific enemies? Here we see the output of the creative process but none of the inputs.<br /><br />The artwork is pretty but not surprising. What new insights could I gain from sketches of Princess Zelda that have been published for years? The focus on Skyward Sword is clearly aimed to draw in the more recent crowd. The inclusion of the manga just reinforces the attention to the new at the expense of the old.<br /><br />This book will be fan favorite for many reasons. The letters from Miyamoto and Aonuma are heartfelt. The design is warm and appropriate. The cover is spectacular by any measure; great job with the foil. The book was made as a tribute to this series and I see it as such. In other words, I love the intentions here. But this could have been so much more.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is great! A must read book of one of our greatest American heros.  Please read and then pass it on to someone else to read.

0525422943|5.0|This book deserves a lot more than what it gets credit for, and I'll say this Gayle Forman has done it again. If I Stay is a two book series at the moment, that both books are so raw, emotional, and even inspiring. These books live up to Before I Fall by Lauren Oliver and I'm not sure as a combined pair which one I would prefer to re-read first (between Before I Fall and the If I Stay series). Both are fantastically done, but what differs is the type of emotion Gayle taps into in her series.<br /><br />  The book burns with greif, abandonment issues, and even a life Adam doesn't want to be living. The raw depression he sinks into time and time again when he remembers Mia and the what happened after her stay at the hospital. With the book taking three years after the accident that left Mia without a immediate family and leaving Adam, the book focuses on Adam's unresolved issues and what he needs to move on and become whole again.<br /><br />  How the two connect in this book, I thought it would be more of a happen chance that \\"music\\" seems to bring them together and a fire starts. However apparently Gayle thought that would be too easy and thus Where She Went was born. The two do meet when Adam is left in New York, because he won't board a play on Friday the thirteenth and he finds a concert hall where Mia is playing. He listens to her, and things pick up from there.<br /><br />  Mia and Adam for the single day they learn a lot more than what they probably intended about how each of them have changed. How Mia has moved on past her parents and family's deaths, and is making a life for herself in the music world. I figured through some of her speak and the context of some of the words that even if she does enjoy the music and in the moments she's playing can see and feel her family again, there is something about all of it that bothers her.<br /><br />  However, the biggest issue is Adam. This story of how he feels completely left out of the grieving process. He was close to Mia's family as well, but wasn't expected or allowed to grieve or feel bad for what happened to Mia at all. Then when Mia left, there was a void, something inside him that I believe exploded. When he finally lashed out there was a sudden success in the band Shooting Stars fame and popularity through the songs that Adam wrote.<br /><br />  There were times when reading this book, and reading some of the excerpts of the lyrics from the songs (which were fantastic), that I wished they were real songs. Maybe they are and I'm not looking hard enough, but to me that would be something out of this world and give me a better insight to what was trying to be conveyed, the tone, the personality behind all the lyrics. With the lyrics though, you can tell the pain Adam is in, the sort of loss and emptiness he feels.<br /><br />  The ending, I won't give it away, was breathtaking. I thought I knew how it was going to end, and when my thought fluttered across the pages with more to go, I was a little bit beside myself. It wasn't a bad ending, it wasn't that it was predictable, it was something that was just so well done that it guided me through the plot and when I thought I understood what was coming there was still something I didn't look or forsee to be told.<br /><br />  Gayle Forman is a fantastic author and I hope the very best for her, and any other books that she puts out. I can't wait to see future books done by her, and I highly highly recommend her to any one who wants to get into a seriously deep emotional book.

B009K0P10K|3.0|The fact that there is a season 2 suggests this story will never get resolved - a new character or villain is always popping up.  Season 1 was fascinating because you didn't know how it would end - well Season 2 suggests it never will and I find I am rapidly becoming bored.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|This album has much to love. Most of the tunes are catchy and memorable. The artistic variety on display here is impressive. You'll see a sampling of different styles and personas, and all of it communicates a raw passion. Here we peer into the heart and mind of a social commentator and musician.

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay, it was one of those books that I couldn't put down. I was enthralled with knowing what would happen to Peeta, Katniss, and Finnick. I was happy to see some of the other characters back from the ending of Catching Fire. Although with this book, I had my doubts and troubles trying to understand some of the characters in this book.<br /><br />  Finnick I understood. His development and what he goes through is far beyond what I could imagine. Even yet, there is part of me that started to feel sorry and sad for him when his girlfriend comes back; and yet near the end you want to admire him for all the sacrifices he makes not only for that girl, but Katniss and everyone else as well. There is so much to Finnick and so much that I hated for the book to end, I wanted to know more about him.<br /><br />  Peeta and Gale finally get down and dirty and talk about who should be with Katniss. At that point I finally screamed about time you two put things together. I wanted them to both turn and scream obscenities at Katniss and both leave her. Yet that doesn't seem to happen and I found myself wondering if the outcome was really plausible.<br /><br />  Peeta's character goes through a huge ordeal that I won't spoil. When Peeta takes the main stage and the light shines on who he is, his character twists and bends into a broken mess. Which suits the world they live in, and ultimately I felt his pain, felt sorry for Peeta and everything he went through to protect Katniss. As well, even after everything he's been through, he's still clinging to Katniss declaring how much he still cares for her.<br /><br />  The rebellion and the sense of destruction as Katniss goes to see the crumbling districts, the war that evolves around her makes her step out of her shell again. Katniss goes from this weakling and a heroin I hated in Catching Fire, to this spokesperson for war and the rebellion. I enjoyed this point of Katniss to a point, she still had these thoughts of a damaged person, and rightfully she should at this point.<br /><br />  The world building in this was superb, I wish there was more of it at times. The scenery, the destruction, and devastation of the people and environment was jaw-dropping. Yes jaw-dropping, for a book. I felt the pain of Peeta, and everyone else that died. Even the one small insignificant cat that morphed into the most powerful emotional tool the series had held. I wanted more; I wanted to feel more of the evolution of the people and the relationships.<br /><br />  The ending... That's what everyone wants to know about right? I hated it, it wasn't the fact that I didn't like it or like it. The ending was superb and I doubt anyone could have done a better ending, but it was like a bittersweet ending. The loss, the pain, the suffering along the way, to me didn't justify that everything was all right. The damaged couple at the end, the torment and sleepless nights they would have to endure because of what they had to endure.

0844659770|5.0|Much of the world has as yet to catch up with Hannah Arendt, who, after Hiroshima, presciently observed that a conventional war could never again be won and that war would take the shape of occupation, that the level of violence in what we now know today as the post-modern world was becoming radically entropic, and that revolutions would become increasingly localized and proliferate beyond the control of states.<br />Arendt went to cover the Eichmann trial like many others expecting to confront a monster, the man who \\"engineered\\" the Final Solution, who boasted that he would \\"dance into his grave\\" responsible for the deaths of 5-6 million Jews.  What she found was a barely articulate former Vacuum Cleaner salesman (that's right - before joining the Nazi Party, almost by accident, as she chronicles - he was employed by the Vacuum Oil Company for five years - which he recalled as among the most satisfying of his life.  He had vague ambitions of becoming an engineer in his youth, but, because of his limited intellect, his noted aversion to reading and learning in general, and apparently habitual indolence, he was never to attain even the equivalent of our basic undergraduate degree.) She notes, and one can feel assured from reading this model of research that no one, with the exception of perhaps the Judges, read the transcipts of the trial and the police interrogations with such care and depth, that the absurdity of Eichmann's testimony and his evident limitations, were in point of fact hysterically funny.  But, as she notes, Eichmann, though he often appeared to be, could not be considered a \\"clown\\" - the enormity of his crimes was so great, uprecedented.<br />This striking dichotomy - between the mediocrity of the man and horrifying enormity of his crimes - is where Arendt actually begins her investigation.  Her former teacher, and shockingly, for better or worse, her lover, Heidegger (notiously also for a while, at least, a Nazi) observed that truth is often revealed in the tying together of idiosyncratic opposites. Thus, her method here imo, is unmistakenly Heideggerian.<br />But more telling is her application of Heidegger's salient observation that modern humanity is in the gravest danger of losing the essential quality which defines us as human: the ability to THINK about what we are doing, to reflect on what we are doing.  The point is somewhat Kantian - but Heidegger does not insist on principle.  He divides what he calls \\"thinking\\" into two domains: calculative thinking and medititative thinking.<br />Calculative thinking, as exciting as its techological products may seem, is essential banal, profane - we might say. We all do it - as we must to survive.  Caluclation goes on endlessly.<br />The destruction of the European Jewery was intricately calculated.  Arendt calls the crime \\"administrative massacre\\".  Again and again, she denies both the legal and logical relevance of \\"the cog in the machine\\" argument of the defense.  Thus, in no way does Arendt claim that \\"the banality of evil\\" is simply being a cog in the machine, and assuming the abnormal and radically immoral to be normal.  What she is saying is the Eichmann and the millions of Hitler's \\"willing executioners\\" and shared in their inability to reflect upon what they were doing.  They simply did it.  Each may have had their own particular motivations - the key point is that evil is strictly naked calculative thinking - thinking without that ability to reflect on the moral quality and import of our caluculations.<br />Is this bureaucratic blindness with the piped in musak which we have in America today any different from the atmosphere of our Nazi forbears?  I think not.<br />This monster, the destruction of our very claim to humanity, by acceptance of the banality of evil, was the real monster in that room of the horror of horrors we know as Shoah.ed in the tying together of idiosyncratic opposites.

006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium was a slight let down. I was looking for more information about Lena and Alex, and it was almost completely left out of this book. I was furious with this, and the world brought into frame, was completely different. I was happy for this change and it's probably the best redeeming factor in the book.<br /><br />  This time around, Lauren Oliver decides to go a different route then traditional chapters; she uses a Now - Then setup for the \\"chapters.\\" At first it took me a bit to get used to the jumping back and forth and trying to catch the small little time lapses between the jumps in the timelines. However, I think this was done rather well. The world in the past when Lena deals with the loss of Alex and moves on slowly as the group of Invalids or Wilds lives everyday life, and is forced to move due to winter and other extraneous factors, mirrored with the hidden lifestyle and the new Lena in the current timeline. I enjoyed it in the end, but I wouldn't do it again in Requiem.<br /><br />  Lauren Oliver does a great job creating a world, the Wilds kept me asking for more. The inner workings of the city-scape wowed me with every turn. I believe that's what Lauren Oliver does best, take the world we see in everyday and pretty much take for granted, and manages to get it down to paper in such a poetic and imaginative way that everyone understand the hustle and bustle of the city. The betrayal and torturous world Lena and Julia were involved in, and the harsh and unforgiving wilds both kept me going, more so than the relationship did this time around.<br /><br />  Lena, her character in this book was hard to discern. I've said this over and over, I HATE LOVE TRIANGLES. Julian I really disliked, and wanted Alex to be the one and only. Julian was too easy, he is just too off. There is something there with Julian that makes him too weak, to unrealistic to be a real character. Lena despite my wishes and desires does go into this love triangle, well I guess you wouldn't call it one cause she is under the impression that Alex is dead, but still... I disliked the relationship between Julian and Lena, it just seemed to... easy I guess.  There was something off with it that didn't get me involved or want them to be together.<br /><br />  Overall it was a great book, the book ends in a cliffhanger. Giving Requiem a good base to start on; I can't wait. But... I hate the ending to Pandemonium, for obvious reasons.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A powerful story of the trauma of childhood sexual abuse, and it's far-reaching evil.  The truths revealed in this story hit the reader right in the gut; I felt like I was going to be sick.  Well written with the possible exception of Sky's descriptions of her sexual encounters with Holder.  Her reactions seem too old for seventeen, and much too normal for the victim of such incestual abuse.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!<br /><br />This is the unrated Extended Cut which gives two possible endings depending on which one you choose it is happy or sort of not.  After watching this movie I tracked down the book that this was originated from, The Dark Fields which later they renamed to the name of this movie.<br /><br />The book sheds more light into the drug AZT and gives a more grim picture than what the movie version goes into.  I do not know if the book &#34;Limitless&#34; is word for word the same as &#34;The Dark Fields&#34;  or if the movie titled book is the movie in print form.  I just went and tracked down the original title, which is much darker than the movie and goes into more aspects of the character and events that the movie glosses over.  The movie ending and the book ending are different and the story is slanted different as well so if you watched the movie go read the book as it adds more to the experience and vice versa.<br /><br />This movie is one of my top favorite movies. The acting is good and I think they did a good job with casting the main character, he seems to fit the role.<br /><br />I wouldn't get so caught up into the drug or possibilities of finding some similar product or mechanism to reproduce what is shown in the movie. It doesn't exist and if it did go read the book and it will scare the hell out of you to ever want to try something like this for real.  It is a MOVIE, it's entertainment only!

0439023483|4.0|This is one of my favorite books, mainly because it's the start of a series that just impacts everything. This series is much more than what you think, or have been told the book represents. And for those out there who say that this is similar to Twilight... I will shank your big toe! I will note this up front, if you are reserve about which to see first the book or the movie, Definitely the Movie. The book beats the movie (as always) by a significant margin and changes a few things that tarnish the book.<br /><br />  Katniss Everdeen, this female character is one of the strongest fictional characters that I have read about to this date. In fact she's currently my second favorite character of all time (next to Tris Prior from Divergent by Veronica Roth). She has this femininity about her that draws you in and you feel her emotion, passion, and every decision and situation she makes. However, she as well has this dark side to her that makes her far more than just a girl/woman, which brought me in closer and wanting more. Great character!<br /><br />  This book about the games, is the beginning of probably one of the most notorious love triangles in young adult fictional books. I would like to note that I hate love triangles, they are dumb, complicated, and end up not being worth the time reading about. So... This one had my attention, I felt the emotion between Peeta, Gale, and Katniss, but at the same time the triangle didn't have the depth to it, it lacked something from Katniss or Gale. Like there was supposed to be a response, or just something that lingers in the back of your mind. It was a great triangle, made you tug to which one she should or shouldn't be with.<br /><br />  The buildup to the games was slow and boring, but I understood why it was needed. Without the training sessions and getting to know some of the other characters, there would be this disjointed feeling between the games and the characters in it. As well, one of the most prolific support characters wouldn't have had as much meaning as what she did.<br /><br />  The games were magnificent; there was a sense of fear around every branch, hidden in the background of the trees. I felt that the tributes were portrayed accurately, the fear and some of the enthusiasm and arrogance in some of them. When the games began, I felt the raw power and brutality that the games bring about. As well as the pain and how the relationships are changed and molded over and over throughout the games cycle.<br /><br />  The issue I had with this book was the other districts. I was left wondering about the people in the other districts and wanted to see more of them and what they did for a living. It was something that I felt left a gaping hole in the middle of the world building. In fact the entire world building is confined to the Capitol and District 12, so I feel safe to assume I'm right in questioning why none of the other districts were involved.

0385738757|4.0|James Dashner does it again; there is something about his work that just pulls me into his world. The world building in his series is something to die for. I read this right after I finished my copy of The Maze Runner and together there was this new attachment that pulled me into this book, which I just didn't get in the first. I found myself screaming at the world that Thomas was thrown into this, and with the new addition of Brenda being added into the mix, it brought a new wave of excitement.<br /><br />  Now when Brenda shows up and adds this whole love triangle mix, with Teresa and all, I was starting to get leery of the idea of it working in this context. Mainly because I didn't picture Thomas as the type of person to jungle two people like that, and frankly I was right. The triangle seemed to stop almost as fast as it picked up. And Teresa, her metamorphosis in this book was fantastic; you WILL hate her by the end of the book.<br /><br />  Now, I will agree this book was miles from the first one. The world that was built was good, even the danger at the end of the book felt real and I didn't want to put it down. However, there was this lack of motivation to get somewhere. For instance in The Maze Runner, I got the idea that there was this need to get out, a need to be pulled into the maze and understand and figure out the puzzle. Here in the desert with all the cranks and whatnot there wasn't that. It was a big hole that just kept the group of boys running aimlessly toward a goal, or they supposedly would die.<br /><br />  But I do believe this book has a better character feel to it, I enjoyed Thomas and Brenda better in this story and how they were developed. The problem with Thomas though, was he seemed to understand or sense things way too easily. Like he almost could read their minds easily. I was happy to see some of the characters change though, for instance Teresa and her whole betrayal. I loved it, it gave knew light to what she would do in order to accomplish a goal and left me breathless when it all came together.<br /><br />  The best part again, is the main plot what WICKED is after and what their goal is still isn't answered. The book is setup to end well in The Death Cure, and I can't wait to get into it. I look forward to the questions and tribulations that plague everyone's mind, in this series, finally being answered in the last book. I just hope Dashner can keep it going.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|All I kept thinking about was True Blood. Who doesn't have issues with their parents? And, which girl doesn't have issues in other parts of her life? This book can be any girl, but still provides the fantasy of romance and exploring a different path. I know my Wiccan friends will share with their families.<br /><br />The flow of the story was superb and the story engulfs you. I dare to say it could be a tv or online series that would be quite popular. If you're looking for different, this is the book. If you're not that adventurous of a reader, I highly suggest you take the leap with this book. It is worth it.<br /><br />I see that it says Series #1, so I'm looking forward to the 2nd one.
0525421033|4.0|I had high hopes for If I Stay, I wanted this to be a book that could live up to Before I Fall. Okay I know that's pretty steep expectations, but I was looking for a book that had the same emotional pull. I wanted a book that not only did I get invested in, but I felt myself myself grieve with the characters, I wanted to feel their pain,  I wanted most of all a book that got me emotionally involved. Not only did I want to be involved and completely invested, I wanted to feel that pull into the book like Before I Fall did and here If I Stay did the next closest thing.<br /><br />  I was shocked at this book, there was something about this book, I wasn't sure if it was the ghostly feeling of Mia watching herself in a comatose state while all of her family members were close by. Her boyfriend Adam, I thought would be the most emotional part of the book, but her honestly wasn't. For me her grandparents were the deciding factor, the realization of what happened to Teddy, there was numerous parts, but Adam really didn't get me all that involved. I guess I can't say that entirely, there was the good conversation with Adam and Mia at the end that finally managed to pull me in, but personally there was things with Adam, that I disagreed with.<br /><br />  Now I will say this, Yea I did disagree with some of Adam's actions and mostly it may be a personal decision of what I would have done in that situation (because I was in a similar situation, not as severe though). Saying that I can say that it is plausible, and I do know what lengths a boyfriend would go through to see a girlfriend and to what ends and creativity he would go through just to hold her hand. I did want Adam's plan to see her succeed, and while it did sort of, it just didn't bring the result I was looking for.<br /><br />  Mia... I honestly was intrigued by the tales of this story, her decisions and passions throughout the book. I got completely invested in her character and her decisions just bore into you. The complete emotional involvement and how the book didn't just pull me in, it drug me (even if it was willingly). I found myself more than once crying at some of the family members reactions and sometimes I find myself thinking back to it and starting all over again. The book did great at pulling at every string that was around.<br /><br />  As well, the past \\"memories\\" of Mia and her family brought the book home. I think without those memories her character would've been completely flat and not as complex as it could have been. I was happy they were there; as well, they seemed to foreshadow some of the events that would happen and gave reason behind some of her choices while she was in the comatose state. The one memory I didn't quite understand was the whole first sexual experience between Adam and Mia, it seemed almost out of place and like it didn't even belong. I found myself on more than one occasion questioning why that was there, and frankly I don't know.<br /><br />  Now, eventually I will fire up and read the second part of this series, Where She Went. I am hoping that book is just as good as this one!

1616550414|5.0|Firstly, I wanted to get through the entire book, cover to cover before reviewing and I am glad I did.<br /><br />If you just flip through with a glance, it will look like it is primarily a Skyward Sword book, but it is far from it. It is amazing how much information and images are stored in this.. what can only be described as the Bible of the Legend of Zelda series. A good looking, sturdy book on the outside, and packed full of goodies on the inside.<br /><br />It does go into a good amount of detail about Skyward Sword, but I feel it has more than enough information and images about the rest of the games. I love the chronology of the games, as well as the admittance that the story was never really a primary focus and there are discrepancies, it just happened. I adore the concept art from the games. It's amazing to see how concept goes to final. The detail of how each game fits together is lovely and I really enjoyed the bonus Manga, it really makes me hope another game comes before Skyward Sword someday!<br /><br />I'd recommend this to old and new fans alike. It's a good brush up for old, and a good learning experience for new. I'm so glad I have this, inside and out, it is a perfect addition to the Legend of Zelda fandom.

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire, this one wasn't hard for me at all. After reading the first and going straight into this book, I couldn't put it down. However, this review will focus on Catching Fire alone, as if it was a book by its own. I will talk about the series later, after the review is finished for all the individual books alone.<br /><br />  With the book, the scenery and the characters change dramatically. I found myself more and more yelling at Katniss for being a pansy in this book, rather than the strong, calm, and collected character in the first book. This book is where more or less, I found myself questioning Katniss and her change, and the book where I hate Katniss the most. However, the other characters in this book fill in those gaps where Katniss should be shining, when a prolific main character just isn't there.<br /><br />  The world building in this book really only came into play with the new set of games coming, and what they bring to Katniss and Peeta. The other districts start to come to life, and what is going on in each of the districts. Seeing them and trying to understand what they are like and how they differ from District 12, brings life to the book and the scenery. However, I do wish the book would've slowed down through some of the districts, so they could be built just a bit better.<br /><br />  I felt lost and disjointed from the other districts and I wanted to get to know the others. I was already invested into the series and wanted to know more about the others, but that just didn't happen. In the other districts though, I started to realize the rebellion and see just how far they've come, and what they were willing to do.<br /><br />  The best building block for this book was the character building. Katniss's transformation into a self-righteous death to save Peeta, and how she became this pansy of a character made me mad. Peeta and Gale took the limelight here; they both got more involved with Katniss. As much as I hate Love Triangles, this one worked. I found myself rooting for Peeta, go Team Peeta! I found that he's just a more likeable character, and genuinely is more interested in Katniss than Gale seems to be.<br /><br />  Overall the book was a great sequel in the series. I highly doubt this book would have been much more than a sequel if anyone other than Suzanne Collins had done this book. The way the dialogue was done, the world building, and the character details were breathtaking and I found myself wanting more out of this book.ne worked.

B006ID6NDQ|4.0|I liked this book but didnt love it. One has to be in the right mood for such a serious book, and I read it while on vacation which was the wrong time. The writing is good, the story strong enough that I wanted to finish it but not more.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I will read it again and maybe again.  Ayn Rand had a mind like no other.  Her characters are perfect and each fits into her story to last forever.  The story line takes one into the world of architecture leaving not only a feeling of talent, wonderment, beauty and glory; but also jealousy, dishonesty, manipulation and more. Above all, it is a love story and a story of great accomplishment against all odds.

0385742886|4.0|The Kill Order I was nervous of because Thomas and Teresa didn't seem to take part in this novel. And I was right, for the most part. The book focuses on Mark, Trina, Alec, Lana, and a few other friends; and all the events that happened to play part before WICKED was formed. Well I should say while WICKED was forming. My huge hesitation on this book was far far from justified, I enjoyed this book and how it explain<br /><br />  The introduction to this book is what had me hooked. It starts after the Flare, after everyone has tried to come together and seem to be working together in the long hot days. How the group shows up and starts the beginning of the book, and plunges the whole story into chaos is just outstanding. I love how Dashner just introduced the characters and immediately plunges them all into peril.<br /><br />  Throughout the book, we get to see pieces of the past. How Mark and Alec became friends and just how important those two are to each other. Than Mark and Trina how they find each other and seem to bond together as a couple and friends in all the devastation. The dreams Mark has tell the past of how their group survived the Flare and even more throughout trials of time. Each ordeal made me realize just how deadly the world had become, and through the beginning years after the Flare how the people turned on each other to live.<br /><br />  The Cranks are even explained in this book, even though I don't believe they are given that name in this book. I didn't make the connection at first, but when more of the Cranks appeared and how they manifested and their nature just took me by surprise. James Dashner did a brilliant job with this book and explaining just how everything began.<br /><br />  I don't want to go into the rest of the book, because it may give away some of the information of who one of the characters is, and why this story is important is to some of the bits. However, I don't know if someone read this book before The Maze Runner if they would understand the story better. If someone wants to try this and hasn't read the series, I would appreciate it if you told me what you thought of the story and if reading The Kill Order helped or not. Anyways, the book is great!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a fun read. I was looking for something that wasn't going to waste my time and/or money, and saw all the positive reviews for these books. I'm so glad they were all written when I found them as it would have been real hard to wait for the next one. As it was, it was hard to wait until I picked it up again each day! Thanks, Mr. Howey, and I've just ordered the next group of 3!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|What a fun app. My granddaughters love it as much as I do. Very clear graphics and entertaining as well if your a horse lover you'll enjoy it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved the story, May have to read it again,<br />It was very hard to put down. I definitely recommend this book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun. It's more interesting than temple run. The changing themes/locations keep it fresh. It is addicting. Overall, Subway Surfer is great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is addicting. but it stimulates my brain. its not like those junk apps lying around. its good :-)
0385738773|4.0|I am mixed about this, there were parts of this book that blew everything open and made my eyes wide as the series concluded in a grand finale. However, there were parts of this book that I wanted to slap Thomas and Brenda both, Teresa's change and need to prove herself to Thomas after what she did in The Scorch Trials was almost sickening, but I still felt kind of sorry for her.<br /><br />  Anyways to the bread and butter, I did enjoy this book a lot. I loved the finale and enjoyed everything up to the very end. How the series conclude I didn't quite get, it's not that I didn't understand it; more of I don't think it was completely believable. It's a slap in the face, WICKED wins again. As well, there was a huge lack of emotion at the end, there was no joy, no sense of victory which also aided to this ultimate depression of an ending.<br /><br />  I was extremely happy with this new world, the complete reveal of Wicked and the real snow capped mountain/forest landscape and city. I enjoyed the change of pace, as well it was almost nice to not have to worry about the whole games taking place during the whole series of the book, but the real question I asked myself when I finished was it? I mean could the trials be almost the same as everyday life? I mean the reveal of the Cranks and what they were capable of, and how they were spreading everywhere, and slowly taking over humanity was terrifying, but at the same time brought the games to real life.<br /><br />  Now the one thing I did miss, and I wish it was there really. I wanted to know what Thomas was like before the wipe and what made him believe this would be a good idea? Why did he begin the Maze Trials and whatnot? I guess we'll all have to wait until Kill Order for that reveal, I can't wait either!
B009GENZ12|1.0|I chose this movie because I thought it was a horror film.  After it ended, the roomful of people all glared at me in disappointment that I subjected them to this awful film.<br /><br />If you've read other reviews, you might believe that there is a \\"twist\\" to it.  I think the word twist is misleading because it might make you believe that something interesting might occur.  I assure you, it won't.  The film's best moment is when it finally comes to an end.<br /><br />I don't appreciate being deceived and lied to.  The makers of this film trick you into watching the movie with a shamefully deceptive summary.  Billed as a horror movie with the description, cover artwork, and even listed as a horror film in many instant movie watching services, its really an ODD social tale and the anticipated twist is a MAJOR letdown and actually is quite boring.<br /><br />What is really sad about the movie, is that its extremely slow and uneventful.  Some might think its justified because you're waiting for something interesting to happen, but since nothing interesting actually happens, the slowness and boring was all for nothing.<br /><br />I don't want you to waste your time, don't make the same mistake that I did.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I did not know who this author was.  I just heard that the book was good, read the trailer and was hooked. A great love story and the title does it justice. Both main characters broken and come out better.  Loved the supporting characters esp the sister who was excellent. I finished the book and felt bereft..I have since retead the last few pages and geared up again. A great read, one that will stay w you long after you've moved on to another.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book One that is hard to put down once you started reading it. Has a good story line. Language was a little more than I would have liked.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|impossoble to stop reading, can't wait for the third already!!!<br />Better than fifity for sure, well written and less silly as well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use it on my kindle my phone and my computers.  it is amazing. I thinks it is easier to use on my kindle fire and my phone than on the computer :)
0385737947|4.0|James Dashner had his work cut out for him on this book, there was something about this book that had me hyped up and ready to read the moment I got it in my hands. I will admit, when I first started, the new dialogue and mannerisms of the already existing Gladers was a bit odd and out of place. There was something that seemed silly with all of their new and unusual behavior, but as the book went on and drug me into their world I found I was actually using their words (Klunk, Shuck, Shuck-face, etc).<br /><br />  The world building was fantastic; the horrible Grievers that roamed the maze all around them brought a well needed sense of fear and suspense. There was always this looming evil around the next corner, and then the fear of the changing. The way that everything was organized, and how jobs were structured around the Glade, did give proof that the others were there for some time.<br /><br />  At first I wasn't sure if I would like Thomas, to be blunt he was my first male main character and I was a bit leery of this. I like female characters more, because they tend to be more open and I tend to get more involved and into the characters; however with Thomas on the other hand, the only word to describe it is, Bromance. Thomas was everything I had hoped for and more.<br /><br />  Another issue that I found with the book at the start was it was almost in third person. I was wishing over and over it was in first, and still at times I wish it was. The book didn't falter because of this, it was told well and I believe it allowed for some more details to come out that the reader needed to know. I liked this bridge to fix an issue with the lack of memory that plagues Thomas at the start of the book.<br /><br />  The characters in this book were far, far more than I expected. They were all original, believable, and there was this sense that made me believe it could happen in reality. I mean, in every book, in a dystopian or science-fiction novel, I try to figure out if this could really happen and definitely believe if given the chance it could. If you don't think it could, as Thomas if he thought it could before he woke up in the elevator going up to the Glade. This part of the characters demeanor made this real, made the tension and the mystery of what is going on around them, that much more intense and put me on the edge of the seat, tearing through the pages.<br /><br />  The answers that arise in the book, through the arrival of Teresa and some other events that arise with her coming don't just come to fruition and end. The book ends with a well place hanger that leaves it open to the next in the series, so many questions, and so many unfinished holes that I want the next book now. I can't wait for it, The Scorch Trials!
B006M3JVD6|5.0|I loved that Jaycee wrote it herself, her way. The reflections are important, it is the way life is.  Warts and all story - sad but beautiful.  Her hope and resilience, looking ahead to the future, are amazing and inspirational.  I finished this book looking at myself and silently thanking her for sharing her story at all with us, so beautifully, and that it put perspective on what you should be thankful for.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I would have given this game 5 stars, but I have had to reinstall it 4 times since downloading it yesterday, it freezes up when redirected out of the app from a link. I do love all of the activities you can do in the game and will gladly increase my rating if this improves.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. I enjoy it so much. It passes time and is something to do. If I could I would<br />play it 24/7. My friends enjoy it too. Hopefully you guys will read this and say wow I like how people saying<br />they love the game. Thank you for making this game.<br /><br />  From.<br />  Subway surfed champ.
B00846REIS|5.0|good start to forget about fifty<br />and actualy I rather prefered this series than<br />The heroine it's not silly and the man character it's for dream about it!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Excellent CPU. Easy to install. One BIG thing to keep in mind is this item does NOT come with a heat sink, and it can be difficult to find the right heatsink for your board and socket. Just keep it in mind when purchasing and planning.
0316228532|1.0|The Casual Vacancy had the most potential to be a great book, and if you read my review when I got this book and the future expectations I had on this book you would know that there was a lot of glaring problems I had with this book. And I would love to present my first abandoned book to everyone. I just couldn't get past the glaring problems with this book and how horrible it is. If you like slow moving dramas that really just involve a bunch of self-centered morons, this would be the perfect book for you.<br /><br />  This book is just horrible. It involves an empty seat for the town council, I can only assume. But everyone seems too stupid to realize that the seat is up for reelection now. It isn't until halfway through the book that someone realizes, \\"HEY! we can fight over this seat and an all-out war will ensue and ...\\" You get the drift I image. It just moved way way too slow for me and I couldn't find a reason to pick it up anymore and finish it. Maybe later, but no.<br /><br />  The characters, oh the characters are horrible. There wasn't one general character that I enjoyed of felt that I would enjoy when I put the book down. It was just a cluster of horrible and even worse they all are so self-centered and delusional it's sickening. All of the characters really just use each other to position themselves better politically or to better their standing with the community. The lot of shallow characters in this book is far from what I expected out of J.K. Rowling. C'mon you can do a lot better, than this.<br /><br />  As well, this is labeled as Adult, and realistically this is no where near an adult book. Its more of a young adult book, with a few mentions of sex and condoms that look like those white grubs you can use for fishing. I hated the labeling of this book, it's not at all what I was expecting. If I could have claimed to be an adult when I was 12 by simply mentioning condoms and sex, than I believe the world would have a lot less teenagers and more immature bastard children running around. This book isn't even close to the label it had.<br /><br />  The environment was confusing as well, it focuses around Pagford and some suburbs. I spent most of my time re-reading the paragraphs trying to understand what was being conveyed. I felt that I missed most of the setting or it just wasn't described in a manner that I could visualize. As well when I finally understood the setting for the character that was speaking for the moment; the character changes. There is no chapters, there is days and in one day nearly every character has a section in which they give their perspective on the days happenings. Its very disruptive to the story and I was left with a complete emptiness when the character swapped. It just isn't something I enjoy seeing in a book, there was no reason to swap that way.<br /><br />  Now when I picked up this book I looked around at fellow other bloggers and reviewers to see what they thought, and generally it's a mixed review. Some love the book and some utterly hate it. I would view my stance on this book less than neutral. I don't hate this completely, it more or less just isn't my style of book and I couldn't get past those issues, and it's generally not just me who has those issues but most of those who dislike this book share the issues.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|My orientation of &#34;Alice In Wonderland&#34; came primarily from the animated film version. I did not have an interest in any of the other film adaptations until this one came along. Johnny Depp has proved himself dependable in the world of fantasy with such hits as &#34;Sweeney Todd&#34; , &#34;Pirates of the Carribean&#34; and &#34;Edward Scissorhands&#34;. He does not fail to impress as the &#34;Mad Hatter&#34;. The characters were truly dreamy. There was never a second where your attention would wander elsewhere. Anne Hatheway charms as the &#34;White Queen&#34; but the true star was the &#34;Red Queen&#34;. Kudos to the directors/producers for making her head huge and heart shaped.The action sequences were authentic enough but tame so that adults could enjoy the film just as much as kids will. I think this was a solid attempt at bringing a little fantasy back into the hearts and minds of us all. No detail was left unattended in this film. The design of the costumes, characters and set were all wonderful. If you are a fan of &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; then you will adore this movie.
B007SGM084|3.0|Was a pretty good book. I got  lil slow but picked back up.  First book was the best and the third book had surprises, which was good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such an amazing game. I love it so much. Its really fun and it keeps me busy. Thanks for creating such a wonderful game.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|What to say about it....it's a relief that we can read how finished this story, but I took some time to<br />come back to my normal life.<br />And actualy I rather enjoyed the point of view from Grey in the end of the book.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Simply put, this book has great reminders regarding effective communication. The most important message is to like yourself so that others can like you, too!
0062112430|4.0|This was far beyond all my expectations. I am a huge, huge Lauren Oliver fan and she just continues delivering a love story unlike any other. There was something about how Lena and Alex just seem to fit together that makes the whole story take your breath away, page after page.<br /><br />  The funny thing is, when I started the book I sat down and was thinking to myself, what would have to happen to cause this to actually become reality? There wasn't anything I could think of, aside some random crazed scientist proclaiming that Love was worse than AIDS or some serious contagious treachery against all humanity. However, the reality was I bought into the world. This world where people were fake, no one cared or loved one another after their \\"cure.\\"<br /><br />  Lena's transformation through the book, going from wanting the procedure; even counting down the days until her procedure, to going to wanting nothing more than to sit in the little abandoned broken down with Alex next to her. The transformation was the book, the love story and the entirety brought me so close to them that in the end I wanted to throw the book in anger. I was actually saddened to see this book end, and well the ending in general.<br /><br />  The reason I didn't give this book a 4 instead of a 5 was the enduring fact that some of the relationship between Alex and Lena seem a bit stretched, and not natural. How they go about struggling to understand what is real and what is real in this dystopian novel. The other issue I had was that Lena was a true romantic, she's weak and so emotional that I almost wanted to read more on Hana then on Lena. These were the major flaws of the book, and when the end came and went I was okay with them, they weren't too glaringly wrong for me to enjoy the book and not want to put it down.<br /><br />  I wish Lauren Oliver the best and I do have Pandemonium and Before I Fall coming up in the future, but this book falls in place with how good of an author she is. I just hope she does decide to keep the damn love triangle out of her work. I can't wait to get to Pandemonium, and then to Requiem in the future.
B001HN6922|5.0|If you have a cars fan you will love Cars 2! My 4 year old son has watched it over and over!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Just a darn good movie.. keeps you watching... the first movie i have streamed it was easy and fun, i'll stream again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson got me hooked on this game and now I spend way too much playing. I'm 70 years old and<br />Should be doing more constructive things with my time but I love trying to see how far I can get. Lovethe graphics. I put this game on my phone too so I can play when I don't have my kindle fire. Call me crazy!!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm clock is absolutely amazing.  The amount of customization on this app is mind boggling.  You will never regret buying this.
0525953728|5.0|I enreally enjoyed this book and did not find a lot of negativity towards Obama. After reading this book, I really admire the men that made up Seal Team 6 for their courage and sacrifice.
0525423656|3.0|I am still mixed about why I am rating this book as High as I am, and that mainly has to do with the fact that this book is far, far better than Matched. However, the glaring issues of a world that just didn't seem to be completely built or frankly the story really wasn't told the best it could have been.<br /><br />  I don't think going with the alternating Ky then Cassia route for the chapters was the best alternative. I've read books that have done this sort of varying chapter orientation; however here in this case I don't think it was the right place to do that sort of swapping characters. I felt this sort of switching left me wanting more from the character, losing track of the timeline at points, and even wondering why Ally even thought this would be a good alternative.<br /><br />  Now back to the book, which picks up almost right after Matched, maybe a few days/months missing but that's not too bad. Cassia has took it in her hands to go find Ky and rightfully, in a good romance, that would be the only option to go, so I applaud the lack of originality here. Throughout the book I was pretty much guessing what was going to happen next, okay in a few spots there was that new<br /><br />  The love triangle seems to disappear almost completely here in this book, and I enjoyed that. Xander nearly dissolved in the pages; the more you read he disappeared. There were a few points where he crept up, \\"Xander has a secret...\\" After a while I got the picture, and yet it was reminded to me over and over. Overall though, Xander just seemed to dissolve and go away, and I never liked Xander to begin with, so it didn't bother me.<br /><br />  My biggest problem with this series is the lack of character involvement. I feel no attachment to the characters, and frankly in the second book of a series I started to get involved and want Cassia and Ky to be safe and sound, but in the end when the book pretty much leaves them all in exactly the same place the first book left off.<br/><br />  I can't tell you how disappointed I was at this book, and I enjoyed Matched. I barely say this is better, but not by much at all. The lack of originality, the lack of pulling me or any reader in for that matter, the poor world building that didn't seem to entice me... I wanted much more out of this book, and the hype was there again. Here's to the third book and we'll see if it fixes a lot of the glaring errors in both books.
B00ARN0XGG|2.0|Some movies should just give up after part 2 and this is one of them.  Although the ending was a shocker,  It wasn't worth sitting through the rest of it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this show! Its very well written with intriguing storylines. Keep up the great work! FREE BATES NOW!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a nice on the go kind of game. I do say it does need some more updates. I do say get this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so fun and awesome, to me it never gets old also if you get bored of the same old looking game there's other one's like original, New York and Rio then when you beat all of those games you can start the whole thing over again
B00992CF6W|3.0|it is good but cpu is much better i have got to recomend cpu if u like this. this is fun just not quite as good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very innovative and creative. My little sisters simply loved this app, and I had to agree.<br />This is a must have app.
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|This album is worth the money, thirty songs for $9.99 and you can listen to the entire album without skipping, finally some good r &b music reminds me of the 90s.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite kid movies. The soundtrack is fantastic and the story teaches many valuable lessons.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|... but Amazon is sorely lacking with their closed caption programing.<br />This is only CC on your computer (when I watched it in Jan 2013), not if you are watching it using a PS3 or &#34;non-Amazon&#34; device. The other missing star is because the streaming was always buffering and then I lost picture quality. It went from a quality HD picture to something quite out of focus. This was using an HDMI cable from my computer to my TV (so I could watch it on the big screen with CC).<br />As soon as Amazon catches up with their nearest competition (associated with the color red) in the streaming department... I will give five star programs such as Downton Abbey five stars. Great series, mediocre digital delivery.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|sends me back to home whenever I open it, ive tried many solutions.  . . . . . . . .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addicting, still learning how to play it, and very challenging and exciting. You will never get bored.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|But the further you get into the game the more disappointing it becomes. It starts out with a slew of different quests that are easy enough to finish and even fun, but then the quests start dwindling in number, and then the only way to complete them is to spend real money on virtual items. This is shameful, especially for a children's game. By the time you get into the real meat and potatoes of the game it's no longer worth playing because everything costs real money. Here's an example of what to expect. It's 70.00 USD give or take a few dollars to buy Princess Celestia, you have to pay for two of the Mane Six (Rarity is about 6.00 dollars and Rainbow Dash, who is about 10.00 dollars), many of the ponies you have to get for quests you have to pay real money for, or the game ends up coming to a complete standstill, currently I cannot do anything because I either need to pay for ponies or I have to pay to move past the quests. I'm actually really disappointed in this game and would not suggest it to anyone who doesn't want to run into the same disappointment. After a while the game simply loses all it's luster and is no longer enjoyable.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|The concert footage gives us the great artist in his prime. I prefer to ignore the two irrelevant novelty aspects of the performance; 1)Playing with his teeth and 2) Abusing and burning his guitar. These pop tricks are beneath a virtuoso of his magnitude. Watch and listen to him become one with his guitar and the unbelievable sound created flows in to the listener in a similar way. INCOMPERABLE!
1455527475|2.0|There is probably only one reason for reading this book:  You have read the author's Op-ed piece on NY Times, and you expect me to elaborate more in the book how Goldman Sachs mistreat his clients.  However, the author does not meet that expectation.  In this 250-page book, not until 20 pages before the end of the book the author started to talk about how Goldman Sachs sales focuses more profit and less about client's value.  Even with these 20 pages, the descriptions are vague and second-hand, providing very little evidence to back up the author's claims in the op-ed pieces.  If you come to this book because of the op-ed piece and you would like know more, you will be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely addictive in the best way possible. Way better than Temple Run. For a free (or paid) game, it doesn't get much better than this.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is suspenseful and keeps the reader guessing . It is worthy of being a NY Times Best Seller
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an excellent game very good great for a challenge and very addictive i would recommend this to anyone  its like temple run but a bit more cartoony great to keep you busy with daily challenges
B008476HBM|5.0|I read it in high school but really didn't appreciate it then.  Upon re-reading it I loved it even more.  The story line is relevant, and the story is a classic.  Enjoyed very much and definitely think it was better the second time around!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this all in one game. It's free you should get it. You have to earn the games by beating the ones that are unlocked.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This is a very frightening story of drug addiction. I know someone very close to me addicted to Heroin, and this gave me a look into their reality. I am so glad I never ever went to concerts expecting to meet the band's. The way they demoralize women and the women who allow it is disgusting.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Directed by Quentin Tarantino and an unbelievable cast...this movie has it all.  Action, suspense, drama, and many famous actors before they were famous.  My wife had never seen it before, so I ordered for rush delivery via Amazon on Blu-ray.  The movie was and kept surprising her at every turn.  Not your typical date movie, unless you are Bonnie and Clyde.  If you have not seen this movie you need to see it right now.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|It cost way to much money to buy glu credits, someone needs to figure a way to get credits in the game
B005OZE9SA|5.0|If you want really good sound quality and don't need very many channels or features, this is a great choice. I've never heard a better sounding interface, and this unit doesn't have any junk that I don't need. The ASIO drivers for Windows 8 (64-bit) work seamlessly with FL Studio 10.<br /><br />I opened the box, installed the drivers from the website, switched it on in FL Studio, pressed play, and felt a moment of joy. There is absolutely no noise and only 36ms of latency, including output latency. (2ms ASIO buffer, 34ms output latency -- there is also a direct monitor switch with 0ms for hearing what you record). I have very good hearing and didn't hear any noise or electronic buzz whatsoever. (I'm using Sennheiser hd280 headphones).<br /><br />This unit is very portable, and very easy to use. The sound quality is fantastic. I haven't had any of the driver problems others have had. Out of all 4 similar units, I have owned, this one is by far the best. (The others included a tascam studio usb, presonus inpsire, and presonus audio box, and an m-audio something)<br /><br />I don't have much experience with mic preamps, but these sound great (nice hot signal, no noise)<br /><br />The mic gain knobs light up green and turn orange and red when they clip or get to hot. The unit feels built well.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone who needs a 2x2 interface.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This flick is certainly a step above the original Stalone version—at just about an hour-and-a-half in length, there's certianly enough time to eat a couple of bags of popcorn and some sodas or beers before the film's conclusion... which is rather foreshadowed throughout the entire display of scenes. Certainly not a brain buster, this is a good science-fiction action film for a Friday night — rather violent, so it is highly recommend parents and/or guardians send those whose age is under 16 away from the TV when this movie is being enjoyed.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fast paced and funthere is a bit of a hicup every once in awhile. Some of the pricing is high but you always have a goal. I really like the different characters and I love the mystery box.
B004RL9T50|3.0|It was okay, but kinda boring and very long and drawn out.  Tried to put the usual good versus bad in it, but they also seemed to try and build on beginning to much. About half way through I switched to another movie.
B002WGQJJG|5.0|The vinyl edition contains reprints of the jackets and inserts. It is great to have new copies of my well worn originals.
B007TK77QE|4.0|A merciless analysis of the petty daily issues of countryside life, and the drama they can lead to.<br />The book flows smoothly, digging into the life of a small town without indulging in gossip-style.<br /><br />A beautiful trip into the characters of a small town in England (that are probably the same in every country in Europe).

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I got this because I liked the radio songs.  After getting it, I find that I enjoyed the other songs even more.  &#34;One and Only&#34; is really good.  Adele should do a classics album, like all the ones Rod Stewart has been doing.  I would love to hear more classics, like &#34;I will always love you&#34;.
B000NMW6J8|5.0|Great movie. Was recommended by our son in law and we were glad we watched it. Good plot. thank you
B008MILL9G|5.0|For anyone with a collection that is not concerned with having each titles retail packaging. If you're a collector, you may want to purchase separately.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game for everyone. Kids can learn how to play it easy and all adults love it. Mostly terns in my hour love it make more. You should.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham's latest is good, but not up to the level I have come to expect from him.  First, the scenario is too unbelievable. The realism of past Grisham works is missing. Second, the ending is not satisfying. All said, the novel starts out well, but then seems rushed - as if the author was in a hurry to meet his publish deadline.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really fun I play all the time it's really fun to play if u r bored n it is great to keep it kids busy
0765325950|5.0|The final book in the series &#34;Wheel of Time&#34;. It was greatly enjoyable though I am somewhat sorrowful too in that now the story is completed. I heartily recommend this book and the entire series to all readers.
1616550414|5.0|This is a really neat book, and I would suggest it for anyone who's a fan of the \\"Zelda\\" series.  I was impressed when I got this book, as it is quite big, and the cover looks very nice.  Inside, the book contains a variety of things, but it mainly consists of artwork, a history of Hyrule, and a manga at the end.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is the artwork.  There are many, many pages of this, and many of the images likely can't be found anywhere else.  Near the beginning is a section on just \\"Skyward Sword\\" artwork, concepts, etc., including artwork for minor characters that never appear in the game.  Later on, there is artwork for the rest of the games.  Some games don't get as much artwork, while others, like \\"Twilight Princess\\", get a lot.  I especially enjoyed seeing different concepts they had for characters, like other ideas they had for Midna and Fi.<br /><br />As I said, the book also has a big section on the history of Hyrule.  To get all the games to fit into the timeline, they split the timeline into three after \\"Ocarina of Time\\": what happens if Link failed in \\"Ocarina of Time\\" and an adult and a child timeline if he succeeds in defeating Ganondorf in \\"Ocarina of Time\\".  It's interesting to see how they attempt to make all the games work together.  And it was interesting reading about what happened in the \\"Zelda\\" games I missed.<br /><br />Last of all is the manga at the end, which tells part of the story of the war that took place before \\"Skyward Sword\\" and how the Link of \\"Skyward Sword\\" got his red Loftwing.  The first several pages are in color, and the rest is black and white, and I think the artwork is quite nice (especially the pages in color).<br /><br />So anyway, I really enjoyed this book.  The timeline can be fun, but I think the best parts are the artwork.  I highly suggest this to any \\"Zelda\\" fan, especially those interested in the artwork of \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series.  I'm really glad they ended up releasing this book in English.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This app was great! It has so many new and awesome features and i loved it!<br />My problem,after playing for a while i shut off my kindle fire and go do other things. When i come back to play the game it loads for about a minute and then closes completely! I havent read any reviews where the same thing has happened but im just warning you, if it works its great!
B00555X8OA|1.0|This is not easy reading.  Hard to follow.  I find my brain drifting off to other things when I read this book.  BUT, the authors may have something important to say, so I will push through this!
B008VBYN80|5.0|if you like strategy games then this game could be for you but you have to have a lot of free time so you could build your own civilization
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a beautiful app! This is actually the free version, the premium version has more sounds that are interesting! I give it a......<br />5 STARS!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This has to be one of the best games for kids and adults LOL my daughter's love this game soon as they hear the music they go crazy hahaha. I must must admit I love the game too and collecting characters ..
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A description of heaven that makes the most sense through the mind of a medical professional.  Convinced me that we have nothing to fear and everything to gain through eternal life.  It is hard not to think about what was written in this book everyday.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Everything about this book perfect! Best book I have ever read! Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I like this book because of the detail and additions from the movie. I recommend this book for kids that like Greek mythology and their Gods. I like this book too because of the adventures that Percy goes on, and I like about the ending to keep you wondering for the next book.  Nick 8 years old.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Being new to Angry Birds I find this a fun way to spend my time.  The game does get harder as I progress but this makes it more challenging - sometimes turns me into an Angry Bird when I get to the 9th or 10th try but that's part of the game's fun.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|The casting in this movie was eclectic but genius, they captured the essence of each character. Who knew some of the stars in the movie could sing. After watching the movie I had to buy it and purchase the soundtrack. This was a step back in time to some great rock music!
B008469DGY|4.0|Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 GB. Lots of fun. Challenging. No glitches in game play. Wish there were more levels in the challenges and a normal play mode.
B00000JCOV|3.0|I think this Slipknot's weakest album. Overall, this sounds like generic, late 90's nu/rap-metal (think: Limp Bizkit meets Disturbed's first album). The production, lyrics, and musicianship are far weaker than that on Slipknot's latter albums. However, there are some songs worth having, like (Sic), Eyeless, Scissors, Wait and Bleed, and Spit it Out. I would recommend just buying those songs off iTunes, rather than buying the whole CD. As a metal fan, this CD is very heavy and it does rock, and still better than most rock music released in the last 20 years.<br /><br />It's not a bad album, especially for a debut, but don't expect anything nearly as good as \\"Iowa\\" or \\"All Hope Is Gone\\".
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is better than the first in many ways. Fun, challenging, and creative, it's awesome. The only bad thing is the graphics on the running person. In the last game the runner-graphics were unreal. Now they're just okay.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|That was an in depth book about something that I love. Great read for zombie fans out there. Definitely recommend it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Not being a techie I wasn't sure how a radio app would work.  I LOVE IT.  I can listen to my local stations & so much more.  I was surprised to even be able to hear local police & fire bans.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Great music and outstanding voices, this soundtrack really takes me back to some fun memories! I loved the movie so I had to get the soundtrack.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun addicting game.There is a series of trains that is used for an obstacle course. It is really fun you should try.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|The only book where the written word scared the bejeepers out of me! Keep the light on wit this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Once I get started playing this game I find myself having hours of fun! It's a definite challenge as I attempt to better my score with each play and earn bonus points. I love the theme and scenery change every now and then. My hubby and 7 year old grandson are also addicted to the game.
B001NHNG64|5.0|What guy wouldn't want to be Jack Reacher.  Independent and principled.  Another great Reacher book. Thank you again, Lee Child.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This season has brought back the suspense while letting the viewer find out more about what makes the Winchester brothers tick.  I miss Bennie and I hope they bring him back in the near future. He brought out the best in Dean and we really haven't seen that aspect of his character before now. I  find it hard to believe that Dean would turn his back on such a devoted friend. I await the next story arch with anticipation.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I loved this book so much!!! There are some sad parts like the time Sunny got locked up in a 30 foot tower. The author of this book was completely right, there is no happy beginning or end. But this book is interesting so I was happy to finish it and I am really not a \\"book\\" person. I always are looking for an interesting book. I am totally buying the next book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really cool game I would play all day if I could  good game for any body that would want to play
B009KS4XRO|1.0|it said free and then after a few games it wants money to play more the game is fine but you need to let people know it will cost $ after a few games
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game ever because it is super fun.all if the different people you can get.and all the cool board's you can get.this is the best game ever
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a fun game.  I enjoy playing search games.  would have rated it. five stars if I didn't. have. to. uninstall and reinstall go get it to work
B003TSEEDY|5.0|so far i adore this, glad I'm reading it before the movie but logan lerman is definitely my charlie, really good & makes you think, really sweet,
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the best temple run I have ever played! It's better than  brave temple run and the first temple run
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think that this is a wonderful and touching Bookw. You can relate easily to it. Thank you R.J. Palacio!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game not only has better graphics than the first, it has loads of new and exciting ways to play. I love the added minecarts and the set up is perfect.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie, alternate universe concept opens up a whole new movie series for years to come. Bring on the next Star Trek movie!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I've watched this movie 3 times when I rented it on Directv.  Now I am ordering it to watch with my daughter.  I don't purchase many DVD's, but I love musicals and this one was extremely funny with good music as an added bonus!
B005PK553C|5.0|such a great show, have to say that I still like this season over the second. TATE and Violet and the whole cast and characters YES.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesomeness. Love it. I'd download it even if it costed money. Great. Fun to play. Great graphics. Never lags. Keeps me busy for hours. Wish they'd add more features though.
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|I enjoyed these books. a bit violent in places, but wanted to finish to see what happened to main characters
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I use the cosmonaut along with the app good notes in lecture every day. I've tried other stylus where the point is all &#34;mushy&#34; but this one blows them out of the water. It has a solid yet soft tip that makes it feel great to write with. Fits nice in the hand too. Would buy again.
0817439390|5.0|I actually own the 2nd edition of this book, and bought the 3rd edition as a present for my father.  Okay, I looked through for the differences to see if I was going to keep the new one and give my dad the old one.  I ended up keeping the old one primarily because a few of my favorite photos were replaced in the new edition, and the new content was material I already knew.  The new material deals almost entirely with options available to digital photographers that weren't available in film, though most of the book is applicable to either.<br /><br />This book is probably my single most-recommended educational photography book for new (D)SLR owners.  Bryan starts by grounding the reader in the basics of exposure and then showing what you can do by varying up your shots.  On my first read through, a lot of my prior assumptions about what made for the best image, the best equipment, etc. were challenged.  Bryan explains what settings and setups went into each shot so you can understand how you might do something similar.<br /><br />Certain shots in here do require &#34;special&#34; gear, but there are generally inexpensive ways to get this gear.  At the end of the day, photography isn't a cheap pursuit, and you generally pay for good quality.<br /><br />This book is very readable, provides a solid understanding of photographic principles, and serves as an inspiration for the new photographer.  If you are an experienced photographer you probably won't get as much out of it, but you may find a shot you haven't considered and pick up some little bit of knowledge.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is so easey! it also was dumb. it did all of the ways i wanted to go all all wrong!
B007M45PMU|5.0|this is a great CD, I love their sound, everything about it sounds so genuine. I've had hey ho for a while but I had to jump and buy this after I saw them perform live on SNL; amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was a extreme awesome version of temple run but more cooler than the app it self and sometimes they would even upgrade it with special events
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Now that it's free I'm super happy! If you are board then I would recommend this game because it's addicting and time consuming!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|really love this app.  easy to use. can set multiple alarms for each day of the week.  pleasant ring that starts off softly and increases in volume.
B0053O89U6|5.0|The jokes continue to build on themselves with season 3.  If you haven't seen previous seasons, you'll be able to enjoy this one but I would recommend watching the seasons in order.  Family dynamics continue to evolve (as makes sense) while the type of humor remains the same.  I did feel like the beginning of the season was a little rough (though still with highlights) compared to the prior two, but this quickly resolved into another great season.<br /><br />Packaging on this was good, but nothing special.  There are a fair amount of extras included that were enjoyable to watch once, though I'm not sure I'll ever watch them again.  Let's face it - you're buying this for the episodes, not for the extras.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ok I feel it 110% necessary to give this book a billion stars in the sky... WOW. JUST WOW.<br /><br />\\"The sky is always beautiful.Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy,it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"<br /><br />I must admit I was a little hesitant to write a review for Hopeless. There are just no words that will do it justice. If you read anything this year, if one story, it needs to be this one. Colleen Hoover is a master puppeteer of the heart-strings.<br /><br />Home-schooled, 17 year old Sky, puts her foot down with her adoptive mother and demands to enter the cruel world that is high school for her senior year. Sky has been sheltered since she was adopted at the age of 5. No TV, no telephone, no internet. Sky, however, has a quirky best friend next door that has pushed no shortage of local boys into Sky's window for make-out sessions. When Sky starts school, her reputation proceeds her.<br /><br />Holder, the rumored town bad boy who has been MIA since he beat up a homosexual classmate has recently returned to town. During a chance encounter, Sky runs into Holder, Holder thinking that Sky was someone from his past. Life and everything Sky has ever known will never be the same. Holder soon discovers that he knows more about Sky than she knows about herself. But how much could Holder possible know about this sheltered girl and will he let her in on the secret?<br /><br />Hopeless evoked so many emotions for me, sadness, love, heartbreak, relief and even made me laugh. There is a lesson or two in this book and I hope that everyone gains as much as I did.<br /><br />\\"You cant get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. Its the fake happily ever afters that should piss you off.\\"
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I really like this watch! I don't exactly know how to use all the features yet so it's frustrating when I accidentally touch the bezel and end up in a program I don't need or want at that moment and can't get back to where I was. I started locking the bezel at start of run until I get more acclimated with it.  Then I can just record stop and start information.  It has a lot of great features that I am sure I will use in the future but right now I just use for distance, pace, and calories.  I love garmin connect program that allows me to analyze my mile splits and see pace readouts.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Enjoyed playing quite a lot of challenging games and diverse boards. Not  playing  the same game each time played always different and more challenging
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was the first Jack Reacher book.  Child's created an interesting hero. The plot is not easy to anticipate. If you like crime and suspense you should find this a good read.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Love, Love, Love this book!  Easy to read and a great perspective on how the disease affects everyone involved .
B00009R6J7|3.0|The double bubble is useful for determining if you camera is really level.  Most of the time I haven't found being perfectly level to be an issue, but having a double level is particularly useful if I'm getting ready to shoot a panoramic that I'll be stitching together.  I have a single bubble level to determine if the base of the tripod head is level, but that doesn't tell me if the camera is level.  When using a bubble on the tripod head base and a double bubble on the camera, I find I can quickly reposition the camera for the next shot.<br /><br />The price is the main reason to dock this level.  There are others out there (such as the Flashpoint equivalent from Adorama) that function just as well and are cheaper.  You won't regret owning this, but you may regret paying the extra money for the Manfrotto name.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend.  I am so glad that I didn't dismiss it!!!  There weren't any slow parts to this story and I truly fell in love with the characters of this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games. It's so much fun! The app was very easy to download. I also love the fact that they change scenes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. It's so fun. I play it all the<br /><br /> Time right now I'm working to get 95000 coins so I can. Get Carmen
B00B2V66VS|4.0|at various times the game will quit unexpectedly. This is more of an annoyance as it usually happens after you die and click on a gem to continue.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|I purchased this as a gift for someone who was having trouble with their marriage.  I watched it and hoped it would help them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics :) great game :). Love that its a 3d picture and not 2d. Only horse game I like so fare on my tablet hope it keeps getting better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Suspenseful Romantic. Well written love/mystery story.  Surprise ending. Well chosen characters.  Can't wait to start another great book by Nicholas Sparks.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I was deceived into reading this book by all the 5 star ratings and great reviews. I can't believe this was a best seller. I'm so tired of weak female roles in books,movies etc.  Why must the female always be rescued by a boy (typically the bad boy. Snore.)?<br />It was unbelievably predictable. I rushed through this book waiting for the 'plot twists'. Never happened. And really? The two main characters talk like 60 year olds. Ridiculous. Especially the last page where 6 year old Holden talks like he knows the world. Hahaha. I don't want to write a terrible review but, really? 5 stars. I was actually blushing through-out the book, embarrassed for the writer.<br />So maybe I should be a writer? All I need is a cheesy story line, something predictable, a weak female role and a bad boy. Next best seller?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you love horses and love taking care of them then this game is the right game for you I recommend this game to anybody
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Watched it 5 times yesterday. Part 1 was good but part 2 knocks it out of the park! No regrets!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Excellant as always!!! I love every word and couldn't put it down until the end. A must read for sure.
0205632645|5.0|I LIVE with this book. It truly leaves nothing -during the use of the English language- to chance. A must have for any writer... of prose, poetry or parking tickets...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A game full of excitment and fun! Wayyy better than Temple Run 1. I reccomend to everyone who likes fun action games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool I like it. Most of my friends like it to.my highscoore is 187000.it is one of the best games I have
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun this game is a lot of fun I play it all the time blank id really rude and makes up stories. all she wants to do is make my life misrdable and turn all of my friends against me

B0035RFYT2|5.0|I was surprised to find the wolf isn't breakable - it's more of a rubber. But I was very happy about that, and it doesn't lessen the quality at all.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is just amazing. It is great that he took the time to do this. Dave Grohl and everyone else is just perfect!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very entertaining and doesn't take a long time to get a lot of points to buy things with. Definitely recommended for anyone who likes games like these. Also it isn't as childish as the theme park game so older people wont feel stupid playing it in public
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a great game, really fun! Simple, but challenges you a little bit. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone! :) hope you enjoy it as much as i do!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest.  &lt;3  Love this app. It was first app I downloaded on my Kindle Fire. That being said, I have a caveat. Navigating to the main page is not as seamless as the desktop or Android versions. With Pinterest's growing popularity, and its evolution since the &quot;invitation only&quot; days, I don't expect such a hindrance to last.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think the game is really fun because u can build a restaurant however u would like. I am 13.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting story telling technique.  Keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  Not sure about the ending...I'll leave that for others to comment on.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever.its amazing getting to raise a horse. it is soo much fun wnd you have to try is
B000VMFDW2|5.0|That truly was the greatest generation. Take it from a current marine, those guys put us to same and we should all look up to them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME and the way the kid jumps.I love it because it is like temple run.Unfortunately I don't like the way the kid thinks.
B00ALQUV66|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. Very informative and visually stunning. If you love Dinosaurs like I do you'll love this series. Just wish the episodes were longer than 30 minutes:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for all ages. I highly recommend this game to adults and kids alike. The graphics are beautiful and the game is relaxing as well as fun.
B004UID2LC|4.0|No problems I can see.  Easy to use . I mainly use to get things for my three year old to watch in the car etc. I love this program. Can't understand the negative reviews.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This was a hop and the best of Canada is to sleep after the movie ever seen please Lakeland and the party of me on my drink a party of the best way to sleep.
B00992CF6W|5.0|mine craft is the dest game in the world because  you can grow crops and kill zombies that is what I think
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A friend told me to read this and I am so glad I did!  This is a wonderful story, full of ups and downs of real life from the dogs point of view.  Definitely worth every penny! buy it...down load it...read this book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome!I can play this game for hours without getting bored.You have to concentrate a lot.I think it is better than Temple Run!You need to check this game out!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|easy to read, its not just abiut sex, but emotions too. fell in love with the caracters. highly recommended not just for women but men also
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|Great movie for everyone.  Small children may need the puppet scene fast forwarded and some may be sensitive to the lost ticket scene.  Other than that, EXCELLENT movie and one we probably watched 200 times over Christmas.  No foul language.  Just a cute movie.
B00008GKEG|5.0|As a Beatles fan, and following there lives I found these DVD'S to be excellent. I enjoyed seeing films from the BBC that were never shown in the US  I would highly recommend this for any Beatles fan to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really addictive app. Love it! My kids and I play it all the time. We cannot seem to get enough. Would highly recommend.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|It was fun but you have to buy the gems. Like it but it needs more updates.I will keep playing but I will not buy gems.
B00000I8UJ|4.0|Go Dexter Gordon. The music is most enjoyable but there is so little of it. I guess that's why it was a cheaper CD.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is the BEST player for the price. The mp3's sound like their playing on a big audio system. Its the boss!
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I am a big Beatles fan and I found out more info then I knew. There were pictures that I had never seen when he was younger as a child , and also many pictures that were taken in Hamburg in the early years as a Beatle. I really enjoyed the DVD!
B004KPHQR6|2.0|This movie prolly was good back in 1984 but watching it for the first in 2013 leaves a lot to be desired.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|fun game. lots of changes. thought it was a kids game but us fifty somethings are loving it.  very very addicting. great change from bubble games.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|Intricate, innovative story line that keeps your attention with usual Boyd approach to detail and complexity.<br />I like his stories for the prose and descriptions, but equally for the intricacy of the stories, his parallel structure of present and past,  and the vernacular and development of characters.
1593272790|5.0|this is the second yoshi lego book i've bought.  like the first it's filled with creative ideas and color coded for easy assembly.  it's written in the universal language - no words, just pictures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best whole world.  I wish all the games were like this game. How do you get so many rates?  That is off the hook. WOW
0062225715|5.0|This is an easy read all about 'death' and his 'apprentice' mort.  Mort basically takes on the role whilst 'death' has some time out and along the way has a few problems which creates the story line.  An easy read and as usual funny looks at ourselves and about 'death' itself.  Not too complex and worth a read.
B0001FUHV6|5.0|For the piano players it contains haunting music i myself have the sheet music & the mood that passes through you is my favorite not to mention the first Big My Secret which is magnificent in that it is 100% pure diatonic masterpiece which i think involves considerable difficulty in construction of an uncanny caliber!
B008MEM24S|5.0|this app is fun and grate for all ages. it can keep me entertand for a long time I think it wold be stupied not to get this app I think this app shuld get 99999999999 stars! and I am not just joking aoround!

B008GXHOFW|5.0|I am a comics fan like you would not believe.  I got this game on sale and I love it.  Its beautiful.  I play it on my kindle fire and it works perfectly and I haven't had it crash on me yet. It's so fun!  I have wasted many hours on this game.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|I was fortunate to catch these guys at a smaller venue in Annapolis MD last summer, and they are a real treat live.  Highly recommend!

1609611543|5.0|i read this cover to cover 2 or 3 times to thoroughly understand what wheat belly is all about.  been following the eating guide and feel great.  losing about 2 pounds/week.  so far down from 230 to198.  stopped eating things i knew were bad for me, and replaced them with things i thought were bad for me but according to wb, are ok.  my cholesterol numbers are good and i have more energy and feel better and less hungry.  helps not having temptations around the house. also helps that hostess ding dong's and twinkies are no longer available.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|What a wonderful movie. The live show would be spectacular, as a recording on DVD, as well. Can't believe Emma Rossum went from Christine to Fiona, in Shameless.
B00946WMXY|4.0|In this movie, the key is to have recently seen Casino Royale -- and pay attention to the details!  We see the transformation of Bond into the almost heartless spy who masks all his feelings, following the events in CR.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing , AMAZING ,AMAZING that's all I can say about this app you you jump you swivel you duck it's &hellip; AMAZING A M A ZING
B002P79KAC|5.0|I'm a big fan of this show and this has always been one of my favorite episodes.  When I saw I could get this one by itself I thought, why not?  It is still funny after having seen it so many times I can do dialog. Never hurts to have something on hand to give you a laugh.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I cannot stop listening to Wings and Same Love. I love this entire album and Thrift Shop does does do them justice.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|My experience playing this amazing game was fun because I was trying to beat my friends scores and play hard
B008I43DYU|4.0|it took me a few minutes to figure out how this worked as it was different from the current calculator that I use.  Once I experimented with it I thought, how stupid of me, it's not that complicated.  give it a try, you can always remove it from the device
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Classic John Corey. Delightful stew of dialogue, sarcasm and suspense. Recommended for any fan of the thriller genre. Enjoy it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game is great, just wish gameloft would fix all the problems with adding friends, getting hearts, and receiving daily rewards.
0345803485|5.0|Bought this for someone as a gift.They advised me that they enjoyed very much. They  read it in one night an passed it on. I'm happy with purchase, the price and recomend it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a really good game i play it whenever i have a chance moving  and going other places is cool
034580404X|5.0|Great book! I borrowed the first book from a friend, after the first chapter I ordered all three. Really enjoyed reading and gave me wonderful ideas to try with my husband
B00886XQO0|3.0|I pre-ordered and headset was awesome for two hours then \\"new headset euphoria\\" evaporated.<br /><br />How can I possibly be more clear? This headset is garbage, an insult to premium headsets, doesn't function as advertised and is excessively FRAGILE. BOTH arms which secure the speakers are now cracked, fractured and broken. I'm ordering Astro's now and will never purchase Turtle Beach again without extensive research about whether their business practices have greatly changed/improved and investigation of reviews of the product; likely never again release date purchase.<br /><br />This was Turtle Beach last chance to retain me as a customer. $300 is insane price to pay for a headset that is less durable than their $60 entry level stereo headset.<br /><br />My Tango now must be worn at a larger head size adjustment with electrical tape holding a headset arm together to prevent complete failure and disconnection of entire earpiece.<br /><br />Nearly all features listed are over stated and/or misleading.<br /><br />I suspect that the durability of their $60 dollar headset lead to me trusting them enough to again attempt another premium headset, my previous Turtle Beach headset $200 started falling apart after 6 months, so par for Turtle Beach I guess.<br /><br />Complete garbage/untrue about any \\"sound advantage\\" black ops II.<br /><br />Great chat except this means nearly every FISHTANK/TOASTER/POTATO microphone headset others possess comes in with inclusion of \\"toaster buzzing or fishtank echo\\".<br /><br />Don't waste your money, do your research. If you want a serious headset and are willing to spend $300+ buy a premium major league gaming headset or one endorsed as having audiophile sound. EDIT{Laughter} Turtle Beach now offers a MLG endorsed headset. I'd wager dollars to donuts a paid for endorsement and the headset is still FRAGILE(Not something a professional traveling gamer even remotely desires).<br /><br />Please don't get DUPED by this imposter of a premium headset.<br /><br />Turtle Beach Never Again.headset.<br /><br />Turtle Beach Never Again.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great for anyone who likes action and adventure. It's better then temple run 1 because it has special powerups that the original doesn't. Great for any device!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was definitely a page turner. Never new what was going to happen next. It was nothing like I've read before.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|A well worth it purchase!  I love Zac Brown Band!  This is my second album and I continue to love all the different songs and sounds in this album.
0345536886|5.0|If there ever was a screwed up lawyer office, this is a parody of how screwed up one could be. Chasing ambulances, chasing that one big deal, and the one guy that wants to get off the treadmill. Great story to push them all into each other.

B001NLKXK2|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I felt it was a little unlikely how the care was worked out. Can definitely see the fear and bewilderment of Alice and also her humanity and that of her daughters!
B004SB60OC|5.0|I'm very glad I made this purchase!  I really love this album!  She has a great lilting voice and her songs are all different.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game for any age. This game keeps you hypnotized while playing it.This game has many levels.Overall this is A FUN,FUNNY AND AWESOME GAME GREAT FOR A LONG RIDE.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm hopelessly in love with this book. Words are not enough to describe how fantastic and amazing this book is. Thank you Colleen Hoover for being one of the best author of all time!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I got it on my itouch but then I got it on my kindle fire it was so much better!!! It was also bigger!!! LOVE IT!!!!
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I like this album.  It's a really mournful collection of songs.  I don't listen to it much anymore because her music is over played on the radio.
0743289692|5.0|For a woman to bare her soul and be so honest and be rewarded for her courage in the end was very heartwarming to read. What she had to go through was in the end an inspiration. I wish her the best in the future.
0823003590|5.0|I have enjoyed this book and still consult it frequently, months after I bought it. I do not understand how other reviewers found this book limited. While Maughan does focus on portraits in three-quarter pose on grey paper with sepia and white chalk, it's obvious that it is for teaching purposes, to keep things simple. His understanding of light/shadow/form can be applied to any subject in any media. Beyond that, his explanations of human facial anatomy is outstanding, and his drawings have an intensity that is often absent from illustrations in instructional texts. I continue to find this book inspiring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love Subway Servers game. I like playing on the Kindle. The screen is so much bigger than playing on a smartphone
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app is very fun because you can have a horse of your own.  I really wish we could breed!  its the only downside
B000V8A31C|5.0|I really liked the movie and decided to but the album.  I play the album when I am at work because it's tranquil, heart-swelling tracks that are very individual and unique.  I especially like it because I visualize the movie when I am listening and I get the joy of watching the film inside my head every time I listen to the album.  I thought it was worth the purchase.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|After watching the Di Vinchi Code on DVD, I never associated it with the author. Then a friend left a book behind. I picked it up and read the back cover. I looked at the first couple of pages, waiting for my breakfast eggs to boil. Come late afternoon, I was still at the kitchen counter reading. My office called. Are you sick? Did you get in an accident? Do I need to say anything more?
B007NU54H4|4.0|Shipped quickly. Was packaged well as usual. Can't ever give Tink a bad review. Everyone at our house loves her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun and really addictive! I play this game all day and all night. They have really cool characters although they are really expensive it gives you something to strive for. I recommend this game, which I believe is just a bit better than temple run, for anyone who loves games
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book. Hard to put down.  Kept waiting for the next turn in the story.  I am not an avid reader but would definitely recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read this book in just two days! It was so good I never wanted to put it down. I recommend to any girl that likes a good love story.
0553384775|3.0|If this is an expose of trader life, these guys are crazy. Is there a point where you make so much money that you don't care what you do? Is the high so high that you lose touch with reality? That even that high isn't enough?
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Long meandering book. I heard the author wrote the longest sentence in the history of novels, and I can see that. I understand it's a classic, but the book is more than a little outdated.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE t!!!! just browsing on my Kindle and found it...watched every episode and ready for the rest!!! highly recomended
B004SVM7BW|4.0|I read the other reviews, the price was right, and it all paid off.  This allowed me to do almost all of what I needed.  I can open the PDF document, input information, but I can't sign off on it.  I'll take what I can get becuase it is still a step in the right direction.  For my current needs--4 starts; for future uses it may be perfect.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I'm using PicsArt to create book covers, and so far, it works wonderfully. Adding text to the image is a bit awkward, and getting a precise size for the brush in drawing is difficult, but not so much as to make it  frustrating. Overall, I'm satisfied with the results of this app on my kindle fire.
0684803356|5.0|What can I say? He is so scant of description but so full of story. I read his books over and over about his war stories. They almost aren't war stories but preludes to battle where the battle is almost inconsequencial. You are already a conrade of the character. You just lost a friend.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really worth a go if your into horses and want to waste some time playing a game. Best role play horse game/app I've come across.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love the game thanks for making the game love the game and keep up the good work and make more fun games
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|This app is half decent on my Panasonic but pretty rubbish on my Sony bravia, glad it didn't have to pay for it :-(

0312944098|5.0|It was lucky they looked the same or maybe just the guards knew he was wrongly convicted. One died, the other dared. So much restrain. So many years. So much to look forward to. I was waiting for the knock on the door.
B003WTE886|5.0|Great album by Taylor. The songs are sung with different styles so you don't feel each song sounds the same. Strongly recommended to purchase this CD.
1449410243|5.0|I went from a household with dogs, to a household with cats, and this helped to ingratiate myself with my new housemates.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This was one of my favorite documentaries and favorite films of all time! It is CERTAINLY a must see for anyone in the creative arts, and should be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys a fantastic real-life story. There is just NOTHING about this movie not to like. Don't spoil it by reading too many reviews, the less you know going in, the better you'll enoy the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I love that it is very challenging. I love that it allows u to chose your own characters. And I also love just earning alot of coins!!! So please keep on upgrading this game because my friends and I love this game!!!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Picked out the comic to see the difference between it and the series.  Very impressed.  Already bought the 2nd volume on kindle. Looking forward to finish all of them before the end of this season.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I have been buying Legos for 37 years and have never met a lego I didn't like.  It started with my sons and now my grandchildren are continuing the legacy.<br /><br />This is a wonderful Lego product.  I purchased it for my 8 year old grandson and he is one that will work on a project for hours.  It took him most of 3 days to put together.  I will say he did it all himself.<br /><br />I would like to make a suggestion that worked great for us.  I noticed at the beginning that he had to turn the base around a lot as the Death Star is built from the bottom up, not in separate parts.  I found a plastic turntable, like one you would use in a kitchen cabinet, glued on a piece of rubber nonslip backing like that used to keep throw rugs from slipping, or I have also seen it used as shelf lining.  This made it easy to turn as it was being built and he has continued using it as he plays, making it much easier to see all of the rooms without walking around the table or moving the Death Star.  When finished, this item is big and heavy and the turntable really makes it more accessable.<br /><br />The instruction book for this item is huge, both in size and number of pages, over 275 pages.  The instructions are also available on the Lego website.  By using  a laptop along with the instruction book, you are able to get a little different view of the pictures.  This is sometimes very useful.<br /><br />I sincerely hope I will be buying legos for many more years.  Can't imagine not having them under the Christmas tree.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|This case is fantastic.  I own a Olympus Evolt E-300 and it fits in there just right.  It also has enough room for my battery charger, USB cord, spare battery, spare memory card, and lens cleaning kit.  It is just the right size for what I needed.  The colors are cool too! The zippers work very smoothly, which has been an issue that I've run into with camera cases in the same price range.  For the price, this is an excellent little camera holster! I would definitely recommend it! :)
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 on the PS2 was absolutely one of, if not my all time favorite JRPGs. When I got my Vita not long after they were first released I was beggining to regret my decision due to it's severe lack of games or products, and ultimetaly found myself downloading more PSP games for it than actually buying a game at retail. My vita sat on my dresser collecting dust for nearly three months when I found out about Persona 4 Golden.My heart leaped with joy, I ran to my local gamestore and immediately put down a reservation for it. And after getting it and sitting down for over 80 hours with my eyes glued to my vita screen I can honestly say without a doubt that this is the best thing to have come out for the system, period. Every single nuance added fixed any minor gripes I had had about the PS2 version, even the most miniscule detriments were padded out and improved. The new character was also a very neat touch and I enjoyed what came with her story. The extras that can be found on the main menu that are unlocked as you progress through the game are also a nice touch. I didn't think it was possible for a game I already thought was perfect to become even more perfect, if you own a vita or have even the slightest urge to purchase one I hope this game will find it's way into your collection. Granted, it's definetely not for everyone, but if you have even the slightest affinity for JRPGs, no matter how small, you owe it to yourself to get this game.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Haven't been playing too long but love the game so far ... a few too many ads to get 5 stars but still very much enjoy the game otherwise.
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|Not a bad song on this album.  Harper and Musselwhite are great together.  If you are a blues fan, you won't be disappointed.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Really enjoyed this series. Characters were great and the story line was really believable. Would recommend to everyone who enjoys the genre
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this book it is so good I love how they always end it with a cliffhanger it just pulls you in
1569242739|5.0|I'm not vegan, I even love meet and everything but I gotta say this book makes me wonder on the vegan world. In every bite of each cupcake you can taste just GOOD stuff!!!
B009G78EE2|5.0|\\"Thrift Shop\\" is great and I'm beyond pleased at its success, but this album is much more than the single track. Macklemore brings an incredible flow while tackling some serious social and political issues smoothly and admirably. Give it a listen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really great fun game better than temple run. A must get game for any age but will diffently keep the little ones entertained.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|Got this for a friend. She was very happy and excited to get these. The product arrived in good shape and in a timely fashion.
B008CRC506|5.0|I am a fan of SMASH and if you like broadways, great singing and a nice story line this is the one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was traveling and didn't have access to PBS to watch the Sunday night episode of Downton Abbey  --- never fear, I was able to get it from Amazon at such a reasonable price a few days later.  I watched it from my hotel room at a time that was convenient to me.  When I returned home a few days afterwards I was all caught up to watch the current episode that Sunday night.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Pat has a certain undeniable charm.  He has recently been released from a neurological facility after his marriage had broken up.  He is almost child like in his belief in happy endings and is mired deeply in not remembering his divorce and how it occurred,  to me, the story turns simplistic, and the key phrases are reported often.  His support network undeniably has their issues to bear.  We do hope for the best for Pat, but it gets repetitive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Glad I searched for this on Amazon. The picture quality was really good even the regular, non HD version. The price was more than reasonable.  Now I am all caught up.
B004FRB3OQ|1.0|I purchased this adapter to have as a backup for use with my Sony EX1R.  Specifically, I needed it prior to a weekend shoot, as I had no other card to use and needed something inexpensive in a pinch.  The reviews were great, and I bought the adapter.  Amazon shipping and customer service were flawless.  I received the adapter the very next day, along with a fully compatible SDHC card (Class 10).<br /><br />When I inserted the card into the adapter and the adapter into the camera, all I saw was a blank screen with an image of an SxS card on the viewfinder.  If I went to the menu option, there was no way to format the media, the option was subdued.  Clearly, the camera could not see the media. I tried multiple other SDHC cards and always got the same result.<br /><br />I called Sony technical support (very helpful), and they helped me upload and install the  most updated firmware--although Sony assured me that the firmware I had was sufficient.  After the update, still no luck.  So I called Sonnet tech support.<br /><br />These folks were unhelpful in the extreme, and rather than try and ship me out an immediate replacement, the fellow who helped me just re-affirmed in a very bored voice that it \\"is probably the adapter, then.\\"  Way to go, customer service.  No, \\"sorry about that, can we help get you a replacement ASAP.\\"  No, \\"gee, tough luck,\\" even.<br /><br />So here's the deal.  Maybe they make and sell tons of these, but I kind of doubt it.  Also, the group to whom you sell these REALLY needs them to work pretty much all the time, as advertised.  And if they don't, hey, back your product...<br /><br />It's my fault for trying to keep my costs low, but that doesn't mean I can't try and help someone else from tripping up with these guys.  You might get lucky.  You might be like me...sitting around twiddling thumbs instead of shooting while you wait for a $350 card that you hoped you weren't going to have to buy...again.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its a decent game when it actually works. It has to many glitches, and forces itself to close after a 2nd save me option is chosen. Its also been twice now that i've had to completely uninstall it and re-install it to even get it to open. You shouldn't release a game when you haven't cleaned up all the obvious bugs. there's a turning, sliding, leaning, jumping delay. The graphics can't seem to stay up to speed either. it gets laggy.
B0054U56B4|4.0|Fantastic follow up to the first book, well written, engaging characters that keep you guessing, can't wait to read the next.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Reminds you a lot of Mario brothers...fun and easy to play. I like the acorn throwing...makes getting rid of enemies faster.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I first heard about Minecraft I couldn't get the PC so I got it on my kindle fire. It isn't as good but I still love the game.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Bought this to replace my Maglite xl200 holster (discontinued). Fits well though the ears inside make reinserting flashlight more difficult than the purpose built maglite holster. Havent tried with a larger flashlight (dont wanna stretch out the elastic). Clip is very secure, so much so that its a pain to take it off my belt without unbuckling it. Overall a good quality item, definitely recommended!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Is a very good game! very addicted! I cant stop playing! Love the diffent tours very cool game.  Jam telling everyone to get this game u wont be sorry!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Our kids loved this movie we rented and now we wish we had just put the money down to buy it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book was to long winded. I believe in heaven, but the person who wrote this book at first didn't believe in heaven, then he had a NDE and believed, but wrote about it too scientifically,because as a Dr a Neurosurgen I guess thats the way is mind worked. Still more science then spiritual.
B004LWZWDS|5.0|a great time piece film with stellar acting- really addresses karma- what you dish out you get back- overall a classic film
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Fantastic story, very well written and the narrator Saul Reichlin is a pleasure to listen to.<br />I found it helpful doing some research on the characters - believe me, there are a lot of them.<br />Happy Listening
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This made a really good date at home movie for my wife and I great acting and good plot.  Very clean and well done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun, but it's difficult to get used to. If you want to get it but you're not quite sure yet, get it. It is totally worth it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great little app. It is free and does what it needs to. Addittion, subtraction, multiplication, and division. What more do you need?
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|What is wrong with this little girl!.<br />Definitly one of my favorite horror/ suspence movies!.... Love how well the movie keeps you on the edge of your seats!. Nice twists and turns, and a outstanding ending... o yagh and there is a alternate ending!... WHATS NOT TO LOVE!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use it at work with other app. and for food shopping, bithdays, shows, appointment and many other things. works great.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is easy to find my friends and other things like games. Easy to manuver. I would recommend this for my family and friends. with the kindle I can take the kindle any where with me and it is not bulky.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. It is the best game you would ever want to play. If you don't get this app you do not know what you are missing. Buy this app right now.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I thought the movie would be good, most of the Dc animated movies are, but this just blew me away I haven't been so invested in a movie in a long time. it really is a great MOVIE not a cartoon, and one other thing this movie isn't exactly for young kids its pretty bloody and violent, and that just adds to my respect for the makers of this movie. a brilliant adaption on frank millers classic. I will sleep better at night knowing this movie is in my Blu-Ray collection.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Helps me if lots of thing at work. Codes, faults, etc. It's a live saving for not haveing to lug books into my job. Elevator tech.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it goes to the beginning screen the imangi and them back to the apps?? why?? can you tell me please?
630522577X|4.0|I bought this to help learn a Cockney English accent for  the audition. Not only was it very helpful, but I got the DVD at a good price, and promptly.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I bought this for my brother for Christmas because he was dying to see it and doesn't have HBO.  I myself never miss an episode, often watching each one twice.  The shipping was fast (Prime member) and the price was great.  Whether you're a fan or just want to watch it for the first time, this is a great buy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazingly addicting and fun. It gives you a new place to surf every 30 days such as New York and Rio. This game doesn't have many bad things to talk about so 5 stars seems reasonable
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game sooooooo much.  It is addictive. And the best part about it is Free . I enjoy it a lot.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|For anyone who enjoys reading mysteries and tries to problem solve as they read along has to read these series of writings.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Awesome book, awesome series. Glad I read them before seeing the show.  I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out
B00992CF6W|5.0|I been waiting for this forever and did you knownon my phone it was updated and you get sighs and pistons
0897500482|5.0|This book covers all of Bruce Lee's idea's on how to fight, which are still different than the way we fight today.  The way he bring philosophy and spiritualism into his art of fighting is forever genius.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|I love this album! Listening to the acoustic version of his voice is Beautiful! Justin voice has really grown and you really can tell! His new songs are perfect! This is a must have!!!

B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is really cool I am going to get it on computer soon but amazon needs to let this app have updates everybody I know has the updated version w/ armor, signs, a new texture pack, and, baby animals. Please add the updated version.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Throughout the book, references are made to the macro and micro workings of this \\"organism\\" that love is. These concepts truly incorporate the inner essence that married and single people \\"ought\\" to know by putting phrases in plain language anyone can translate and understand. The 5 Languages is a awesome concept, something that can be embraced by anyone of any background ANYWHERE.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Thunder Buddies for Life!<br />I saw This in The Theather.One of The Funniest movies I have ever seen.<br />It was Still as Funny when I bought it I laughed more. Bought This on Bluray Picture Quality was Great.<br />Extras Were Nice; The Making & bloopers were Fun.<br />There is a lot of Swearing but I do think That was part of the shock value Seth Macfarlane Wanted of Family Guy.<br />If you Like Family Guy Fans of seth Will love this.Some people don't like this kind of a dark comedy.Matter of choice i guess.<br />It is pretty hard to make me Laugh this one I really enjoyed.<br />Will be Watching it Again Tonight.<br />Get The popcorn Ready l
B007712XAU|5.0|Excellent production. Great quality. Extra scenes and information round out the experience. A pleasure to watch again and share with others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is funnnnnn. Its bettter than temple run. If you like temple run then you'll love this. You don't even have to tilt your device to steed or turn. And I just like subway suffers more than temple run and temple run 2
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was based on the story and the characters and had a great deal to offer, a few hints every so often about the mystery of one character's past, a question as to why on another. The story had a lot to offer, It is unfortunate that show was aired so sketchy and cancelled before it was given a chance the only thing wrong with the series was that it never had the chance to answer some of the questions left open by its sudden unexpectedly being cancelled.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|My sister referred me to this game. It's good.  Not as good as Mahjong that I was playing on line.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|The doc shares Jiros single minded dedication to perfecting sushi making. His practice parallels meditation. A must see for anyone interested in witnessing what greatness can be accomplished through pure will.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever downloaded. I played it for three hours before I relized it
B000PEX1IE|5.0|A movie that can be watched again and again, and it never stops being funny. Great cast and a great job with its production of.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have enjoyed this app since I downloaded it. I love the variety of sounds and the different combinations you can use.<br /><br />My six year old son likes to pick sound combinations so he can listen to them as he falls asleep. I enjoy listening as I fall asleep as well. I have gotten some of the best nights of sleep since getting this app. I have even recommended it to my sister andbrother in law.<br /><br />The one thing I think the developers should add, is the option to have it on in the background. I have the app on my phone and my tablet, and they both work fine. I would just like to listen to it, as I read a book on my tablet.<br /><br />But otherwise, the developers did an awesome job on this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a lot fun even though I am still trying to figure out how to play a few of the games.<br /> I love the challenge.
B008602KQI|5.0|how can you not love this movie? Hunger games is one of my favorite movies! the special features are excellent!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A phenominal series! My only complaint is that it does not upload faster to Amazon or other providers. If you are even thinking about watching this series you should slap yourself for asking such a dumb question
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It had me in it's grips from the very beginning.  I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next...... every step of the way.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I play for hours and never get tired of this game.  I like the different patterns and the fact that there is a pause just in case there IS that important interruption.  The best is that it is FREE.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it bettter then the first one, the special effects are great! I play it more than the first one.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|When I rented the movie I was thinking what the heck, why not. To my surprise I was impressed with all aspects of the movie. The Twilight Star seemed to really to a good job from separating herself from what she is known for. You can really never go wrong with Charlize Theron, and Chris Hemsworth is definitely coming along...seems to be natural for him. I would def recommend this movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great psychological murder mystery/legal story which keeps you hanging on until the last page.  It left me wanting more story to read.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This was quite a good read. It took only a few days to finish. As usual, Jack makes the &#34;bad guy&#34; pay for his sins.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Very suspenseful, very scary. There was a great ghost story to go with lots of  puzzles and tasks. Seriously it's worth the money. You'll love the ride!!!!!
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over, and will continue to do so. Everything (except for the acting) about this movie can not compete with the movies of today (ref. to tech), but it is still a great movie to own. I still dont like going in water that I am unable to see the bottom of. Def one to own
B008MAI0WK|5.0|If you purchase a Raspberry and you want to understand many things of this PC, I think the best way to start is this book. It's complete.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Love it<br />  LOVE IT<br />  LOOVE IT!<br />  LOOVE IT!<br />  LOVE IT<br />  OH<br />  OH<br /> I LOOOOOOOVE IT!<br />I LOOOOOOOOOVE IT!<br />I LOOOOOOOOOVE IT!<br /><br />Ah I give up I was gonna make a stickman.<br /><br />Its a good game though.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I love watching criminal minds and the series just seems to get better and better.  Can't wait to get season 8 although I shall miss Prentiss :(
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Was not as good as the ratings led me to believe, but was worth watching at least one time. Had its moments of humor, the singing was alright....cant really complain too much I guess. I would say a typical teen movie, maybe a little better.
B006BXTOFC|3.0|I like the first track, but really not much of a fan of the rest. I found this on sale for $5 so I downloaded it on a whim, but I was a bit disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is fun to feed and take care of my own horse.  my five year old daughter loves the game.  now I don't havebto buy her a real pony.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Saw a friend playing this game and thought I would try it, and I have to say, I became addicted instantly. I imagine that after a while I'll get sick of it, but for now, I'm loving it.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Put together very well, very hard to watch only one episode at a time. Was just as good as the first season.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved because it was just so fun I think I'm addicted hehe...I can't believe it's finally on Amazon I love this app it's on my favorites.&lt;3 this
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a really good game it's totally worth it but I think you should be able to blow up dynamite in creative mod
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this read. Kept me interested and guessing all through. Whilst I picked the bad guy, I did so having another option as well, it certainly wasn't that obvious and I wasn't sure until it happened so that's a good read for me. It was first read of this author and immediately purchased another
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great series at a fantastic price.  I have started reading the rest of the series and love them just as much.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I'm not a real big angry birds fan. but I'm getting used to it though I'm delly getting the hang of it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show is never bad love every single one of their episodes if you never watched this series you are missing an all time classic
B006BG7RI0|5.0|If you thought you've seen Casablanca, think again.<br />I highly recommend this gorgeous box set, which gives the movie its rightful treatment as one of the all-time movie classics.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is great and is very much like mario. i love this game. it is very addictive and i can hardly tell a diffrence between it and the actual mario.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm a very light sleeper with fibromyalgia, I haven't slept through the night In years.  Just the other night, I sleep 5 hours straight.  Just awesome!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow! I was on the edge of my seat with this book. What an amazing tale of a strong woman, who finds Mr. Perfect. The ending sure took an unexpected twist! It made me love the story that much more! Looking forward to seeing the movie in Feb.
B007UQRW62|5.0|I highly recommend the beautiful box set of Singin' In The Rain.<br />The film, the vignettes, book and umbrella bring it all to life.  This is why high-def was invented.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|this game is great and it is a lot of fun to play . it feels and sounds like an updated arcade classic
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a fun game.  My kids love playing this with their friends and it is free.  It is like electronic pictionary.
0062082353|1.0|this book was more than horrible.....let me describe it for you:<br /><br />SEALS are super human...we do everything better<br />I killed a guy aiming at his left nostril at one gadzillion yards<br />I'm really good ... To tell you how much....I had my wife write in 3rd person in every chapter on what a great hubby I am<br />the navy uses us to beat up non seal members to get them straight<br />I hang out with marines in battle so I can make up anything I want since I'm not with my unit<br />I'm Tim McGraw<br /><br />This book is trash and I have almost given up on any book written by a seal...but perhaps there is a good one out there that does not stretch the truth and adds humility
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I've played three G5 games at this point \\"The Mystery of the Crystal Portal\\", \\"Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart\\", and \\"CrossWorlds: the Flying City\\".  By far, this one has been the best.  Fortunately, this was the second game I played and it has given me a positive view of G5 games so I am likely to play others.<br /><br />It was a little annoying that I obtained it as a \\"free\\" game, played through to the point where it forced me to purchase in order to continue, and then, when I purchased it, I had to play that portion all over again in order to go on.  Maybe that \\"free\\" first chapter and then force purchase model is standard in these games but if it is noted in the descriptions anywhere, I missed it.  So, just be aware of that aspect.<br /><br />A comment on the story:  Though the story is a little cheesy and predictable, overall, the story works.  But, mostly, the play-ability of the puzzles, the great graphics, and particularly the video scenes, are so well done that I continued playing it and ignored the cheesiness.  It was just fun to play.<br /><br />Having said that, and knowing how these games operated, I definitely recommend this one.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|great app very help ful. it works just like it does on your pc and allows you to use the web a lot better
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Too long too many characters but wonderfully written and very interesting. Great explanations about this time period from so many different view points. Looking forward to the next book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is simple, and great.you dont NEED the special deals they offer to get the most out of this game. It changes theme reguarly to ensure you dont get bored and you can save your free coins to buy charectors, boards and bonuses/upgrades.no adds.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is the second game developed by Atrifex Mundi which I've played, and though I just started, I already purchased it. I could tell early on that it will be as fun as &quot;Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart&quot;. The playability, graphics, and video scenes are first-rate.  At $2.99, it is a bargain for some entertaining puzzle time.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this is a great game with lots to do . i really enjoy this game and i have lots of fun playing it.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Un libro espiritualmente muy enriquecedor. La lectura es cautivadora y te permite compararla con la realidad. El interés que despierta el libro te obliga a leerlo sin parar.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book was slow starting for me but then I found a connection with the characters. It was a bit crude for me as well.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the previous movies in this series and this one was no different.  Great action and story.  If you like these types of action films, this one should not disappoint you.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun and enjoyable game that my daughter just loves. You should definitely buy this game if u have younger kids
B00422LESO|4.0|Great, great book.  Got slow but still amazing.  Great ending!! Couldn't have ended a better way!  I love Darcy, too!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is awsome. they are still updating and adding levels consantly and it does it automaticly. if you have a problem with the free version's pop-ups all you have to do is turn the wi-fi mode on your device off and they wont bug you with ads.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series. I wish more tv was like this. I can watch it with my small grandchildren in the room and not worry about the language they hear. I hope it is on for many years to come.

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Breaking free of religious constraints and facing one's fears.  This movie is bold, moving and the lead actors demonstrate their range.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|this game is awsome. they are still updating and adding levels consantly and it does it automaticly. if you have a problem with the free version's pop-ups all you have to do is turn the wi-fi mode on your device off and they wont bug you with ads.
0765357151|3.0|I loved the movie, so I had to buy the book ! I haven't finished it, which is why I only gave three stars, but so far so good ! It isn't like the movie of course , but it gives a good descriptive story about how Robert Neville lived and survived all the tragedy that hit him.
B00AQMQBKK|2.0|This game is real hard and very, very confusing.  There is to much stuff you have to figure out and understand.  Need to simplifie the directions.  Just real confusing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game. worth your while to download and if you liked the first one your definitely going to like this one even more
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is great and very simple and easy to use . it is nice to have a cal. on my tablet
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|I am a huge fan of Justin Bieber. Even if I wasn't I would still rate this album 5 stars because that's what it deserves. Singer pop star Justin Bieber put his heart into these songs,letting all of his fans know  his  true feelings. He did a great job! Buy this album because  you know you won't regret this! He's got a lot in store! Buy this on Amazon, iTunes,and even in stores before it  gone. Make sure to listen to \\"I Would\\" and \\"Fall\\" two o  my top favorites!

B005OCFGTO|5.0|Can't beat it.  All eight Harry Potter movies for around $35.  If you have seen the movies, you will love watching them again.  The set comes in a nice little box and the movies are each on there own holder (back to back), not stacked on one another.  I really enjoyed the purchase.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I thought it was entertaining reading, typical Jack Reacher story, lots of action a few twists.<br />Lee Child created an interesting likable character in Jack Reacher.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|this is a really cool app that sounds great . its like having a protable piano that is only as large as your tablet.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a beautifully executed game by Mojang. It allows you to unleash your imagination and build anything you dream. But...I have it on my iPod touch and updates come as Mojang releases it. But here we don't receive the update until 3-4 days later. Please fix this.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like how u go into competitions and u will wash or groom them but I wish that we did not have to have a certain amount of energy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|wow. i love the frist temple run and this squel is just as good as the frist if not better. i like how the backround on this on is in the daylight compared to to dark and gloomy swamp. i like how they added zipplines, minecars and ather stuff. like before i just wish the game had checkpoints.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play it all day long I am so addicted to this and I just can't believe it was free
B000PMLFRA|5.0|After meeting Carrie Fisher in Dayton, I had to run out and get this trilogy.  I don't watch it as much as I thought I would, but it's certainly a must in my collection of classic movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game is now on kindle (well..it's been on for a while) and I have no idea hoe to update it but who cares!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game feels like the real like but i don't acutally have to spend real money. i like how your coin pile regenerates.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I hate to see the end of the story so soon. I could read more and more. I hope everyone else enjoys this series as much as I did.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finished all three books in hope that the books would get better..i should have just listened to other people who had read the books..not worth the money or the time.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The case can be converted many different ways for usage.  I like the color and that it has a band to keep the cover closed.

B005EWDA9M|5.0|I have read a lot of books from Haruki Murikami, but this series is even better then I had anticipated. The characters are very well worked out and the tempo is higher than usual for the longer books of Mr Murikami.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Very fast and stable; this is my first eReader app, so I don't have anything to compare it to but it seems to work well.  I'm using it for a textbook, so I'm doing a lot of flipping back and forth, and it performs pretty well.  I do wish it had a 'return' to last page so I could click a bookmark, then return to where I left off...
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is great and so are the controls. it goes by fast and is a lot of fun .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just watch it, and you will be addicted to it.<br /><br />This is so far the best zombie apocalypse plot I've ever seen.

B009YU6FJM|5.0|If you are a fan like I have been I think this album rocks. There are quite a few heavy tracks which I feel the last album missed the mark on. Yes there are also a few softer tracks, but over all a great balance. Leathers truly rocks! Enjoy!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|this is a great game that feels like the real thing . i love playing this ditatal classic . the contorls work great ans the game is fast.
1612183956|5.0|The Pines was a thrill ride.  A hard to put down thriller/mystery.  Leaves many questions to be answered as what about town growth, technology, man's inventiveness and control after Pilcher's death.  And it begins again.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Because I got done with my home work<br />I love this book and kindle fire the best-selling in the world
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love Jack Reacher--but some times he thinks way too much. if you skip over some of his problem solving you sometimes have more suspense in these novels. But jack Reacher is my hero--TeeHee
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this is a great game much like mario. i like the 2nd one ( this one ) a bit better than the frsist verison, but they seem much like the same game. i can hardly tell the diffrence between this and mario.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Simply one of the best, intriguing shows made for television. Each season has become stronger. Only wish we could see it in real time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's really fun and cool to play. This game taught me that you should take care of what you have. Over all you should get this game, and it's free!
B0055PMJMW|3.0|None of the stories were long enough to really get into them. They started--came to the point and ended. I like more suspense, Thank you

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun you might get hooked or you might not matters if you like games like this
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game. It is filled with so much joy. I have to say it is better than temple run. I is very addictive too. It's amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You can't deny the game. This game is really good. Now there's Rio, with a whole bunch of fun.Experience the beautyof Subway Surfers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers so much! I plat it everyday. I normally play it at recess. my friends always beg me to let them play it. subway surfers is the best game ever!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is  the best I especially like the upgrades on the themes like the Rio and the nyc and the  Rio themes it  was very cool and I know you should get it to.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun and simple game! I like it better than the original.  It is easier to view.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Well I love Halfbrick studios and all of there games are amazing so when I got the game I thought it was great and what got me addicted to it was having to collect all of the blades so I love it!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|down right funny movie. money well spent . it will be one that you can watch over and over again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|PROS<br />For those of you that have played Temple Run, This is so much better.<br />There are ziplines, and, I don't mean to spoil anything, but if you run about 2000 meters, you get to go on a cart inside a cave etc. Also, instead of 2 or 3 creatures chasing you, there is one huge muscular one! Then, if you go to the upgrades, you can choose between two male characters and two female characters, if you collected enough diamonds. Don't worry. If you play this game a lot, you'll be rich with thousands to spare! Then comes the levels. Complete the objectives in the stats( you'll get a chance to see your progress when you fail, but if it doesn't show up, just swipe) to reach the different levels to determine how well of a runner you are. Another thing, if you ever see a green gem hovering, jump and get it. This, if you ever fail, you just press ''save me'' and you will keep running from where you left off. There are other powerups too. Some are coin magnet, extra coins,<br />auto runner, etc. Those are pretty much all of the pros, now the cons.<br /><br />CONS<br />There aren't many, and the others say that it gets stuck on the imangi studios page, and I get why they say this, but it doesn't. Also, like 1 in a 100 times, it gets stuck. One time I failed, and I pressed save me cause I had a gem. It froze, closed itself, and my gem was gone.<br /><br /> Other than that, this game is amazing. My rating, 5. If you are thinking of getting this, get it now that it's free because in the future, I know it will cost you $2.99. Please let me know<br />what you think in the comments!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this I a addicting game . play it and you will see. the nly thing that I don't like is in order to get gems you have to use your actual money

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Started out great very exciting. Then it seems  that Dan Brown got a little  lazy. His characters became  walking  encyclopedias not very believable. Too bad because it had such promise.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway serfer is the only game that i play on my tablet after school and play all night. i love the tour concept it is fun i also love Reo it catches the beauty of it. P.S. i am sasquatch
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I sobbed at the end it was so good.  Lou learned so much from Will and Will from Lou.  Sorry  his parents were a bit stuffy, but Lou was the best thing ever for him.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is totally amazing and everybody should play it and it AWESOME did I mention that it amazing. Awesome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome and I would really like to thank whoever created the app and my friend Fatima for showing me the game because if it wasn't for hr I wouldn't have been addicted to this game like I am now
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Story was neither here nor there. Never loved any of the characters. Disappointing after reading many of the glowing reviews.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Cool but it is a little boring after a few days of playing will keep you entertained without wifi required
B0045HCJT4|5.0|This film was a big surprise! Kurt Russell was a bigger surprise !(he can act).<br />No offense to Kurt's fans,the role was difficult, he only had about 120 words to say.<br />The future is grim, when the fighting forces are chosen as newborns. No parents, no love, no life , only training...to kill. Campaign after campaign no rest.<br />Then one day ,new, younger, stronger, faster,allegedly improved soldiers are brought online. There is a contest , the older ones lose. The bodies are dumped on a planet used as a garbage dump. Our hero (Kurt), is still alive. Know what i don't want to ruin the film for  you.you may not be new,but, the expirience that one has......buy this, it is worth having in your Video collection!!!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I'm not sure there is a way to rate TED. It brings all the greatest speakers on subjects you never knew about and many that you do right to your screen.  Not sure life would be so good without the high quality small dose of knowledge I get from TED. Can I give it 10 stars?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best. I absolutely love this game. I'm completely addicted to this game and I got my friends hooked on it to. We are all trying to get the best high score out of us all and I won with 5 million. This is the best game ever you should definitely get this game it is the BEST!
B00B7G23KQ|2.0|I was surprised and sad about this movie! I was really hoping that this would be a more in depth movie than the last one. This movie did not answer questions about the cult or the demon possession or almost anything else. There were so many chances for plot development that were not even taken advantage of by the movie makers. This would have been better had they developed the relationships of the characters more.  I was surprised that they did not.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|If you liked Ice Age, this is right up your alley. I am not a kid, however it brought out the kid at heart in me. I thought the color was well done and the animation quite smooth. And I liked not having to return a video tape to the store ;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was much more than I expected. It is so much fun. I know that it not the real deal but it is as close as it comes with sitting and playing a kindle
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is one of the better adventure hidden object games. We need more like this for Kindle Fire. Great story and excellent graphics. Bring on part two!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Well written but a bit depressing.  Some of the British slang was difficult to follow. Found it hard to follow the story line.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I watched this movie a few weeks ago and somehow it completely skipped my mind to add a review at the time.  Basically, it is Dances With Wolves in space.  I noted this after watching and was not surprised to find out afterwards (searching Google) that others had made the same observation.  Still, the effects were awesome.  I would give it five-stars except for the obvious Dances With Wolves comparison -- or ripoff -- depending on how far you want to take it.  I watched all three versions... the longest extended version is obviously the one to watch.  I can see re-watching this movie once a year or two years.  Good to have something help fill the Farscape void.  Which reminds me... Bring Back Farscape!!!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I wanted this in my video library.  There are a lot of excellant movies that have been produced in the last seventy years and this is one them.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its really fun but it go's to slow or way to fast!!!!!its free so you should get it I like temple run 1 more
B00009TB5G|5.0|I am a LOTR nut and I couldn't be happier with this product.  It was delivered right on time and is in perfect condition.  Finally made my LOTR collection complete and perfect.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great book. Couldn't put it down.  Really enjoyed twist and turns.  Would love to see more on these characters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very well done and mesmerizing. I love the characters and the story line. I've already finished disc 1 of season 1 and am ready to tackle disc 2. Blue Ray quality is as good as any other blue ray I've played on my Playstation 3.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|i was looking for a different style music to use in a compilation disc. nice music and it soothes the mind on those days of high stress.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I love to use Wikipedia and I love to use their app. It's fast and easy and I always get the information I need.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Great show! Have watched episodes over and over again.<br />Good story lines, great chemistry between leads<br />Castle and Beckett.<br />Highly recommend seasons 1-4
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I am happy this product came on time and I am really happy that all the episodes are included. I found it for a tremendous price.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The bible App is very good. I like the fact that there are many plans one can choose from to keep one immersed in the Word of God. The only reason I gave this a four star is because of the wording in th New Living Translation (NLT) which comes up as the default translation to read.  Why replace words with modern day words and language? The bible clearly states that we should not add to or take away from it. The bible has been read for thousands of years before there were any other translations and before we became too wise for our own good by discerning that people will not understand meanings of words or phrases used. I believe God gives anyone reading His word perfect understanding of what He says. I mostly read the ESV and crossreference on the KJV version.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I use this everyday and I love it. It has helped me get healthier than before and it is so easy to use.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE LOVE THIS GAME IT'S SUPER POPULAR. LOOKS REALLY GOOD ON MY KINDLE FIRE. Sorry but it seems I cant post this yet so Rruuuunnnn follow me @VampireLenyx
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I loved this book...it does a great job of filling in the missing links from Creatures. However, I've noticed in the writing that perhaps the book's editor was a bit preoccupied because of some slight repetition and lack of flow in a few paragraphs. Still, it wasn't hard to read and I enjoy the style all the same. Must read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome fun cool a a a a a a a aAa. aa a a a a a a a a a<br /><br />dh love it get it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This.product is amazing I play like every day and it is an honour to have a game as great as this one is
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />The first time I heard Emmy Rossum sing was in a little movie called SONGCATCHER back in the year 2000. She was cute as a button and every time she sang I got goosebumps. I still think of that movie every time I cross paths with her work.<br /><br />This is an album of good old fashioned classic songs.  The drama kids and the choir kids will eat this up.  Many artists have recorded similar albums, but only a select few get it right. With SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY Emmy Rossum gets it right and her album deserves to reach a wide audience<br /><br />But what it is about these recordings that works so well?<br /><br />Here's my guess:<br /><br />High-quality classical training + God-given talent + love and respect for the material + energy and enthusiasm.<br /><br />There is also a refreshing absence of what Holden Caulfield might call phoneyness.  Even though Emmy is playing dress-up in a bygone era, something about the music feels refreshingly authentic.<br /><br />Throw in what I imagine was a top-notch production team and twelve straight cases of picking the right song for the right singer and you get a thoroughly enjoyable album that made me sit up and listen.<br /><br />Eighty-six years after it was written, when the right singer gets a hold of a song like \\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover,\\" it can still make a person perk up and feel a little better about life, and I'll be darned if I didn't absently-mindedly press down on that gas pedal just a little too much as I was driving down the street listening to Emmy sing that song. I'm sorry officer, I was listening to Emmy Rossum singing \\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\\" and I guess I got a little carried away...<br /><br />But I'm afraid if I did get pulled over like that, the cop might not know who Emmy Rossum is, which might mean I'm not getting out of a ticket, which might mean Emmy Rossum isn't getting the kind of universal adoration she deserves for her remarkable singing ability.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listenerlity.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
B009CPES4I|5.0|As each story is introduced and intertwined, you are drawn into caring about each of the characters.  Often found myself pausing and replaying scenes to get all of the nuanced portrayals. A quiet and subtle life-affirming tale.
B00122IYJY|5.0|DOWN LOAD WAS FAST AND PAINLESS and loaded right onto my Galaxy player with no truble.dont be afraid to give this try.<br />LOVE IT.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't update minecraft on my kindle and its frustrating.I've Ben trying to update it for 3 weeks to get armor but I can't do it .I tried everything.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome app but I am having trouble figuring out how to update... anyone have any tips for me?? and it is awesome on the kindle fire!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|As a long time fan of John Grisham, I was disappointed with The Racketter.  John Grisham usually grabs my attention and holds it until I am on the last page but putting this book down was not a problem!!!
B00005JKJA|1.0|Well we liked the young lady coming to town at the beginning of the movie, but not one other likeable character in the movie and at the end you do not like her either.  To describe this movie, I have to liken it to someone's nightmare - the kind you have where you remember bits and pieces that make no sense.  In one scene you are yourself and in the next you have morphed into someone else, then you are flying through the air, then drowning.  All the characters in your nightmares (and this movie nightmare) are exaggeratedly evil.  This movie has many unconnected characters and at the end it left us very dissatisfied and somewhat angry that we watched it.  Luckily someone gave it to us and we didn't pay to watch.<br /><br />I love movies that make me think and try to figure out the connections, but this movie had very few connections.  Characters appeared in the movie seemingly for absolutely no reason, having nothing to do with the (nonexistent) plot. So, who were the evil old couple that shrank to Barbie doll size and ballooned back up again?  At the end, all I could think was \\"What the hell?\\"
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great for passing time. My daughters both enjoy playing as well. My 4yr old plays better than any of us.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app only suggests viable moves. It does not insult me by suggesting I can move 1 card to 3 other columns (at no advantage.)
B009G78EE2|5.0|Let me start by saying that I think most modern day rap sucks. Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Souja Boy, just about everything on Cash Money Records, Chief Keef, Pitbull, 2 Chainz all sound like nails on a chalk board. I'm old school, so good rap to me is Slick Rick, Rakim, Spice-1, Common, Wu-Tang Clan, Scarface, Tupac, Nas. For that reason, I usually avoid mainstream rap like the plague. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is like a breath of fresh air to the entire rap genre.<br /><br />\\"Thrift Shop\\" brought you here - The Heist will keep you here.<br /><br />Buy It. Best rap album I have heard in years.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|i am a fan. loved the cd. listen to her all the time. brought it to my job. good day
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's just so simple to use.  EASY! i use my kindle like people use there're smart phones. Just go to it  and use it. Simple as that
B001NN4162|5.0|Great product.  As described, really enjoyed it.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something similar.  Very happy with my purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Horse owners and riders of all ages will love this. I am adult and already making sure my horse is fed and happy.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|i am a fan. listen to the product alot. shared with others.they have become fans too. good day. peace on
B000FA5TTW|4.0|Very enjoyable read! Beautiful wording by the author. Reading her weird have such present and nostalgic visuals that I can't help but appreciate. Great story line as well. Felt somewhat choppy at times but over all it was a lovely novel that I highly recommend.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading this series 10 years ago. I borrowed the first 5 novels from a friend after being hooked by the first one. Since then I have read and re read the series several times. I was ecstatic when the final one was final available for sale. I got it and read it more quickly than any of the other ones in the series. I will admit there were somethings that I wish were in the final book, like a what happened after the final scene but other than that I loved this book. I would recommend to anyone that is a fan of this genre to read these books from start to finish.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|This historical read is the most extreme thing I have ever tried to make it through.  The description of battles, convents, and sub-characters, just goes on and on and on.  I ended up skipping a lot of pages to find the story that I was familiar with from the movie.  If you want to spend large amounts of time understanding Paris's history, then this is the book for you.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Easy to navigate and great graphics and story line!!! Lots of good hints' worth the money. Can't wait for the sequel'
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this read but found it odd...ending leaves you hanging.  I am guessing there will be a sequel soon.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|This is my thrid time downloading this app and it keeps on crashing! It works fine on my phone but not on my kindle.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love to play solitaire when I need to unwind or have a couple of minutes to spare. Thanks for free version without pop ups!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This was an impulse purchase that I really tried to give a chance to but it fails on so many levels. I really think it was well intentioned but it fell way short of a good read for me. It may be a book someone else will find captivating or revealing just not a person like me I guess.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but wonder if there can be more in the series considering the plot.  I really enjoy the chacters and how they interact.  It was good to see some chacters from previous books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is so addictive I just love this app. it works out your brain you have to get this app you can never stop playing it!!!
B001EBWING|1.0|same old story. immorality. fornication between rick and the chick. and what happened after this? bergomeister went and committed adultery and her children suffered for it. don't think satan has only been around since the beatles. he's been plying his trade for millennia. who paid to see it? rotten americans. they gratified their lust, and the movie made money. and the tale kept spinnin'. satan's got a real racket. bergomeister and bogey fell for his tricks and are you know where now. they were satan's pawns, just like america is. love of money, by mr. warnermeister, is the root of all evil. corrupt movie used by seducing spirits (demons) to lead the world to hell.
140123769X|5.0|I was afraid of this series losing its edge &#34;Hello Jack series&#34;. But the authors pulled off a compelling book that could have easily failed many times but didn't.<br /><br />I was left anxiously waiting for the next book.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I have read most of the DeMIlle books and have enjoyed most of them.  This one is surely in the upper half of the list and although it can stand alone, it is best to start with this as it is the beginning of the Corey books.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is an amazingly fun app! You get to build almost anything! The 0.6.0 update came out for the apple store so i hope they come for the up date for the Amazon store other wise it is a great app!
B008B92U32|2.0|I suppose if you had kids or something, that this app would be very fun or useful to you. It just isn't my cup of tea. It's hard to navigate, though luckily there is now a video that will give you detailed instructions on how to utilize this app. However, the application is still kind of rough on the final product. I find it kind of pointless on my KF 1st generation because it is not picture capable, but luckily I have a phone which does. I think the idea of this app is cute, but I do not see myself spending hours, or constantly opening this up.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I don't know how to play it. Is there any way I can cancel it?  Please let me know as I would like to return it if I can.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Historical fiction at its best. Accurate in that regard, as far as I can tell. As usual, Ken Follet seems to have done his homework. I did enjoy the fact that he told the story from the standpoints of the different countries involved. It had been so long since I had read Fall of Giants that I had to go back and reread the last quarter of that novel in order to bring myself back up to speed on who all the characters were in Winter of the World. I might not have had to do that if some brief mention had been made in the last book about the development of the characters in the first book as they were introduced in the second.
B008SO9M8Q|2.0|Thought this might be an interesting insight into such a twisted man.  Incredibly dull and boring.  I read it for about two hours and noticed I had completed 6% of it (Kindle version).  Not worth the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it has great dynamics. You actually treat it like it's  a real horse! I think this game is awesome
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is so fun and awsome and halarious i love it the great and best game ever and great fun
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Move over Fifty Shades of Grey, this is one book that has it all.  What it does differ in is the purity of true love although it doesn't lack heat and story content
159420411X|5.0|This is an outstanding book about our inability to predict the future. I'd have cut about 50 pages, but it's an exciting read rife with real world political, economic, sports, and gambling examples. Silver's an excellent writer and I can't wait for the next one.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I'm suprised I didn't wear this out, it was a permanent fixture in my car and I also put it onto my MP3 player so I could listen to it whilst working out!
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|This movie should not have been billed as either a thriller not a horror film. There was no suspense in this shoddily produced, shamefully acted flaming turd whatsoever. If you cannot figure out what will roughly happen at the end within the first half an hour, you might enjoy this drivel. However, if you have the sense not to go down a dark alley with a blood coated stranger with a knife, this might not be for you.
1577311523|5.0|I have been interested and involved in bettering myself as an individual most of my life.  I have read and studied many authors, many religions and beliefs.  This book has literally enabled me to practice the incredible information I have gathered.  I have read the Course of Miracles numerous times but couldn't quite understand how to practice what I had learned.  This book has given me the tool I need.  I love this book.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|I've always loved this movie, but watching it the other day for the n-th time it occurred to me that FBDO needs to be in my list of perfect ten movies.  Also on the list (so you know you can trust me) is &#34;When Harry Met Sally&#34;, &#34;Chinatown&#34;, &#34;Annie Hall&#34; and just about anything by Kubrick (of course!) amongst others.
B00418NXBK|5.0|Played it time and time again, along with the &#34;Only by the Night' CD which I bought at the same time.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This was one of Grisham's early books that did not initially succeed. It is a great story about a black on white racial murder in the south. Caution if excessive use of racial slurs bothers the reader.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this app the day I saw it. with the rope and giant monkey it makes it the best!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting and has missions to complete and loads of different characters although they can be a lot expensive ,! overall it is one of mu favourites .
0345803493|3.0|Badly written, but better than the first and last I guess.  Yes, I read all three!  Wouldn't read them again unless desperate for something to read!
B000099T2L|5.0|i love music ... great price fast shipping it was just what i want it .the pic was as it look . i will be ordering again..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is awesome. It is totally addictive. his game is something I would play any time and it is great when your babysitting because little kids luv it to!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|What I mainly liked about the app is that it incredibly fun and FREE.It is incredibly great that it is free because it is free fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game. It's so addicting and fun for kids and adults. You should get this game. It's awesome.
B00005M989|5.0|i love music ... great price fast shipping it was just what i want it .the pic was as it look . i will be ordering again..
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this makes hours go by. Game plays just like it should my wife loves it. Suggest for everyone's enjoyment some ads but can work thru quickly.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. I cannot wait to play. I am just beginning this game and I am not advancing too quickly but i enjoy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great way to pass the time.. AND it's free so easy to download and d delete if you dont like it!
B0000013GT|5.0|i love music ... great price  fast shipping  it was just what i want it .the pic was as it look . i will be ordering again..
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is addictive.  I can't quit playing once I get started.  I really do like it.<br />It is a challenge
B0072OFM28|5.0|I bought this as a gift, the recipient loved the gift, of course he had the first season, what is not to love?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I liked the first one better. These are supposed to be simple quick games. This one just seems too cluttered and not as intuitive as the first one. Still fun but trying to be more than it is.
B00000ADG2|5.0|i love music ... great price fast shipping it was just what i want it .the pic was as it look . i will be ordering again..
B00932ANQM|2.0|Most of the movies made from Nicholas Sparks' books are really good. I loved this book, but the movie, not so much. I usually end up crying with his stories and I figured this movie would be no exception, but it just wasn't that good to me. Maybe because the main characters didn't seem to have much chemistry on screen as in the book.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|If you like &#34;We are young&#34;, then you are probably going to like many songs in this album! The explicit lyrics bother me because I can't sing along and because I can't share this music with my kids, who would enjoy the beats.  If there was a clean version available, I would not purchase this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a terrific game. My sons and I play it together. We work together as a team to complete all the missions and buy all the incredibly cute characters.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game.I cant stop playing it.I have well over a million coins and have beaten it almost fifty times.I have done every task and have nothing left to buy and I still play it all the time. Im going to need a new kindle fire soon. This one over used.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|I thought this was a very cute movie! You can relate very easily to this movie as it covers all aspects of motherhood and pregnancy or trying to get pregnant. I laughed and cried watching this movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is real challenging!! I always like trying to beat my high score! It's not easy, so that's why I like it.  :) I like being able to collect gems and not have to pay for them.  I would recommend it. xD
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Very entertaining. Kind of like Pale Rider and Independence Day got together and had a kid. Full of humor and suspense, enjoy the ride!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love every one of these books, I so wish it was more, the end to fast, but I will be waiting for more
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Great story. The characters were all tied in well -great historical info.  Sometimes detail was too much, but overall it was a great read!
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Continuation of the Ryan Family stories, this time concentrating on the son, Jack Jr.  Little mention of his dad.  Fantastic read!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I knew nothing about The Hunger Games until the movie came out. I was wondering what all the fuss was about, so I checked the Kindle store and thought for five bucks even if I don't like it I won't be out too much. It was worth every penny. Even if you have seen the movie (especially if you have seen the movie) you should read this book. The story is much more layered in the book than in the movie. I was up until the wee hours of the morning reading, and as soon as I got done I loaned it to my Mom, who loved it as well. Engrossing from beginning to end. I have read all three books in the series (I love my Kindle because as soon as I got done with the second one at a little past midnight I got to immediately buy the third and start in on it). I must say this one is the best, as originals often are, but all are woth the time and money.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This is by far one of if not the greatest Batman story told in the comic world. Although the initial series was released in the 80s DC Comics did a superb job with the film adaptation. This film alongside the first one is definitely living proof the Batman is the greatest superhero. If you were a fan of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy than you don't want to miss this follow up to Dark Knight Returns. Part 2 has an amazing story, the perfect ending and this film is so strong it could be easily mistaken as a cartoon that should have been a live action film. When watching these two films together it makes one wonder is it possible for DC Comics to outdue themselves with the Batman. It will definitely rank as one of the top Batman films of all time (and not as just animated films but top Batman films of all including the live action films) They definitely do the batman justice in this film and maybe someday we'll get the origin stories of Joker (Killing Joke) and Bane.
B0012TWRAO|3.0|I really like RAM mounts.  The hardware on this though was a bit of a let down.  The nuts are painted black so they will supposedly  look nice when attached.  However the paint flakes off very easily.  Just the act of tightening them with the proper sized open end wrench cause a good bit of paint loss.  They should have just been chromed or something.<br />Works great though, just not very pretty.
B005P4P966|5.0|This show is a must see if you have any sense of humor and especially if you have a working knowledge of science. We love it here in my household.
B005LLX582|1.0|I like to watch movies for entertainment. Main-stream, independent, whatever - as long as it let's me escape to a different reality for a little while I am happy. This film did not make me happy. Escape was impossible because I kept wondering when the movie was going to start. A bunch of little scenes of a family, jumping back and forth through time, with hardly any dialogue to speak of does not make a movie. Then we get to the creation sequence, dinosaurs and all. Great for a PBS special, but in the middle of a movie that is supposedly about a disfunctional family? I am not ashamed to say that I just don't get it. I am glad I only rented the movie, if I had paid for it at a movie theater I probably would have asked for my money back. Don't waste your time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really love this game, but I wish u couldn't buy coins with cash. It's a little too tempting & I spend enough with Amazon already
B002EEP3NO|5.0|LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS LEGOS THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM AWSOME

1442419814|5.0|I love the entire Uglies series. The writing is beautiful, thoughtful and most importantly action-packed. The characters face surreal problems, such as enormous government conspiracies, and also with issues we each must face in our lives, such as feeling inadequate, or the complex relationships we have with our friends, or having to make the choice between doing what is right and what is easy. It also makes us question our own society and the emphasis put on beauty and fame, our unsustainable lifestyles, and the hidden price of living in a sheltered 1st world society.<br />In particular, I love this book best out of the entire series, because of the way that it begins: Tally isn't out to upset the status quo. She isn't trying to rebel against the system. She just wants to be with her friends, to be older and able to have more and do more. Slowly and believably, she starts to realize that there might be bigger concerns, some of which are worth fighting and sacrificing for. She learns what a true friend is. She learns how unimportant physical appearance is in comparison to creativity, critical thought, and deep emotion. She grows so believably from a typical (if a bit mischievous) teenager into someone determined to change the world, from someone who is mostly self-centered to someone who is mostly self-sacrificing.<br />The series as a whole give us the full scope of the dystopia society so closely based on the ideals of our own. I recommend reading them all. But for those who really seek a character-driven story, this first book gives us a heroine and a coming-of-age story not to be forgotten.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A book that makes you think. Sadness,happiness,friendship,family and overcoming life's obstacles. Enjoyable read, would be a great required book for middle school age kids
B003O86FMW|5.0|This honestly is the BEST book EVER!!!!! I love it solo much I recommend anyone to read.this book dry such a awesome book I was addicted
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Repetitive game at times but a game that was fun and cute noneless. That is until your game gets deleted with no warning when you go to simply open the app. Game has a number of other gliches that can lead to loosing hearts and overall enjoyment in the game...
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|its a really great game plus its addicting and very fun to play and i cant stop playing it idk y
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining game. I enjoy playing it in my free time. I like to play in the night and in the day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is one of the best games on the market.  the background change on its own for the world tour.  i think the next place should be hawaii.  i also think they should make a freeway/ highway surfers.  you should definitely get this application.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|The book is kind of redundant and seems to be slow moving, but it keeps giving clues to keep you reading.  Somewhat of a surprise ending.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun game if you like puzzles and colors which I do so I guess it works out. why more words?ask the review guidelines
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game I love it I have all of the characters really fun I love the Rio and new York world tour :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is allsome because you have a differnt  backround and differnt stuff I just love love this kind you people should play this kind
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I really like the game very much I think it is very fun.I like how you change. The worlds and the charecters
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've been using this app (free one) for a couple weeks now and love it, but it doesn't have an option for adding reminders.  That or I'm blind.  That's my only gripe.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|hfifnei jeopardy nr Jr fur fifbru ifbcdb jxbdksbxvd jdkdbdj kdbdid did fjd xidbsicbekd did did did dj,.......,........... I think its...... ok
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A lengthy novel with a very slow exposition, which I guess was important to give the reader some background knowledge and context for later plot events.<br /><br />It was fun to watch Corey take his act on the road, and Demille again does a great job with Corey's wit and dialogue, mostly about our enemy and the Yemeni culture.<br /><br />The only real plot twist was when the A Team got help from an unlikely source during the final chapters. Still very enjoyable, and I can't wait for the follow-up when they settle up with Chet and Buck.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I absolutely love this game! Price on the Kindle is $2.99  not bad. I believe it's more on the iPad! I just wish these hidden object adventures weren't so expensive!
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is an old stand-by, when you are really desperate!  It is mindless and will kill way to much time!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun addicting and interesting it keeps one occuppied and its not very hard to do like temple run plus the Colors are much better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is so awesome and fun. You can unlock special characters through tokens.this is why subway surf is amazing
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game was great but now it wont open. If it opened I would give it five stars but it doesn't so it gets one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My husband and I both enjoy playing this game - first on our computer and now on our Kindle Fire.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This gives a lot of detail, more than I usually need. I like the way you can click on the red circle with the exclamation point when there is a weather alert and get great detail.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have had the PC version of this game for several years, and have completed the game numerous times. I was happy to see an android version. It's a little difficult to use on my cell since the screen is small, and moving the plants around is a little tricky sometimes. I still enjoy the game, and it certainly helps pass the time when I'm waiting for an appointment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everyone.<br />Everyone I know is watching it.<br />The characters are so real, and I love seeing the 2 sides of classes of people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is relaxing and fun to play. I use to play this game with cards, then on computer and now on my Kindle.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love the selection of types of stations available and the number of stations within each type. I particularly like the music selections available.
0375869026|5.0|I wonder why a certain committee managed to completely ignore this \\"best book of the year\\"??<br />Everyone who works with kids should be required to read Wonder. It has everything a great children's book should have..humor compassion,hope,joy,sadness and just plain great writing!<br />I will be using Wonder in all my presentations for 4th and 5th graders this year!<br />Love it!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Hello!! I love the walking dead. First time I downloaded the first season but we decide to buy those season on blu-ray! Looks beautiful but now the third season is not available on blu-ray!!! I think is unfair from amazon to push people to download the third season.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|DIDN'T THINK I WOULD LIKE IT AT first but it turned out to be one I couldn't put down. It's great.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app does exactly what I need it to do. It allows me to check on how much power I have left.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is a big step up from the first one and it is more entertaining and there is more features to it. I reccomend u get it.

B008LC8TJI|4.0|This CD has great songs, but there are a few that could be better.  The more I listen to it, the more I like it though.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast paced and intriguing.  Could not put it down!  Great twist ending!  I am a Grisham fan, and this did not disappoint.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Challenging! Don't expect to figure it out in two minutes....only had 8 floors, only complaint :( I'm waiting for more, pls hurry! I'm addicted!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's good for kids and it is very easy to play so really anyone can play it. I like the you play around the world.
B005RUV0NY|4.0|This season started great and continued doing so all the way to the last episode! Looking forward to season 3 and 4!
0140131558|5.0|Really fun reads, and I was on the edge of my seat until the very end! Great author and books.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have never been so hooked on a show. The storylines, the characters and just everything. I love having Amazon. Prime. Watched the first 2 seasons and now I'm caught up.  I laugh and cry with the show every week

B0072V39DK|1.0|Had no idea this would be about a bunch of people going around shooting people for sport. Wastes of money
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I truly enjoyed this version of Jane Eyre, it`s one I will consider a great love story. It` s one story you will want to read again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the movie.  My two daughters have read it and were pleased, as well.  Parents, read the book first to decide whether it is appropriate for your child.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game its the best its a good game to focus.when im playing this im focus. best game ever i tell everyone to play this game.
B003O86FMW|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life a a a a a a a
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it its so addicting i hope they make a second one it would be so cool!It is so much fun u get to jump on top of trains but u have to climb the dirt piles i wish u could at least jump on them at anytime in the game.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It had been a few years since i actually bought a movie on disk but this one was definitely worth it. All these superheros in one movie! I watch it every once in a while and its AWESOME! Definitely recommend this movie and cant wait for the 2nd one to come out!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I use the E17 docked in my E9k as well as when I travel as a headphone and netbook amplifier. Fiio product as as good as you can get. I would highly recommend to everyone who enjoys buying quality.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Very additive and fun.  A lot of different things to do and very social. A fun way for you to rule your own little world and seek revenge on any who attack your kingdom.
1423136802|5.0|I am 56 and I was just expecting it to be interesting to 8 to 12 year olds but it captures your interest right away and holds it through the entire series, I was impressed and will be looking for more in this series.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|This is a definate must-buy for pure rock lovers and members of the BVB army! Nineteen tracks of pure lyrics(and speaking parts of Andy Biersack and William Control) and AMAZING music. It still sounds like Black Veil Brides but it's a more refined Black Veil Brides. If you have never heard them before, I recommend this album.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Not a huge improvement over the regular definition. But it's the Godfather and still worth the price. I didn't have much use for the extra
B008XG1X18|5.0|enjoy it very much. the ability to save and attach from other apps is great. very flexkble between my gallery. no easy facebook replete.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very relaxing game. I love the action of the game the pictures,<br />colors and the music. Please make more of games like this. Thank you Jewels Star definitely takes you to Another Realm.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins continued where she left off in the  Hunger Games. The concept seemed far out but the author's skillful writing made the book difficult to put down. I just was sorry the story had ended.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It's big so the Kindle version is nice. I purchased the audio book as well from audible.com. I only wish they had whisper sync for voice. Then this product would be perfect.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The movie was great and it didnt take long to get here. it wasn't a problem really easy going precess.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run Two is the best game ever. It is so addictive.  You should totally get the game.Really fun. Yay!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins continued where she left off in the  Hunger Games. The concept seemed far out but the author's skillful writing made the book difficult to put down. I just had to buy Mocking Jay at the end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat right up to the last page when the end totally floored me.  A great, fast, engrossing thriller of a story!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have used Merriam Webster for a long time.  I like this one because you do not need to be online to use it.  Which comes in handy when you want to shut off the wireless to conserve energy on the Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun way to pass time. Gets faster and more challenging as you go along. Daily challenges and mission keep it interesting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game will lag on tablets.so don't  recommend this item for tablets other than that it is so fun if you have Facebook and your friends have Facebook and subway surfers you can play with them.the cities change right now it is Rio and before it was new York city. So fun! Defiantly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun for all ages.<br />I enjoy how it always gives you new places to go and people to unlock.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Exciting,inhibiting,kept me on edge of my seat. Regiment to all my reading friends, can't wait till I start his next book
B0067R0APK|5.0|I give this 5 stars because it works so well. But, so did the free version, until it stopped working. Amazon techs couldn't figure it out so they gave me a credit to use this version.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|I think this GA-990FXA-UD3 AM3 is a stable, high-speed platform for delivering fast data transfer via the GIGABYTE 333 onboard acceleration technologies. Featuring the USB3.0 controller, AMD 900 series motherboards allow to me to take advantage of super-fast USB transfer rates of up to 5Gbps, delivering 10x faster data transfer compared to USB 2.0.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|I remember watching this over and over as a teen so bought it to watch with my teenage daughter.  My hubby watched it with us laughing.  It is a goofy movie but enjoyable.  Price is perfect.
B001E7EONC|4.0|It was a great depiction of the actual events. I only wish they went more into the main characters instead of the rubbers
B00992CF6W|4.0|If that's a good thing...upgrading seems to be a chore or at least not straight forward.  Otherwise a 5 star
B00178JDCK|5.0|No one use's batteries anymore, Why buy and change batteries every time you wanna play , it is more logical to use a power supply that \\"Daisy Chains\\" all pedals, this way you have consistant power and tone when the effect is applied.<br /><br />  Ever tried starting a car on a dead or dying batterie, it makes your starter strain and who knows what with the electrical system. Now imagine that with your pedal. Im not an Electrical engineer or expert, but I do suspect this is why some lower cost pedals have a short life span. I own two Behringer pedals that I use constantly on a power supply and no problems at all...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS SOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN! FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, YOU CAN CHANGE  LOCATION MONTHLY ON WORLD TOUR. I'VE BEEN TO RIO GRANDE AND NEW YORK SO FAR AMAZING 3D GRAPHICS SO FFFFUUUUUNNNNN!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app/game is really fun. It is a new and improved temple run. You have multiple platforms such as a mine cart platform! I founded this app and played it at first. It was much better than temple run the original. It is way harder in some ways and way easier in others, you have more upgrades and different items. Yet, there was one flaw with this game.  When I play for a really long time it makes the game kind of pause. And when I try to do something about it, it won't play and the whole screen pauses. It just won't play! I have to wait some what of an hour to play it again. Still this game is a wonderful app, and I won't say don't waste your time. All you do is wait an hour, and it is only on this one app. So go ahead and try it, and remember that you can always delete this game from your device. BTW: I used this app on my kindle fire. I don't know if it works well with other devices, all I know is that if you down load this app on your kindle fire, that when you play it for about 30 - 45 mins, that you will have to wait one hour to play it again. Just entertain your self with all your other apps or games. I hope this helps your decision on getting or not getting this game!!! ;D good luck on beating it!!!!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|A few bad words here and there for the little ones, but overall, so funny & well done. Adam Sandler is amazing with the voice of Count Dracula!
B001GCUNYO|3.0|Loved the movie. I just wish there were some more extras. I was a little disappointed there. I decided to switch to Blu-Ray, since this version is usually the one that offers good extras. I could have bought the DVD, paid less, and still see the movie. I love the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter and I love playing this game! She is three years old and beats my score a lot of the time!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!! It's like Temple Run but it's on the Subways!!! You also can go to Rio and New York and many more!!! I recommend this game to everyone!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Outstanding!!  We're addicted.  Shame to see Mathew killed; ruins an important part of the story.  Even Julian Fellows though it was bad.  We assume it's because the actor playing Mathew isn't available for Series 4.  Chuck Burges  cburges@san.rr.com
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app is so cool and fun. Two thumbs up. I love this app! Lol buy it! It's interesting.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great Story, kept my attention and had me wanting to read more.  Was surprised at the ending, but in a good way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|How do I update on here.I mean I can't get this to go on 0.0.6.1 it's eras I love the game but I wanna update this
B0084AZXKK|3.0|A classic to be sure but less action than I am now accustomed to in today's works. Overall I'm glad I read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THE game subway surfers is amazing and it was a bomb it is fun and full of joy and swag.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Is a good book, I did not want to put it down. Can't wait to see the movie! I hope it is as good as the book was.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game with loads of content. If you've played Temple Run, than this game will be a pretty good challenge. You're also allowed to update the game to go to places like New York, Rio, etc. It might get a little repetitive after a while, but there's always more to unlock. New characters, boards, and daily challenges. Fun for all ages!
B00947N6D8|5.0|I have 3 children ages 3, 4, and 7. I usually have to take them to the restroom several times and they bother me so much that I can't even enjoy the movie. This movie absolutely mesmerized them!!!!!! It was awesome! this was the first movie I have ever come home and pre-ordered on DVD. It's a MUST SEE!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is great! They have a new theme every once in a while which is cool. It has great quality. Awesome powerups and characters. Overall I like it better than temple run!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a super game.I'm so addicted to this awesome game.ever science I heard of it I've played this game ever since.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really good graphics, better upgrades, and one GIANT monkey! Who couldn't love Temple Run? The ropes and mine carts definitely add to the effect. I definitely recommend this game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|All I have ever heard, is...&#34;have you watched nxt epsisode  of Downton Abbey?' I hadn't seen even one. The next thing i knew, it was winning all sorts of awards. I figured, I must be missing out on something special. I began to watch at a friends home who had sent for season one; i was hooked & can't wait to receive my amazon purchase of season two-it is spectacular. The writing, the cast keep me in suspense. What a wonderful show!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book I've ever encountered! Surprisingly even better than the movie!! IT WAS AMAZING!!!I love it can't wait to read the second and third book
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics for a free game, but it can be a little laggy at times. Other than that its great. I think I'm going to get addicted..
B0064W667Y|3.0|Nothing special. Nothing creative at all about the story. I hope the the rest of the series is better than the first.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|I've got this on both DVD and Blu-Ray and honestly didn't see much improvement in the Blu-Ray version. Either way, it's definitely a sci-fi classic that should be in every geek's library!
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|For any LOTR/ Hobbit fan, this is the perfect soundtrack. I bought it simply because I loved the song &#34;Misty Mountains,&#34; but the entire soundtrack is absolutely fantastic! Howard Shore does an amazing job!  I definitely recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am hooked on the Harry Bock series of books. This one was fabulous and keeps me waiting for more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good book and kept me up reading all night! Keeps you interested. Would recommend this book to a friends
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My three year old grandson and I are both addicted to this game. I sm really glad tha I took the time and tried it out.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and this book was another great one. The master of horror takes a whole new look at time travel, and it is a masterpiece! With never a dull moment, King keeps the book rolling, and it is a truly fanatic story! I recommend this for King fans, history fans and Sci fi fans too!!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|simply a great movie.  an epic tale of friendship and endurance through life's trials.  if you haven't seen it, you're missing out.
3795753384|4.0|Used, like new. It was totally virginally clean and untouched.  I was very pleased and bragged to the rest of the chorus about how much $$ I saved.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Typical of all her books, this one was amazing.  I loved it. However, when the climax of the story hit, i thought \\"really? Already?\\"  I have read every book in the Scarpetta series, and I look forward to the mystery part of it. This book just seemed to jump forward quicker than the others. Still a great read!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This film can only be described as an epic and emotional motion picture.  The adaptation from the Edgar Rice Burrough books is one of great creativity and definition.  The audience is given a ride that even the most ardent of realists can enjoy.  The pace is very rapid, yet totally entertaining.  If you have never read any books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, you may want to check them out.  This epic motion picture quite literally belongs in your collection of DVDs.  LOVE KNOWS NO LIMITS!  NJMJr.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|The details and thoughts of E. B. Sledge is that of similarity of my experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Very well put together book it explains so civilians but a lil to much for those of us serving in the military but fascinating to see how the phrases of Marines change over generations but the meaning is still the same.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Really fun!! In the style of Mario Brothers. I'm so glad I found this game! The artwork is really pretty too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome and so much fun playing with friends and haveing competitions with them too so get the game it is worth it
B008M721MS|5.0|i like it but how i can use and how i can download it on this kindle its not working
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's very thought provoking for me as a teacher of young children -age 4&5- that it's important to guide them and do activities to spark creativity. We need children to be future explorers, scientists, finding cures for diseases, etc. we don't need robots just going through the motions adults tell them to do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! It's completely fun, and so entertaining, It's so addictive. I would highly recommend getting it. I'm completely in love with this app.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I heard some of this on Pandora and ordered the cd. I am listening to the cd now as I write this and it is great!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|game was great the first time I played right after I downloaded it but everytime I have gone to play it since it crashes and wont open so I can no longer play it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought it was very &#34;wordy&#34;.  But the more I read I understood the thought the writer was trying to convey thru the character and thus brought out the emotion one feels while reading this book.  Yes it was a great book and I just bought her first book &#34;Slammed&#34; to read too.  i was hesitant because of the name of the book, but one can't judge a book by the title!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I heard some of this on Pandora and really liked it. I ordered the cd and it is really great!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Ads get in the way and slow down the game. But so much fun and super addictive.  The missions are easy but challenging enough to keep your interest. And the change of location is fun too.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I just wanted free gems and the graphics are good there's a unicorn which I really want and you should play this game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfers is a great game. It's WAY better then temple run<br />Because when you play temple run in the car it's really hard to tilt to<br />collect the coins. In subway surfers u can just swipe with your finger<br />to move and collect coins. Also there are more fun characters to pick from.<br />This game is addictive and fun.<br />Over all its a good game.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie and I had several questions or wanted more information. I read the book and I was happy to find out much more about this interesting society and the death games they use to entertain themselves. Great story and very easy to read.
B00080DIWE|5.0|I had, for years, been using a lazy susan from my kitchen cupboard, which did serve the purpose.  But, this little set has made painting my models a real pleasure.<br />You can have my gun.  But, you'll have to pry this gem from my cold dead hand.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great App!  Haven't gotten very far into it before I was asked to rate it.  (What's up with that?)  However, I have always enjoyed the basic \\"Seek & Find\\" apps but tended to stay away from the mystery/clue type.  I tried \\"Dark Arcana: the Carnival\\" because of the very high customer reviews.  I LOVE IT!  What an intriguing story line and beautiful graphics.  Thanks G5. :b
B003O86FMW|5.0|After I saw the movie \\"The Hunger Games\\" I picked up the first book and was fascinated by the story. I couldn't wait to get this one, once I received it I couldn't put it down. Out of the three I'd have to say this was my favorite.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing the movie when it comes out.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|** This review has many spoilers **<br />These 2 movies are a terrific adaptation that are true to Frank Miller/Klaus Janson's 1986 landmark story which along with the Watchmen invented the concept of comic book graphic novel. The Dark Knight Returns remains one of the greatest graphic novels of all time and I still remember picking up the 4 issues of the story back in 1986, not realizing the significance of what I was reading. So the makers of these movies had a lot to live up to when they decided to adapt the graphic novel into a movie. Firstly it was a very wise decision to split the story into 2 parts, too much story to cram into a single movie. The animation is first rate, clean lines, colours that capture the dark mood of a Gotham descended into a cesspool of crime and violence. The nuclear winter environment was really well drawn. And I'm glad the violence wasn't overly sanitized, there's lots of blood letting and brutality which did not feel gratuitous at all. Joker's murderous rampage from the methodically planned talk show audience massacare to his indiscriminate murdering at the fair grounds - how awesome was it to see him politely apologizing to the people in his path through the Tunnel of Love as he executed them one by one. And those creepy flying Bobbie and Mary poison gas spewing exploding robot dolls were sublime. And I was pleased they didn't overly sanitize the brutal fem-nazi Bruno character over allowing her to be topless with the memorable swastikas painted over her breasts (Although no view of her naked asscheeks like in the graphic novel).<br /><br />The pacing was excellent. The dialog crisp. The score was perfect, fitting and not overwhelming.<br /><br />The voice acting I'm split over. Having watched/listened to Kevin Conroy portray Batman for 2 decades it's hard to imagine anyone else who could do the voice of Batman. Similarly Mark Hamill did such a fantastic job as Joker for years I found the Mark Emerson's voice of Joker in this moviea bit too smooth and not maniacal enough. On the other hand I thought Mark Valley's voice of Superman/Clark's voice was a good fit right up there with George Newbury and Tim Daly who have done most of the voice of Superman in recent times. Ariel Winter was very good as Robin. Nice to see Justice League regular Maria Canals (Hawkgirl) with a prominent role. And always cool to see how producer Bruce Timm inserts himself into a minor character role and last but not least Michael McKean (remember Lenny and Squiggy?) as Dr Wolper and Conan O'Brien as Dave Endrochine were nice touches.<br /><br />And nice touches re-creating several iconic images from the graphic novel: The silhouette of Batman in mid air with the lightning bolt backdrop. Clark standing in the grassy field with the open shirt and one foot on a rock. A stabbed and bleeding Batman sitting next to a smiling, neck snapped dead Joker in the tunnel of love. Superman emaciated in the middle of the nuclear blast with the lightning bolt through his body. Superman plastered on the nose top of the huge Soviet nuclear missle in mid flight. Bruce pulling the drapes aside finding a beaten, bound Selina Kyle hog tied wearing a Wonder Woman costume.<br /><br />Kudos to Bruce Timm and director Jay Oliva for this fantastic product and hopefully more of these DC Animated Universe movies to come. Just sticking to Batman alone there's so much material ... Long Halloween, Hush, Knightfall to name a few.<br /><br />Now that I've watched this film adaptation it's time to re-read the graphic novel again!

0061950726|4.0|I absolutely enjoyed reading it but it had some shortcomings that detracted enough from the book that it attained pleasure reading status rather than a great American novel.<br /><br />The author interweaves the story of two women, who though they are separated by more than 70 years; face similar tragedies, hardships, and emotional disappointments that are common to the human experience.  Through their fortitude, tenacity and persistence, they overcome their unique challenges to successfully live life on life's terms with joy.<br /><br />As the synopsis states, Vivian was placed on an orphan train when her family dies in a tenement fire.  Though young, approximately 7 years of age, she is selected by her \\"first parents\\" to be nothing more than free labor in their sweatshop making ladies clothes.  When the stock market crashes, the orders stop and nearly starving, she runs away.  Of course, being so young she again becomes a ward of the Children's Aid Society and once again, she is placed into an equally miserable situation and runs away.  Through good fortune and compassion of strangers, Vivian is finally placed with a childless couple to work in their store.  She is a quick study and makes lemonade out of lemons.<br /><br />As the Vivian's story of her youth unfolds, we are reading alternating chapters of Molly's unhappy journey through foster care.  After stealing Jane Eyre from the local library, she is assigned 50 community hours, which she parlays into being assigned to Vivian's historian/house cleaner.  More specifically, though Vivian is quite wealthy and she has nearly 90 years of junk to sort through and Molly, a total stranger is going to help her separate life's treasures from trash.<br /><br />Molly's assignment to help Vivian is one of the stories weakest points.  Vivian, who other than being elderly is quite physically and mentally capable of sorting her own stuff and furthermore, she has a full-time housekeeper, Terry.  It is Terry that gets Molly the job at the behest of her son, Jack, Molly's boyfriend.  The reason Terry hasn't assisted Vivian in this effort over previous years is because she doesn't want to!?  This scenario is all to contrived for me.<br /><br />Another weakness of the story is that Molly's characterization is the signature \\"troubled child\\", she exemplifies the \\"bad ass\\" foster kid attitude and plenty of piercings for emphasis.  While in many ways, her story parallels Vivian's; as we are reading her account it also sounds pretty similar to any local news story, with a loss of her dad to a car accident and her mom to drugs.  Perhaps, this is a truly sad commentary on society in general; but she is so stereotypical, it is hard to empathize with her character or to root for her survival. More importantly, I felt the author didn't make Molly empathetic. It isn't that you dislike her, her characterization is too flat with the exception that both she and Vivian are great fans of Jane Eyre.<br /><br />Couple this with the repeated theme of the rejection all the main characters seem to have to endure and it is nearly maudlin.  Jack is the product of a brief affair, his mother had with a Black Dominican resulting in her being disowned by her family and abandoned by the her fiance thus leaving her a single mom and Jack having to deal with growing up without a father figure.<br /><br />Molly's foster parents' are emotional \\"train\\" wreaks as well, with overwhelming resentment by her foster mother, Diane for her mere existence (she just wants the maintenance check)and her foster father being too weak and wounded himself to fight on Molly's behalf.<br /><br />Though I preferred Vivian's story, there are times where her speech sounds more like that of today's 20 year old than that of an elderly woman.  Additionally, some of words weren't even in the vernacular of that era, so it would be unlikely for her to tell her story in such a manner.<br /><br />Ms. Baker Kline tackles a plethora of emotions: fear of rejection; fear of the unknown; alienation; inability to trust others; the inability to be honest about the true self are all major themes.  I think she wove them fairly effectively.  The book covered a topic that has always interested me; the orphan trains and Baker Kline obviously did her research and it resonates in the telling.<br /><br />It may be fun to put this in your bag for a beach reading but I doubt it will become your \\"Jane Eyre\\".ejection; fear of the unknown; alienation; inability to trust others; the inability to be honest about the true self are all major themes.  I think she wove them fairly effectively.

B00AHXDECG|4.0|This album is pretty good. like the songs \\"Locked out of heaven\\" and \\"Natalie\\". But there are a couple flaws. Like there's a song that's just piano, and then there's a song that rips off a reggae tune. I mean, It's okay to make a song in reggae style, but it's like he just took a reggae song and called it his. I say i give it four stars.
0596009208|2.0|I've heard great things about Head First books, but was turned off immediately. Who has time to wade through all this cutsie/hip presentation?  I returned gratefully to my all-too-grownup \\"Core Java\\" book and blasted through everything I needed to know, and more.

0385535147|2.0|Being an avid Grisham fan, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, this was not one of his best. In fact, had I not known the author I would never have pegged this as John Grisham. It was slow, lacked suspense throughout most of the story, the main character was dull and I was hoping as I continued reading that it would gain some momentum. Overall, I would give this book a C+.
B00008QSA5|4.0|the combination of mike bloomberg al kooper and stephen stills is one of those rare fusions of raw talent and just plain wow factors this album is a must have for any collector of the blues!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game very funny I have to be honest I wasn't a big fan of temple run 1 and my friend talked me into downloading the game and I loved it if you are thinking about downloading it do it NOW and it's FREE yes free!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app. I love horses and this is the coolest app ive found to have a virtual horse on. However the app only opens about 25% of the time and that is very frustrating. Please fix it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game I currently have on my kindle. the only slight downside is that it is one of those games that you just can't make bug-free. other than that it is a great app and is the cheapest version of minecraft. this app is definetly worth it and cannot be compared.
1616550414|5.0|This is a great book that has everything a zelda fan would want. Lots of color and art. You will be looking at it for years

B008597UP6|3.0|Of course there can be no doubt that Kafka left The Castle unfinished since it stops abruptly in mid-sentence, but after reading the work for the second time, I would like to call into question Kafka`s true motivations for leaving the work unfinished.<br /><br />The one true drawback to the castle as a literary work is that, at times, it becomes somewhat wordy and wandering, so that I propose the true reason for Kafka's abandoning the work in mid-sentence is not the fact that he didn't have time to finish it, but rather the fact that he didn`t know where it was going instead.<br /><br />The work has many interesting elements.  It can be read as an allegory for society, outcasts, conformity, even as an examination of male/female relationships in examining Freida, K and Pepi, but really there's simply no logical way that The Castle could possibly have been concluded.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is a good action thriller crime novel with really good characters and a great plot.  I found it to be a quick read and extremely entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I do not understand what all the fuss (and adolescent giggling) that's been made over this book.  This is nothing but a cheap, dime store sex 'novel'.  The writing is trite and, quite frankly, horrible.  It reads like a teenagers diary might read.  I made it through to Chapter 11 and got rid of it.  We get it, Miss Steele and Mr. Grey get it on and GET IT ON GOOD!!  At the risk of offending someone, if you have to read this kind of crap to put excitement into your life, you need to re-examine your life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game ever if you like temple run then you will like this game!!! I like this game a lot!!!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I was really enjoying this game and teaching my six year old...she loved it! But now it is requiring an internet connection everytime we turn the kindle on which we don't always have
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a good design of puzzle/ adventure game, images are sharp and a interesting storyline that is worth following. There is plenty of variation in mini games that should keep you entertained for hours.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a satisfying and wildly popular game, interesting for adults and kids. Unfortunately, Amazon is very slow to make updates available. With such a popular, trendy game, this is massively frustrating and undermines much of the app's value. I would have wanted to know that the Kindle is a bad platform for this app before I purchased the app or the Kindle.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Good book because it was very awesome and it rocks in the second series it was even more awesome and cool
B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you are a Nelson DeMille fan, like I am, you'll like this book. He never disappoints. John Corey never disappoints either.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Heard about Downton Abbey from a friend.  For those who love Maggie Smith and Gosford Park, it was tremendously satisfying.  I heard that it kind of stalls out in Season 3.  Boy were they wrong!  Enjoying this while knitting on a cold Winters day or night.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is awesome.I love subway surfers. I love the RIO version. can't wait till the next version. This Game is awesome.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I am not an emotional person, never saw the point of tears in love movies, think it's silly when people do but I cried like a little bitty baby in this novel. I love that this book is realistic-ish. A new girl (Lake) moves into town and her neighbor (Will) has automatic hots for her. They go on a date and both feel an instant unexplained connection. Something happens when the two can't be together yet they still have to see each other everyday multiple times a day. Their little brothers are best friends, adding fuel to the fire.<br /><br />Lake soon finds out why they had to pack up and move right after the father dies and now has to be a strong rock from the family. They begin to communicate through a love of poetry. Will helps her get through the rough patch in her life and it is hard for both of them not to continue their romantic relationship. I was an emotional roller coaster when it came down to this book. It is a quick read, maybe a day or two. Lot's of laughs, good tears, many smiles.<br /><br />While the main characters are easy to love, the secondary characters are a riot in themselves. Even when Kel and Caulder are sleeping they made me laugh. Lake's best friend is a confident fire cracker who is witty and has a story of her own. A story for each secondary character can be written and enjoyed as stand alones.<br /><br />I have recommended this to many friends who have enjoyed books such as Beautiful Disaster (Jamie McGuire), Easy, Vincent Boys and other college/late teen romance novels. They are not super billionaires, they do not have crazy ape sex all the time, they are normal everyday you and me people.
B006CQLGXG|4.0|Enjoyed the novel and the original drawings were a treat.  Glad that Amazon preserved the illustrations. The e-book (kindle) format works great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Every book that Sparks has written I have read.  They are great reads, I enjoy how he builds the characters throughout each story.  I love the tenderness and raw emotions you see in the characters.  I can picture myself in the book watching it take place just out of view of the characters, willing them to make better choices or to react differently.
B00064WSNM|5.0|This remaster sounds OK to me and, for those not familiar with the record, it is a Masterpiece of Innovation as it relates to 20th century musicianship and composition. The musical elites of the day (myself included) snacked on this disc made of vinyl and petroleum spinning on a DUEL manual turntable often, along with gentle giant and a few other worthy works. YOU CANT GO WRONG, BESIDES OLGA JUST SAID...
B008K8VDPU|3.0|Nothing super fantastic, but it's something to play with.  I do like the play along song setting, although it's trickier than you would think.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Excellent as most of his novels !!! He never lets me down ! I admire his writing,intelligence,humour, use of English,rythm etc etc. I'm his absolute fan since i read Saturday.Never miss any of his books.<br />There is always an unexpected twist in his stories and an incursion in Maths or Physics that I love !!!
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|My first mistake was listening to many of the songs on this CD online where the quality was poor.  My second was jumping to the same conclusion many of you did, \\"too easy listening\\".  After listening to the CD I've got to revise my first impressions and push my original 3 star rating to 4.  Don't give up on this CD too early, because the strongest numbers come towards the end. Foster surrounds the voice with arrangements that are lush and beautiful as always. It is true that you can picture Bocelli sipping espresso and reading the newspaper while singing some of these, and while good, they are not memorable. However there are many very good to great ones:<br /><br />Champagne--I perked up with this one.  The first song that gave the CD real promise.<br /><br />Era gia tutto previsto--Bocelli emerges! I'm a fan of talk singing so this caught me immediately.<br /><br />La vie en rose--Love it! Beautiful duet and he somehow manipulated his voice to match Piaf's perfectly.<br /><br />Garota de Ipanema--The first to put a smile on my face throughout the entire song. He sings it exactly how it was intended to be sung. The way my generation first heard it and sung it for weeks afterwards.<br /><br />Malafemmena--Hello! The sultriest song on the CD.<br /><br />Il nostro incontro--The most potent combination of singer and musician.  Bocelli and Botti make magic together.<br /><br />Senza Fine--Great, great song.<br /><br />Mano a mano--again a great song.<br /><br />When I Fall in Love--He doesn't stray from the original version on this one either to his credit.  Great match for his voice.<br /><br />There are other songs that are more than good, but not quite great--Anema E Core, Quizas is catchy but I'm not sure Lopez was the best choice, Corcavado is much better pairing of voices and really enjoyable, Love in Protofino is very good.<br /><br />I think \\"Amore\\" will be the more succesfull of the two CD's because of the upbeat tempo of many of the songs, something \\"Passione\\"might have benefited from.  Still \\"Passione\\" is well worth the purchase!
1451695195|5.0|Very interesting and thought provoking book. You should read it! Received it in a speedy process which was great because I was looking forward to reading it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool for your kids to play and its kind of like temple run. I hope you enjoy the game and have a good bless time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well written but did seem slow at times.  I was a little disappointed in the ending...I didn't expect it to be so abrupt.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Okay. I'm a writer myself, and I wanted to like this. The writing at the beginning was a bit sophomoric, but okay, turns out this is a \\"contemporary romance\\" (the author's description) and apparently for kids. I am open-minded about reading things for a younger audience; even curious. I've read Twilight and the first of Amanda Hockings book. This was not as bad, I thought, writing-wise.<br /><br />I knew what Sky's problem was from the first scene. I knew what the relationship with Holder would be because I knew there was already... some background. But it didn't bother me figuring out the plot because I'm a writer and I'm always anticipating plots.<br /><br />SPOILER BELOW (not a very secret spoiler, since it's obvious from the start)<br /><br />So... what did bother me?  Using traumatic events as entertainment with no understanding of the devastation involved.  Minimizing the aftermath of abuse.  Manipulating readers with wildly unrealistic solutions brought about by falling in love.<br /><br />Holder talking like no guy ever talked. The four and five-year-old versions of these characters talking like 10-year-olds. The page after page description of their make-out sessions (so many cupping hands on faces! so much leaning on chests and heads! so much kissing of necks!) and then their eventual giving in to the urges. And a lot of unwrapping of condoms! I'm sure 17-year-olds have sex all the time, but I don't really think they should. And I don't think this couple in particular should. And if they need to, to \\"cure\\" her... couldn't they wait a bit? Maybe no sex might be just the right, mature move. Oh, and I guess I don't really want to read about 17-year-olds having sex anyway. And I didn't know that I would be reading about it here. That's the sneaky thing about this book. Even if you read a sample, you have no idea of where it's going.<br /><br />I have to point out that the author never describes anything except that Sky has lots of hair and lots of stars on her ceiling. And Holder has scruffy brown hair, blue eyes and dimples. Everything else is a big blank. And she NEVER uses body part names. Amazing! \\"The moment his eyes fall back to mine, he pushes himself into me without a moment of hesitation.\\" That would be the sex act. There is not a single reference to breasts, nipples, or any of the specific body parts involved in intercourse. Yuuucky, I guess! Teenagers can touch 'em, but they can't talk about 'em.<br /><br />Rule: If you can't use the \\"p\\" word (Amazon won't let me type it out), you shouldn't be reading about sex. Or having it!<br /><br />It's not a romance. It's what we used to call \\"women's fiction,\\" except that this book is not for adult women. There are so many outlandish coincidences and incredible plot points that it gets silly by the end. Not to mention very sad and very adult.<br /><br />This book is a bit like Holder -- it seems to have at least two different personalities. I can see how teens might love it... but I wonder if their mothers know what they're reading? And speaking of parents, what kind of parents are there in this book? Karen is absurd, Holder's Mom is unbelievably uncaring, and Six's parents are... invisible. What are they doing while their daughter is banging every boy in her grade? And do they ever notice that Sky sneaks into their house to make international phone calls... hello... is anybody HOME?<br /><br />About a third of the way into this book I was enjoying it. A sweet teen romance with perhaps too much cupping and neck-kissing action, but okay. And then it turned into this potboiler, dark and horrible. Then the bad guy conveniently disappears, and true love will save Sky. She and her boy even talk about marriage... because you know that teens in love last forever.<br /><br />Ms. Hoover trivializes serious issues to manipulate her readers into thinking love can cure everything.  But it can't.ceiling. And Holder has scruffy brown hair, blue eyes and dimples. Everything else is a big blank. And she NEVER uses body part names. Amazing! \\"The moment his eyes fall back to mine, he pushes himself into me without a moment of hesitation.\\" That would be the sex act. There is not a single reference to breasts, nipples, or any of the specific body parts involved in intercourse. Yuuucky, I guess! Teenagers can touch 'em, but they can't talk about 'em.<br /><br />Rule: If you can't use the \\"p\\" word (Amazon won't let me type it out), you shouldn't be reading about sex. Or having it!<br /><br />It's not a romance. It's what we used to call \\"women's fiction,\\" except that this book is not for adult women. There are so many outlandish coincidences and incredible plot points that it gets silly by the end. Not to mention very sad and very adult.<br /><br />This book is a bit like Holder -- it seems to have at least two different personalities. I can see how teens might love it... but I wonder if their mothers know what they're reading? And speaking of parents, what kind of parents are there in this book? Karen is absurd, Holder's Mom is unbelievably uncaring, and Six's parents are... invisible. What are they doing while their daughter is banging every boy in her grade? And do they ever notice that Sky sneaks into their house to make international phone calls... hello... is anybody HOME?<br /><br />About a third of the way into this book I was enjoying it. A sweet teen romance with perhaps too much cupping and neck-kissing action, but okay. And then it turned into this potboiler, dark and horrible. Then the bad guy conveniently disappears, and true love will save Sky. She and her boy even talk about marriage... because you know that teens in love last forever.<br /><br />Ms. Hoover trivializes serious issues to manipulate her readers into thinking love can cure everything.  But it can't.
B0049DN56A|5.0|Beyond Gipsy jazz, beyond musette, far away from corny accordeons, Zaz comes to us like a breath of fresh air, bringing life back to a moribund French music scene obsessed with Anglo-Saxon sounds. Latin and North African sounds made great strides in France's music scene, bringing about a fusion that transcended borders and cultures. Yet, since the passing of Helno in 1993 (Negresses Vertes lead singer), no one had really managed to bring back that zest for life, this celebration of true French sounds. Zaz music is simply wonderful, unabashed by French musicians sad diaphanous posture towards their own essence.<br />Here we have an album that brings back the Quintette du Hot Club de France, Piaf and many more. Zaz voice is also unique: strong, complex with this touch of street urchin, she uses it like a true music instrument, precise and yet so unique.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian is one of the best books I have read in years. I have recommended it to numerous people.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I had never played this before trying the app. Its fun and the difficulty goes up as you get better. Keeps it challenging.
B007NU54H4|5.0|A great Tinker Bell story. Nothing at all objectionable or frightening and even little children can watch and love the wonderful story and great animation. As their 70 year old grandfather, I regularly watch with the little ones, 2 and 5 years old, and enjoy the experience as well. Beautifully done, Walt Disney.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This is a great educational and interesting app for knowledge seeking types like myself. Wonderful tutorials that go in depth if you are interested in technical details.
B00992CF6W|4.0|They need to update it to 0.6.1 like iPod, ipad, and iPhone so this app is not got armor,signs,baby animals, and a stonecutter
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is accurate and shows battery when you turn your tablet on when it is low. It also summarizes how the power was used. It gives you a great idea of how much power the different apps use.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a good and entertaining game but is a bit slow to react and also good for any age xx
B00170F0WU|4.0|Liked this movie and good performances. I did find the story line disturbing in that the killer would befriend a child and teach her to kill.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It a excited games and it good game for kid to play this game I love this game so much ha.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This is a quick visual app which I have found useful. You can see the strength of the wireless signals in the area. So if you are not sure which circuit is available to you, you often know by the strength of the signal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun I can not explain it. It is so fun I might explode. So fun so fun so fun so fun so fun so fun so fun!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|works great on my Kindle Fire hd. The format is beautiful and user friendly. It is easy to learn and navigate.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing! It makes you smile, laugh, and cry in such a short period of time. It's definitely a heart-felt story. A MUST read!
B008220DGE|1.0|I viewed the film and came away shaking my head. I think the best (and kindest) remarks (reviews) said \\" while some watched the film two or three times feeling they may have missed something, it should not be necessary for a viewer to watch a film multiple times to attempt to discern a hidden meaning\\".<br />While I agree with those who praise the acting, I also agree with those who find the film a pointless waste of time. I feel that attempting to dissect the film looking for meaning is an exercise that yields diminishing returns.<br />Maybe those who are acolytes of Scientology will have an inherent understanding of the intensely obscure \\"theme\\".<br /><br />Who knows, this might become a cult classic comparable to the Orson Welles film \\"Citizen Kane\\" which was, at one time, incomprehensibly voted the best film of all time. Only thing missing is \\"Rosebud\\" as the final line.<br /><br />One line in the movie DID impress me. Jesse Plemons who plays Lancaster Dodd's son is told to go listen to his father's holding forth that he may learn something.  He replies, \\"He's making this all up as he goes you know. I could sleep right through it and not miss a thing\\".<br /><br />So say us all !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game.me and my brother  love it more than temple run.oh and speaking about temple run,their  is now a temple run 2!
B0049J0DC8|5.0|&#34;Toy Story I&#34; - I am a senior citizen and do not watch a lot of children movies; but I enjoyed this movie very much. Cleverly done.  I loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game that everyone should get. It is crazy addicting and super fun. I especially like it when the setting and city change.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is an awesome game that you should play its an example of how modern the kindle is, PLAY IT!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Glee meets South Park. Crude humor, but the singing is fun to hear. Not appropriate for children under thirteen years of age.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is not just a photo album fot pretty pictures! It's a way to catalog knowledge, plans and ideas for projects, and a way to connect with new friends.<br />I have a suggestion - when pinnimg to boards, a search option would be nice at the top to enter the first letter of the board name to go there quickly.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Got this as soon as it became available. I have a passive 3D LG 55&#34; TV, with a Yamaha A-1010 7.1 receiver, Oppo 93 3D blu-ray player, and Polk Audio speakers. Both my adult son and I felt the viewing was as good as when we saw it in the theater--which was pretty damn good.
B0010Z32OA|3.0|I thought I was buying the DVD.  My error.  So I can only watch the movie on the computer and I can't turn on the CC.  Again, I guess it was a learning experience.  I won't do it again.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|Worth watching just in 2D.<br /><br />3D brings out how the prehistoric paintings on the cave walls were placed so as to give the impression of depth. I feel this is a title worth having for 3D fans.
B001NA6096|4.0|Before Sunrise is an excellent picture of the nervousness of youth. After spending time learning how not to be nervous before the camera it is a real craft to recall that nervousness for the camera. Kudos to actors and director.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I think it's a great movie and the 3D makes it even better. By now, you've either already seen it, or heard about it. If you have 3D and are looking for decent movies to collect, I recommend this.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|At first I thought this book was about a girl haha Don  judge. But after a while when Harold started taking about how he's going to date and do all that other stuff the book got really good this book is like awkward and different. I haven't seen the movie yet so I'm excited!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfers is an awesome game not the best but great. I would have wanted to have a choice between a boy and a girl for the first character. Great game.
0765325950|5.0|I give this series five stars as a whole even though the separate volumes are of uneven quality.  Long fantasy sagas appeal to me, beginning with Tolkien's masterful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" that set the standard for modern fantasy.  The Wheel of Time is a good tribute to Tolkien as well as a masterpiece in its own right.<br /><br />The difference between the two, the difference that is important to me, is that The Wheel of Time has believable women, characters who are women first and then are Aes Sedai, queens, kinswomen, wise ones, Forsaken, or just ordinary women doing the best they can under extraordinary circumstances.  Some people have complained about these women who shake their shawls or flounce their skirts or engage in other minor tics or features of behavior.  I found it amusing because I have seen it all in my many years.  The rivalries, the cooperation, the mentoring, the friendships--all of these features combine to make the women real to me.<br /><br />If I have any quibble about Brandon Sanderson's work in finishing the series it is that the women become somewhat less individual, with fewer of the quirks and idiosyncrasies.  Other than that I must congratulate him for completing a labor of love most satisfactorily.<br /><br />Now, to start reading it all over again.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Love a game that combines hidden object's. a story and puzzles.  The price is right as well.  I bet many of you spent more than that on a cup of coffee or fast food today.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This may not be as guitar-driven as past Tegan & Sara albums, but it is driven by an incredible energy that just makes you want to keep listening and singing along.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how you get different places to tour and how each palce comes with its one board and character. I think that there should be a tour of Korea and the board say gangnam style on top and the bottom of the board will be the  Korean flag and the character will be PSY
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of my 2 favorite mystery writers.  I have read all of his books.  The Black Box was incredible.  I read it in 2 days -- just couldn't put it down.  Too bad because I now have to wait a long time for the next one.  Jane Hooton
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I play it on my kindle my computilure my ipod.its reaaaallllllly fun. I like that amazon makes it easy to download

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever! Its better than temple run and tempo run 2 I love this. Everyone needs this game. Get it now
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is good but after a while it won't let me play it. it loads and goes right back to the home screen.
0062238868|5.0|I went into this book expecting a lot of machismo and bad-ass stories about being a bad-ass sniper. While there was a decent amount of that, I was surprised to find that there was a lot of heart to the author's story.<br />Specifically, Chris Kyle and his wife reveal details about their personal struggles with dealing with his military career. Both he and his wife are very open and honest about their ups and downs, they didn't seem to gloss over their low points or negative feelings at all. We usually want to view ourselves in a positive light and ignore our own mistakes, but they both admit to bad feelings they had and mistakes they made. That was impressive.<br />I was also impressed by Chris Kyle's humbleness. The title and subtitle of the book made me think I was going to be listening to some typical military bragging from a typical military bad-ass, but Kyle came across as humble, without any of the \\"I'm tougher than anyone\\" crap. He seemed very down-to-earth, someone who I'd be glad to call my friend.<br />It takes courage to write about your low points as well as your high points, so for that reason I was very impressed with this book.
B00A5052YE|3.0|If the title is a metaphor to suggest that Alicia Keys is some kind of outstanding musical talent, I disagree. The girl can play the piano, but, when it comes to composing songs, she’s lukewarm at best. Her singing voice is nice enough. I don’t even mind the husky underlining that makes it sound like she either needs to go “ahem” real loud or lay off the Newports. It’s her vocal melodies that lack. Almost every song here suffers from a case of first-degree mediocrity.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Prometheus is a movie the makes you wince as you watch.  The behavior of the &#34;biologist&#34; on board a trillion dollar mission?  A contaminated mission leader who tries to hide his contamination?  Major surgery followed by running and jumping?  Another decapitated android?  Aliens that can grow in the absence of calories?  And on, and on, and on...<br /><br />Good grief, Charlie Brown!<br /><br />This was the first, and only, movie I purchased while on a airline flight, and that time through I thought both the screen size and the airline editing must have affected my perception of the movie and plot.  Then I just finished watching it in HD yesterday.<br /><br />I nominate Prometheus for a Razzie Award.  Any seconds?<br /><br />And did I mention that one of my favorite movies of all time is Aliens?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is AMAZING!!!!its so much better then the origanal temple run. its so awesome. some of the things that r different is that for one part u can go in a mining cart! a another thing that is different is that u go on a zip line!! see what else u can do and GET IT!!!!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST FILMS EVER MADE.  THE SETTING IS GREAT AND THE ACTING IS THE BEST.  MAGGIE SMITH COULD NOT BE BETTER AND THE CHILDREN BRING A SPECIAL SOMETHING TO THEIR ROLES.  I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE WITH MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY MANY, MANY TIMES AND WE JUST LOVE IT.  HOPE MORE PEOPLE SEE IT AND HAVE THE SAME GREAT VIEWING EXPERIENCE THAT I/WE HAD.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I'm new to the Jack Reacher series but am falling in love with this character.  Tom Cruse does not do him justice.
0545157617|5.0|My grandson has all her books and we love reading them.  Did not know Santa was in the book.  Great story!
B0091THRCU|3.0|The pouch is well made and worksmanship seems of hight quality.  I like the concept of this case however there is one flaw.<br /><br />The case it too tight.  I have a full body zagg screen protector and the tightness of the case puts indentions on my screen protector towards the bottom of the pouch and the top where the opening is. The tightness could make it difficult to get your phone out.  Makes me wonder if the tightness will eventually rub the paint off my black iphone 5.<br /><br />The concept of the pouch is nice but improvements needs to be made to &#34;softly&#34; protect the phone instead of bear hugging it.
0142407542|5.0|Loved this book.  It is a favorite to read to the grandchildren.  A great sequel to The Gruffalo.  We love reading all of her books.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What's not to love?  A Space-Cowboy TV show!  I Wish it'd come back on the air.  Bought the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; to with, but it's just not enough.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This miniseries if terrific.  The story and the acting are so moving that I have watched it many times over.  The relationships formed by the major characters are truly touching, and the sets and costumes are wonderful; the atmosphere of 19th century England comes through brilliantly.  Fans of the BBC or of PBS dramas are certain to enjoy this amazing series.
