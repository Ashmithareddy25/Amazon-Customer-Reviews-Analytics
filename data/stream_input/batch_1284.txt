B0063IH60K|5.0|This game of solitaire is very entertaining, while giving you the quick ability to undo a play you made a mistake playing. Very fun!
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|game is terrible :(  but I thought it would be much better but no it isn't graphics match up and it runs smoothly I dislike it because it sucks
0756404738|4.0|The Wise Man's Fear was much better than Book 1, and Book 1 wasn't bad at all.  Like The Name of the Wind, this is a book you should read, just take all of the 5-star reviews and comparisons to Tolkien with a grain of salt (tequila optional).   I'm looking foward to Day 3.
B005ZUR724|4.0|oFTo awesome sauce!!!! best game I played for a low price, with lots of things to do and characters to interact with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  You can go on and search any verse then change the version and not loose your place. Also have the ability to highlight and bookmark.. Great app for anyone that likes to study anywhere and able to spread the word at just a simple click!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Great release of this item.<br />I have the trilogy that came before, but this one is so much better release. Good extra content. Good box that contains the Bluray.<br />A must have for X-Men fans.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is woo fun! i love omnom......its an awesome app and works awesome on the kindle fire. its really fun and worth a dollar and it doesn't crash when yu get on it....I LOVE CUT THE ROPE!!!!!!!!!
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|I cant believe people ruthlessly slam this game for only giving them 4 games. The ability to purchase more is ok. No one is pretending you get 30 games for 3 bucks, and youd be silly to demand that.  I enoyed the games. Free loaders stop the griping.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|The cadence of this film is so relaxing - perfect movie to watch when chilling out, it's romantic (but not like all of the modern american romance films), and visually pleasing to watch; all of the actors have an enjoyable performance.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with the anti-climactic parting of ways with Adriana; it would have been nice if they tied her archetype in a little more clearly or directly somehow with the woman he ended up running into on the bridge in the end...
B004RSCWZ2|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Derek Trucks and have loved his awesome guitar work. When he married Susan Tedechi and they recorded together, this had musical promise. How disappointing. While Dereck may have found marital bliss, he has lost himself in this recording. This essentially is a Susan Tedechi album - don't get me wrong, she is a talented blues player - but Dereck is nowhere to be found. While the opening track has some signature Dereck work, he is pretty much otherwise MIA. somehow two great musicians should make great music. However, the result is Susan totally dominates and Dereck is barely there.   If they record together in the future, I hope they get better balance.
B005HSL626|5.0|being me,  I'm often bored. when I first got this app, I could hardley stop playing it! for once in my life, I was no longer bored. this game is fun &amp; additive. my grandma and mother both love it as well. to summerize, this game SLICES. THE. BORDEM. AWAY!
B0063IH60K|3.0|enjoy game but hate getting come-ons for other games. once is enough. don't keep asking again and. again. thank you.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is wonderful live! I've always enjoyed her vocals on her two CD's 19 & 21 but some of the arragements and chorus vocals not so much! Live - the arragements and chorus vocals come together much better.  Not as intimate as her CD's on the ballads but this is done live in a very large hall and she still manages to do a great job!<br /><br />If you have kids be aware that she does throw out a few F bombs.
0143116738|4.0|Great Read.  Ken Robinson uses the term, The Element, to describe the place where the things we love to do and the things we are good at come together, and that is where the sparks start flying.  As Robinson skillfully points out throughout the text, this concept has deep implications for education, because many brilliant, creative people did not do well at school.  Hmmmm.  As a matter of fact, it wasn't until many of them left school that they recovered from their education and do something with their lives.  This book tells those stories, and it smarts at times for educators who have built the box of \\"school\\" with sharp edges.<br /><br />He challenges all of our assumptions about intelligence and makes us think that perhaps public schools in America should be doing more than preparing their students to become University Professors.  Perhaps teaching our students to think and create might be more valuable, and using the Arts to do it could be wonderful thing.<br /><br />He also exposes the profit generating machine behind the standardized testing movement (it is BIG business) but comes short of calling it a conspiracy.  The book starts out a little slow but quickly picks up speed, and he lays out a new way of thinking about educational reform in the end.  Worthy.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This is a great CD!  Rather you are a big Tony Bennett fan or not, this CD is fabulous!  If you are a TB fan, then it is a MUST HAVE!
B005ZUR724|2.0|2 stars cause ive seen what this game is capable of, but as of yet have been unable to play. Getting dumped to the app store for an update that doesn't exist does not encourage me. Ive seen gameplay online, and at a friends house. I'd hate to delete this and lose my money over an issue that could at least be officially addressed.
B005ZUR724|3.0|I have a kindle fire and i love(d) this app but the update really is broken i also have a iphone and i have some apps on there that got broken by a update. So please get a new update designer or something, and I'm paying for a membership so if you don't fix it in the next 3 months i will sue, and many other will too.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I read through many of the reviews before deciding to purchase this cover. I was a bit concerned, as were some others, about the negative comments written, especially those about the bad stand. Now that I have it and have used it, I am happy with my purchase. For the cost of the cover I think it does a great job. It is light-weight and very sleek in design which adds nothing to the weight of the Fire. It feels good in my hand. I would have given it five stars except that the stand part does slip a little unless you get it positioned right. However, it isn't that big of a deal; unless you are a monkey, it doesn't take that long to figure out. I would also like to see some kind of a magnetic strap that would come from the back to hold the cover closed when not in use - but I figure I'm old enough to treat my electronics with respect so I can be careful with it and not be tossing it around.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I was surprised how much info was provided, and how easy it was to access.  Nicely done and highly recommended.
1594484805|5.0|Daniel Pink delivers.  Again.  Picking up where he left off (A Whole New Mind), Pink lands a knock-out punch with this one.  With great stories and keen insights, he shows us where the world is headed.  This is more than a book about motivation.  It is a book about life and how you can make your life (and work) better by focusing on the right things.<br /><br />This book is a trip at 35,000 feet.  A great adventure from the mundane world we find ourselves in every day.  Pink describes three types of motivation.  Motivation 1.0 is survival.  People behave in certain ways (sometimes very negative and hurtful ways) to survive.  Motivation 2.0 is extrinsic.  The factories of today are systems of carrots and sticks and use extrinsic forces to control behavior and make improvements.  Unfortunately, most of our public schools today are elaborate Motivation 2.0 systems designed to produce cogs (worker bees) who follow instructions but don't think for themselves.<br /><br />Pink shows us that Motivation 3.0 is where it's at.  Motivation 3.0 companies have figured out how to tap Intrinsic behavior and are destroying the competition.  What does this mean for schools?  We must move beyond carrots and sticks.  We must seek to inspire students to become thinkers and learners.  People who read and write because they want to.  People who solve problems.  What kind of work can we provide for students so that the work itself will inspire thinking and learning?<br /><br />We need to challenge the 2.0 way of doing school.  Bigger carrots and sharper sticks is not the answer.  We are not going to create Linchpins (Seth Godwin's term, which means indispensable people) by extrinsic forces (i.e. money for test scores)--that method will just create more cogs.<br /><br />Train teachers to provide work for students that matters.  Work that makes them think, produce things, solve problems, and work in teams.  Easier said than done, but Pink will rock your world, dunk your head underwater, and wake you up.  If you have every been frustrated by our test-crazed current public school system, this book is a must read.wake you up.  If you have every been frustrated by our test-crazed current public school system, this book is a must read.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice the same day!  I ordered it streaming from Amazon on my Roku XD (which I also love).  The reception was great.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is a little intense for younger children.  The special effects (like those in Avatar) are unbelievable.  I hope there will be a sequel.
B0055QYKQO|2.0|I purchased this motherboard expecting it to be fully compatible with AM3+ FX series processors. When installed an FX-8150 and powered up the system it would not POST, and the only way to get it to POST was to install an AM3 945 Phenom II from one of my other systems. With the Phenom II installed I was able to update to a newer BIOS and then after swapping the FX-8150 back in the system was able to POST and install an OS without issue. I would have given the motherboard 4 stars if the manufacturer had not falsely claimed full AM3+ compatibility.
B005ZUR724|1.0|stupid update I hate how GL tell anyone about it and then it doesn't work fix this now it really is making a whole lot of people mad
B0002MB7QW|5.0|This was a great entertainment movie. It was also humorous now that we know for a fact about all the lies about global warming. The emails, the hockey stick graph which was a hoax.<br /><br />I own the movie and enjoy watching it from time to time. Great fiction!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I think that this game is s little goofy!  and it gets.titeying in the end.  .but it is fun and enjoyable
0385528752|4.0|Yes it is good.  The hype is worth it.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting very much.  I am not usually a sucker for pop culture books, but this one is got my attention early.  Filled with compelling stories to illustrate their theory, Switch delivers.  The point of the book is the study of change, and how to make sweeping or simple changes in your own life or that of your business or organization.<br /><br />Obviously, In the world of education reform, there are many applications because the present public education system is built on established and traditional ways of thinking.<br /><br />The Switch theory is pretty straight forward.  Our brain has two battling components that determine how we act--our emotional brain and our rational brain.  The emotional brain (symbolized by The Elephant) wants to do what it wants to do.  It is known for energy, power and passion.  Good stuff if you get it moving in the right direction.  The rational brain (symbolized by The Rider) makes logical decisions based upon the data provided, but is often paralyzed by over analyzing things.  Sometimes---many times---the Rider can't get the Elephant to go in the right direction (that's why you stay up messing around on Facebook for three hours when you should be doing your homework).  The direction is known as The Path.  And there you have it.<br /><br />The book builds on this metaphor for change with compelling story after compelling story to illustrate the point.  The key to transformation change is a combination of appealing to the reasonable of The Rider, motivating The Elephant, and shaping The Path to make it easier to travel.  The rest is gravy (and easy to read, hard to put down).  Highly recommend.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Like all legos, they are durable and made great. Bought these for my sons third grade class to play with at recess. they love them.
B006GRBK4G|5.0|Great film. . . most recent in the available MotoGP documentaries.  Good footage and behind the scenes.  If you buy this, I recommend two additional purchases and watching \\"Faster\\", then \\"The Doctor, the Tornado, and the Ketucky Kid\\", and end your marathon with Fastest.  As a Simoncelli fan devastated by his death in October 2011. . .this was a great film.  It was early in his MotoGP career, so he is not in the film as much as I would have liked, but enough it brought a smile to my face and a tear to my eye for a fan who misses him!
B002LMV7TS|5.0|The blu ray is exactly what I thought it was, although I didn't use it this did come with a digital download thru amazon which I thought was pretty neat.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Great price for a Blu Ray of F.G.  Great Picture and sound quality.  Would recommend to friends. Thanks for always being thier Amazon.
0545265355|5.0|The books were great and they were in perfect condition. I read them in max 3 weeks and that was not reading every day. Actual Reading days they took me about a week.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Just loved this movie on theaters and I had to own it. I hope that they make a second part pretty soon!
B006ISJQBM|5.0|This movie is good. I've read the book several times, and yes, there were changes made, but I still loved it. When transferring book to film, changes are always made. It's the awful truth, I know. People want to compare this film to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Guess what? It's not. AND, it's not supposed to be. I'm a Thompson fan, through and through. I've read his work for years. I think the characters were spot on. This movie isn't for people who just want to see Johnny Depp on screen, or those who want another film in the likes of Vegas. Ribisi was AMAZING to watch in this movie. I really loved it, can't wait to get my copy and add it to my collection.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I bought this book when I was in eighth grade. I am in eleventh now. I can't believe I put this book off until the movie came out!!! It was amazing, though short I finished it in about 4-5 hours, and I regret not reading it sooner. I almost started crying in the mall where I was waiting to leave. It is heartwarming, heartbreaking, and heart-wrenching. Joey's story is emotional and is wonderful from his point of view. I can't wait to see the movie, Joey the War Horse is a hero, no one can doubt that.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|this app skips 2-4 pages everytime i flip the page.  ive changed font but cant even go to a certain page  please fix this.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are fun, I wish you could just play all of then right away though. but it makes it pretty easy to get the others.
B00005Y7KX|3.0|This is an amazing video however when I recieved it and tried watching it. It skipped at two places.  The first part was when Quasimodo was singing about being the pope of fools and the secound was near the end of the song L'attaque de Notre Dame.  Upon examining the DVD I found two scratches.  I dont know if anyone else had this same issue but I was dissapointed.
B005HSL626|5.0|This free app works great on Kindle Fire and is enjoyable for kids and adults..Different challenges to unlock different blades and backgrounds
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This CD is probably one of the best Christmas albums ever produced.  Buble's skills and the composition of each song mesh to make a masterpiece.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I bought a couple of the singles a few years back, but just bought the whole CD, and it's great.  Earnestness at its best.  I just listened to it again, and though I'm a few years older, it still rocks.  This is probably the best - just ahead of \\"Appeal to Reason.\\"
0061743526|5.0|There's a reason this book is considered a classic.<br /><br />The author manages to capture the time period perfectly and I was extremely impressed that she did it was honestly, and held nothing back no matter how ugly it read.<br /><br />This one's a keeper!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I never feel compelled to write reviews for things, but after reading all the negative reviews for this case I feel compelled to. After perusing Amazon I purchased this case at Best Buy. It fits perfectly! Yes the elastic needs to be stretched but it was very easy to get in the case. Yes the cover doesn't close all the way, but I get the impression it will after a few days of breaking in. This case is more red than it appears online, but is just as pretty. A great purchase for your Kindle Fire and by far the prettiest case I have found yet.
B000001FNL|5.0|I know they would sell more copies with the upcoming SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER soundtrack and it's follow up SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN both of which I love.  However, MAIN COURSE may be the finest moment of what I call the 2nd phase of their brilliant career.  The had moved to the U.S. and began recording in Miami, Florida with legendary producer Arif Mardin.  He began to move them away from their previous soft rock & pop early career to a more R&B based sound that would soon lead to them topping the charts and releasing a string of albums and songs that would put them in the conversations about the greatest of all time.<br /><br />I have heard people dog their supposed \\"Disco\\" era as being something to be embarrassed about, during this time the wrote some of the most incredible songs the world has ever heard, sold out shows across the world and topped the charts in ways that no one had come close to doing before.  The \\"critics\\" always had a hard time trying to fit them into a particular category or box.  They were multifaceted and multitalented artists who took the music world by storm and more than once which is something you can't really say about most of their contemporaries.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing for this band to be ashamed of as a matter of fact, at one point in 1978, the Gibb brothers were responsible for writing and/or performing 9 of the songs in the Billboard Hot 100. In all, the Gibbs placed 13 singles onto the Hot 100 in 1978, with 12 making the Top 40.  They also had a string of 6 consecutive number 1 hits at one period from 1978 to 1979.<br /><br />Now to the proper review of this album, \\"Main Course\\" is the beginning of what would be called \\"Disco\\" by many in just a few short years.  It truly was what is termed \\"Blue Eyed Soul\\" from the area I grew up in and truly displayed fantastic songwriting, musicianship and singing.  Barry and Robin Gibb are the main songwriters with Maurice co-writing some of the songs and the melodies as well as playing multiple instruments.  The albums first 2 tracks, \\"Nights On Broadway\\" and \\" Jive Talkin\\" were two of the biggest hits of the era and played in clubs and discotech's around the world both then and now.<br /><br />The album also showcases the variety of their songwriting with ballads such as \\"Songbird\\" and \\"Baby As You Turn Away\\"; Soft Rock classics like \\"Fanny: Be Tender With My Love\\" and \\"Wind of Change\\" and even Country influenced songs \\"Country Lanes\\" and \\"Come On Over\\".  One of my personal favorites is \\"All This Making Love\\", I love the interplay between Barry and Robin's vocals and Alan Kendall's guitar on that song is gritty and fantastic.<br /><br />This is a complete album from beginning to end and was a main catalyst to opening up doors for Barry and Robin in particular to start writing for other artists in just about every genre known at that time.  This is truly an outstanding display of talent and musical knowledge and this album would solidify their move away from their Robert Stigwood influenced years and they would start taking more control over the direction of their careers.<br /><br />This album is one of the greatest examples of what made this band great and one of the most influential bands of all time.  And let's be clear, they were a band and not just a singing group who all played instruments, wrote and produced songs and sang with a passion that few have ever reached.  I read recently that at least 2,500 different artists had recorded their songs.  This is the truest testament to the greatness of this band and one of many examples of why they deserve all the praise they have received and in this reviewers opinion, are deserving of so very much more.multiple instruments.

B006C1DH92|5.0|Thank you Half brick Studios and Amazon for providing this for us. Its a great game with some nice new features added since the original Fruit Ninja.  Again thanks to Amazon... we all appreciate the free app of the day.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I bought this app and it was working great.  It is an awesome game but... they updated the game online without Amazon giving us an update so I can no longer log into it until there is an update.  I was VERY happy with the game but now very UNHAPPY there isn't an update and it won't work any more.
B000OMF3K6|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS STORY!  I READ THIS BOOK ONCE A YEAR AND STILL GET CHILLS, THRILLS AND EXCITEMENT FROM IT!!!  IN MY OPINION, BEST BOOK WRITTEN BY DEAN KOONTZ (I have read many of his books and liked most of them)!
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|This is an excellent movie, however, the manufacturers of the Blu Ray apparently don't give much effort to quality control.  The extras added to the Blu Ray expeience such as \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" have embeded so much information onto the dvd that it is impossible to get through the normal run of the movie itself.  The problem, and I have encountered this upon occasion with others, is that every 15 minutes or so of the movie, it \\"backtracks\\" and resets to the beginning of the scene just viewed.  To get through the movie either requires fast forwarding through what was just watched and hitting play to resume or simply don't watch the blu ray version at all and watch the standard back up dvd provided.  What a complete waste of time and money.  This was most frustrating when we opened the package on Christmas to view it with family and everyone was so frustrated that it was pointless to finish.  Where is the quality control, Amazon?  I suggest you notify your distributor and their supplier that this is unacceptable manufacturing practice.  It makes me want to do business elsewhere due to this frustration and the fact that I now have to return the item and throw the dice one more time to see if I can recieve another \\"brand new\\" HP Deathly Hallows - pt two or end up having the same \\"less than positive\\" experience again.
0783229526|4.0|Based on the book and article by the same name, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the movie has been described by the author Hunter S. Thompson as a \\"a vile epitaph for the Drug Culture of the Sixties.\\"<br />On the surface it may be classified as two individuals on a wild drug trip, but deeper I believe it does delve into the eroding of the American dream.  This venture into what became known as \\"Gonzo\\" journalism has masterfully been brought to life by actor Johnny Depp who not only transforms into Thompson but also adds his own colorful quirks to relieve this writers journey into the abyss.<br />Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, the affable attorney Oscar Acosta who provides the counter to Raul Duke's character and pushes the envelope to the extreme that event makes Hunter seem sane.<br />A mix of reality meets fiction, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a cult classic from an age that viewing from today's perception seems a whole lot simpler and saner than today's world.<br />Cameos by a few other well known stars like Carmen Diaz, Bill Murray, and Gary Busey to name a few,  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wildly wicked peek into the American psyche.  It reaffirms the old maxim that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Read all three in a row. Sad to see them end! Can't wait for the movie. Definitely recommend it with five stars.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this game is great. works well on a Samsung stratosphere . some of the elaborate claws to use can make the game lag a bit.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This app has four stars because (1) Good graphics (2) has good sound effects and music (3) has awesome and fun puzzles, and (4) Has fun things to do and cool things to figure out. But can someone tell me how to do the puzzle on the globe?! Please, that's the annoying thing! That's also why it doesn't have 5 stars, is because THERE ARE NO CHEAT SHEETS!!! I mean, really? You can't even have at least a HINT button? So can someone help?
0142403873|5.0|My sons favorite book now. A fun book with great illustrations and a fun story. He's 5 and enjoys reading this over & over. We even bought the DVD!  Would definitely recommend.

B005OCFGTO|4.0|If you are a fan of the movies, then this collection is an inexpensive fix for your Harry Potter addiction. It contains all 8 dvds in a simple combo pack. It has barebones special features and very little extras, but it was exactly what I wanted for an excellent price.
B0031Q0XCA|1.0|This movie was just boring and pointless. It seemed to just go on and on about basically nothing. It was a BIG dissapointment.
B005KMX866|4.0|Brian Setzer did it, so why not Chris Isaak? I'm a huge fan of Mr. Isaak, and I always got a Sun Records vibe from his music, so this CD makes perfect sense! Really diggin' the lesser-known tunes on this one. A fitting tribute fron CI!
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is great even if u r not bored. It's simple to use and fun to try and unlock things! Disco sword is fun!!! Lol!

193413712X|5.0|If you saw this book on the shelf, you might be tempted to pass it by. It's small, a short little paperback that looks like it might take only a few hours to read and forget. If you decided to grab it, you'd find that despite it's little size, this book is filled with worlds of imagery and language. It is a book that stretches time. Though it's dense and takes a little longer to read than you would expect based on its length, while you're reading it you feel almost as if time has stopped, as if you have been reading this book for an indeterminable period that could be minutes or days. This book is, to put it simply, something else.<br /><br />Tinkers can be a little disorienting. Told at least partially (and perhaps totally) from the perspective of George, a man hallucinating on his death bed, it jumps back and forth in time and space without much warning or explanation. Through these jumps the reader learns of George's childhood, of his father's life and childhood, and the ways in which they are different and the same. Often, it's hard for the reader to tell which character they're reading about at any given time, which I think is part of the point of the novel. Always enclosed in a Maine landscape that is described with ecstatic hallucinatory clarity and brilliance, the lives of fathers and sons, of families and generations, unfolds in a strange non-linear and sometimes circular narrative. The prose is lyrical. I hate the overuse of that word, but there really is no other way to describe the rhythm and sound of this writing. The descriptions are poetic in their beauty, and the meditations on time are at once direct, in that they are clearly talked about in the text, and subtle, in the way those meditations are mirrored and confirmed  in the structure of the novel itself. The quality of the writing and the high level of craft are self-evident. No matter how enjoyable you find the book, it is impossible to walk away from it not thinking that Paul Harding is a gifted writer.<br /><br />I have a history of being disappointed by prize-winners (see: Wolf Hall, A Visit from the Goon Squad, The Road, etc) but I honestly think that Tinkers deserved to win the Pulitzer. I am still shocked that this was Harding's first novel. It's a beautiful book. It's not always the most enjoyable read, in fact at times it's downright frustrating, but it is definitely an experience worth having.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars<br />Recommendations: It's confusing and jumps around a lot, but just stick with it. It's ok if you get the characters confused or don't know where you are. That's part of the point. Just enjoy the prose, and it will all make sense eventually.I have a history of being disappointed by prize-winners (see: Wolf Hall, A Visit from the Goon Squad, The Road, etc) but I honestly think that Tinkers deserved to win the Pulitzer.

B006C1DH92|4.0|It was a better version of the original Fruit Ninjas. I think it made it more exciting because it was Puss in Boots. When you play it you feel like you are in the movie.
B006C1DH92|5.0|awesome graphics! game runs very smooth on my samsung fascinate. it is the same exact thing as fruit ninja, but who doesnt love a little theming every now and then. well done.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|Being a vampire fanatic I was really looking forward to this movie.<br />I was so disappointed. It was just pathetic. The voice overs were pathetic and boring. It wasn't bloody at all or scary, it shouldn't be considered a horror movie. Sooo happy I didn't buy it, only borrowed.
B006C1DH92|4.0|Thank you for this free app today. very cute and graphics are beautiful! Love it.<br /><br />Puss in boots version of fruit ninja.<br /><br />Will update review once tested thoroughly
B005OCFGTO|4.0|This 8 film collection is great! I got this for my 13 year old daughter who loves the movies and has read all the books as well.  She was very excited to get this for Xmas. I paid only $39.99(DVD only) for it on a Cyber Monday special, so the price couldn't have been better. I knew that this was just a base 8 film collection with no extras when I purchased it. If you are just looking for the entire Harry Potter series with no extras, this is by far the best deal going. It arrived on time with absolutely no damage. Amazon is great and I thank you once again.[[ASIN:B005OCFHHK Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection [Blu-ray]]]
B005HSL626|5.0|This is awesome for a free game. I love how u get the full features on aneroid. On apple u have to pay for the full features. I completely recamed this game!!!
B00029D04M|1.0|I have found Revell  models to be inconsistent and this is no exception. In the past I had made a living as a model maker the, making prototypes for consumer products as well as the occasional kit model.  so I consider myself a quasi-technical expert. Although kit models  all  rarely perfect I expected more from Revell.   Cons-   Hiigher than except  Amount of flashing.  Some parts did not fit with acceptable tolerances.   Better part indexing was necessary on some pieces  some  parts should have  been molded in as opposed to a glue on part.   Pros-  A high level of detail on the parts.   A comprehensive assortment of decals.
B0035G9ABG|3.0|I've loved Gorillaz for over 10 years. Loved their previous albums. This album disappointed me. They collaborated with other artists way too much it didn't have the Gorillaz \\"vibe\\" like they used to have. Getting \\"The Fall\\" soon, I hope that doesn't disappoint me..
B006C1DH92|2.0|Was able to download app  and then install. I made it too the title screen then it forces close automatically.
0446585025|3.0|I started reading this book over Christmas holidays, and by the time I was 3/4 of the way through the book, 'fluff' came to mind. Ellen does a lot of reversing and, like listening to a person who talks this way, reading it is twice as irritating. To me, many of her 'imagination' setups were absurd. Not what I was expecting from someone who does so well as a talk show host. I have not read either of her previous books. I am puzzled by those who call this her best book yet. I wish I had gotten this book from the library instead of paying for it. For me, it was a disappointment.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|A long time ago, in an ear canal not far away, you could only hear mono, then stereo, then surround sound, and now The Ear Force, defeating the deaf star! Fantastic product, highly reccommended. My son loves it, after all, I am his father!  May the Ear Force be with you!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I bought this case for my girlfriend's brother for Christmas. He is absolutely loving it. As soon as he opened it and put it on I looked at it and was immediately impressed with how light it was. The case also seemed to have a nice and snug fit and I would feel very comfortable setting it into a backpack to take on a trip without being concerned for damage to the device. The only thing I think that could be improved is the the propping system. It is a little on the sketchy side to me however I was not able to truly test that aspect of the case to be certain. I hope this helps your decision process!
B000000WCV|3.0|The perfectionistic electronica-wiz duo Daft Punk have only released a handful of albums, growing in strength. Homework is a funk-driven record with little actual emphasis on catchy melodies - though it's got those, too.<br /><br />The catchy and groovy \\"Da Funk\\", the soothing \\"Fresh\\" and the exhilirating \\"Around the World\\" are all solid and enjoyable listens. Overall, though, the album rarely entices me to listen to it as a whole. It's got more to do, on the whole, with experimental German techno than melody-driven techno-disco or however you can classify Daft Punk's later work. \\"Alive\\" and \\"Rock'n'Roll\\" both seem like they take an eternity to pass - incidentally, neither has much of a melody to work with.<br /><br />Homework's primary function seems to be that of a club record, in which capacity it's a good enough release. It doesn't have the melodious fulfillment of Discovery and especially the excellent Human After All. Daft Punk have certainly crafted stronger music than this.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that tugs at your heartstrings! I have not read the book, but my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Thought provoking, funny, and will hopefully make people stop and think about the way they treat others. Loved it!
B005LJITS0|3.0|EDIT - Amazon would not let me post a review of the EXTENDED Blu Ray version of the film because I had posted this review. I hated my initial foray into this film. I decided to give the EXTENDED cut a spin as I had heard it was a better experience - it was. Not a perfect film but better. The Sinestro yellow ring sequal set-up subplot is pointless but I guess they were swinging for the franchise fences. ALl in all decent 2 and a half stars for the EXTENDED cut. My original review of the theatrical cut follows (I still feel that CGI is abused but in the extended cut it feels reduced as it is rounded out by actual acting and actual people):<br /><br />Couldn't finish watching this CGI craptactular. I wanted to like this, like the comic, like sci-fi, this just didn't work. ..and the special effects, not good at all, maybe they were better in 3D but at home, terrible.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I am so frustrated with companies that have terrible nonexistent customer service.  I feel like I wasted my money and and my time.  I've lost trust in anything produced by Gameloft and Amazon is not helping here either.  Don't sell people things that don't work!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I enjoyed the complete series so much that I am now watching it again.  My next purchase will be the \\"Movie\\" 1 & 2.  I would recommend this to  mature adults, as there is a lot of nudity.  I buy all of my DVD, ITunes and products from Amazon, and haven't had any problems.  I recommend Amazon.Com.
B002VECM72|5.0|I am not a huge football fan, and I loved this movie.  Great acting and a very heartwarming and entertaining story.  Saw it with a friend and liked it so much I had to have it.  That is saying a lot since I have not purchased a movie in the last 6 months.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is my first Stephen King book.  I don't care for horror and gore, so I've never considered his books as something I would read.  But the subject of this one grabbed my attention.  When the Kindle price dropped, I got it.  This book is by far in the top 2 of books I've read in my life and I'm 57! Stephen King is brilliant.  I was drawn in from the first page.  This book has it all.  If you're in my age group, it reminds you of things long forgotten. There's history, mystery, Sci-Fi, and romance with each element having the power to trip over the others. Don't think you'll know how it turns out because you won't.  The end was quite literally in the last sentence.  somewhere in the middle of the book, my mind was exhausted, so I stopped to read something mindless, then went back to it.  When I finished it, I didn't start another book for days.  It haunted me and haunts me still.  You will ask yourself, \\"what if I had done something else?  where would my life be today?\\"  When a book has the power to entertain, think, question, and linger after the last word is read, you've got yourself a book!
B006C1DH92|5.0|Fruit Ninja no longer feels like a game with Atari graphics.  And how wonderful that Amazon is offering the better version for free as a free app of the day?  Amazon has been on a roll the last few days.  Love it.
B002GMNLKQ|5.0|I was blown away by these guys. I've listened to a lot of metal, and I have to say that I'm highly impressed with the talent of this band. When I play this CD I actually get to enjoy playing it all the way through, not just skipping tracks to the ones I like, because I like all the songs. I think if Mozart and Beethoven and all the important composers were alive today, composing METAL music....they'd be writing stuff like this. This music is genius. I will be buying the rest of Insomnium's music as soon as I can.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I was looking for a good functional and durable knife that was within a reasonable price range. I had done some research and found that the Becker knife was recommended by a lot of people. So I ordered it and have been very pleased. The knife if balanced nicely, has a nice comfortable grip and an overall solid construction. It does not have a bulky feel. It is a very good no nonsense knife that you can keep by your side on camping trips, while hiking or for general use in any outdoor situation. You won't be killing any bears with it, but for a nice solid general use knife, the Becker is definitely the way to go!
1419701533|5.0|I have to say its super easy and awesome. Me being akindle fire kinda girl I say this is the best ver.!! I can just go on my kinlde and oder what ever I want its that easy!!! xD
B005R32L66|2.0|Installed on Android 2.1 but exited with an error on sign-in (we use Skype on other devices without a problem). For this reason we uninstalled it.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I first read before I fall. And I like how the author wrote. In the kindle version of this book which I read, was awesome. I loved the story, and of couse cried like an idiot when I finished it. I would not read the second book because I feel like Lena Did not connect enough with the reader.(unlike, Katness in the hunger games)In my kindle version There were two pages missing. Over all I would recommend this book for someone who likes action, and non heavy romance. I read it in less than a day so obviously its good.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I like this item.  My son came home from Phoenix and showed me the case he had bought for his kindle.  His was a very heavy case.  I like the one I purchased as it is very lightweight and protects my kindle fire much better than his.  I am very happy with this item.
0316010669|3.0|Gladwell has a lot of great points but for me they get lost in long drawn out stories.  The stories themselves are good, but if you goal is to get to the meaty part then you have to wade through pages of stories to get to what is often a one sentence point.  A cliff notes version of this book would be recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really love this book bought it on my fire and I couldn't put it down. It's a great story and an easy read.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|there are lots of levels to play in this game. you can pick it up for a quick game or really sit down for a long engaging time.  some of the best graphics ever
B005ZUR724|2.0|awesome game but then started asking for a update that isn't there if any one knows how to fix this write a review on how please
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This to me is the best Bible app available. It is easy to use with all of its features. Being able to use the different translations depending on who is giving the sermon makes it easy to follow along and add bookmarks as needed. I love being able to look at my notes from past sermons and share them with those who need a good word.
B000002HMH|1.0|As a kid, Metallica meant something to me. Their unrelenting power and honesty made me feel I wasn't alone - that there was a voice of reason in a world full shxx and pretense. Like a modern-day black sabbath, they spoke from the heart and never backed down from what they believed. Ride the lightning, disposable heroes, and justice for all, fade to black, one, master of puppets, sanitarium and more. These songs expressed what so many of us felt but were afraid to express so clearly as they did. James Hetfield, like Geezer Butler from sabbath, wrote about the injustices and hypocrisy of politics and war and everything else that was a lie. Not to mention they were musical geniuses. Everything was constructed with perfect heaviness and lightness - tension/release, that helped you express these feelings - the ultimate catharsis. The Black album was pretty good, but not the same - a beginning of a uneasy change into mainstream, but still heavy and powerful. Load? Lmao. Load is pathetic. The lyrics are meaningless cliches. The song structures predictable and boring. But worst of all - there was no driving passion anymore. Fat rockstars with hairnets and painted nails. It would've been funny if it was any other band- but from Metallica it was heartbreaking. Now 15 years later, I'm no longer heartbroken, I'm just coming to terms with the fact that people don't take music as seriously as I do. Oh well. I read all these positive reviews and think: \\"ok, these people like pop music. That's cool.\\" but this is terrible pop music! I crack up at these reviews saying \\"if it wasn't Metallica it would be a great album!\\" no if it wasn't Metallica, it would still be derivative crap. Writing this review is healing because when this album came out I felt so disillusioned - my heroes had sold out. They had sold their souls. Hey no one stays angry forever, you say. Listen to a geezer butler solo album. He's over 60 and he's still fighting the fight. He's still telling the politicians to gofxxx themselves. As for me, I'm not so angry at the world anymore or at Metallica, just disappointed. Cause even if they sold their souls for pop, it didn't have to be derivative pop. It could have at least been creative. :)
B005LJITS0|1.0|Ryan Reynolds' performance is terrible and the story has more holes than Swiss cheese. If you're over the age of 15 don't waste your time. This is the worst superhero movie I have ever watched. The first hulk movie with eric bana is better than this.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I love the series, but I can't believe these books are 8.99 when most of the Kindle ebooks I buy are between 4 and 6 bucks.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I loved this movie series and so my husband bought me this for Christmas to go with my kindle fire. I love this just as much! I will read these and reread them for sure. Great trilogy!
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|I tried to use with my iphone 4 and my Ipad2 to the tv, there's only audio coming out of the tv, no video. I'm very disappointed.  I think that Apple must improve their quality control.
B0046VRR5A|4.0|Almost every performance in ths box set is great - a couple disks I have not heard and a couple I have but will let pass further comment.  The price is terrific, less than 2 dollars a disk via the cheapest seller listed on Amazon.    But I have almost all these performances in the mastering offered here or in better remasterings.  What I really want is the SACD versions (out there and some want insane prices) or the new DSD remasterings/reissue which Sony could have put together and delighted us.  But alas this is not the DSD set and let alone a SACD set.  For the DSDs many of these have been issued in DSD sound or are being issued in DSD - and yes it is usually much better.  Bernstein's Beethoven 5 is top notch thrilling.  Still if you want a great classical music intro set -and many do- in good sound (RCA was the champ in the 50s) this is a fantastic buy.  One star off for Sony not giving us their best.  (Sony bought RCA - another great American company destroyed by mismanagement and Wall Street.)

B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game excpecially when u are bored. me and my little sister are addictied to this app!(: which is why I give it 4 starss.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it! So many different reading plans to choose from to guide your reading. Love the option to make notes and share them with other users. Also love the ability to share readings on social sites. Only wishi could attach the reading plan intros to my notes.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|It arrived promptly.  I have not seen it, so do not know if it was good or of good quality.  It was a Christmas Gift for out of state.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is both funny and sad, i cried and laughed many times. It talks about drugs, alcohol, sex, love, friendship, beauty, suicide, rape, homosexuality, media, and many other things. The story is told by Charlie, as he writes anonymous letters to an unknown person. Charlie is a Wallflower, a teenager in high school who doesn't talk much, but listens to everything, and things a little too much. This should be required to be read by everyone in high school, really, its simply amazing. It will make you think about life like no other book.
B005F3XV7Q|3.0|The movie was just ok.  It really wasn't that funny.  Like a typical Kevin James film it has a lot of physical humor but the humor is typically low brow.  The underlying story line is a love story and unfortunately even that has very few surprises.  It is suitable for a first date movie but won't hold a kid's attention.
0439023521|3.0|OK, can't we predict from the start who is going to win? I suppose the real element of suspense is how to resolve the problem of which of two likable characters is going to survive until the end and how will the boy-girl relationship work out. Then, ***spoiler alert**** there is a rule change. That felt contrived. I just shook my head, but kept reading. I thought the central plot was too similar to \\"Battle Royale.\\" I wonder if Collins read that book or saw the movie version. I used to teach elementary school and would read to my kids. This is not one I would choose for that, considering I was teaching 4th grade when I retired. I know it is recommended for grades 7 and up. Will I read the sequels? Perhaps. The cliffhanger about our two characters' feelings for each other felt contrived (there's that word again) and designed to sell the next book in the series.
B000LB7G00|2.0|This is a really great product which i would have loved to use, but it didn't seem to work very well on my mac.  In SketchUp it seemed to have flaky performance, and i couldn't for the life of me figure out how to change any settings for it.  In blender it just didn't work at all.  High quality hardware, low quality support.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I was cery satisfied with the order. It was received in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I was very satisfied and happy with my purchase and would defiantely recommend it to others.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I received this sleeve as a Christmas gift for my Amazon Kindle Fire, I can notice an off smell if I stick my face directly in the sleeve and it smells like any other manufactured synthetic product (new car smell anyone?)  The smell doesn't transfer to my Kindle, and it certainly isn't detectible in a room.  The sleeve is sturdy and very well made and fits the Kindle Fire PERFECTLY, not to snug, not too loose.  I simply can't understand the ill will towards this item, it provides an impressive amount of protection without being overly bulky.  I love it.
1931955085|4.0|Great collection of Ryden pieces; beautiful photos of his work and nice large format.  Great for referencing and studying (as an artist myself), as well as a gorgeous coffee table book for casual viewing.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!
B000YJ54DU|1.0|So awful and full of extraneous words so that finding the action line is difficult. Book 11 was so awesome and good that this was a horrible let down. I have 13 is good again. You can skip this book and not miss anything.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|It came to my house faster than I expected.  The box was perfect and the packing was great. I love Amazon.
0440246016|3.0|The plot itself was not so bad.  It had a logical flow to it, the story had a good amount of tension, and there were no plot holes.  My biggest issue is that I couldn't get into the Jack Reacher character.  He just doesn't make much sense to me.  How could he go from leaving a highly organized life as a military police officer who led his own squad to some drifter with no home, no job, no money.  It's just not a logical progression, and he's not a believable character.  He comes off as a bit of a loser.  As a result, it was hard to get fully absorbed into the novel.  But the story had a strong climax with a good action sequence, so overall I give it a thumbs up.<br />Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game!!!!! I would tell everyone about it and how I play this on mykindle iphone even my computer at work. very easy to use.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|The dvd hellboy that I bought was brand new. Very good working condition. My son liked it. Reviewed quite well in our house.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I got this cover when I got my K.F.....What can i say... I love it ....it looks great ,it is nice and slim and feels good in my hands.
B003ZTQN1I|4.0|Enjoyed this CD much better than the movie.  I am still listening to it and replay more than half the songs over and over.  Heart felt songs and themes.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|This is similar to the game on all other platforms (PC,Ipod/iPad, android) and is just as fun. it is nice that you just have to click on customers to get them moving. Some customers are may be too close to each other, making it harder to click on them sometimes and delivering coffee through clicking on coffee and then customers take some practice. Love it overall though.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|It is the 1870s, and living beneath the Paris opera house is a mad, disfigured, musical genius known as the Phantom (Gerard Butler).  Using often violent methods, he advances the career of Christine, a young, orphaned chorus girl(Emmy Rossum). Christine is grateful to her mysterious mentor, but the Phantom wants more than her gratitude.<br /><br />I love the magnificent musical score and opulent sets and wardrobe; the film is a visual masterpiece.  The story is, at turns, passionate, dangerous, and tender, and is well-directed. At age 16, Rossum is sweet and innocent and gives a good performance as the conflicted Christine, but I felt the other two leads are miscast.  For me, Butler's lisp and overbite are too prominent and distracting (since the rest of his face is covered) and he lacks the confidence and charisma needed to pull off the role. Also, his eventual unmasking reveals nothing worthy of horror.  As Christine's childhood sweetheart, Patrick Wilson  has a American accent that makes it impossible to believe he's a French nobleman and I didn't find him appealing at all.<br /><br />Fans of the show may overlook these quibbles, however, as the production is first-rate in every other way.  Minnie Driver's performance as the  diva is one of the highlights.  If you're looking for lavish production values and a beautiful musical score, you'll enjoy this \\"Phantom.\\"<br /><br />PS:  The Extras (the history of the musical, the filming of the movie, and a crew singalong) deserve 5 stars!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evernote rocks! best way to keep all your notes. syncs between desktop and mobile devices. never leave home without it.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Much more fun with bonus life and magic beans. My Galaxy Tab has no problem registering simultaneous swipes when I try to slice screens of fruit with multiple fingers using both hands. Really cool! My grand kids like the original but are going to love this one.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this.  I received this for Christmas from my brother.  Thank You! I listed to most of the first side and I look forward to listening to the rest of the CD.  There are not many songs here that I donnnn't know.  I have the other greatest hits cds he did and I still wanted this one because it was a double disc.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|I hate it its so retarded I don't even understand it if I were you or anyone else it would NEVER get it! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Just what you hope it is,  better.  You will enjoy blending your own symphony of sound and tailoring them to your liking.  I use this all time now.  Worth more than I paid.  I encourage the people who worked on it to continue to to improve on this wonderful app.  5 STARS, JUST BUY IT!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I bought this game for my little brother for Christmas this year. Me and my Fiance' are very into zombies and the zombie apocolypse so of coarse he is too. The packaging of the game was good and looked nice the game design itself is sturdy and looks nice and the game play is actually very fun!!! we played 10 rounds last night and had a blast! I would recommend purchasing this product if you or the person your buying it for likes zombies! Little brother was very happy and said its like Farkle for zombie lovers!
B006C1DH92|5.0|this game is so much fun and the new challenges are way better than the original fruit ninja. graphics, sound effects, and new blades are all awesome.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|This was a great movie , fantastic sound, can't beat the action. I have this movie in my laser disc colection, it was a mut have in blue ray.
B005ZUR724|1.0|just downloaded this app, installed it, whatever. everytime i go to join a world e.g. Arcadian.forest it says i don't have the newest version, and there is no 'new version' in the app market seeing as how i JUST downloaded it
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I love games just like this. I have a kindle fire and it can be sort of hard to choose an item that you have found but it is still a good game to play.
B006C1DH92|4.0|Fruit Ninja is always an awesome game. This version seems a lot easier though, I quickly beat my high score from the original. Desperado mode is a nice addition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! I am truely a hunger games addict. ;) I can't seem to stop singing \\"The hanging tree.\\" Also audible does the book good.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|boy those birds are angry really cute fun game, howeve.r the ads in the corner are so small that they really do not bother me great free game
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game was aesthetically pleasing and wonderfully put together. The music was eloquent and the game play was not too complicated, but at the same time not too simplistic. It is completely the price.
B0014JKJK2|3.0|Have to put in a liner to make it comfortable for walking.Nice to have it without the holes for wet grass.
B000001F27|4.0|Although I will always prefer Rainbow's 70's albums featuring Ronnie James Dio on vocals, Rainbow's 80's work with Joe Lynn Turner provides that unique classic early 80's rock sound that has never duplicated since. Turner's vocals are excellent and Blackmore proves one can make sucessful a transition from hard rock to commercial rock. I was only about 1o when this album came out, but style and sound feels even better once you rediscover it and many years.  And for those too young to know the sound, try it out, there is nothing else like it. Out of the three 80's Rainbow, I rank Difficult to Cure\\" number two, a very very close second to \\"Straight Through the Eyes\\" and just ahead of \\"Bent out of Shape\\".
B006LS7DQE|4.0|This is a pretty solid port of puzzle quest 2. The game has little pauses all of the time, but runs pretty smoothly. Not sure if they will release an update that would fix this problem, but that would be nice.  the 3 dollar price tag is just right. its the cheapest way to play this game.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Yes yes- I am late with he reading and reviewing...but I had to say something because the HBO series made me want to read this book and it was so fantastic I read all of the series back to back.<br /><br />Entertaining, fast paced, completely engrossing!!  Unexpected twists and turns and I hope to God Martin finishes the series!
B002KVCA1O|5.0|This is just enough Rolling Stones I need to Rock!!  This has all my 1 hits that I grew up with. Well worth it!!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It was very helpful and easy to use. It has become my favorite app to date. I will be using it for a long time to come.
B0029LB2V4|5.0|Everything about this show is good! Worth all the time. Great performance from all the characters! And the story telling is fantastic.
B000K7UG34|5.0|I had seen the movie on tv but at the time didn't realize that I was related to Col. Moore (even though my maiden name was Moore).  We own a blu-ray player so I though I would order a copy.  Big difference in the quality.  The movie is more about him and his personality and the scenes where soldiers are shot are not extremely graphic, which is a plus for some of us female viewers.  Having Sam Elliott in the movie is another plus.
B005Y423ZC|3.0|Adele was incredible. Her performance shined from the heart. However, I was strongly disappointed by the editing on this DVD. The edititor must have ADD. The camera men kept switching the angle every few seconds. When Adele was singing a memorable part, the camera was focusing on people standing in the audience or some non exciting scene. I was getting dizzy from the switching of the cameras. I still would have bought this DVD, but come on, I bought it to watch Adele not some fat women waving their arms in the audience. All said, Adele rocks!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|If you liked Goonies as a kid, you will love this movie. It's kinda like the Goonies meets ET. The best of both worlds. Definite buy!!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|My 15 month old grandson could not wait to play with this toy after he unwrapped it! The blocks are perfect sizes for his hands, and he is able to put together and take apart the pieces easily. He had a lot of fun throwing the pieces back into the box when he was finished playing, too. Legos are just great toys.
1466401885|5.0|I loved this book. Once you start reading you will never be able to put it down. The way she describes everything happening you will be able to create a picture in your mind.
1400069181|3.0|As a fan of Toms Shoes, I was inspired by a contest Toms ran called \\"Books for Bloggers.\\" Toms selected bloggers and gave away two copies of Blake Mycoskie's new book, \\"Start Something That Matters.\\" Bloggers were asked to read the book and keep one copy for themselves and give the other copy away on their blog, Facebook or Twitter. I received the books just before my annual vacation and instead of carrying around a heavy hard-back book, I decided to download a copy I paid for onto my iPad.     I read the book while in Fiji. Fiji is a country of extremes. Extreme poverty - where the average wage is $2.50/hour (US) and a liter of gas was $2.83 (on 12/24/11). I drive a Honda Accord and usually put about 15 gallons in my tank to fill it up. 15 gallons equals just about 55 liters. So a full tank of Gas in Fiji would cost about $155 US dollars! The average worker would make about $100 a week. As you can imagine, most people don't drive. The other extreme is the tourism industry which built a man-made island to accommodate half a dozen four and five star resorts where people can spend in one day what some Fijians will make in one month.     Blake Mycoskie's journey starts in Argentina where he is inspired by the poverty and people in need. The book focuses on how he developed the idea, how he started the company and the obstacles he faced along the way. Inspirational quotes and stories are scattered throughout the book. Much of the book focuses on Blake's mentors - the founders of companies and organizations like Zappos, charity: water, The FEED Project, and Method.     Blake says this book is for you if:   - You're ready to make a difference in the world - through your own business, a nonprofit organization, or a new project.     I was left inspired and would love to start something, but I was left wondering what to do. Blake provides questions at the start of the book to help you find your passion - but I haven't figured out how to make my passion into a project, company or nonprofit yet.     - You want to love your work, work for what you love, and have a positive impact on the world - all at the same time.    I have a good job, one that affords me the ability to travel to places like Fiji and Thailand and Australia - however, I can't say I \\"love\\" it. Blake provides great ideas and stories about how to make a workplace great - perhaps I should give a copy of the book to our CEO because I can't make that type of change occur. I would have loved to read about how to create that type of change when you're not the leader.     - You're curious about how someone who never made a pair of shoes, attended fashion school, or worked in retail created one of the fastest-growing footwear companies in the world by giving away shoes.     I did find it interesting to hear Blake's story and learn how Toms became what it is today. It was inspirational to hear about the risks Blake took, the humble beginnings of the company and how they're keeping their mission and values intact as the company grows. It did make me wonder if I could make one of my dreams a reality - but at the end of the day, I was left asking more questions rather than jumping into action.     Blake talks about social media and how important it is. He talks about Toms uses social media and how other companies use social media to communicate their messages. After finishing the book, I had a question. So I decided to reach out to Toms & Blake on Twitter. I tweeted 5 times and got no response. I then decided to email Toms and Start Something That Matters and again, got no response. I mention this for two reasons. First, it left me feeling like Blake and his company isn't practicing what they're preaching. I interact with companies like Starwood Hotels and American Airlines on Twitter who respond quickly - occasionally within the hour - so it can be done. Second, as part of the Books For Bloggers program, I was told that for every copy of Start Something That Matters which is sold, achild's book will be donated to a child in need. My question for Blake is: do you donate a book to child for a copy of Start Something That Matters downloaded from Amazon or iTunes? To this day, I still can't get an answer to that question from Toms, StartSomethingThatMatters.com or Blake on Twitter.     I was inspired by the book, but I wasn't fulfilled by the book. I was left wondering and asking myself a lot of questions - which is good, but I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the book so I could turn those questions into actions.     I go back to Fiji and the disparity between the worlds I saw and wonder; how I can I make a difference. What can I do that will really matter. Maybe before I return home at the end of January I'll have figured out the answers to those questions.     The book was interesting, and worth the read - especially since a child in need will receive a book for every copy purchased (though I'm still not sure if that means only hard copies or includes downloaded copies as well.) I would recommend you read this book if you're a fan of Toms, you're into charity and giving back or just want to be inspired by some great stories.     I will be giving away two copies of Start Something That Matters (both copies given to me since I've got one on my iPad now). To find out how to win a copy, follow me on Twitter @VeryGoodPoints or on Facebook [...]. Contest will start on Jan 2nd 2012.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. That's not to say that it's necessarily Oscar-worthy; it's just that it is so rare these days to see a good premise be so flawlessly executed. The writing is clever, slowly building tension then delivering jokes (or fatalities) before building tension again.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with horror movies, especially of the \\"a group of kids go into the woods...\\" variety, will see references to classic elements from favorite films - the haunted-looking cabin in the woods, the use of certain power and hand tools, creepy townsfolk, etc. But the director does a great job of helping the audience to see both the frightening and the ordinary in each of those scenarios. Is the cabin creepy, or just a DIY project away from a great vacation home? Is the local yokel whose laugh makes your skin crawl actually dangerous, or just nervous around pretty girls?  and so on.<br /><br />Likable lead roles and appropriately two-dimensional secondary characters are ably portrayed by the cast, although the rapport between Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) is truly exceptional and a key reason why the movie works so well. I giggled through most of the movie, well, when I wasn't gagging over some of the worst bloodshed, and was delighted by the way the movie both followed established horror \\"rules\\" and also turned the worst cliches on their ears. This is a great movie - something I'd consider to be (at last!) a worthy American response to Shaun of the Dead.
B0000E1WKE|3.0|I am a big fan of Whitney Houston as a singer, so I had high hopes for this Christmas CD.  I was so excited to receive it!  When I did - I listened to all of the songs...it wasn't the same ol' Whitney from her younger years who could sing the ABC's and make that sound wonderful.  She has a song in there in which she is singing with her daughter which is sweet.  But overall, I was a bit disappointed.  The Christmas songs on this CD are traditional so that's nice to listen to.  But Whitney is not the Powerhouse singer that she once used to be.  If you enjoy listening to Christmas music, then it is a good buy, but if you're expecting to hear that amazing voice of hers...it's not on this CD.
1451648537|5.0|This book is an excellently written work. It tells Jobs' story in riveting style with superb details. This product is exactly what is advertized - a compelling, fascinating biography.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this.  Great version of solit&agrave;ire. Highly recommended! Layout is good. Great options.  Like the undo button.  Again would recommend this version.
B00683JK9K|5.0|This is the best puzzle app! Grab each piece from the right side of the &quot;tabletop&quot; and drag it onto the work area.  Gorgeous photos - 20 in all. Pieces snap into place without a lot of wiggling. Very enjoyable puzzling app.
B005ZUR724|1.0|It appears that the publisher no longer plans to support this game, but instead of removing it from the store they decided to drop it to 99&cent; to make a quick cash grab.
B006C1DH92|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a great game it's just when I opened it for the first time there were no zen or arcade modes. I think they were trying to make up for it with bandito mode. It worked well but not good enough to replace those modes. A future update suggestion please include arcade and zen mode in some form.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I have a google account,kindle fire and a blackberry. this app syncs them all! looks great on the kindle. worth the $ to keep me organized.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are cool, but some are hard to beat, like the bouncer game. I say 4 stars out of 5.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Bought Plants vs Zombies and downloaded it on son's Creative ZiiO. The app is on the tablet but when icon is pressed an hour glass comes up for about 30 seconds and then the screen goes back to the home screen. It basically will not open even if we are on Wi fi connection. Although I would think you use the Wi fi to only get it downloaded.  Who can I contact to help me with this or get my money back if it is not compatible with the Ziio?  Thanks
B006O5XYWG|1.0|This movie is overrated.  Please don't waste your time if you have seen any movies in the past 5 years.  Really boring, way too much of a predictable story from start to finish. Movie actually starts to get interesting when there are 10 minutes left.  Horrible acting, almost like a bad version of incredible Hulk and any zombie movie, resident evil or 28 days. Really disappointed that I didn't read any of the negative reviews before watching this movie. I actually thought this movie was going to be good...
B004LUS390|5.0|I love this app it rox! I can do so much. its great for all ages! bat sometimes it does not draw.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Dl'd to my Kindle Fire &amp; I am loving it! So smooth, no lag, plenty of levels, and even though the challenges get really tough, you can't walk away from it! We need more games like this.  Better than Angry Birds in my opinion!
B006C1DH92|5.0|Downloading now, if it's anything like how the Xbox game play is it'll be fun.  Oh and first! Probably a failed first lol.
0062101897|5.0|This book is perfect for any Harry Potter fan. I would recemend it to any fan of the series. It is the best.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have downloaded Angry Birds to my Kindle Fire. It is fantastic on the Fire because the screen is much larger than what I'm used to playing the game on, an Android smartphone.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|The Perplexus Epic has already captured the undivided attention of a group of 25 year olds at my house for hours. They take turns seeing who can get the farthest in this fascinating puzzle toy before passing it to the next person to try. We have lots of challenging puzzles but this one tops them all.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I love it...its fun and simple rules.&quot;A round of milk for everyone...&quot;.<br /><br />Reason is I have never played FN but if its anything like this well another 5 stars then.<br />O_o  &quot;Yup&quot;
0312576463|3.0|In the last 50 pages, Franzen managed to show that the angst of the first 500 pages was necessary so that the characters could not only find themselves but also find love and happiness as a family.  This was by no means an easy read.  A good editor could have eliminated at least 200 pages.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Very strange that some Vibrant owners have reported problems, as I've had none.  I'm running Ice Cream Sandwich.  I wonder if that may have something to do with it.  Nice app.
0446547603|5.0|I was totally delighted with my purchase of Safe Haven by Nicholas Sparks.  In true Sparks manner it leaves you just wanting more of his fine writing.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Seen this on-line and the price was right..saw the same thing  at Best Buy for $30.00 more !! Well worth the money
B005OLF6BI|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it.  We went to see Taylor in concert this Fall in Atlanta. It was a great concert and this dvd captures that for her.  Just like being at the concert.
B002SJKWZ4|1.0|Very difficult to use, hard to program.  Made of plastic.  Doesn't light up, make any sounds, etc.  Totally not worth the price.  Bought it for an elderly family member who watches a lot of TV; thought it would be fun for him.  But, it's so hard to use, it was too frustrating.  Very disappointing. Maybe if you have excellent fine motor skills and have A LOT of time to practice with it, it would be okay; but, really, who among us has that much time to learn how to use a remote control -- as cute as the concept is, bottom line, it's a remote control -- that's it -- and it's very difficult to use.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote stores my life's stuff. It's a great tool for organizing myself, too; my projects, at home and at work. You need it, too!
B004LWZW42|2.0|I've been an XMan fan for years.  When they made the first 3 in the series, I didn't mind the changes to the original story because they were close and had the spirit of the original.  I enjoyed all 3 of the original movies, so I was eager to see this one.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I disliked that they changed the original Marvel universe (Sebastian Shaw was a Nazi who killed Magneto's parents ???  Emma Frost is Xavier and Magneto's age?  Beast is part of this first class but Iceman, Cyclops and Marvel Girl are not?).  But worse than being frustrated that they strayed so far from the story we all know, the movie was just plain boring.  They lost me during the 2nd half of the movie.   I would not recommend this movie.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Enjoyed playing the original Fruit Ninja on Android phone. This version is just as great. Looks really good on Kindle Fire too.
B005HSL626|5.0|Very fun!! A perfect and entertaining addition to your Kindle Fire! FYI: Besides for a couple ads, there is no difference between the paid one and this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't read a whole lot of fiction, but thanks to my girlfriend giving me a Kindle Fire for my birthday, I'm back at it.  This book has me hooked on the series and wanting to read more in general.    I first heard about the book from a friend that is an extra in the film and after receiving my Fire, I looked for this.  There it was, and better yet, free to check out with my Amazon Prime membership!!  To tell the truth, I enjoyed the book so much, I feel guilty not paying for it!  If you know a little bit about the story plot, this book will have you drawn in from the start.  Couldn't put it down and read the whole thing in about 3 days...which for me, is a big deal.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Quick to download and super easy to use. Love it!  Couldn't beat the price for sure! Fun way to pass the time.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|UPDATED FOR BLU-RAY:<br /><br />A couple of things about the Blu-ray edition 1) Paramount has done a stunning transfer with nice depth, clarity and detail. Skin tones look quite nice as do textures. The audio is VERY active with a great losslss 7.1 mix.<br /><br />Be aware however that the sequences shot in IMAX format are NOT presented in the wider aspect ratio for the film (unlike, say, \\"The Dark Knight\\"). Also this includes a code for a Ultraviolet \\"copy\\" which means you'll have to stream the film rather than upload it to your portable device. There's also a code for itunes as well if you go that route.<br /><br />The special features are good for the two disc editions but I am a bit disappointed that we don't get a feature length commentary track from Brad Bird and tom Cruise but we do get Bird's commentary for the deleted scenes and alternate opening sequence for the film. We also get featurettes on the dust storm sequence (a truly amazing sequence in a film filled with them) as well as \\"Mission Accepted\\" with Cruise, J.J. Abrams and director Bird on set discussing the making of the film.<br /><br />On the film:<br />When Tom Cruise lost it a couple of years back it impacted my ability to enjoy the films he was in and for a long while I avoided them. Having said that, I enjoyed \\"Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol\\" and found it to be the most consistently entertaining of the four films produced in the \\"MI\\" film series. Bringing director Brad Bird (\\"The Incredibles\\", \\"The Iron Giant\\")best known for his CGI films made with Pixar was a wise move--Bird proved that he had the ability to make an exceptional thriller with involving characters even when they were CG and now he had the chance to prove he could do the same with live action thrillers.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />The convoluted plot boils down to this: Ethan Hunt has been disavowed due to an operation that went awry and he's forced to work with an mysterious analyst named Brandt(Jeremey Renner \\"The Hurt Locker\\" and forthcoming \\"Avengers\\"), Jane (Paula Patton \\"Jumping the Broom\\")and the only member of his team that he's worked with before Benji (Simon Pegg \\"Paul\\", \\"Star Trek\\") now a field operative. Hunt's team can't rely on anybody within IMF because the organization is being blamed for the destruction of a military facility in the Kremlin. Hunt discovers that Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist of the original \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\")a dangerous terrorist has active launch codes for a Russian nuclear device and plans on using it to start a nuclear war.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />A well made thriller with some truly astonishing action set pieces including a scene where Hunt must scale the tallest building in the world in Dubai, \\"Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol\\" truly delivers on its promise and is, quite possibly, the best of the four films that Tom Cruise as starred in and co-produced. The writing by Andr&eacute; Nemec and Josh Applebaum (both \\"Alias\\" alumni working with \\"Alias\\" creator J.J. Abrams as co-producer of the film)focuses on developing the plot not so much the characters in the film (although a cursory attempt is made with the IMF team)but then these type of films aren't about developing character as much as it is to create just enough to help the plot fly.<br /><br />The action is nonstop in \\"M:IGP\\" and fans looking for a spectaular display of explosions/action sequences won't be disappointed. The main flaw of the film is the lack of character development and the use of familiar faces (Jeremey Renner, Josh Holloway in a cameo, Tom Wilkinson)to help flesh out characters that aren't given much screen time to develop but, as I mentioned earlier, that's really not the point of \\"M:IGP\\".Locker\\" and forthcoming \\"Avengers\\"), Jane (Paula Patton \\"Jumping the Broom\\")and the only member of his team that he's worked with before Benji (Simon Pegg \\"Paul\\", \\"Star Trek\\") now a field operative.

B004P98QZ8|5.0|We bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. He had a great time putting it together, challenging but still fun.  Once built the temple was sturdy enough for him to play with, unlike some of the Star Wars Lego products we had purchased in the past.  It was expensive, but I think worth the price.

B006C1DH92|5.0|The title says it all, really.  There isn't a lot to this game but once I start playing it, it's hard to put down.  I got this as the FAOTD but I would probably bee willing to pay money for it in other circumstances.  I think it is notable just for the fact that it is the first game I have gotten for Android which uses finger-swipes and is truly responsive and accurate at reading those finger-swipes.  Very well done.
0307891372|5.0|Seriously, this book is huge!  I have only just started using it, but it has been invaluable already.  It was a Christmas gift - and so happy to get it.  I almost want to start over in the game with a new character to utilize some of the new things I've learned!<br /><br />Nice job, Prima!

B004UQPM4E|5.0|For Anyone who is a Superman Movie Fan, the Blu Ray Edition of the Superman Movies brought the Series back to life and was a Reminder Just how Good Christopher Reeve was in this Movie series.  I especially enjoyed Superman II - the Richard Donner Director's Cut.Of course the first 2 movies  were the best in the Series but it was great to watch all the Movies in Blu Ray. Alot of the Extra Features about this Movie Series were quite good. My ranking of the Movies in this series is 1.Superman the Movie-(4 Stars) 2.Superman II-The Richard Donner Director's Cut-(3 and a half stars)  3.Superman II Theatricial Version-(3 Stars)4.Superman Returns-(2 and a half Stars)5.Superman 3-(2 Stars)6.Superman IV-the Quest for Peace-(1 and a half Stars-only for Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman, the Special Effects were poor and the Villian of Nuclear Man was way below average and Cannon spent almost no money to do this film, a Superman Movie is suppose to be a Big Budget Film in my Opinion) But overall the Movie Series and all the Extra's that are included is worth having on Blu Ray.

0393338398|5.0|My review is also the title of the Chapter 11, which for me, a former commercial real estate banker, is a hard pair of words to write and not think of bankruptcy.<br /><br />I think this book, so well crafted, so entertaining and as delightful as any other Michael Lewis book about our culture, is specifically about the intellectual bankruptcy of sport. It is also a general tale about the bankruptcy of conventional wisdom.<br /><br />I love baseball and I love baseball books but I don't like the people who run Major League baseball and I haven't since reading Lords of the Realm, by John Helyar. I am not the least objective.<br /><br />I still love baseball and this book is the least cynical thing I have learned about baseball, and enjoyed, since the Red Sox won four games in a row against the Yankees in 2004's ALCS. They then went along to win four more in a row to win their first World Series in a very long time. I hate the Redsox, but I love their fans, and I recommend every one of them read this book. For the fans of the Yankees, well, nothing is going to help you so I don't care if you read this book or not . But you should.<br /><br />Biily Beane's story, for this is a book about Billy Beane and not necessarily about the Oakland A's, who I also hate by the way, is a very odd man. I can't imagine he will ever be appreciated inside baseball, but for all of us outside baseball, he is Babe Ruth. He is a slugger of myths and he is an epic individual.<br /><br />If you don't read this book about Billy, then you may not have a soul. You may not care about baseball but you have run up against conventional wisdom all of your life. Maybe conventional wisdom did you some favors but in the long run, just like any statistics, your performance against conventional wisdom will gravitate to the mean. Your experience against it will be pretty much be the same as everyone else.<br /><br />The Oakland A's in general, all the players Billy and Paul Podesta traded for, scouted and acquired, defied conventional wisdom and prospered. We all should, prosper that is. But you'll have to defy conventional wisdom.

0307454541|5.0|Generally, I have never cared much for mystery books. But this novel was the rare exception. I first picked up the novel - hesitatingly, I'll admit - expecting to read another ridiculous mystery that would make me yawn. After the first couple of chapters, however, I was so fascinated and hooked that I could NOT put this book down! The author, Larsson, gives all his main characters such developed personalities that I kept having to remind myself that this book was fiction. When I read this novel, I became so attached to the plots and characters' qualities that I actually had a dream in which I was somehow living in the story with the characters, as if it were all real. Last thing, I've noticed that most of the people who gave this book negative reviews were complaining that they didn't enjoy the novel because the main heroine, Lisbeth, was too sexually promiscuous. I don't think these readers seem to understand that Lisbeth had been so physically and emotionally abused by all the people around her that having sex not only gave her temporary feelings of belonging and security, but it also served as an angry rebellion against society's value of sex as something sacred and done with a regular partner. This \\"sexual promiscuity\\" is not superfluous information, but actually essential to understanding the feelings of Lisbeth. Give this book a chance, you won't be disappointed!
B000SO7OL6|3.0|i'm a diana krall fan and own 8 of her albums. i bought this album together with \\"the girl from the other room\\" as my latest purchase. i first got wind of the \\"very best...\\" album when a friend lent me his CD and immediately love most of the songs in the compilation, most especially the last song - the live version of \\"fly me to the moon\\". i got disappointment with my CD because the last track would hang in the middle of the playback. i tried playing it in different cd players but got the same result. this is the first time i experienced such a defect from an original CD, hence the 3 star rating.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I wasn't feeling well when I started this book, and had a bit of trouble getting into the story. I came back to the reviews and after skimming through a few, decided I would keep reading. I am very happy I made that decision. As another reviewer mentioned, I also found myself dreading the chapters reflecting the dismal and cruel reality of the orphanage. I will strive to remember each day as was presented in this worthwhile novel that a smile and kind words cost nothing and can literally be life changing to the recipient. Thank you, Christina McKenna, for this lovely work!
B004AYCWY4|5.0|Are you a former creationist or Intelligent Design enthusiast? After growing up in an IFB (independent fundamental baptist) cult, I was clueless about evolution upon emergence. All I had heard about evolution was that \\"man came from monkeys.\\" I needed to study the basics of evolutionary theory before I came to my conclusion about earth's having a creator.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins is a vocal atheist trumpeting science as incompatible with fundamentalist religion (if not all religion.) Becoming an atheist sparked my critical thinking skills from dormancy into action. I chose The Greatest Show on Earth as my introductory lesson to Evolution.<br /><br />Here's my YouTube video review about my experience in listening to the audio version of this book:  [...] (It was too large to upload here. YouTube Channel:  MEAndersFit)<br /><br />I would recommend this book to the following five groups:<br /><br />- Those who are newly deconverted from Christianity.<br />- Christians questioning the validity of Creationism or Intelligent Design.<br />- Religious leaders seeking to explain the origins of the world to their congregations.<br />- Anyone who needs a refresher course about the basics of evolution.<br />- Brainwashed religious cult survivors.<br /><br />Readers: What other books would you recommend to someone new to evolution? Any other favorite scientific authors you enjoy? Carl Sagan is next on my to be read list for evolution self-education.

The segment/song \\"Echoes\\" is worth buying alone, as the lead part is not recorded for the CD/record and only exists in this movie. It's an amazing lead guitar part that must be heard and seen to really enjoy. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright are interviewed and express their emotions and insight on writing or approaching their song writing.<br />The best part is a small glimpse into the pre-Dark Side of The Moon synth-music that Roger showcases in this movie.<br />This is a perfect \\"10\\" out of 5 stars! Enjoy this wonderful movie and event.

1442419814|5.0|Have you ever just taken a moment to think of the future?  Like what it would be like and what rules we would have to follow?  Just imagine at 12 years old having to leave your home and family to go live in a place called Uglyville, and then from there, at age 16 having to go from an \\"Uglie\\" to a \\"Pretty\\".  What's your opinion on this?  Do you agree or disagree?  Agree, or can't make up your mind, maybe reading down further will help.  The Uglies is a sci-fi book and the first one out of 3, written by Scott Westerfield.  The book takes place in the future of America 300 years from now.  In the beginning, in what now is our world was called the \\"Rusty World\\", because at the time we used to much metal and the world rusted and became ruined.  From there on, villages were made, starting out the \\"new\\" way of life in different communities, but mainly a community, called Uglyville.  Tally Youngblood, our narrator, is an outgoing 15 year old girl just waiting for her birthday to come so she could undergo her transformation.  That's all she is waiting for.  To become a \\"Pretty\\" and live like a \\"Pretty\\"  The whole thing behind the \\"Uglies\\" and the \\"Pretties\\" is that from the time you are born to age 12, you live at home.  Then once your 12th birthday hits, you have to move away from home to live in the society of Uglyville.  Most of the kids there are just anxiously waiting til their 16th birthday where they will finally undergo their transformation.  This transformation that I have been mentioning is that once you turn 16 you are required to get a major plastic surgery done, to change your looks to be what the society thinks to be pretty, but not just that.  There are things that not everyone may know about and even things the human eye isn't aware of.  Once you get the tranformation from and \\"Ugly\\" to a \\"Pretty\\" you again are required to move into a community where you are with all other people that have gone through the same things you have.  Tally Youngblood is one of thekids living in Uglyville that just can't wait to undergo her transformation to a \\"Pretty\\", but her friend Shay, feels entirely different about becoming a \\"Pretty\\".  Shay, she has some special information...she has a connection with and outside, rebellious group called the Smoke.  Shay soon runs away to join the Smoke, leaving Tally alone in Uglyville.  But, she doesn't leave her totally in the dust, which is a plus.  Shay leaves behind clues and hints about the whereabouts of the Smoke.  Tally then promises to not rat them out.    Once Tally soon hears, by a \\"Special\\", (the secret police organization), that unless she reveals the territory of the Smoke, that she is forbidden to getting the surgery; 16 or not.  Now, Tally has a decision to make.  Will she become a \\"Pretty\\" and betray her friend, or, will she stay loyal and stay an \\"Uglie\\"?  There are 2 main themes in this book.  One, I'm sure you may already notice, is change.  Physical and emotional.  Changes happen all throughout the book by the \\"Uglies\\" transforming to \\"Pretties\\" and changing their ways of lives.  Not only do their looks change, but their personalities change and the surgery even creates lesions in the child's brain.  The other one is \\"the general truth of life\\" and that \\"looks aren't everything\\".  That you don't have to undergo a surgery to become pretty, that you have a inner beauty just how you are.  This is a quote that I think goes along the lines of the themes:  \\"All that you know is that you are, and all that you are is nothing; and as sad as it seems, it is not sad at all, because all that you know is everything\\"  Later on, the Smokes did get captured, leaving free only Tally and David. (David is Tally's love).  David's dad is dead and his mom has made a cure for the lesions in the brain.  Tally tries to get Shay to use the cure, but Shay refuses to take the cure because she has not proven herself.  Now, what will Tally do?  Will she make the right decision in the end?  Will she make thedecision to become a \\"Pretty\\" and be the test for the cure, and help out Shay?  Or, will she leave Shay hanging without a cure?  I guess you will have to find the book and read it...all the way to the end to uncover the question that lies on the table now:  What does Tally do?  Personally, I can't tell you my favorite part of the book, because it is a spoiler.  I will say that in my favorite part I liked the honor and courage that Tally showed, even in the harder times.  Also, sadly, I haven't read any other sci-fi books to compare this to, but I think I can say it is a sufficient one.    Overall, I think the author did a great job writing the book and getting his point across.  He had great writing techniques and good usage of figurative language.  If you like a good book with twists and turns, some interesting things that you could imagine in our future, some romantic and action scenes, then this is the book for you.  For me, reading isn't number one on my list, but this book, I didn't mind reading and I didn't want to put it down, so if you're like me, then this is also a good book for you to read!       Enjoy!

B001YV504U|5.0|My wife is a child of the 80's and as such, still remains in love with both Kevin Costner and Michael Douglas. The movie is great (for its time). It is an easy one to just turn on and do chores with it going in the background. It was well worth $9.99.
B00447G2PM|5.0|I love the underwater, I scuba dive, and I find watching IMAX documentaries extremely fun. So when I first saw DEEP SEA in the Melbourne IMAX theatre, I had a ball of a time! Not only were the underwater footages amazing, I appreciated the combination of humor and wit in the direction of this documentary. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are perfect as narrators for this. This documentary gives a good factual introduction to the underwater, and the music and narration add to make it a really enjoyable documentary! I think that even people who aren't so crazy about the underwater / who do not scuba dive / do not dig IMAX stuff, will find it hard not to enjoy this 40min trip underwater. If you're extremely selective like I am about purchasing 3D titles and you enjoy wildlife, I would recommend DEEP SEA in a heartbeat!

159514188X|1.0|\\"I hope you're ready, because I'm about to tell you the story of my life. More specifically, why my life ended. And if you're listening to these tapes, you're one of the reasons why.\\"  Thirteen Reasons Why is an extremely creative story, but the appeal stops there.  It starts with a boy, Clay, who finds a mysterious package on his porch. When opened, he discovers it's from a girl who killed herself not long before; a girl that he had a crush on for quite some time. The package contains cassette tapes and a map, and after Clay rummages through the garage to find a cassette player he listens to the first tape; her audible suicide letter.  Clay listens to all of the tapes in one night, following along all the reasons why Hannah Baker had ended her life. There were thirteen tapes, thirteen reasons why, and she sent the tapes to every person who was a reason, including Clay. She had included a map with the tapes, so that you could go to the places where her story took place. In all, an extraordinary way to explain why she killed herself.  The author of this book, Jay Asher, is very inventive with his writing, and he's very good at stringing everything together so you can follow along. Which is a great quality to have when your story is nothing more than a written soap opera. The whole novel is packed with useless drama, and exaggerations of what being a teenager is like.  The novel itself is written in present day, in a small town where everyone knows each other. It's different than most books because the story is told by both Clay and Hannah, quickly switching back between his thoughts, and her recorded voice.  People who love teen novels will probably enjoy this book incredibly. As previously mentioned, the book is very well written, the story itself, however, is less than desirable.  \\"In the end, everything matters\\"  Meg D
B0042U94UQ|5.0|To me Dispicable Me is one of the funnies childrens movies ever.  It is a great movie for the whole family or just for fun, very good and cute story I would recomend this for anyone with children or just to add to your movie collection.  This is a very good movie.
B005804NCI|5.0|I would like to echo that this is a good mix on SACD.  It was nice that they took the time to do it right, and worked hard to make the surround-sound 5.1 experience a worthwhile purchase on many tracks.  If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, then I'd suggest you pony-up the cash and buy this album (provided you can play SACD).<br /><br />A few quick notes:<br /><br />Secondhand News sounded just average for SACD, but I really liked the sound of Dreams, and especially Never Going Back Again.  Don't Stop was a little flat, but the clarity of the drums and surround treatment in Go Your Own Way was a nice experience.  Silver Springs will raise hairs on the back of your neck (if you like that song).  As mentioned, The Chain was very nice.  You Make Loving Fun sounded more updated, and sufficient, but more could have been achieved here.  I Don't Want To Know was refreshing, if a bit above average for an SACD track.  Oh Daddy was almost a surreal experience by comparison, however, and Gold Dust Woman was so nice it almost makes the disc by itself.  The disc ends with Songbird, which sounded good as well.<br /><br />I should also add that my Oppo experienced 3 drops in sound (silence for 1 or 2 seconds) at various points while listening to this disc.  I went back over the spots where these drop-outs happened, but could not reproduce the problems.  It could by my player, but I haven't noticed problems with any other discs.  I just thought that I should mention this.  I will be keeping an ear on my player and will update if I notice more problems.  The disc is in new condition.

0156027321|4.0|\\"I got up from my desk and hurried to the blackboard. Before the teacher could say a word, I picked up a piece of chalk and said as I wrote: `My name is Piscine Molitor Patel, known to all as' -I double underlined the first two letters of my given name- `Pi Patel' For good measure I added `pi=3.14' and I drew a large circle, which I then sliced in two with a diameter, to evoke that basic lesson of geometry.\\" This quote shows Yann Martel's tendency for surprise, as well as his character's ability to relate logic to life.  Life of Pi is a fictional story about Pi Patel; a clever, God-loving boy from India who loves to learn and has a great interest in animals due to the fact that his father is a zookeeper. When he is sixteen, his family decides to move their zoo to North America, but on the way their ship sinks and Pi is left out at sea in a lifeboat with only his life, some of the zoo animals, and his wits. One of the animals, a 450-pound Bengal tiger, quickly devours each of the other animals until just it and Pi remain. Pi must rely on fear, knowledge, and quick wit if he wants to make it out alive. The major themes of the book are the nature of religious belief and the will to live  Martel relates himself to Pi with the traits he exemplifies. For example, Martel studied philosophy in college and he makes Pi a person who analyzes things and looks for the deeper meaning. As a boy, Pi was very open-minded about religion. He was a devoted Hindu, his country's religion, but he also was intrigued by two other religions: Christianity and Islam. So much so, he eventually came to be a member of both as well as his first religion, Hindu. Three vastly different religions; but he found things in each he loved. He was actually a bit of an agnostic because he was not sure of any one religion, so he chose three to try to ensure himself. Martel also shows his intelligence through Pi. Pi does not just make claims about something, he learns the facts.  This knowledge and wisdom help Pi when he is put into a seemingly inescapable situation: he and a tiger on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean. The only way Pi can possibly escape is if he wills himself to. He must abandon some basic principles he has lived by, when his survival instincts take over. This book shows how far the will to live will push you.  Although this book might be a little hard to follow for younger readers, the author uses imagery very effectively, to literally show the reader what he means. If you can, just hang in there long enough and you are in for a great suspenseful fable. Martel is a master story-teller and this book won him the prestigious Man Booker Prize. I loved this book for its surprise and intelligent descriptions of life, and I think it would be a great read for anyone who has an interest in zoology or religious studies, or loves tales full of suspense.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory season 2 is really funny and entertaining, I love this show more and more as it goes along.  It is a great tv series to own and it is one that you can watch over and over again.

B005804MHE|3.0|I imported this SACD out of Japan.  It was pricey, but I like The Doors, and thought it would sound really great.  Overall, I found the sound to be of decent quality for an SACD, but I was a bit disappointed by the mix.  I felt as if it was made 5.1 channels as more of an afterthought (well, I suppose it sort of was, but it's no Pink Floyd!).  Jim Morrison's voice is almost entirely center-channel on most tracks -- basically just dumped into center.  The other instruments are separated well across left and right, and bass extension is nice, but the surround experience is little more than basic processing no different than my Marantz receiver can create on its on.<br /><br />There is an interesting write-up in the printed materials that accompany the SACD.  It starts out saying, \\"Warning:  This isn't the same album you've been listening to for the past 40 years....\\"  It goes on to explain some minor overdubbing that was done, as well as that the entire original album was, \\"...running slow and off-key -- flat, to be exact.\\"  They claim that the vinyl and CD copies are actually off-key, but this SACD is accurate speed-wise.  Interesting.<br /><br />I suppose this is a must-have for a huge Doors fan or SACD collector, but overall, I was a bit disappointed.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought personally that it was a great book and that it made you think a lot. It got into my mind and I questioned a lot of things. The genre is fiction and is a Epistolary novel.  `I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn't try to sleep with people even if they could have. I need to know that these people exist. `  This book follows the mind of Charlie, or so we know him. In the first letter he says that he will not be using real names. The letters are to a friend, but we never find out who that is. He tells about his first year of high school in these letters. Charlie talks about the hardships he is going through. At the beginning he starts of with no friends, and a teacher steps in and helps guide him in a way. He tells him to go participate, go to football games, dances, etc. He starts to go to a psychiatrist and asks him a lot about when he was little. Charlie sees' no reason why he is going there and thinks it is stupid and that they should be concerned about the here and now and the then and there. He discovers hidden things that he has pushed from his mind and depressed them away. We do find out that he has a lot of mental things wrong with him and is depressed.  Charlie is a depressed freshman and just needs some love and friends. He grows a lot as a person throughout the book. His best friend dies in 8th grade so he has a tough time coping with that. Charlie is a very smart person and reads like crazy.  This story is set somewhere in the 1990. Sadly however they never say where he lives. Charlie wants to keep everything a big secret, so nobody knows who he is.  A major conflict was when he kissed Sam and not his girlfriend when he was dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. After he did that Patrick (a close friend of his) told him he probably shouldn't hang out with them for a little while or until things cooled down. He sunk back down into major depression like he was before he got friends.  I really liked howthe author wrote this book. He gets into your mind and makes you think about life in a different perspective. He got into Charlie's place and took off it seemed. It was amazing how well he wrote the book. Stephen Chbosky is an amazing writer.  Someone who would really like this book is someone who isn't afraid of reading other peoples thoughts. This book rememinded me a lot of Dear Everybody by Micheal Kimball. It probably only reminds me of it because they are both letters. But it gets into your mind and it's so cool.  `I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't. `  by Alli C

0399250573|5.0|The book Scorpia Rising by Anthony Horowitz is the ninth and final installment in the  Alex Rider series. It is a fiction book that takes place mostly in Egypt, in the present time.  The main character is Alex Rider. Alex is a tall fifteen year-old boy with blond hair who  is gifted at being a spy but does not want to. He has been blackmailed in the past into working  for the British spy service, MI6. He had thought that his days of spying for MI6 were over and  has been enjoying being normal. All this changes when the evil organization Scorpia, currently  led by Razim, sets up a trap to disgrace MI6 and kill Alex. To do this, Scorpia pretends to be  doing an operation on a school in Cairo. MI6 can only think of one person suitable for the job:  Alex.  This book is fast-paced and full of suspense and mystery as demonstrated by this  quote: \\"Alex felt the extra weight as a towel was laid across his face. And then the first  drops of water were poured onto the towel. He felt the dampness against his face and then,  immediately afterward, the first symptoms of suffocation. He couldn't breathe. Worse than  that. His lungs were tearing themselves apart, his whole body trying to swallow itself. He was  going mad.\\"  This book is similar to the James Bond series, because it is about a spy who uses  incredible gadgets and works for the British spy service. But Horowitz uses his own unique style  by creating a spy who simply doesn't want to be one. He is also very descriptive and will keep  you on the edge of your seat.  I enjoyed reading this book. I liked the action and trying to figure out Scorpia's master  plan. I read through it slower than usual; trying to savor it, almost not wanting to end the saga  that had me so enthralled.  So if you are looking for an exciting, action-packed book, Scorpia Rising is for you. Just  try a chapter. You won't regret it.  Evan L

B005QBKXSC|5.0|I love Daughtry and I highly recommend people to buy it. My faborite song is \\" Crawling Back To You\\" and I think Chris Daughtry is mad hottttttt. Anyone who is a huge fan of Daughtry like I am, should buy this CD cause it's well worth the price, and the seller is also recommendable as well, cause he sent me the CD on time without any scratches or anything on it at all.
0062060554|5.0|I guess I never realized how critical I am of different people's works until I started writing reviews and pulling out the words to explain how I really felt about the novels. THIS book, I will tell you, is remarkable. It had me at Hello. Just kidding...but as soon as you start the story, you're sucked into it. Amazing plot and the story is told from the point of view of the main character with severe memory loss. Reading the events through her words makes the reader feel for her and understand her challanges and anguish and confusion. I feel like I am \\"one\\" with the main character in this book, because the writing is so vivid and detailed (not the overly-boring kind of detailed) that you can see through the eyes of this woman and sympathize with her struggles. I don't want to just read a book. I want to connect with it. I want to be moved by it and learn from it. This book did that for me. S. J. Watson is an incredibly talented writer. So glad he did not choose a different profession.
0743496736|4.0|\\"By the time you read this, I hope to be dead.....I guess I should tell you, Don't blame yourself; this isn't your fault, but that would be a lie. We both know that I didn't get here by myself.\\" ~Peter  What does it feel like to wake up every morning and look in the mirror and just see \\"you\\"? You  don't see a reflection worthy of the teasing and torments you undergo each day; you just see yourself.  Sometimes it feels as though other people look at us and see something that we can spend a lifetime  trying to understand. They hate you for the face they see. They hurt you for trying to just get by  unnoticed. They can make you hate yourself for being who you are.  A matter of minutes is too short to make decisions that will permanently change your life. In  Nineteen Minutes it shows how even the most innocent can turn into monsters. This fictional story takes  you through the story of a victim who turned an ordinary New Hampshire town completely upside down  in less than a half hour. It poses the question of whether we can ever reach a breaking point where our  actions become justified. When too far is too far. When you have simply had enough.  This book does not focus in on the traditional main character. Instead, the story unfolds as it is  told through several different perspectives centralized around one boys disturbing revenge. It was very  intriguing to see the same scenario through a variety of eyes. Through the lifeless eyes of a boy who was  trapped in his own skin; a boy who decided one day to no longer put up with the discriminations that he  felt defenseless against. Through the blind eyes of a lover who chose to live a life of pretend rather than  face the consequences of being real. Through the watery eyes of a mother who did not know how to  separate her life from her job in order to provide her daughter with the love and support she needed.  And through the tightly shut eyes of a mother and father who could not grasp the reality that their little  boy--the one they raised and loved--could turn into something so heinous. As you become a part of  each character, you not only start to care and grow feelings towards each one of these individuals, but  also start to realize that it takes hardly any time at all to change your own/someone else's life forever.  Although Jodi Picoult does not have the same quality of writing as other world renown authors  such as Shakespeare or Jane Austen have, she certainly redeems herself through her heat wrenching  plots and unexpected twists. She uses the simplicity of her words to convey such raw and relatable  emotions. Up until the end of the book, you think you know everything there is to know about each of  the characters, but the last few pages reveal the secrets and overlooked truths of each one of the  characters situations. Through this book, the author challenges you to the question of \\"Is anyone ever  really who they seem to be?\\", and leaves you to come to terms with your own decision.  Overall, this book is a real eye opener to all who have undermined the consequences of their  actions. Nineteen Minutes also provides comfort to those who have also been victims by proving that  they are not alone--there are others who have suffered. I would personally challenge anyone who reads  this book to really concentrate on the very complex issues and thoughts that the author weaves subtly  into the storyline.  In the end, you question your own character. What would it take to push you off the edge? How  do you allow others opinions to effect the way you live your life? Would you continue to love someone  despite what they became by remembering them for who they once were? And most importantly, how  well do you really think you know the people you associate with in your everyday life? Not everyone  who has endured negative situations becomes evil, and it doesn't always take a bad situation to cause  someone to commit a terrible doing. We are the only ones that know the thoughts in our minds and the  intents of our hearts. We are the only ones capable of stopping ourselves from ourselves. We are the  beholders of the secrets and truths of our lives. But just as this book proved that we are held  accountable for our own actions, it also proved that everyone has skeletons in their closet...some are  just better at keeping the door shut.  Jules D
0843175028|5.0|Cute book. The drawings in this series make me so happy - and the small sizes make the book a perfect stocking stuffer.
1419702238|5.0|This book was so funny that my son read it once himself, and then read it a second time to the rest of our family in the first day he owned.  So very funny.  Super speedy delivery.  I am so pleased.
0385737955|4.0|I was very entertained throughout the book. I found it to be a page-turner for me. The only reason it's getting 4 stars instead of five is because, although the concept of the storyline is ridiculously imaginative and original, there were several points throughout the book where the writing left much to be desired. Some things were just not explanatory enough. Even when the book was finished, I still found myself with some unanswered questions. Hopefully these will be addressed when I read the Scorch Trials.
0316098329|4.0|Room by Emma Donoghue is a story about a five year old boy and his mother held  captive in a shed in the backyard of a man's house. The boy, Jack, was born and raised in a  11x11 size shed by his mom, who is twenty-six. She was kidnapped at the age of nineteen  and has been in the shed for seven years, she had Jack when she was twenty-one. Jack only  knows of this shed that he refers to as Room, he doesn't know that there is a whole world out  there waiting for him. When he watches T.V. he thinks those things are fake and that grass,  clouds, flowers, and other people don't exist he thinks that him, his mom, and Old Nick,the  man who took her, are the only people.  In the book Jack refers to things as if they are people, \\"We move Table over to beside  Bath so we can sunbathe on Rug right under Skylight where it's extra warm.\\" At first it was a  little hard to get used to inanimate objects being referred to as people.  To Jack Room is home, its the only place he knows, but to his mom it's a prison. For  seven years she's been trying to get out. She tried to dig out but there is a chain fence under  the floor and when Old Nick saw it he laughed in her face, and she tried to hit him on the head  with the top of the toilet seat when he came in and when he fell stuck a knife against his  throat; after that he threatened her that if that ever happened again he would kill her. His mom  knows they both can't stay there much longer she's getting desperate so she comes up with a  plan, but starts to doubt it.  Emma Donoghue did a excellent job getting into the mind set of a five year old boy. In  To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee she told it from a five year old girl perspective, but the  way she told the story was much different. In Room Jack acts like a five year old, he pushes  his moms buttons, gets in trouble, and has an imagination, but in To Kill A Mockingbird Scout  doesn't act like a five year old she acts more mature, but she still likes to push peoples  buttons and get in trouble.  I would recommend this book for people that like drama. While reading this book you  can feel the mother's frustration of wanting to get out. I finished this book in two nights, the  beginning of the book was a little rough to get through because it was boring and nothing was  really happening, but once I go to the middle it was hard to put down the book. Although, I did  think that it ended a little abruptly I thought there should have been a little bit more to it.     Becca D
B001PPGAJE|5.0|X-Men is one of my favorite all-time movies, and remains my favorite in the X-men series.  I think, being the introduction to all the amazing characters like Rogue, Wolverine, Professor Xavier himself (whom I so loved as a child I named my only son Xavier after!), Magneto, Storm, and so many others their names escape me at the moment!  But my point is movies where so many main characters are introduced, usually the first in the series, are often the best, because these are the movies where you meet and get to know and fall in love with said characters, as you do so here.  And you come along a main evil, humanity, which wants to rid the world of mutants.  And there are also so many sub-stories, sub-origin stories as well.  Like where everyone is coming from, their backstories, how they are meeting and coming to Professor Xavier's school, coming together, and on the reverse how the other, \\"bad\\" mutants are coming to Magneto's side, etc., and the other stories, and love plots, between Jean and Wolverine and with Rogue wanting so badly to make a connection and being unable to touch anyone.  This is also Anna Paquin's big coming out, playing Rogue, her first big part on the big screen (now as Sookie Stackhouse in the True Blood series), and she really makes her mark and nails this part like no other could.  But the whole cast is cinematic Gold.  It is a Stars Buffet to be had, and this is definitly THE disc to get!  I already had it on standard and just had to pick up the blu-ray as well, X-Men is one of the rare few I will rewatch for years to come (I am not one of those that rewatches movies at all) Highly recommended to all, a must have for any movie collection!

B0037AGASG|5.0|My Daughter recently got struck with Bieber Fever and asked for his cd for Christmas, this is the one I picked up for her.  She has been listening to it every time we get in the car and often in the house, memorized the tracks (10 and 5 are her favorites) and loves to sing along!  While 5 seems very young to me, Ella has a great appreciation for music, and has gone from the Barbie Song, to \\"I'm Blue\\" to her love of \\"Cake\\" and now Bieber, and it's all Bieber all the time.  As far as role models go though, he isn't bad for my 5 year old, a bit annoying on my ears the tenth time around, but it could be worse (Lohan, Cyrus, Spears, etc.,) and I think he's a better role model for younger girls then some of these tragic females today.  Ella just adores him and I got her a fun pop culture book for Christmas as well as stickers and we will soon be watching the movie I am sure.  I have to admit I find the first song catchy and it stays in my head too, lol. For such a young age he sings of heartbreak and falling in love with so much knowledge, but he still sounds like a girl to me, and I don't say that to be negative at all, it's just the youthfulness of his voice I suppose, he has a beautiful voice, just very feminine in quality, but I give the CD 5 stars for it was bought for my daughter and she loves it, and even though I am not a fan, I don't hate it (just tire of listening to it), but the words written do have a lot of meaning, and I do like the first and tenth song.  Good stuff.  :)
B004HO6I4M|4.0|We saw the movie twice in Theatres and it was on my daughter's Christmas list.  She is in band and just loves the music.  The story line was kind of cute.  Not something I care to watch over and over again, but the kids like it.  Arrived in plenty of time for Christmas-in great shape.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It says that god created the world 6000 years ago but we know it to be much older and we now know about evolution. Now if this creation didn't happen then there's no original sin. Then there's also no jesus swooping down and forgiving us for original sin. This book does not correspond to real life and should be read as fiction. Great app though!
B004132HZS|5.0|I'm fairly skeptical about adaptions that transplant classic tales into the contemporary world and was prepared to dislike \\"Sherlock\\", but I was pleasantly surprised, especially by the first episode, \\"Study in Pink\\".  It's stunning.  Not just the story telling, but the photography and general production values are outstanding.<br /><br />I was much less enthusiastic about the second episode, \\"The Blind Banker\\".  The episode opens with Sherlock engaged in sword fight in his flat that never really is integrated into the rest of the story, which for me barely held my interest.  The best part is the Chinese circus scene, which has some outstanding visuals.<br /><br />The third episode, \\"The Great Game\\", is an improvement over the second episode, but doesn't reach the quality of the first.  The opening scene is particularly annoying.  It shows the sociopathic side of Holmes, as he mocks the grammar of an Englishman, imprisoned in a foreign country and facing a murder charge, who has begged Holmes to save him from execution, but is very hard to watch.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as Dr Watson, the Afghan war vet adjusting to civilian life, both give brilliant performances.  Dr Watson is a particularly interesting character whose inner tensions are more apparent in each episode, with more depth than Holmes.<br /><br />Despite my gripes about the story in the second and to a lesser extent in the third episode, the writing, acting, and general production values are outstanding in all three episodes.  I'm looking forward to seeing what future episodes will offer.  Until now, my favorite Holmes were Jeremy Brett and Basil Rathbone, but Benedict Cumberbatch seems likely to eclipse both of them.  I like Martin Freeman's Dr Watson much more than his predecessors.  He's not the bumbler that's often portrayed, but an intelligent medical doctor who is also a hardened war vet who knows he has alternatives if Holmes takes him too much for granted.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Loved this movie in theatres-I love Colin Firth in it-all the acting is great, the rating seems wrong for a few cuss words-I will watch this one over and over again.  Briefly touches on his brother and the abdication, which I find of interest.  I got one for my mom and one for me-a present for myself! :)  DVD arrived quickly and in pristine condition
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like it.  fun. simple. different skill levels. easy. enjoyable. free. no cost.  good graphics.  good for variety of skill levels.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|The movie is fantastic and a great finish to the series.  However, if you are looking for the digital copy this isn't it, it's digital streaming and very difficult to setup and then you have yet one more system to deal with.  Complain to Fixster and they will provide an I-tunes code to download a true digital copy.  I for one will not buy any additional Ultraviolet digital copies!
B003L77GGK|4.0|I bought Seasons 1-3 on a whim when they were on sale at Target for $15 each a couple years ago. Been hooked ever since. Season 6 for the most part did not disappoint.  I would say it's a stronger and better season than 1, 2, and 5, but not as good as Seasons 3 and 4.  Still, it's worth the buy if you are a fan of the series and don't want to try to watch everything online.  I'm consistently behind in the on-tv-season, so I always end up buying the seasons while the current one is on-- but regardless, the best time to buy online is Black Friday! $20 is a great discount for an entire season that would normally be $40+.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I don't understand the whole Harry Potter hype that has hit the nation and would never buy this product for myself let alone pay to see anyof these movies. That being said, my wife loved the complete package so I must have done right. Yea me!!!
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Yes this movie is raunchy and over the top, but I loved it. There are awkward parts and it is R rated for a reason, but this is the best comedy I've seen all year. Don't take it seriously and you'll love it!
B006C1DH92|5.0|I like fruit ninja and now with puss in boots. its really fun and I have enjoyed it a lot.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|After borrowing the first and second seasons from friends, I was trying to watch the rest online to save some money. Getting sick of that, I bought the complete series on Black Friday online for a great discount price.  Totally worth it, and now I can go back and watch all four seasons over again, because now that I've seen the end, I KNOW there's stuff I want to revisit in the first couple of seasons. One thing that wasn't clear is that the movies Razr and The Plan are included in the Complete Series-- not having done my research on this, I ended up purchasing those separately, so now I have two copies of those. Shoot.<br /><br />Anyway, the series is so good I already have family/friends lining up to borrow various seasons-- I did hear from my brother that my first disc of Season 2 was scratchy, but he managed to get through it so I suppose it wasn't too bad. So far everything else is great!<br /><br />Starbuck & Apollo forever!!!!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Nearly two years has passed since the end of the game, the planet having been saved by a group of adventurers with good hearts.  Now, a new threat emerges.  A plague-like stigma that causes painful skin irritation and distress and a new physical threat in the form of three gray-haired brothers named Kadaj, Yazoo, and Loz.  Cloud Strife, buried in a sea of grief and drifting further and further from the things he loves, must fight the threat back while simultaneously attempting to remember what he cherishes most.<br /><br />For those of us who have played the game just having the characters CGed so well gets us giddier than a child at Christmastime.  What's more is that the story is actually good!  It does a fine job of sticking to the shadows of the video game with the way humor melts with drama and action swirls together with story.  In addition the movie combines aspects of the game like materia and how it is used and giving living, abstract personality to characters that were analyzed only through written dialogue and jerky movements.  Even the interactions and relationship between Reno and Rude are pristine.<br /><br />This edition also has additional features such as a \\"Making of\\" , \\"Deleted Scenes\\", and some of the trailers from the original advertising of the movie.  A great buy for fans of the game, but not so much for the common layman.  Though the movie does explain the game there is a lot that is lost if you have not physically sat through the game and given the time over to learning the characters and story.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|The CD arrived promptly and as expected. What wasn't expected was for it to be a little book, much like her recent \\"remix\\" album, 'Director's Cut', which was very charming. The only problem with the 'little book' format is that it seems like it'd lead to the disc getting scratched up, should anything stray into the envelope in the back of the book (I'd think it'd be better to have a little four-tab thing that folds around the CD so one lifts it out instead of slides it out).<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Kate Bush, this might not be the best album to start with, since the format is very few, but very long, songs (much like the concept album side of 'Aerial'), with the songs generally mellow. Although 'Sensual World' isn't all that indicative of her most recent works, I still think it (and/or 'Hounds of Love') would be preferable to use as a first-time album to sell folks with.

1451627289|1.0|I was there reading Carrie when it first came out. It is safe to refer to me as one of the constant readers; now it ismore like constant sucker. I am sure that the conspiracy people will be saying that this is yet another book that is NOT written by Stephen King. This one, they will say was probably written by someone very close to him or an Editor at Scribner. Whichever way one looks at it this is another prime example of turning a 50 page story into an 800 + page Monstrocity. There is about 800 pages of pure boredom in which there is next to no coherent story. Wasted words that amount to nothing. Even as a Soap Opera the romance in this alleged novel is not believable. He reverts to his formula of repeating and repeating and repeating.  Basically the grocery list is probably more exciting than this novel.  This is another prime example of what is wrong with the Publishing Industry of today.

B003LL3LHO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book I read it b4 edge of destiny because ghosts of ascalon had not one bad review and I see y after reading it. This story is twist after twist never leaving a dull moment. It is a very interesting story any guildwars fan would love it. I personally want to see a movie based off this book that would be sick. I also believed these book are actual storyline events that guildwars 2 is based off of.
B005F3XV62|2.0|1.  Anytime there's a movie with talking animals, I get it because my kids tend to love those movies.  I knew going into it that it was a PG movie and I can say that it is a PG movie.  However, you have to wonder who these folks targeted the movie for... because it just misses on all levels.  Most \\"normal\\" adults aren't going to enjoy this;  it's not bad, but it's basically juvenile.  Some scenes and episodic language isn't for those below Jr High... and those young kids are the ones that are typically going to watch talking animal movies.<br />2.  Bottomline, this movie could have been pretty good, if it just focused on one target audience;  ie young kids and their parents and cleaned up the language / certain situations... but they didn't and as a result, this movie is already headed for the trash heap of has been films that will be lost to memory etc...
B003L1ZXCU|1.0|Well, the book was actually pretty good at first. The technical info is for the most part good. But after a while I started to loose interest in the book. Somewhere between the robots (which was a great leap of faith) and a complete wrong representation of special ops take-down procedures (just using logic, do you think that \\"hands in the air\\" actually happens in real life spec ops?). Anyways, it hit me that the book was a complete trash and the author might have an internet/networks technical knowledge, but that's about it. He might have a better luck selling me the whole thing if the deamon was an actual AI, but as things stand, just to much bs to take in.

The nuance and complication that animate modern life are richly drawn here.  Franzen has been criticized for not liking his characters.  I don't agree with this as a categorical critique.  He likes them variably, as we do each other in life.

I am reminded of the places in Tokyo that serve one cocktail, but focus on the one in order to make it the best possible.  Murakami seems to be trying that with one novel.  Always the same characters, plot, symbolism... Etc.  now it's just tired.

B004QPOVF0|5.0|Just got this great DVD for Christmas. I know it has been out for a few months but it made a nice gift to me from the family. We saw this concert in its arena form on this Black Ice tour and this is a great souvenir to have of it. Angus is probably slowing down but you can't tell from watching his performance. The rest of the band is as rock steady and professional as ever. This is my generation's Rolling Stones. They have so many great songs and they just keep keepin' on. I hope they keep at it till they can no longer pick up their guitars. Just love them and their high volume boogie rock n roll. I have read some complaints about the constant cutting between cameras but this is just the way things are done today. They have lots of cameras and the director tries to capture both audience and band with lots of cutaways and some split screens. I did not find it that distracting. The color and sound was fantastic. I also enjoyed the small documentary on doing the show in Argentina that was included as an extra. All in all nice package.
B006C1DH92|4.0|This is an amazing application!  The only FEW reasons I gave it a four star is because it is an advertisment for Puss In Boots and, it is not designed like the original Fruit Ninjas, but more complex. It is NOT very complex, but when I first opened the app, I said to myself &quot;What?&quot;. Of course, I.am not at all against this app! Great sound features, looks very well on Kindle Fire, and has great features! I am pretty amazed you can get all this for free! I reccomend this to anyone looking for some fun!

B004H1V5RU|5.0|I love this toy, It was on my wish list for almost a year, until this xmas, I decide to got th expert one, instead of the rookie or the normal version, this one have almost 135 steps, really difficult, I been playing this one for about a week at the office and I could reach level 60, more that that is really challenging. This is a good option for spend free time at the office and keep your eyes of the Screen,   besides, at least in my case, I leave this toy at the office, and my co workers sneak to my desk to play with it , also is a funny decoration. All the people that walk by, suddenly stop and ask for this, yes is a maze, inside a ball. is not a gameboy, buy is better to test your fine skills   Not recommended for little kids since they can try to cheat and shake the ball to try to reach a higher level, LOL

B005EY2XFC|4.0|The Crow is based on a graphic novel (comic book).  While it is not the first movie to be based on a this medium, it is one of the first movies to take this material seriously and present it darkly.  The Crow is graphic, violent, and presents its story in a dark gothic atmosphere.  The film also has a good soundtrack (rock genre).  There are moments of silliness in the movie and the plot has some holes, but the movie, as a whole, is entertaining and very watchable.  The Crow is not perfect, but its a good flick in a time where movies like it were few and far between.  The crow is a trail blazer for films like Sin City, Hell boy, Blade, and Watchman.  Its a good little flick and a must have addition to any comic fans film collection.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Amazing app just like MX tube for ipods. Best app on the market for sure. Expecially love ability to play as music instead of waste battery watching videos.

1451648537|5.0|People may say there are flaws with this book, but I did not see them. Sure, when you try to capture the essence of someone's life in 500 something pages, there are things that won't be perfect. But I find it hard to believe any other author could have done a better job. Isaacson shows Jobs from all angles and you really get a comprehensive view of a man who, while flawed, achieved great things and inspired millions of people in the process. You really discover the magic behind Jobs and see what a truly unique person he was, from a business and personal standpoint.

0439023513|3.0|** SPOILERS in this review **  Ok....As the reader, I came into this book with certain expectations. I expected war. I expected a sigificant death toll. I expected less of the love triangle aspect, however I knew it would be integrated and eventually resolved. I cared about these characters, who Collins did a beautiful job with in the first two books, and I expected them to be written in the same light. If they had to die it would be with cause and it would be emotional.  War and death toll I got. The rest, not so much.  Finnick's and Prim's deaths seem so casual, like \\"Oh well, Finnick was too slow so the mutts got him. Anyways, moving on!\\" - Obviously that's not a literal translation, but that's how I took it. It was so emotionless... Not like when Rue dies in the second book, there I really felt something... Even Prim, who was the original catalyst for Katniss to ever volunteer as Tribute in the first place, who Katniss cared for more than anything in the world, dies in an explosion and then we go right to Katniss being in the hospital morphed out on pain meds (which is just another annoying reoccurence in this book) Prim's death is so significant, yet is written so abruptly. This really bothers me.  As the character who's eyes we experience this story through, Katniss has two primary objectives leading into this book. Save Peeta. Kill Snow.  SHE ACCOMPLISHES NEITHER on a personal level. This also bothers me tremendously.  First of all, Katniss should have been a part of Peeta's rescue mission, period. Katniss is a fighter, especially when motivated by something meaningful to her. Instead she was in a bunker with Finnick, tying knots, waiting to hear about it from some one else. This happens a lot throughout the book. Katniss not really doing much, spending a lot of time in the hospital, or unconcious, and then hearing about how things happened after. This is not in character for her. Then she votes to hold a Hunger Games of the Capitol Leader's children???? Shewould never have done that. It was frustrating to read that.  The resolution with the love story is written in a sloppy and rushed manner. Gale takes a \\"Fancy\\" job in 2 and Peeta comes back to 12 where he and Katniss grow closer again. Gale, fancy? Huh???? I don't get it. I half expected one of the boys to die with a heroic passion to save Katniss, knowing the other would be there to continue to care for her.... something dramatic... not this. Katniss disconnects with Gale based on the possibility that his bomb design may have killed Prim, which HE doesn't even know. How doesn't he know if he helped to design a bomb that looked like the parachutes in the Games?? Thus leaving Katniss with Peeta by chance, not by choice. And that's it....? Oh, and Haymitch. So he moves back to 12 with her by order, and then they just don't talk anymore? Even when Peeta returns? Why?  If I had written this review immediately after finishing the book, I would have given it one star. I was not happy. But having some time to reflect, I feel like it's necessary to read in order to complete the trilogy. Yes, I am disappointed in the hastily developed details, but the story does provide closure on most things. Maybe not the way I wanted them to, but when has war ever provided a structured or satisfying outcome? If anything, I ended up caring about Peeta more than anyone else in the story, so for him to end up with Katniss to go on with life together and have children was a definite huge positive for me... the lingering PTSD symptoms they carry are a realistic detail. And while there were many moments where I felt like Katniss wasn't written in character, she also displayed that unpredictability we know her for on so many occasions. Like when she kills Coin. That had to happen I suppose, in the bigger scheme. Snow was sentenced and was going to be executed regardless. Katniss decided to off Coin because she knew that Coin was just as corrupt, and the viscious cycle would continue in Panem with Coin in control. So I was half satisfied, but more half empty.  I just hope that when the movie for this book is ready for production, and the story isn't portrayed strictly through Katniss's eyes, that we will finally see the things we missed - Peeta's rescue, the rebels overthrow the Capitol and Snow, maybe even Snow's trial or Katniss's trial.... I sincerely hope that Collins will help them shed light on these things, and also bring some drama and emotion with the deaths of Prim and Finnick. She owes her readers that much.

0062112430|4.0|In society where love has been declared a disease, 17 year old Lena is rapidly approaching her time to be \\"cured.\\" When she meets and falls in love with Alex, a boy from the Wilds, she has to make a choice: Be cured and live a safe, normal, boring life-- or risk it all for a boy and a disease society says could kill her.   I loved how this book evoked the question, \\"What would the world be without love?\\" To do away with love, is to do away with almost every emotion. Grief, anger, fear, hatred, jealousy...The list goes on and on. That's what appealed to me when I picked up this book, along with the beautiful cover art.   Maybe I've read to many dystopian novels lately. To me they are all about the same thing: a young girl who rebels against society. No variety, no new plots. I was hoping that Delirium would be a fresh take on a over popular genre, but alas, it was not so.  I did like this book. The writing was great and I loved the articles/ poems at the beginning of each chapter. This is the beginning of a trilogy that I am really looking forward to. My problem: I was just bored.   I think one day I'm going to pull this one out and reread it when I can give it all the dystopian attention it deserves. Delirium has potential to be one of my favorites, but right it's getting lost in all the dystopian, YA fluff that's filling my bookshelf.

B000002UAO|5.0|So the term \\"experimental\\" has been bantered around quite a bit by other reviewers here.  While that's true, Help! was already edging into that territory, so people shouldn't have been so surprised.  I like the Beatles' early work, but I like their more creative works just a bit better because they go outside the largely R&B cover tune box and show what innovative musicians and vocalists they were and, to this day, still are.  It's hard to argue with the fact that, while so many other artists--some less talented than others--have come and gone, the Fab Four still get heavy airplay 50 years after their arrival here.  And why not?  They changed the entire face of music and pop culture in a way that's left its indelible mark on history.<br /><br />\\"Transitional\\" project aside, I discovered the US cassette version of this album in my sister's tape case at the age of 12 and, admittedly after a few plays, fell deeply in love with it.  I knew nothing about any so-called gateway project--just that the album floored me and still does to this day.  After losing the cassette copy, I purchased the US version on vinyl at the age of 16, then discovered this (British) version about 10 years ago.  Gone were \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" and \\"It's Only Love,\\" but in their place we got the silly, but catchy \\"Drive My Car,\\" the solid and irresistibly harmonious \\"Nowhere Man\\"--a song everybody can relate to now and then--the \\"Act Naturally\\" resemblant Ringo tune \\"What Goes On\\" (Yes, I admit it's not great), and George's wonderful \\"If I Needed Someone\\" with some of the cleanest sounding guitar riffs from that time frame.<br /><br />Other than that, the tracks are the same as on the US version.  \\"Norwegian Wood\\" has a lovely melody that's been interpreted a thousand different ways, unfortunately leaving it open for a furniture store I'll not mention using it in a Ferrante-Teicher like instrumental setting.  Is this song truly an ode to pot smoking, as some have said?  WHO CARES?<br /><br />\\"You Won't See Me\\" is among the best pop songs here, featuring strong, forward vocals by Paul, excellent piano work, and great \\"Ooh-la-la-las.\\"  Too bad Anne Murray, every housewife and granny's favorite frumpy singer, decided to cover it.<br /><br />\\"Think for Yourself\\" is a rather dark George Harrison tune, and it's always sounded to me as if he personally had someone directly in mind when he composed it.  \\"Although your mind's opaque, try thinking more if just for your own sake.\\"  Those really don't seem like lyrics that qualify as rhyming \\"June\\" with \\"spoon.\\"<br /><br />I have always loved \\"The Word,\\" a huge predecessor to so much of John's later works.  True, it is of its time, but that's what also makes it so cool.  You didn't have to be a teenager back then to get the coolness of this positive song, and the descending chords in the instrumental breaks really make it big.<br /><br />\\"Michelle\\" is admittedly McCartney fluff, but there is something so terribly winsome and sentimental about it that this version is still the only one worth bothering with.<br /><br />\\"Girl\\" is dark, cynical, and a real treat since John and Paul were influenced by Greek music while on holiday when composing it.  I have always liked the epic feel and bitterness to it, contrasting with some of the more uplifting tracks on the album.<br /><br />\\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" reminds me of \\"The Night Before.\\"<br /><br />\\"In My Life\\" has to be among the most beautifully written songs of all time, especially when you consider that John penned most of the lyrics.  The sentimentality is touching without making you nauseous, and that harpsichord solo is a dignified, outstanding touch.<br /><br />\\"Wait\\" is a bud of mine's favorite song on this album, but not necessarily mine.  Again, I must agree about this one along with \\"What Goes On,\\" except I like this better.<br /><br />\\"Run for Your Life\\" is a great closer, and it seems to embody the image people always had of John as the tough guy.  Honestly,when you listen to those lyrics you have to admit you'd feel the same.  It's also easy to change the lyrics to if you're the potentially victimized female!  Then again, so much of the Beatles' catalogue is open to wide interpretation, and that's what makes their music so generation and gender friendly.<br /><br />There is something for everyone here, because this is a very well crafted pop album with very minor flaws.  People are still wearing shirts promoting the album (myself included), and it's also made the top ten fave albums list of other musicians as varied as members of Judas Priest and Patty Smyth's Scandal.  There is something elusive and magical about Rubber Soul, not just because it was so different from their previous work, but because it still managed to keep the original elements from which they sprouted alive as well.  It was a fine line of gradual change from one extreme to the other, and it's a bridge between both eras that can't be done without.  It helps tell the entire story of a history that has had many attempted imitations in fact and fiction, and has never succeeded in being duplicated.  You may love this album or you may despise it, but one thing is true:  it's too important to ignore.ics to if you're the potentially victimized female!

I stumbled blindly into the past with him and longed for similar things he longed for. I wasn't expecting the love story and feel it is the ultimate reason the decisions of the narrator make so much sense in the end. It took King 2 years to write this novel and 2 months for me to read it. I plan to reread over time. Oh, and don't forget to read the Afterwords.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|The Intel Core i7 2600k is an outstanding processor. It's extremely good for multitasking such as ripping videos and other CPU intensive tasks at the same time. For the amount of tasks load, it appears to use less electricity than previous generations of CPU. But in order to use this second-generation i processor you would have to upgrade the motherboard as well because it uses socket 1155. It's not compatible with the first generation socket 1156. Both socket 1156 and 1155 uses the same heatsink and fan configuration and fit, therefore can be reused on this new platform. This platform uses DDR3 exclusively.<br /><br />This processor is extremely good at idle power usage in it's default non-overclocked state. The motherboard that I've bought contains the Intel H67 chipset and therefore doesn't allow the multiplier to go beyond 34 therefore does not allow overclocking. This doesn't matter to me since the processor even in its stock state is extremely fast and extremely energy-efficient to boot. The reason I bought the 2600k which is essentially similar over the 2600 is because it no doubt that he came from a higher bin up at Intel's fab.<br /><br />This is what I think, the 2600k version is better and more than likely came from a higher Intel bin number lot. This put it this way, when Intel manufacture processor within a given family on a fab. Each CPU chip is fully tested at different speeds and functions. The best ones are reserved for the highest speed and the lower speed ones are place in bins lower down in order. Some of the chips that has defective sections have those sections and more turned off and configured as a different model such as ones with less cache memory. Some of those lesser chips may even have some functions permanently disabled and sold as cheaper CPUs models such as with and without Hyperthreading even though they came off the same fab.<br /><br />This model also has a better onboard graphics engine than the non-k version. This feature is not important for me since I use a separate graphics card. This CPU works like a charm and approximately three times faster than my previous one which is Intel Core2 Duo E8500 clocked at 3.2 GHz.separate graphics card.

B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I installed PLEX for Android on my Kindle Fire today, and am absolutely thrilled with the performance.  I have been using PLEX on my server and on my laptop for a few weeks now, and I love the interface and the spped at which this application works, and it works equally well on my Kindl Fire.  It is FAR superior to Windows Media Center, which takes forever to display and deliver content to both locally connected and remote clients. PLEX looks and works great, and I can't imagine going back to Media Center.  I am able to stream movies to my Kindle Fire using a 3G hotspot from a FIOS connected server with absolutely no lag time or buffering delays.  The only complaint that I have, and it's not much of a complaint, is that the metabrowser insists on renaming some of my home movies that are on the server too.  It finds known media titles that are \\"close\\" to the filenames I assigned to my home movies, and renames them.  Now a home movie on the server that I titled, \\"Christmas2\\" has been renamed \\"Guns for Christmas 2.\\"  Sort of funny, but somewhat annoying.

B004A8ZWXS|5.0|Since his films have accumulated somewhere in the neighborhood of $7.5 billion overall, and following the Oscar wins as Best Director in 1993 for SCHINDLER'S LIST, and 1998 for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, director Steven Spielberg can pretty much make any film he wants, and not worry about whether it has commercial potential or not.  Because of this, it should become second nature to sophisticated movie fans to expect the unexpected from the man.  This is the case with his epic World War I drama WAR HORSE, one of the best films of 2011.  Based on Michael Morpurgo's book of the same name, and set in England and mainland Europe during World War I, WAR HORSE stars Jeremy Irvine as a young English lad who trains a seemingly unsuited-for-farming horse that his well-meaning but doddering father (Peter Mullan), much to the chagrin of his mother (Emily Watson), picked up at an auction in their hometown of Devon.  Irvine manages to train this horse to be a solid plowing animal and also learns to ride it with sureness and dispatch...that is, until World War I breaks out, and he has to hand over the horse to the English army, which needs every able-bodied man and animal possible (this being before motor vehicles and airplanes came into being in warfare).  The rest of the film depicts this war horse's journeys throughout war-torn France, until Irvine is finally reunited with his long-lost companion after he has become an enlisted English soldier and almost been killed in a gas attack during some intense trench warfare.   It is very tempting to think that Spielberg took on this project because it involved the interaction of animals with humans, but that would have been extremely obvious (not to mention dubious and manipulative as well).  Anyone who knows anything about Spielberg's filmic output, however, knows that so many of his films have tended to be set in the past, like the World War II settings of SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; the America of the 1830s for the 1997 film AMISTAD; and the America of the 1960s for 2002's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.  In WAR HORSE, Spielberg goes back close to a full century to World War I, which was supposed to be the War To End All Wars; and while what he depicts in the situations involving either Irvine, the horse itself, or both of them is not as graphic or heartbreaking as what he showed in SCHINDLER'S LIST or PRIVATE RYAN, he is still true to the historical fact of the earlier war, with its depiction of cavalry troops, trenches, and the first-ever use of chemical weaponry in war, where thousands of troops on either side were killed or burned by it.  There are unavoidable, albeit unintentional, references in WAR HORSE to other past films that are among the director's favorites, such as the depiction of Irvine's English homestead, reminiscent of John Ford's 1952 classic THE QUIET MAN and Stanley Kubrick's 1975 18th century period piece BARRY LYNDON; and the scenes of World War I echo Kubrick's 1957 classic PATHS OF GLORY (the scenes in the trenches), and Lewis Milestone's 1930 World War I epic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT.  But Spielberg is a good enough director to let those references slip in via the storyline itself and not by his direction, which is as good as anything he has done throughout his career.  More than just a depiction of war, family, and human/animal interaction, WAR HORSE is, at its heart, clearly a human drama of the first order, a triumph of the human spirit, in which humanity's best comes out to balance off its worst traits.  John Williams' music score, with its combination of British and Irish influences, is one of his best as well; and the largely unknown English cast (excepting Watson) is excellent as well.  WAR HORSE can, in the final analysis, be counted as yet one more feather in the cap for Spielberg and his cinematic canon.

B004H1V5RU|2.0|Our daughter received this as a Christmas present and enjoyed working it for the short period that it wasn't broken.  After just a couple hours of use, one of the blue plastic parts broke off inside. This must have been improperly molded or stressed during assembly, because the ball had never been dropped or shaken before this part broke.  The broken part makes it impossible to complete the puzzle and it even gets in the way when trying to work through other sections.  We are in the process of trying to return it....

B0018QOIXU|5.0|WHAT CAN WE SAY ? ITS ADELE AT HER BEST AGAIN AND AGAIN !!!!!  I LOVE THIS CD AND HAVE PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Umm, what's to complain about?  The cinematography and sound are absolutely marvelous.  There were a couple shots that I didn't like though.  The whole concert is shown in 24p.  However, there might be one or two shots where 60i is interweaved.  I loved the B-roll shots as I thought they captured the environment and helped bring you into the concert.  There were also some slow motion shots.  I thought they could have chosen better shots to be slow motion, but the choices were still very cool.  Yeah, there are some grainy shots, but this is okay.  Though the casing doesn't indicate you can hear DTS-HD MA, the disc indeed does have a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track and Dolby Digital 2.0 track.  DTS plays by default for my player as I have a receiver capable of playing this sound format.  The extras on the Blu-ray seem to be mostly shot in 60 frames per second, but some in 24p and some slo-mo.  As for Adele, I have not one complaint - she's outstanding.  She does have a bit of a potty mouth though when she lets go and has fun, but just be advised of this.  There were just a couple things I didn't like about the whole Blu-ray, but other then that, the camera work, cinematography, sound, and obviously Adele make for a great concert experience.  I highly recommend the Blu-ray or DVD.

B0011ZVVOM|5.0|Two people! Untouchable talent! Neither seems to be trying to reinvent the wheel, but they have re-packed the bearings and put some new steel-belted rubber on an old wheel and put in motion on on a newly paved highway going somewhere badazz. If you love deep gritty blues, psychodelic rock, and those sounds bounced off concrete walls and feet of hard black earth, pick up any of these albums, sit back, and enjoy the ride. Out of over 50 songs in my Black Keys collection, I'll take or leave about 5 from my daily playlist, but I wont delete them from the collection...
0553573403|3.0|Before I launch into the reasons I will not be reading the rest of the series, let me say that I believe George R.R. Martin to be a masterful storyteller. This is the only book of his that I have read as yet, however.  Martin weaves a tale so gripping you feel that you are a character in the story. And he fashions characters as real as any person you actually know. The twists and turns hook you and keep you wanting more.<br />Unfortunately, I will not be reading on to find out what becomes of the characters I have grown to admire, despise or pity.  I cannot stomach one more description of the rape, degredation or denigration of the female characters in Martin's writing. The word \\"whore\\" is used too many times to count. Yes, yes, we get it: the men in this world saw lowborn women as nothing more than servants or sluts to satisfy their needs. Only women who are lucky enough to marry into the right family are treated with any kind of respect- respect that vanishes instantly with the precarious positions of power their husbands hold. Martin, however, beats the point to death.<br />Even more disturbing is the graphic description of women being raped/sodomized or gang-raped several times in the story. One mention (in less detail)of this vile practice among the Dothraki people would have sufficed, but I guess the author felt it necessary to creep us out with many more. And the description of the seduction of a 13 year-old Daenerys, by a grown man, left me feeling dirty and guilty for reading on. Yes, they married young in this world, we get it.<br />As if that was not bad enough, of the main female characters, there is only one that I could admire: Arya, the nine year-old daughter of Eddard Stark.  She is the only character who was intelligent as well as strong and independent minded. Alas, Martin seems to imply that beauty is incompatible with brains and virtue by describing her as \\"horse-faced\\" by other characters. The others may have beauty, but lack virtue or are foolish and weak, because of their womanly passions. Cersei Lannister, the queen, is lovely but a cold-blooded, cunning witch. Sansa, the twelve year old daughter of Eddard Stark, is pretty, sickenly well-bred, but lacking in sense and loyalty.  Daenerys is abused and brainwashed in turn by her brother, then Dothraki culture. Catelyn Stark, Eddard's wife, also beautiful but tragically selfish to her family's ruin. Lysa Arryn, Catelyn's sister, is portrayed as half-mad and revoltingly doting over her sickly son. Women servants and common peasants are repeatedly, and so contemptuously described that it makes you want to scream, \\"Yeah, we got that a long time ago: women are sluts and only fit to do a man's bidding. can we move on already!?\\"<br />This is in contrast to the male characters who also have flaws, but are basically excused by their life experiences and particular upbringing. We can find many males to empathize with and/or admire: the honorable, but too trusting Eddard Stark; his resolute and skilled bastard son, Jon Snow; young Robb Stark, brave and thoughtful; the staunch and loyal men in the Tully family and other families pledged to the Starks; the loyal and valiant knights and men of the Kingsguard; even Khal Drogo of the bloodthirsty Dothrakis and the scheming Imp, Tyrion Lannister.<br />I hope to find another author in this genre, or even another book by Martin that does not offend the whole female gender the way this book did., because of their womanly passions.

B0044XV3QY|1.0|I was looking for 3D movies to give to a friend who had just bought a new 3D TV.  I searched in \\"Movies & TV\\" entering the search text \\"3D\\".  I was extremely happy when I saw AVATAR in the list.  When it arrived and we started to watch it we found this is NOT 3D.  Very disappointed in the deceptive marketing of Amazon.com but let's face it, the bottom line is the paramount issue.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|A highly amusing collection of tales, written in a fast-paced, factual style which only kings of literature can achieve. I was enthralled by its integrity and the terrific plots of the stories; as well as the unique characters! A fantastic read.

B000127LW2|4.0|If not for Paramount's dogged insistence on over-pricing Voyager (& all its other Star Trek series DVD sets years after their release), I think more people would have a chance to get to know this solid & entertaining series. And this applies to US issues of these DVD sets. Amazon UK sells Voyager sets for under $20; even with shipping, that's a fraction of the cost here. True, there were a few episodes that were really, really dreadful. (Think Janeway & Tom Paris turning into giant lizards and mating. I kid you not.) But on the whole, this series depicted a hardy band of space refugees far from home, just trying to make it day by day as they trekked laboriously from one end of the galaxy to the other. This really is Star TREK. That's what made Voyager such a refreshing change from the normal & sometimes boring milleu of Klingons & Cardassians & Romulans & Vulcans & and Federation political correctness & such. With Voyager, pretty much anything was possible. The crew was admittedly plain vanilla for the most part, but they got the job done. Two characters in particular have to be near the top of anyone's Trek list--the Doctor & Seven of Nine (after season 3). Those two, just brilliant creations. If you've never dipped into Voyager, try to rent Season 1 or stream it. Or do like I did, and patiently wait for a reasonable price. It does happen.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very good version of the game. Love the touchscreen version. Easy to use on the kindle fire :) Plus you can't beat the fact that it is a free app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|People say you can't play all 101 games at first, which is true, but it isn't hard to win the first 9 games that are unlocked. its really stupid for y'all to say this game is bad because your to lazy to win the first games. if you want the expensive games right off the bat, then buy coins or download one of the free apps to gain coins. I mean really... guys... its a great game, just give it some time

B005VMVUAQ|1.0|What starts out as a pretty standard clone of umpteen other similar home invasion movies, quickly becomes a ridiculous series of supposedly 'clever' plot twists. They aren't clever, but just silly and the movie quickly spirals into utter nonsense.
B0046W1692|1.0|Fans wait 5 years for this, after the incredibly disappointing effort and 4-year wait for \\"Amar es combatir\\" and what do we get?  All duds except for one song.  I've listened to all of Mana's material and a close listening to it reveals their best albums revolve around some kind of social/societal commentary.  (Some songs are just plain fun, but those are not in the majority.)  This is why their best albums are considered to be \\"Cuando los ángeles lloran,\\" \\"Sueños líquidos\\" and \\"Revolución de amor.\\"  I could play nearly all the songs through on each of those albums without wanting to skip maybe but one song or two; on \\"Revolución de amor,\\" I could play all the songs and enjoy them.    To be fair, we have to remember that Maná's been around since the early 80s, so it has changed members and musical style quite a bit over that time:  some changes have been for the better, with others for the worst.  To be honest, \\"Amar es combatir\\" marked a notable departure from Maná's sound and musical approach--AND the song quality seriously declined as well:  we go from nearly a flawless album in \\"Revolución de amor\\" to only 3 hits/good songs on \\"Amar es combatir.\\"  Detail-oriented fans like myself notice Maná always recycled some themes and lyrics from previous albums (\\"Ojalá pudiera borrarte\\" on \\"Amar es combatir\\" is basically \\"Vivir sin aire\\" with a few changes)--but usually with significant changes that made those songs different enough to be new hits.  Once we hit \\"Amar...,\\" we've waited another 4 years since \\"Revolución...\\" and...basically a dud album not worth buying it its entirety.  We expect \\"Drama y luz\\" after 4 and get another year delay (from the original announced date on their blog) tacked on.  Now the only song upon hearing such the pathetic effort of this album that could best exemplify the group is \\"¡Estamos agotados!\\"  Only one song on this effort truly stands out--\\"Amor clandestino\\"--and yet it's a perfect example of a recycled song with recycled lyrics (akin to \\"Manda una señal\\" melded with \\"Mariposa traicionera\\").  It's true Vallín hasn't had the guitar input on this and the last album as he did on \\"Revolución de amor,\\" which was a smashing success on so many levels.  The first fix is to get Sergio re-involved to the point he's back to driving a significant part of each song.  The other fix--and the only possibility to save an obviously lyrically-exhausted band--is for them to seriously reexamine what they did that was great with hits and music, then find some way to recapture it.  Eight years of musical flirtations with other musical influences hasn't come off like it should have and has been at fan's expense.  It's been obvious since before \\"Revolución de amor\\" that the group was tired and that's why it took off 4 years, so there's more time for them to spend with their family.  Sadly, they've lost something and need to find a way to get it back, as it's clear their hearts haven't been fully committed to the music nor to its fans by shorting their composing and recording efforts.

B005F9CPG8|5.0|Nice, but in order to fully appreciate the Beatles one needs to purchase the mono box set. I never liked mono, but this is how the Beatles recorded their music. Day Tripper is amazing in mono. The song absolutely rocks in mono. Plus you get proper mixes besides bass and drums in the middle. No left right non sense. We Can Work Out and Paperback writer same thing. Listen to rain in mono and it will blow your mind. Oasis really did copy them. Also, I am the Walrus is on another planet in mono. Only a few songs are better in stereo. It really is a shame.

B005V1WZ10|1.0|Boy am I glad I saw the original Korn lineup a few years back. They became a total joke. Losing two members and now this. I didn't buy their last two albums, but I've heard them. Maybe J Davis needs the money? Whats the point of pressing forward when you almost lose half your band? Plus, their last few albums have been pathetic. Their one good album without Brian was 2005. Pack it in folks.

If you give me the option I'd rather have the actual disc.  It was shipped quickly and the disc played perfectly in the car.  Adele truly has an amazing voice and there is not a bad song on the album.  This was a great deal at $9.99.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|This isn't a digital copy and is not at all usable in iTunes.  You can't even buy this movie on iTunes, so this is the studio messing with the consumer but not letting you know it in advance.  All the other movies have been available to be used in iTunes and on iTunes devices *except* this one.  The packaging is a lie. I wish I could get a refund and just buy the movie alone.  Don't waste your money.
B000UX6THK|4.0|Nice packaging. Our family gets a kick out of these! Overall the quality of the picture is good at best. Our discs have some imperfections that \\"freeze\\" on occasion. Overall happy though.
B000JML90Y|2.0|All these reviews of this book saying it is \\"absolutely wonderful, must read, cornerstone\\" - it is like a bunch of porn addicts saying playboy is fantastic.  This is entirely based on your world view, nothing more.  If you have been brought up to believe in evolution as truth, you will love this book.  If you have brought up to believe in creation as truth, this is a short-sighted insult to your religious beliefs.  For the evolutionists who hold Darwin in high regard, this is a great read, confirming what you already have been lead to believe to be true.  Take a step back and pay attention to what Darwin says near the end that he even questions his own conclusions based on actual science, not conjecture.  The actual book content is very good for the time in which it was written and what it portrays as his opinions based on his very limited science. It's too bad the masses flock to this type of literature, instead of drawing conclusions based on actual science, rather than evolutionary religious beliefs and 150 year old false conjecture.
B005XN0SGU|2.0|Perfect Viewer does what you would expect a comic viewer to do. I like that unlike comicat two page spreads are placed on a single page but honestly thats how one would expect any like app to work. Bookmarks are nice and book shelving is easy. The main problem is the price, this is a free app elsewhere but the developer is charging 3 bucks on the amazon marketplace just because kindle fire users dont have a free alternative. Its even worse when you consider the app was free on this marketplace until the fire was released. Unethical business practices mean I can't bring myself to rate this app any higher than this.
1400079144|1.0|It seemed like a good idea at the time:  a long road trip, an intricate Dan Brown plot.  But no.  This book did not live up to my expectations which really weren't that high to begin -- I don't expect Dickens or Shakespeare from DB but I did expect a decently plotted and at least minimally edited story.  Instead, I got a painfully repetitive, unimaginative, loudly foreshadowed plot. Did anyone reading (or listening) really not know by the end of the first chapter just where the last plot point would be unveiled?  And how many times must one be told of that (apparently endless!) last moment in drowning when one breathes in the water?  Apparently, per DB, that answer is three, in case we didn't catch it either of the first two times.  And then there are the interminable lists:  of the many cultures and religions that have the \\"Word,\\" or the practice, and and and ....  All of which is more horrible on CD, for the failure of the equivalent of being able to quickly scan and skip pages.  We would have skipped fully 1/4 of the book, had we read rather than heard it, simply to avoid repetition or, worse, the copied-from-Wikipedia expositions of obscure, irrelevant points.  (That l-o-n-g story about the scale to measure the weight of one's soul ... !)  If you must experience this (against most recommendations), at least do it by book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is an addictive game that you will play until you die!!!!!!! you can never get enough of the crazy catapult action.
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|It is always hard for a sequal to outdue the original.  And while this was no exception, I still think it was a pretty good movie.  I can see why some people gave a less than fair rating for what they deemed inappropriate content for a G rated movie, but as stated in another review, the movie portrayed more of a James Bond like theme.  There are parts where a car is \\"tortured\\" and then \\"killed\\" but I think it was done in a tasteful way - my kids didn't seem to think anything of it and I think that it is a thing that only the adults will really understand.  The movie still has a few good morals to be learned about friendship and being who you are and not what people want you to be.  Mater of course has his usual humor and funny quirps but also learns some things about himself, as the movie is centered more around Mater than Lightning McQueen.  Overall I give it 4 stars for the good morals in the story as well as a good plot and story line.  Would have liked to give it a 5 but it just didn't compare to the original Cars movie.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I purchased this collection as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. We both love the Harry Potter films, and, when I saw that the entire collection was available on Blu-Ray, I simply had to make it a gift!  While the quality is excellent, and you do receive some special features with this collection, the only missing component would be an upgrade in packaging for the complete collection. Each disc comes separately packaged, and then all of the discs are gathered into one large cardboard (?) sleeve. While that has nothing to do with the quality of the item, it does matter to those of us with a concern for aesthetics, and the appeal that can be brought when purchasing an entire collection instead of purchasing each film separately.    The films are an excellent buy, and definitely worth the purchase.
0446573019|5.0|I again purchased this book as a Christmas Present. They love it and we will continue to order from Amazon.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|From all the negative reviews before even seeing the movie, I honestly thought I was going to hate this. I wouldn't say that I am in love with this movie but I did enjoy myself. My fiance loves Green Lantern and he loved this movie so much he put it on his Christmas list. The effects are a little hokey but considering the story, I would say give it a chance.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|Its starts a bit slow & then non stop action. It was ok for the money but this type of movie needs a better villain. This is a great movie for the younger crowd but I need a reason for the hero and I dont believe the reason was clear.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|JUST AWESOME. Great way to see how your neighbors networks may interfere with yours so you can change channels. Helps out a great a great deal. Easy to see and looks beautiful on the Kindle Fire

B002BU0DPE|1.0|The first thing I noticed about these headphones was pronounced and ever-present \\"hiss\\". This sound is present regardless what the headset is connected to (PC/PS3/360), how the in-line amplifier is adjusted, up/down on/off or whether or not there is audio playing. A quick look around the web confirmed that this is a VERY common problem which, according to Turtle Beach is likely due to a \\"defective chat interface\\".  I'm not taking my chances, given the number of people experiencing or myriad other problems, I have no reason to believe that a replacement will be any better. This kind of basic quality control question should be a non-issue for something that costs $65-80.  Very disappointed, the PX21 is going back immediately.   I got a [[ASIN:B000PCCLPU Sony DRBT50 Stereo Bluetooth Headset]] which look, feel and sound great. The DRBT50 should meet my needs for a quality headset and mic for the PC/PS3. The 360 will have to wait.
B005OK722U|3.0|I saw this on Fios on demand and it blatantly gave away the main twist 'not that it wasn't expected' but to have it written in the program description was messy.<br />This movie had weak kills and the gambling aspect of the plot was not shown much at all.<br />Just when I started to get into the movie I looked at the time and there was only 18 minutes left.Time management wasn't handled well at all.The effects were very average and for a Hostel film there were very few.<br />I will say that those last 18 minutes were really really good which just made me think why couldn't they have put more effort into the rest of the movie?<br />All in all I give it 2 and a half stars for the first hour and 4 stars for the last 30 minutes.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this application is great on the kindle fire, it is works very well for local areas, good map, good extended forcast.

B004UA8D1O|2.0|movie was decent for a sci-fi. You're better off watching it in regular DVD or blu-ray. There weren't too many special effects to warrant the purchase for the 3D version. Wish I had known that before paying the extra cost for it. Oh well...
B0055SWM08|5.0|choice of the dragon was great, but this is even better in my opinion. it is so addictive, and it will take hours of fun to get every level perfect.
B004EPZ07A|4.0|Movie was great and the price was definitely worth the purchase! I wasn't sure what the Movie-Only Edition meant but it worked out in the end since it contained the entire movie and didn't require the added cost of paying for whatever other version is out there. After all, I just wanted to see the movie and no special features or previews, etc.
B00061RZBA|1.0|Perhaps I should have known, but when purchasing the Mulan 2-disc set, I didn't notice that it was 'Region 2' and had no knowledge that this meant that it would not play on American DVD players.  This label didn't show up on the original listing - it wasn't until the second screen that it said it, and there was no warning that I found that described what 'Region 2' meant.    My daughter was disappointed on Christmas morning.
B0025KVLTW|1.0|Strawberry fields and Penny Lane were both written for Sgt. Pepper's and Phil Spektor left them off and later recalled that omission as being one of his greatest mistakes he ever made. (barring that murder trial thing, eek)  Gave the 1 star to even out the ratings - of course its better than that but no way it deserves 450 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 stars. (usually albums with more reviews on Amazon are better bets to buy)  The Beatle fanboys on Amazon hit the 5 star wayyyy to much. It's great Pepper's remains, but fataley flawed by the Side A fillers. Try a solid three stars and you've rated this one right.  Easiest to just mention the songs -- >  Side A: Starts great, ends weird and filled with a jelly core of bad, yes bad Beatle, fillers.  (4 Stars) Magical Mystery Tour - one of the most rocking Beatles songs ever made. It's a morning cranker.  (2 Stars) Fool on the Hill a McCartney song about a guru named Maraarishi is ok but meanders like Paul was drunk when he wrote it (he actually wrote it sober at his dads house in England).   (3 Stars) Flying is like something you'd find filling time off a Pink Floyd album - its actually a quite interesting instrumental for the way its put together, but feels \\"filler.\\"   (0 Stars) Blue Jay Way - this is the only song by the Beatles that I've ever skipped when listening to the music. Yes, its that bad.  (1 Star) Your Mother Should Know - again, another song written as if Paul was drunk.  (4 Stars) I Am The Walrus - very good tune that John wrote piecing together everything from nursery rhymes to belittling Hare Krisna. Lennon wrote it just to screw with all the people analyzing their lyrics.   ____________________  Side B: This stands alongside Sgt. Peppers, the White Album or Rubber Soul as one of the finest halves ever written:  (5 Stars) Hello Goodbye - Paul at his best - the confusion of love in snazzy melodied package. Classic.  (5 Stars) Strawberry Fields Forever - often cited as one of the 10 Beatles songs.Why? It's Lennon pouring out his childhood for all to see. Strawberry fields was a school where he group up.   (5 Stars) Penny Lane - Clearly a song that should have been on Sgt. Peppers along with Lovely Rita and When I'm Sixty Four. One of Paul's best.  (4 Stars) Baby You're a Rich Man - Another song with incredible lyrics - as if it was ripped right off Rubber Soul. Answer ridiculous press questions by saying just be yourself, they are asked.. 'what will you sing next', and next they sing...  (5 Stars) All You Need is Love - John delivers the grand message and Paul's humor converts its to a jolly sing-a-long. \\"It can be summed in two great lines: Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time. Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be. It's easy... All you need is love.\\"  Wanna buy Beatles? Buy Revolver, Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper's, or the White Album - they are mind blowers. This is the greatest group passing time before they slammed home the singles that comprised Hey Jude and then Abbey Road. Get a hits album that has the second side stuff of MMT plus the singles of the unavailable Hey Jude --- such as Past Masters Volume 1.  Btw, some of the younger folks might wonder why someone would break a CD into album halves (particularly since its not a straight-flowing concept album). At about 23 minutes per side - vinyl albums had the song order, song time length, and even song messages arranged by the artists or their producers to produce a particular impact with the listener. Ponder \\"A Day In the Life\\" put on Side A of Sgt. Pepper's? Ack! Perhaps the Fab 4 decided here to toss out a crap side-A - the quality difference is huge. As for progress, CDs were later great by allowing flow-through - especially on concept albums, it seems a pity to me that MP3s have all but killed the album concept and converted radio and our ipods into fast-food 3-minute single machines.

B005IZLPMY|2.0|This was another blockbuster film that I came to with high hopes, only to end up disappointed. As usual, the problems with this film start with the script, which is limp and suffers from a poor third act, but the director has to take a lot of the blame as well. Never using subtlety when a sledgehammer will do, never allowing any character relationships to develop when a nonsensical action scene could be squeezed in, this film is a bit of a mess.  It's not without merit, but is far too stylised - yes, we're in \\"comic book land\\", but the events that unfold here do not occur in a parallel universe, they specifically refer to real-life events such as the war and the rise of Nazi Germany. Instead of allowing any vaguely reasonable nods to historical accuracy and then dropping the fantasy elements on top of that to make a nicely cohesive world, as a more intelligent director would have done, Joe Johnston has clearly gone through the production drawings for sets, props, clothing etc. that his designers have come up with, has looked through them for the most outlandish, silly thing he can find and has shrieked \\"THAT ONE!!\\" when he's found it. Headlights on Nazi officers' cars, for instance - instead of being vaguely useful beams to cast light into the foggy darkness, we've got what are clearly LEDs in a slit formation, obviously designed to look like menacing eyes. Or when a car crashes through the wall of a church, the scene is suddenly and inexplicably lit by four-lamp spotlights on tripods which have been conveniently placed right outside the church in order to light the villain to maximum effect.  The film's also peppered with stupid, irritating logical flaws and plot holes. When the fantasy elements of a film like this fit in nicely with the reality of the time in which it's set, or if a fantasy film creates its own logically consistent world (even if that world is completely invented) then a viewer can readily suspend disbelief; when a film throws all sense to the winds merely in order to look flash or to attempt to raise a wry smile, it fails.
B00005JPFH|3.0|It's good but i feel like it was the worst in the series. Spiderman 2 was the best and the first spiderman was far better than this movie. Spiderman 3 is worth getting though if you do have 1 and 2. But if you don't have the first 2 yet then get those before considering this one.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|This is a very nice case and it fits the white iPhone 4 very tightly and securely. I love the fact that it is clear, showing off the white back of my iPhone. I've had this case for about 6 months now and I am noticing a small yellowish spot beginning to form, so I hope it doesn't spread/grow too quickly. Other than that, I have no complaints and really like the case. You might want to check out the smoke TPU case that AmazonBasics also makes, if the yellow tint concerns you.

B006C45MRE|4.0|Not having read anything about it, I had assumed that this would be a comedic affair.  The flippant title does seem to suggest that.  When it began seriously I thought \\"well, the makers are for sure not going to be able to resist gags.\\"  I was pleased that they played it completely straight.  And when you think about it, the premise is completely plausible.  Would visitors or invaders who were untold hundreds or thousands of years ahead of us be any less likely to arrive in the the 1800's than in the 1900's or 2000's?  Worth the rental, in my opinion.

B001V7UXG2|5.0|This series is such a favorite of my family that it has earned a nick name: Woody Booster. If you have not seen it, just buy it. You'll love it.  Noting several complaints about the video transfer, however, here's a tip: Find out if your DVD/BlU RAY player can play disks in the British format (Many can -- I think its Region 2 or PAL or some such thing) and if the answer is 'yes', then go to the UK Amazon site and buy it there. Don't worry about British Pounds and Dollars, they will take care of all of that for you and delivery works just fine. Why do this? The screen resolution of the British DVD is as close to perfect as you will ever get. Almost BLU RAY quality. There is no need to settle for anything less.

B005URRCUY|5.0|I must be a freak of nature because I've been following the Keys for years and I've enjoyed every album without exception.  People who call themselves purists and are missing the \\"old\\" sound are just confused about what makes these guys so great.  Ever developing and stretching what's possible.  Each album is it's own life, don't judge one album by another. That's like a parent judging one kid by another; just wrong.  If you want a bunch of \\"thickfreakness\\" or \\"rubber factory\\" then you shouldn't have ever bought another keys album after those ones.  Plain and simple.  This album is as solid as any other, take it for what it is; not for what it isn't.
0440244412|3.0|It's impossible to describe this story in a review...mostley because it doesn't make much sense. If you want to read a story you will get lost in about evil fae taking over the world & a girl who has to find herself before she can save the world then this is for you. There is a touch of romance in it but not enough for my enjoyment. All in all it was a great series but I had to give the last book three stars BECAUSE:  the self refecting, questions, fact repeating and just plain fliller was 80% of the book!! I had to literally skip pages at a time of just nonsense that had nothing to do with the story. I think the author likes to rattle on about feelings and that just drove me nuts. BUT it was a good story with a lot of twist & turns that made you think. But do not expect the ending of the third book to give you many answers. I felt let down at the end, If this story line was put in another authors hands and made into 3 books not 5, it would have been much much better.

0307959856|5.0|The concept for this book is genius.  The execution of the work is part homage, part satire.  The story is repetitive--but then so is Austen.  The narrative is more \\"tell\\" than \\"show,\\" but so is Austen.  James got this one almost pitch perfect.
1451648537|4.0|This is a book that anyone should be able to enjoy, but if you're an entrepreneur (or an aspiring entrepreneur) you will get more out of it than probably any other book that's come out in recent years.  Isaacson's thorough study of Jobs' life reminds us of one of life's most important lessons - never settle...keep dreaming...and work hard.   Although Jobs had his flaws, he embraced these principles fully and achieved a level of greatness attained by very few. We can learn a lot from his story.

B005TQAI6G|2.0|I have seen at the same time both Lady Gaga's Monster Ball and this Femme Fatale. Britney's performance and intensity looks so poor when compared with Lady Gaga. She should play live, and not use recorded voice. When she dances it feels like a robot she should put more emotion. All in all, the songs are good, but I can't find the spirit of this show.

B004SIP6C2|5.0|I love this movie!  The only form I had it in was video tape.  So happy to get it on DVD!  The story is about an orphanage and the children who live there and the staff who work there.  A mother-to-be could go there for one of two reasons: to deliver her baby and give it to the orphanage or she could have an abortion.  The doctor there performs both procedures.  The doctor has an assistant who was a former orphan of the facility, who basically grew up there.  He was fully trained and experienced to deliver babies or perform abortions, but was not a graduated physician with a degree.  The movie is mostly about his life (Toby Macguire).  The doctor thinks he is the best choice to take over the practice there, but instead he chooses to leave the facility to make a living on his own.  He ends up returning to the orphanage when he hears that the doctor has died.  It is a really sweet story.  One of my favorite movies.

0439023521|5.0|I initially thought this was the new \\"twilight saga craze\\" happening again. It's not- I read all three books within one week, and that's including having them be shipped from Amazon. This is the type of book that you open the book and 4 hours pass without you realizing it. There is still the romantic love interest with the classic \\"girl stuck between two guys\\" (like Twilight) but it's not the main focus of the novels at all. The way I describe this book to my friends is that it's a futuristic version of Gladiator games. That being said, I don't know if I'd recommend this book to kids until their a bit older. Overall, I can't recommend this book enough. Its a must read!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great to spend some time while waiting for an appointment and not miss a beat with the saving feature. Recommend.
0812550706|5.0|I must admit that I was a bit skeptical reading a sci-fi book published in the 80s. I figured it would be dated and show it's age which would make it less enjoyable. I am thankful to say that I was really an amazing story from beginning to end. It wasn't heavy on the sci-fi qualities as much as the psychology behind Ender, which I found to be intriguing and wonderfully done. I can tell why Card won so many awards for it. It's a well written book that tells a great story. I'm excited for the movie that is supposed to come out in 2013 so see what they come up with...!
B004A8ZWXS|5.0|Loved this movie from beginning to end. Old fashioned cinematic storytelling is at work here so dont see this movie if you are anticipating Matrix , Die Hard or any recent Nicholas Cage action flicks. About fifteen minutes into the film I said to myself thank you lord for giving us filmmakers like S. S. who know how to tell great stories on celluoid. This is why I go to the movies in the first place. War Horse is a winner all the way to the finsih line. No need for a full review just remember if you love old style old school film making like John Ford and Frank Capra then get in line. If not then you will be bored. Alot of sentimental, heart tugging moments in this one and I loved it.
B00004RF8J|5.0|good movie and an exellant price the movie arrived before christmas it was a shock to my wife when she saw it. she loves this movie.and the service of amazon is the best that i have ever delth with
B0057R5XRG|5.0|first i will say all 3 movies brings back alot of memories when i was younger, i always loved these movies, i been seeing and hearing people bad mouthing the bluray transfer of all 3 movies, they say the 1st one was horrible, then the 2nd was alittle better then the 3rd was even alittle more better, well for somebody that has a 55\\" led lcd tv with audioquest cables and a ps3, i couldnt beleave how clear and crisp all 3 movies where on my tv, it lookd like it was a brand new movie that just came out, even in dark scenes it was super clear and had no grainness once so ever, so i will say the transfer is 1000% better overall and they did an amazing job with the 7.1, its like watching an all new movie bc you are heariung things you never did before, i really hate when people bad mouth a bluray or product when ever time it seems like its there tvs,bluray players or even have the settings wrong, i would recommend this set to everybody who loves the jurassic park movies and for all that bad mouth it, they should really check there equipment before saying its a horrible transfer because thats so far from the truth,
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie was amazing and if you have not seen it I would recommend that you buy it anyway. This movie was definitely the best movie produced this year. I would rate this movie 10 stars of out 5.

1451627289|4.0|I had high hopes for this book. It was one of the few e-books that I purchased this year that was over $5 - because he is one of my favorite authors and I thought it would've been worth the money.   The book is good but not great. I agree with some other reviewers. The middle lagged and I found myself reading the same details over and over again. Fast forward to the ending, I was once again absorbed into the story. A little editing and cutting out some of the middle and this book would be a 5 star hit.

B003Y5H5HO|2.0|Geeze.  This review is based solely on the movie.  I did not see the apparent prior version or read the books, but I did not expect this.  Sex -- no problem.  But, explicit sodomy/rape, forced oral sex, torture, animal decapitation, photos of murdered and tortured women and lesbian sex -- I could have done without.  The screams in the sodomy/rape scene were heart-breaking and sickening -- certainly not \\"entertainment\\" by the wildest stretch of the word.  I personally do not understand why there were so many positive reviews on this film.<br /><br />My son and I both enjoy Daniel Craig as an actor, and thought the promo looked good. I was surprised he accepted this role.  The movie was 2 hours long or more.  The first 3/4 was very slow.  The last 1/4 was fast-moving and interesting, and saved the film from death.<br /><br />The movie begins with a winter scene in Sweden.  Mikhail (Daniel Craig) loses his savings in a court battle over \\"inaccurate reporting\\" as a magazine journalist.  He reported a story without being able to prove it.  Meanwhile, a separate side story gets our attention about an unconventional young girl trying to survive.  She is living off a trust fund and is an exceptional part-time independent investigator. Watching the two stories side-by-side for some time, you wonder how they will eventually come together.  Although Rooney Mara gives an outstanding performance as Lisbeth Salander, the troubled young girl, in my opinion, her abilities are wasted in the violent storyline of this movie.<br /><br />Veteran actor Christopher Plummer requests Craig come to his mansion on the Island in or around Hedestad, where he offers Craig a nice sum to write his memoirs.  (According to the internet, Hedestad is a ficticious place, but if you happen to be traveling to Stockholm, the Stockholm City Museum is currently offering a guided tour that visits real locations that the book mentions.) What Plummer is really asking is for Craig to investigate the murder of 16-year old family-member Harriet, killed many years ago.  Her body was never found.  The Island is all owned by members of the same family, many of which who do not speak to each other.  Craig moves into the guest house on the property and begins to investigate.<br /><br />With the price of movies today, don't waste your money on this flick.  I see that some folks think it was brilliant.  Needless to say, I did not like the overall movie and I offer you my humble opinion as well, and why, so that you can make an educated choice of whether or not you want to see it.  If they had left out the behaviors mentioned above, I would have still only rated it an overall 3 because it was interesting but much of it was very slow.  No, I will not watch it again and I will not buy the video.  I hope you do not take your young children with you if you choose to go to see this movie.Harriet, killed many years ago.

B001E75QH0|5.0|I bought this set for my younger son for his birthday but decided to wait and give it to him for Christmas. After unwrapping all his gifts he picked up his DVD set and told me this was his favorite present! All the movies in one box set for a great price and it has a bonus CD as well!
B000AQJPQE|1.0|I bought this for my 4 yr old son for Christmas.  It was so cool when we first hung it up and turned it on.  THEN, after only turning it on 4 times the motor stopped working all together.  We bought new batteries and even tried our rechargeable batteries several times...nothing.  My son then turns to me and says..\\"Mommy, why did Santa bring me a broken toy\\"?  He was so sad and I felt very bad for him.  Had I known this thing would have been junk I would never have bought it.  I bought it from Fleet Farm who only carries toys once a year so they didn't even have any left to replace it with.  Now I'm afraid to buy him the same one somewhere else.  I told him I had to mail it back to the North Pole to be fixed, but thinking of buying something without a motor now.
0307959856|1.0|If you're a fan of Jane Austen and P.D. James, Death Comes to Pemberly will disappoint.  It has neither Jane Austen's wit nor P.D. James's suspense or character development.  There is too much rehashing of the Pride and Prejudice plot, which is surely not needed for those who would be drawn to this book, and, in general, too much \\"reader feeder.\\"  Parts of the book read like a treatise on 19th century legal procedure.  Too much narrative and uninteresting detail and too little action.  Dialog is sparse and wooden and our favorite characters - Darcy and Elizabeth - hardly have any scenes together and none of the chemistry or electricity of Austen's original.

1594202710|4.0|On China is a must read for those trying to explain China in the late twentieth century and predict the likely path a modernizing China will take economically, socially and in its relations with the US.  Kissinger has met, corresponded with, negotiated against and influenced each major Chinese leader since the first meeting brokered by Kissinger between Nixon and Mao in 1972.  His realist perspectives simplify the great events of his time -- the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Tiananmen and China's economic liberalization -- in order to provide a high level perspective on the past, present and future.  However, On China falls short in three ways -- 1) He minimizes the significant abuses and mistakes of the country and of many of its leaders (living and dead), 2) his lens is so US centric that it fails to delve even superficially into the perspective of other important nations (e.g. Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, India) on the evolution of China and 3) so many of the major forks in the road for China feel \\"deterministic\\" -- there was only one way for affairs to turn out, and there were not any good options other than the one Kissinger chose.  The first half of the book is context setting --  building on an analogy of Wei Qi, an ancient Chinese board game that emphasises strategic encirclement and how it differs from Western military strategy, which stresses \\"concentration on the decisive point\\" and \\"total victory\\" (this is never squared with \\"the balance of power\\" element of Western diplomacy).  While the importance and pride Chinese leaders and people feel towards their cultural heritage is important, Kissinger unnecessarily minimizes  the relevance and longevity of key Western traditions.  He claims in the prologue \\"In no other country is it conceivable that a modern leader would initiate a major national undertaking by invoking static principles from a millennium-old event -- nor that he could confidently expect his colleagues to understand the significance of the allusions.\\"  I am not so sure -- most modern leaders would be familiar with the \\"Trojan Horse,\\" the \\"Siege of Masada\\", Hannibal crossing the Alps or the Crusades.  The West has its traditions and customs as well -- even if the nation-states which evolved over the years have changed.  The second part of the context-setting is the weakest part of the book, with the exception of a very in-depth review of the Korean War (which was surprising -- I expected Kissinger to focus more on Vietnam given his personal involvement in government during that war).  One leaves the first half of the book with several important foundational points on \\"how to think about China\\" -- they have a keen sense of pride and history, colonialism left the country with a deep fear of loss of sovereignty, they are a strong nation by dint of their size, but collectively the nations which border China constitute a significant threat, the invasion by Japan through Korea left China with a desire to avoid having a strong Korea on its doorstep,  Kissinger uses the next section of the book to demonstrate that Mao is more of a \\"continuation of the past\\" then the revolutionary that he was.  This is the section that left me feeling let down -- was Mao, who's policies were responsible for the death of millions in the Great Leap Forward, always as it would seem, one step ahead of everyone else?  Was the chaos of the Cultural Revolution just a phase that didn't work out very well, as opposed to the mad undertaking of a leader with no conscience?  Kissinger seems to look for logic and rationality in a period that was clearly terrible for China and the citizens of that country.  The strongest part of the book was the final third.  Kissinger is now writing from deep experience, and with unparalleled access.  His perspectives on Deng's leadership, the implacability of the Taiwan issue, the realist perspective on Tiananmen, the challenges of maintaining a stable dialogue through changes of government and the occasionalcrisis are thought-provoking and well-founded.  He closes on a three-scenario view of evolving relations -- one of inevitable confrontation (the Crowe perspective, drawn from the early 1900's view of UK and German relations), the Dai Bingguo perspective (which is a \\"rosy scenario\\" about the inevitability of China's peaceful rise) and then Kissinger's aspiration for a \\"Pacific Community\\" that creates a framework for the nations bordering the Pacific (would this include India?) to reconcile their differences and manage towards common interests.

B001UV4XFQ|4.0|I am keeping this short and to the point. I've read the books several times and find the first two movie installments to be watered-down versions. I had to actually separate the knowledge I have of the original novels in order to even half-way enjoy the first two movies. Eclipse is still a far cry from the original story, however, it definitely grew up a little bit to the point I am looking forward to watching Breaking Dawn when I get the chance.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|It was 1 hour and 12 minutes into the movie before i ever laughed...The 1st movie was really funny..this one...NOT
B00154GEFU|5.0|...rises again.   They went off for a while, did their own things. The Asia name continued in various iterations...eventually, all that was left was Geoff Downes. Three-quarters of the founding members gone! How could any band persist through that sort of lineup shift? Well, Yes did it for years, why couldn't Asia? After all, both Howe and Downes had both been members of that legendary prog pioneer. Fast forward twenty-five years, John Wetton has just been through heart surgery, and--coincidence?--the band has had a change of heart as well and gets together to record again.  \\"Phoenix\\" is amazing stuff, of a kind with their very first collaboration, and its followup, \\"Alpha\\". Only,  the artists are that much older and wiser (well, one hopes!) and with so many years' experience. I know, as if they needed any, but there you go: the result is a record that is as good as any they ever made! \\"Phoenix\\" indeed rises, and burns brightly, brightly enough that the group saw fit to record together again with 2010's \\"Omega\\". Hopefully THAT title is not so apropos; I want to see them continue. Might I suggest that the next record could be titled, \\"Eternal\\"?  Thanks, Geoff. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Carl. Thanks, John (and stay well!) Play on. We'll be listening.
B005ZUR724|1.0|this app is bogus. very defective. when its opened, it prompts you for an update. there's no update available. it worked all fine and dandy until that bogus update came in the picture.
145551389X|5.0|the book came in awesome condition! packaged very well. this was a gift for my best friend whos a huge gaga fan. this was beyond anything she could have expected. i wish i ordered one for myself!! its a huge book full of fantastic pics!!!!
B002ZG981E|5.0|The title says it all. This is one of the best movies of the last few years, and blu ray just makes it that much better.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|5 stars because the delivery was pretty speedy.  Also, no damages to the album.  It was in a nice plastic covering.  This was actually a gift to someone because I knew they wanted it. The person said he listened to the album nonstop for the whole day, so I guess it's pretty good!
B006JN5KBG|5.0|Those of you who think or are making the statements that another release with more extras and at a much lower price is not on the horizon are, in my opinion, the people trying to sell this item for the considerably profit margin. Whether or not this practice is morally repugnant is one of personal choice, but to suggest, by proxy, that they better buy at this price or forever be \\"out of luck\\" is suspect.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I like it. It has a tongue and cheek feel with some great gore. Roddy Mcdowall hands in an excellent performance and the vampire next door story runs well from beginning to end. It's an 80's movie that was on the \\"B\\" shelf with mostly unknown actors, barring of course Mr. McDowall, it transcended its genre and budget. When I saw it as a teenager when released to theaters I was very surprised by it and I think it has withstood the test of time.<br /><br />FYI, for those who know what I am talking about, an HD Quality version is available online for free!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Gives me local forecast.  I like that it uses the upper left scroll down option on kindle fire :) With scroll down option you don't have go waste a favorites spot.  Amazon kindle fire should do more with upper left scroll bar option.
B003L77G8I|4.0|Started watching the reruns  with my daughter. Got hooked on the show.  It's a great show. Love it.  I have bought all the season and I'm catching up to the new season showsand.
0439023521|5.0|Keeps you on your toes and wanting more! Super excited to read the rest of the books and see the movie!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a little lovey-dovey for my liking at the end, but overall I do recommend it. Great read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who thinks they will have free time. I also have this on my iPod, and I am totally addicted.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My sister and her family are huge Harry Potter fans and wanted to get the complete set.  They went out on Black Friday because of an advertised special on this set and stood in line for hours only to lose out.  When they told me, I went online to Amazon and got the set at the same price as the BLACK Friday ad.  It arrived long before Christmas and they were thrilled.  I do not think they realized what price I got it for and I am not going to tell them.
B005ZUR724|4.0|this game is amazing. only has thing is the new update. causing downtime. hopefully this.gets resolved soon. tho I'm glad I didn't pay the full 6.99 or this may have.been.much. annoyance
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Couldn't believe the amazing deal this product was. All the dvds for a great low price, would recommend to anyone looking to own them all
B005ZUR724|1.0|The actual game is definitely worth 5 stars, but until they get the updates straight it's only worth one. Very sad... I'll change the rating when it's fixed though.
B004132HZS|5.0|Caught this on CPTV and we couldn't wait for the next episode. Cumberbatch is entertaining and naughty. Plays a perfect 21st century Holmes. When will they work on the 2nd season?
B006C1DH92|5.0|my first review ever - excellent game play - really fun - moves to sd card - can't wait to see superman's review
B001H9JBW6|4.0|Totally enjoyable thriller and a bit eerie.  A bit closer to reality than I'd like to entertain, but that's why I sat on the edge of my seat  through the whole thing!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There is nobetter way that I know of to have a wealth of Bible translations at hand for study.  The reading plans have helped me to be more consistent in my reading as well.  Highly recommend this app.
B006C1DH92|5.0|The best Christmas gift ever! I also love the music in the game! It makes me feel excited. Strongly recommendation.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is another great time waister from Rovio, with new fun birds and harder courses... Kill the pigs! That's all that matters still.
B005ZUR724|2.0|okay every time I try to play the game on kindle fire it says updated version available I. store what the hell is going on I go to store and only the version that says update is available
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|This app does know the rules, does give you the game options, does provide a challenge, and has 2 player!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My son loves Harry Potter. He has all the books, and movies. Last year he got his own Blu-ray player so this set was a natural birthday gift. Reasonable price, fast delivery. What is not to love?
B00136S0NE|5.0|So charming, sweet, sad and lovely. Marketa Irglova's voice is ethereal, complementing the brusqueness of Glen Hansard's voice. The music may take a couple of listenings to grab you, but it is honest and simple and is not muddied down with over-production. It is straight from the heart and frequently painful and real. Best tracks are Falling Slowly, If You Want Me, Say It to Me Now, and Gold. This soundtrack is so amazing, it has its own playlist on my i-Tunes.
0140143505|5.0|And I don't know why.  It prompted me to read everything else I could find by Hanff and loved them all.  She has captured a New York City I wish I had felt at home in, one that I went looking for but never found because I was too late.  Hanff was the feisty type of woman I always find amazing, demanding and persnickety but with a heart like gold--very much like true New Yorkers.  All of her books make me want to hug them, keep them real close to my heart.  Wish I could thank the lady for giving them to me.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Its fast even on 3G and ive never had an issue with it. It also doesnt force close on me like other apps.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|There are a few things about this version that I liked, like the sense of claustrophobia and aloneless in that huge house at night.  This is the only adaptation that has ever scared me and made me feel what living at Thornfield with that mad woman must have been like.  I also loved Jane's serenity. She was a model of grace.    However, she wasn't much else. The thing about this romance (and every other) is that it works because of the chemistry, and both these actors were only mild versions of the characters they were portraying. And together, they were just bland. I didn't see why he loved her, or why she loved him, nor was I given any indication of her emotion. It's fine to say that Jane is reserved, but an actress must nonetheless show the audience something or they will be left cold.    Sadly, that was my reaction to the whole movie.  Oh, and I felt it suffered by rearranging the beginning to show bits and pieces across the timeline. It felt like a move by the director to just do something different with this tale that's been told so many times.  Unfortunately, it was a poor choice.    The Zelah Clarke version remains my favorite.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Awesome Movie. No need to say more. Completed my collection of the 8 DVD series. I like that I got a digital copy even if some people don't like it, but I was able to watch it in an airport when I was unexpectedly delayed there with the digital copy since I didn't have the DVD.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is amazing... The CD included is my new favorite. She is great live, she puts a great show.  And blu-ray just makes everything better. Worth every penny and more!
B006C1DH92|3.0|Overall this is a good spinoff to Fruit Ninja. The ever changing challenges keep the game fresh and different than your usual gaming app. The spanish guitar music is also fun to listen to.  My biggest problem with the app is that it doesn't run well on my Motorola Droid. I've had Fruit Ninja on my phone for a couple of months and haven't had any problems while playing it. But this PiB edition lags my phone and becomes unresponsive to my touch on just the main menu alone. And then when it comes time to do the challenges the unreponsivness costs me lives most of the time, which makes the game less than entertaining after awhile.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|So if you haven't seen this concert video, it literally is one of the best live performances ever caught on video. You don't even have to be a Talking Heads fan to buy this, because you will be one after watching it. That's all there is to it. If you are a fan of live music I cannot scream it loud enough, you have to get a copy of this show.  As far as the Blu Ray quality goes, it's not the best video out there, that's for sure. It's better than the DVD, but I wouldn't buy it again if you already have the DVD for the video quality.  The sound is a different story. The Blu Ray sound shatters the previous DVD entry. The instruments are so crisp it almost sounds too perfect. Also, you pick up many other smaller sounds that you couldn't even tell were in the DVD version.   This concert was actually shot on three different nights and spliced together for the film. It's a masterpiece.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is one of the great science fiction series that ended way too soon. Firefly is hilarious and full of action. If you or your friend(s) liked Sci-fi's Farscape then, Firefly will fit nicely into you sci-fi collection. Taking place 500 years in the future, Firefly we join the crew of Serenity as they dodge Alliance ship and ravenous cannibalistic Reavers. Want the full package?! There is also a Firefly move that goes deeper into motives of the crew members of Serenity and the origins of the Reavers. GREAT GIFT FOR ALL SCI-FI LOVERS!!!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|You know the movies, so let's get right to the quality of the Blu Rays.   The first one is grainy. No two ways about it. BUT if you are a Jurassic Park fan, this is worlds above the DVD entry and worth the upgrade. The last two look extremely good. The sound upgrade is awesome. When the T-Rex screams in the first movie it's beautiful and can definitely be used when showing off your sound system.  I'm happy with the purchase!
B005ZUR724|1.0|this game is awesome a great game I.love it until the unknown update they need to change it if they do ill change my stars but for now ill keep it like this
B006INDMEE|1.0|I expected this movie to be good.  I was very disappointed in the movie.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I ordered this on a Thursday and received it the following Saturday. It was used but you could not tell it. I would highly recommend this merchant.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Enjoying it so far, will be sad once I complete all the puzzles, however, there is a sequel in the marketplace which I am sure I'll buy ;)
B0025UHKNS|3.0|For almost a year this product worked to expectations.  A few months ago the watch started to die at random times.  At first it was about 30 minutes into a run, and then 20, and then eventually it would die before acquiring satellite signals.  I had the 305 and it worked great the entire time I had it, which was a couple of years.  I gave it away when I got the 405.  My friend stil uses the 305 without any problems.  The 610 looks interesting, but the reviews indicate there is a rather high probability (17%) that the 610 will have battery problems.  My advice is to either purchase the bulky, antiquated, yet reliable 305 or get a cheaper product like the Timex or Motorola that have comparable features.    On another note, the bezel of the 305 was a bit frustrating to use from the beginning.  It becomes almost useless when you sweat on it.    This is a link to the unresolved \\"405cx reboots or shuts down\\" issue.  [....]    Hey Garmin convince us you can create another reliable product like the 305!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My favorite tower defense style game. I even bought PC version. Works on Droid X and Galaxy Tab. I highly recommend the game.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this was the free app of the day and so I thought it would be pretty good. well, I was wrong. it was terrific! excellent graphics! (on the kindle fire)
B002X6DQV4|5.0|This turned out to be an excellent product, despite not being what I was looking for.  I had wanted a socket to plug directly into the charger end of business, so I could run a 12v tire compressor without leaving the car on in the garage.  This has the male plug--same as the charger, so it attaches directly to the car socket instead.  Not going to lower my rating for my own stupidity and this actually does the job anyways; it works as an always-hot plug with the car off.  Everything went better than expected!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Get the Kleenex ready.  Great storyline, and the characters are each compelling and unique.  I was so engrossed with the story, I actually forgot they were acting.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The first two books I could not put down. I wanted to keep reading more and more, especially about Dannerys.  The plot lines were great. I could see all the characters in my minds eye and I kept wanting to come back for more.  However, the 3rd book was a snoozer, I couldnt wait to be done with it.  The reintroduction, descriptions and having to read the back stories of the characters over and over made me crazy. But I had to get through it, figuring that the first 2 books were so good, this snoozer was necessary for the drama in the 4th book.  I was right - the 4th once again had me on the edge of my seat.  I can't wait to find out what happens next.  Looking forward to the 5th installment.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is pretty amazing I love how this game is free and allows you to play without restrictions... this is one of the best games of all times!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a wonderful game it is very very addicting most pellet would say that it was boring but if u ask me I would say it was quite fun I would recommend it
B005ZUR724|5.0|best game ever everyone should play it.  I'm only levle six and I have a really good weapon out of the whole game for my archer. everybody should play Order of Chaos On line.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My nephew asked for this for a Christmas present from his 88 year old grandfather- It was his pleasure to give him this great video set which depics the \\"Pacific\\" side of the war.  He has already viewed \\"Band of Brother's\\" which was from his other grandfather's perspective as he was in the infantry.  This certainly helps keep the \\"Greatest Generations\\" stories and sacrificies alive and well as that generation begins to be called to their final resting places.  If we don't carry on their message we will lose the ability to keep America strong and self suffucient.  God Bless All Our Veterans now and forever! Amen
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game don't understand any star rating under 4 the only annoying this if you have a short game having to go to the main screen to play again rather than pushing restart game when you get your score
B006C1DH92|5.0|I never really cared about fruit ninja until they put some puss in it. now it's purrrfect!!! oh that was too easy you knew it was comin...
0811875040|5.0|This is an exceptional cookbook from the scalloped pages to the beautiful photos that accompany each recipe.  Whenever I go to Sanfrancisco I make a trip to the ferry building to have a sweet treat at Miettes.  I am so happy that I now have their cookbook so I can make some of the things that I love to eat.  I will always treasure this cookbook.Can't wait to make Graham crackers from scratch!
B000NTPDSW|3.0|Well..... I Mean The holidays were coming around and I figured I'd get something good for a family member of mine.... She has recently purchased a 59 inch HDTV, so I figure... What else to watch, then THE GODFATHER.. yada yada, blah blah blah... After I received the package in the mail. the box was small.. I was surprised, I opened it to find out that the box was small and less than quality. Also the booklet that comes with it does not fit in the box set. THE FANS WANT IT, why would you NOT put it in there...<br /><br />JEEZ.... lol.<br /><br />(I'm terrible at reviewing box sets btw)
B005ZUR724|5.0|would love to see next expansion and more things to do once u reach max lvl<br />very addictive at first but at the end it could be very boring
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Very cool. Works well with kindle fire and windows 7. It is alittle laggy, but almost any remote desktop will lag. My wireless network is outdated, so probably contributes to lag. Tried basic functions, going to try some Diablo 2 next. Well worth the $$$.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|Our 7 year old grandson loved putting together the fire temple.  He has several other Ninjago lego sets and plays with them constantly.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|will not install on kindle fire.  downloaded fine, claims installed, click to open takes you back to install page. repeat, repeat.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Complex, hard to really get into. Didn't keep me coming back for more. Too many characters thrown at me at once to try and remember who they all are, easier names would have helped. Didn't realize there were previous books that should have been read before this one, might have been easier to follow and more enjoyable.
B006C1DH92|5.0|the best app ever very worth the money I can't seem to stop playing it thx Amazon for the app
B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie is great for those who want more out of a movie, it is one to make the viewer think rather than stare at the screen mouth open with drool hanging out. The delivery was two day Prime shipping and the movie came in one day (That is always an exciting surprise).
0061537969|5.0|It was a great read. Suggested to anyone who loves dogs. Actually if you don't like dogs very much you might find this one appealing. He is very funny and only a dog could tell a story like this.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|gets you thinking, and it's fun, wish it was longer. you can play again and search for different things in the same scenes, would be better if it was longer.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Similar to old Fruit Ninja, but much more fun! More modes, more blades. Great game! Good job! You will love it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My nephew and his entire family loved this toy, they all compete to see who can get farther! It was a Christmas hit!
1594744769|5.0|First of all, I realize this book is for the young adult, which I did not know when I randomly picked it up off of the \\"Best Sellers\\" rack at Walmart and hastily added it to my basket. I am not a young adult -- but at 33 years old (and an avid, mature reader) this book held my attention from page one and I could not put it down for 2 days (the time in which it took me to read it due to the fact I have three small children who do require time and attention! Ha!)  I read on another review that a reader had thought the book was going to be a horror story, and I suppose that is why I picked it up, but as that reviewer noted, it is not really...more of a fantasy/thriller.   The characters so so very real, the story truly comes to life and leaps off the page. I was so happy to find there is a book two in the works, slated to release in Spring of 2013 (a very very long wait from now -- Dec. 2011). They are also going to produce a movie with Tim Burton as the director which I am very much looking forward to as well.  I will say for those that are shopping for their \\"young adults\\" there are a few curse words in the book and several that are thinly (if at all) masked in foreign vernacular. Thankfully not the mother of all bad words, but words none-the-less I would not want MY young adult to read, however I am more conservative than most being that I am a Christian, a mother of small children and a former teacher & temporarily retired school counselor. I closely monitor every thing my children are exposed to (for instance, Sponge Bob is NOT allowed in this home). But should one read the novel first, like I would hope one would before giving it to their young adult, it would be easy to either black out the very small number of foul words or remedy it some other way.  All in all, an amazing book with a very interesting approach combining haunting/fascinating vintage photos with wonderful writing. I highly recommend it and give it two thumbs up for young and old.
B0000CC5CS|4.0|This DVD isn't amazing, but worth four bucks. The documentaries, transfer, and behind the scenes footage are all plenty worth this money.  If your looking for a load of bonus features(because you're a collector or something) you probably won't want this.  However, if you're just browsing Amazon and happen to come across it, considering it applies to free super saver shipping, you might as well add it to your cart for the heck of it and if you think it sucks, it isn't like you wasted the bank's vault. The reason i give the package four stars is the movie itself.  When people say they think this is the worst movie in the trilogy, they are definitely right.  The movie itself is great, especially if you've never seen T1 or T2, but if you have seen them,you know that T3 falls significantly out of the constant flowing story line of the previous films.  This could be a result of the fact that it was not as closely related to the magnificent Jim Cameron as T1 and T2.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|This is the first headphone amp I've purchased and I'm not sure how I lived without one before. This little box makes any decent pair of headphones much more vibrant and clear. I have this paired with a set of Sennheiser 280's and it adds a good bit of punch and clarity to music with no added noise or distortion. I'm in love with how well this brings out subtle effects not only in music, but in games as well.<br /><br />The instructions leave a bit to be desired. It never states what the difference is between the EQ modes, but from what I can tell no light is a flat boost, red is bass boost, and blue (my most used setting) is a boost in the mids. Both red and blue is for high level input. Battery life seems good. I haven't tested to see jsut how much charge this holds, but it lasted through a 5-hour gaming session with no trouble.<br /><br />The only real downside tot his is how cheap it feels. It's made out of weak, brittle feeling plastic. I panicked when I dropped it a few inches onto my desk and was surprised it didn't break. That's how poor it feels. The switch and buttons feel loose and don't appear like they'll last too long.
B006C1DH92|1.0|Really liked the original Fruit Ninja, but this one is so slow and laggy it was unplayable!!!  Luckily I got this as the FAotD so I didn't have to pay for it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Everyone who comes near my kindle loves this game. Although it just might be the oldest computer game, it's still a great app. Highly recommend.
1451627289|3.0|Given the premise, there were 1,000,000 things that could have been done differently.  In the end, this is a love story.  The JFK fans will still get the tale they are looking for, but it is peppered in between the love story.  I enjoyed the audio book, but I can see how reading this would have gotten a little monotonous.  I kept waiting for something crazy to happy, find out more about the green card man and his kind, but this book would have no answers in the time travel department.  I liked it, but again - I was expecting more.
B005ZUR724|1.0|the game refuses to let me enter a world. instead it tells me that I need to download the new version first, which is not possible considering its not on the app store. don't buy yet until the new version comes out.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|No bells and whistles but the Complete HP 8-film collection offered at a great price ($40) from Amazon during black Friday week.  Just what my son wanted.
0545405777|4.0|It was for a gift for a relative.  They havent stopped thanking me as they were hoping to receive this for a birthday.  Thanks Amazon for helping me make her day
B005HP2J66|4.0|i have to come clean - i'm a huge Herzog fan. and i'm sure this clouds my review.   BUT having said that, this movie blew me away.  i must have spent 2 hours after watching this film (saw it in the theater) just hanging around a coffee shop trying to digest what i just saw.  it totally made me reevaluate how i felt about culture, art and history. i'm no snob, in fact, i'm a total novice when it comes to art. i have no back round, very little appreciation for it, and never thought i would.  but this movie really changed all that for me.   i keep finding myself looking at the world in a completely new way.  it's crazy.  loved it. might be his best work, though it's tough to compare it to much else.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|Started off fine, was able to easily copy about 6 cassette tapes. Then every once in a while the speed would be off, eventually it always played the tapes too slow. At this point it is headed to the electronic recycle center.
B00164GDD2|2.0|This is a review of the Ghostbusters [Blu-ray] release, not the movie itself.   First let me state I am not a true technophile.  I really don't know a great deal about the differences between resolutions, other than know that one resolution looks better than another.  I have seen a lot of things in high definition and while I sometimes think it can be too much for some movies, I've rarely seen anything that looked bad... until now.   The transfer on this version is complete garbage.  It looks so bad that the DVD version [[ASIN:B0009RCPY8 Ghostbusters Double Feature Gift Set (Ghostbusters / Ghostbusters 2 + Commemorative Book)]], which I already have, looks BETTER.  Even if they GAVE this Blu-ray away for FREE, it still wouldn't be worth owning.  It saddens me to think that a beloved movie can be treated like utter trash by the movie studios who clearly rushed this version out just to make a quick buck.   Take my advice: save your money and wait until Sony releases a restored version.
0307959856|4.0|I read this during Christmas break and found it thoroughly enchanting.  I'll admit, I\\"m not a purist but rather I enjoy a good read.  So, I recommend this book to others.  I couldn't see the ending coming.  If you are on Christmas break then get it!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|This is a very fun movie.  Our kids love it and have added it to their ipods. Lots of content on the discs.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I am a radio host, known for my extensive Christmas programs, I love my Christmas music. Michael Buble's Christmas recording is the best of the best, from the choice of songs to the arrangements, not to mention Michael Buble's near-perfect interpretation and style, this album is hands-down the best I've heard in years. What an exquisite discovery. A bonus is that his style and  choices span the musical tastes of several generations. A timeless collection from an excellent performer. I will be including this album in my Christmas repertoire.
B006C1DH92|4.0|If. you like Fruit Ninja , you are going to like this as well. I like the extra version it has, but it would be better if it had the arcade mode or something that the original Fruit Ninja has.
B000HLDFK4|5.0|A wonderful time warp romance.  A mailbox that allows two strangers to meet and fall in love with a five year span of time difference.  Will they finally meet and still be in love in the same time?  Confusion ensues.  I have watched this movie again and again
B001UV4XFG|5.0|My order was quickly filled & well packaged. I'm so glad I bought it as I've played it several times. I'm so glad I bought the 2 discs! Thanks!!!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Very interesting adaptation of the origin of the X-Men. The clash in views between Xavier and Magneto is interesting as always and adds a nice tension to all thier scenes together.<br /><br />My wife who isn't familiar with any of the the origin stories for any of the X-Men really liked this movie.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie. First problem is that the movie did not sync with the ads and trailers. The second problem is that the plot is bankrupt of entertainment value.  Don't get me wrong loved the effects and action sequences but they could not overcome the fatal flaws of the plot.    At best this is an acquired taste.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|See other comments as the widescreen is NOT complete while the normal view. Disney or Amazon should make this flaw perfectly clear as this is a damaged product and is false advertising with this song cut out of the wide screen. Editing films should ALWAYS be noted on the packing and in descriptions just as rerecorded songs should be clearly marked as such. We LOVE this film and I thought I was buying my family the best version out there and we are extremely disappointed being forced to not watch the wide screen view we paid for. I will be writing to Disney and to Amazon to complain.
B0055SWM08|5.0|My daughters (8 and 10) and I play together. Great exercise to keep the mind active. We will be playing this game for a long time.
B000EUDAWG|4.0|My nephew really got a \\"jump\\" out of this toy.  He loved how real it looked and had fun scaring all his family!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Quick review - very good series thusfar, at least the first season.  Haven't seen the 2nd season yet.  But it's a very will directed & written TV show that does a nice job of mixing in a bit of goryness(but not too much) with an excellent plot.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The 8-disc set arrived right on time and was in great condition.  I was a little concerned that the box was too thin, but inside all of the discs are held in their own nice little plastic sleeves that you can flip through--very convenient and it saved a lot of space compared to each disc in its own individual box(less likely to lose one that way too).  I bought this as a gift for my little sister and she absolutely loves it. She has watched all of the movies in a two day span.  We already had one of the movies but this was a much more cost effective way to get the rest of them.  Great product and got a great deal!!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This app is fun for drawing but difficult to get it exact or make it just how you want it. It is a lot of fun to make things as long as they don't have a lot of detail. Especially fun for kids.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love this cover!  It is micro thin and compact, making it so easy to insert in a handbag or briefcase and...it doesn't add any weight!  Ingenious!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If you don't have this,you don't know what you're missing!  This is my favorite app! Works great on Kindle Fire! :)
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Loved this game on iphone and pc, but crashes every 5 minutes on my new Galaxy Nexus. This is the only app I've had trouble with on ICS.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|In the spirit of Kubrick's 2001, this methodical space-based science fiction film is a mind bender.  Sam Rockwell has perhaps his best performance yet in a near solo performance along with the felicitous, colorless voice of Kevin Spacey.  A fresh science fiction film that I'd recommend to nearly anyone.   The Blu Ray itself is well produced with good extras.  I wasn't blown away with what was included, but the extra content was nice and added to the experience.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is both fun and challenging. A great way to keep your mind sharp.  I also love relaxing music.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Room is a moving book written though the eyes of a 5 year old boy in a terrible situation.  He doesn't even know it's terrible which is the best part of the story.  It's totally innocent and moving.  I couldn't put it down from the first page to the last.
0670022705|5.0|I gave a copy of \\"A History\\" to each of my family groups for Christmas.  Everyone loved it, stopping their gift opening to scan through it. Since one copy stayed at home, I know I will enjoy it, too.
B005R4255C|3.0|Being a huge fan of Michael, Cirque and mash-ups in general, I was really looking forward to this release.  But too many of the tracks are either not that much different than the original or way too short.  I bought the deluxe edition but easily this could have been a single disc and therefore much better.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|If you are expecting an innocent, tongue-in-cheek, goofy comedy, you had better look elsewhere!  This has to be the most offensive, sexually perverted comedy I have ever seen! There is one scene where they go to see a wizard for guidance on the quest. The wizard offers to help if they kiss him on the lips and masturbate him, which they do! It is also revealed that one of the heroes has been molested by the wizard since he was a little boy - all presented in a humorous way, of course!  This is just one example, but the movie is filled with this nonsense from beginning to end! The dialogue is continually sexual in nature, with a lot of emphasis on homosexual themes.  Hey, if that's your thing you'll love this movie. I not only find this perverted, homosexual, and child molesting humor sickening, I think that it should come with one helluva warning label!  As for me I gave it one star, only because \\"negative five\\" was not an option... {BARF}
B005XBKXV2|5.0|This is the best Disney movie I've ever seen, and I'm convinced, the best Disney movie every created--certainly among the best.  This movie is a classic.  It's not your typical child's movie.  The \\"Circle of Life\\" theme moved me when I was 8 and again many years later.  The interconnectedness of all of creation, the idea of confronting and coping with the past, and other common motifs of friendship, love, and courage make this a very mature and inspiring film.  I would really recommend this film to everyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love reading and easily switching back and forth between favored versions. It goes with me to church and my Bible study group.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|As expected the cases are a perfect fit for the Kindle Fire but to be honest somewhat expensive for what was provided.  I had ordered two - one black, one pink.  The pink one is only pink on the front... not a problem just pointing that out.  In hindsight i'm not too sure why i ordered these at $40... $30 is far more manageable but still a tad more than i think its worth.  Glad to see Amazon doing the right thing and automatically crediting the price drop difference to my account.  This kind of action is why i keep shopping at Amazon.
B004YF6MHW|3.0|Would be nice if the timer countdown could be silenced. Image looks great in viewfinder, but colors are slightly off in the final image. On Galaxy Nexus (Android 4.0)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is one of the first games I hot tor my kindle fire I haven't stop playing it since. its addicting.love the variety of games.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I should have listened to the other posts.  This thing is about as cheaply made as it could be. Broke almost immediately when fitting it to my phone.  The tripod may come in handy for other things but I still can't attach my phone to it.
B006C1DH92|5.0|If you love puss in boots in the shrek movies and fruit ninja u'll love this and it works great on the kindle fire.  :D
B0042816YK|4.0|I know it's unusual (people usually prefer the book to the film), but in my case I found that Julia Roberts, Javier Bardem, and others actually brought some color and life to the characters in the book.  In the book, I didn't actually like either of these characters, but Julia and Javier caused me to like them more.  Much of the photography (especially in the Balinese sequence) is really quite beautiful.
B0063IH60K|5.0|in spite of all the ads you have to exit between every game it is still a good one.
B000F1IQMS|4.0|For a film that could have stood more editing, \\"Munich\\" holds one spellbound. Jewish Spielberg doesn't take sides in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict but shows the continual output given long-standing trends - violence begets violence.   While that remains a constant, shifting international winds make long-term field operations dicey and often counterproductive. Those that have watched Daniel Craig's movies out of sequence might wonder how James Bond got on the Israeli hit squad. The incomparable Geoffrey Rush (\\"The King's Speech\\") is worth his weight in gold in this film.   I happened to see \\"Munich\\" the same weekend that presidential aspirant Newt Gingrich popped off about the Palestinians being a \\"made-up people.\\" Golda Meir, Israeli prime minister during the 1972 Olympics crisis and included in \\"Munich,\\" once said the same thing. Spielberg reminds us that Palestinian aspirations are genuine and earnest people are willing to die for them. The Palestinians are not part of some anti-Jewish plot hatched by the Islamic world against the U.S. and its allies as Gingrich and his neocon/Israel Lobby pals would like people to believe.   Nationalist flag-wavers are not capable to grasping the Jewish/Arab tragedy.  But Spielberg, honest broker/filmmaker, understands it. Only when flags are set aside and brotherhood and forgiveness come front and center will peace endure.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Nice game. Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots is better than Fruit Ninja original and also more addictive. Excellent game. I love it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The 2008 financial crisis/recession can be traced back to deregulation and Charles Ferguson makes the case succinctly and persuasively. The main message I took away from \\"Inside Job\\" is this is what happens when freedom is given to people that are not morally ready for it. Or, put another way, with freedom comes responsibility.   Ferguson picks up the trail with the appointment of Merrill Lynch CEO Donald Regan as President Reagan's first Treasury secretary, which considerably boosted the standing of the financial services industry. Interesting and it's not a partisan argument - Clinton and Obama are criticized for picking from the same bucket of rotten apples. George W. Bush takes a drubbing, too. Not touched on by Ferguson is the short-lived appointment of Paul O'Neill as W.'s first Treasury secretary. Here was a man of production (CEO of aluminum maker ALCOA) unable to survive in the new finance-dominated paradigm. Yet Ferguson essentially makes this important point when he (through the voice of narrator Matt Damon) notes that finance was a subsidiary part of American business for much of the nation's history, not its core. But now it is the core and that core is rotten.   That regulation is not a magic bullet and can become outdated (although the Glass/Steagall Act will likely never become obsolete) is something that Ferguson seems to concede but the perniciousness of regulation and big government in the 2008 crisis he leaves unexplored. The Carter-era Community Reinvestment Act lit the fuse for the subprime mortgage bomb. And there's more, a lot more. Perhaps this is the subject for a future movie.   Ferguson concludes that the re-regulation fight is worth it as is Charles Morris' recommendation to reorient people away from consumerism and to take up savings and investment again. This won't be easy. The same academic economics profession whose corruption Ferguson deftly exposes will try to \\"expertly\\" defend short-termism/debt/profligate spending and how \\"growth\\" will be impaired by reduced consumption and long-term thinking. But, as Ferguson fittingly concludes his excellent documentary - \\"some things are worth fighting for.\\"   To those who design financial products that wildly enrich the sellers but open bottomless pits on the downside and to those that two-face their clients by betting against products sold to those clients, listen to the words of the Mesillas Yesharim (Rabbi Moshe Chayim Luzzatto's \\"Path of the Just\\") - p. 119 - \\"If he does not analyze and weigh his actions carefully, he will bring forth thorns instead of wheat, for he will transgress and fall victim to the sin of deceit about which we have been warned, (Leviticus 25:17) `Let not a man deceive his fellow.' \\"
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie is for people of all ages. The animation is lush and vivid. The music makes you want to sing and Samba. The storyline is sweet.  I showed this to my students as a reward and they absolutely loved it! They danced in their seats and around the room. It totally captivated their attention. (as well as their teachers') This is a movie you can show to children and not worry about them learning something they should not. This is pure, exhilarating fun. Buy it noooooow! You will love it! (the soundtrack is awesome too; you can bust a move for exercise! :0)
B000H5U832|5.0|I am very pleased with this transaction. Movie received in good condition and my child has proceeded to wear this movie out. He asks to see it every day sometimes twice a day.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I've never seen this movie, but I ordered it as a gift to ship to my grandson who is out-of-state.   The ordering was easy, the price was good, and it was delivered promptly and in good condition.  Happy with purchase... no complaints!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is one of the best games I have ever played. I don't even need the app store any more. I love it. n I get great recommendations.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I purchased two copies of this CD for family members and I may actually purchase a third for myself. Usually all Christmas songs sound similar, but Buble gives the songs a twist while still keeping it classy enough for holiday celebrations.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really easy to score points and get new games unlocked! its really addictive! plus,the more you play the more points you get awarded.
B003L77G06|5.0|Season Two is as funny if not funnier than Season One.  Anyone that watches the series weekly will never get tired of watching this collection.
1610452607|5.0|This audio version of A Christmas Carol was great.  The narrator's voice(s) were very interesting. It matched right along with the version of the book I used for my English class.  We enjoyed the story and enjoyed the narrator's classic telling of this classic story.
B0006GAOJA|5.0|\\"Raging Bull\\" is a frank account of the boxing career of Jake LaMotta, which is characterized by intensity to win and some of the mishaps LaMotta faced during and after his career. Robert De Niro plays LaMotta with fierce accuracy and he won the 1980 Academy Award for Best Actor. This is one of the best boxing films of all-time.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B0063GORYU|5.0|works great. never have problems and its easy to use. not too many popups like with some other programs will have.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This is the best thing i have bought since my ps3. it is very sweet. i can sit and play my games while in the living room with the family. Very nice.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Nothing new appears in the plot department in \\"The Descendants\\". For the umpteenth time, we have a successful, workaholic father (George Clooney as Matt King) juggling three problems: 1) attempting to be more \\"parental\\" with older, estranged, profane daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and uninhibited younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), 2)monitoring the comatose, near-death state of his adventurous wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), and 3) as trustee pondering how to dispose of prime Hawaii seafront real estate: sell it and make many family beneficiaries obscenely rich or preserve its pristine beauty. As you can see, Matt's plate is overflowing.<br /><br />The movie is about how Matt methodically and gradually addresses his three problems. To some degree, \\"The Descendants\\" is ultimately predictable. However, what is novel is the theme that we almost never act from purely noble, altruistic motives. In the decisions Matt makes, he simultaneously shows patience and exasperation, -self-control and vengeance, reconciliation and resentment.<br /><br />For example, as he tries to reestablish a connection with Alex, Matt is fumblingly, hilariously, and sadly ineffective. That is, until he learns that his wife was having a clandestine affair. Matt, of course, is fiercely determined to ferret out the slime who cuckolded him, though this \\"righteous crusade\\" is somewhat tempered by the fact that Elizabeth may have cheated on him because Matt neglected her in favor of work. Perked up by the prospect of this juicy, scandalous mystery, Alex slowly drops her \\"sullen teen\\" facade and eagerly helps her dad discover that a Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), a real-estate broker, is responsible. Therefore, at least and partially for underhanded reasons, they grudgingly get closer, though as the movie progresses, their relationship improves for more honorable ones.<br /><br />As another example, Matt finally confronts Brian at his rented seaside cottage about the affair. But instead of getting into a spirited fistfight that would shatter the lawyer's reputation, Matt quietly but determinedly interrogates Brian about his tryst with Elizabeth and informs him about Elizabeth's tragic state. Again, Matt's logical way of handling this seems more humane, but it is also more searingly effective in wounding and humbling Brian, and eventually Brian's wife Julie (Judy Greer), to whom he confesses. It also exposes Brian for the cowardly louse he is, since he refuses to visit Elizabeth on her sick/death bed and sends his wife instead.<br /><br />Matt displays his ulterior motives regarding the land sale. With his family members, he views the breathtaking property and realizes it would be commercially vile to condemn it to condo development. Therefore, he gathers the cousin beneficiaries together to tell them that he will not sign the land over to developers. But his new-found environmentalism is not the only reason for Matt's decision. He also doesn't want the idle cousins, who never cared for the land in any way and only acquired it through descent, to profit. But Brian, coincidentally, was orchestrating the deal, and Matt REALLY doesn't want HIM to profit.<br /><br />As the final example, Matt discontinues life support for his wife when the doctors tell him that her head trauma from a boating accident will eventually doom her. Of course, this is an obvious act of charity and a concession to her \\"Do Not Resuscitate\\" wishes. However, it also gives the all-too-human Matt, his daughters, and his in-laws the chance to vent about her flaws and failures and infidelities without her actually hearing it. Hypocritically, Matt even tries to restrain the others' ventings, especially from Brian's wife, as if only he has the right to complain unreservedly against his wife.  Nevertheless the venting eases Matt's reconciliation with his wife, and makes the post-cremation ash-scattering into the ocean that much easier and truly genuine.<br /><br />To make peace with the world, we must sort out our mixed selfish and not-so-selfish feelings as we stumble towards some kind of resolution. Even when we make the \\"right\\" decisions, we often do so for at least partially \\"wrong\\" reasons. Matt and company learn this anguished and sobering lesson in \\"The Descendants\\".our mixed selfish and not-so-selfish feelings as we stumble towards some kind of resolution. Even when we make the \\"right\\" decisions, we often do so for at least partially \\"wrong\\" reasons. Matt and company learn this anguished and sobering lesson in \\"The Descendants\\".
B003Y7AR4K|3.0|I watch a different Nutcracker every Christmas Eve. This Blu-ray was my 2011 selection.  Visually, the disc is excellent. The image is so razor-sharp, you can actually see the texture of the scrims as you're looking through them! Try that with a conventional DVD.  The soundtrack is likewise very good. The orchestra is closely miked, with good balance between instruments and a wide stereo image.  Costumes, sets, lighting ... all very professional.  What's missing is the magic. The dancing is competent, but unexciting. The choreography is serviceable, but unimaginative. There are no surprises, no special moments, and very little humor. The battle scene is a big yawn. The transformation of the Christmas tree feels mechanical and ritualistic. Even Miyako Yoshida, admirably precise and ever-smiling, is bland as toast. It feels as if everyone's just going through the motions.   The previous DVD version by the Royal Ballet is better in every respect. Too bad it's not on Blu-ray.
B0031R5K7M|4.0|An amazing book following up from Eldest. If you are interested in fantasy then I would definitely recommend this book. Christopher Paolini has managed to create a brilliant world nearly on par with 'Middle Earth' of Tolkein.   The characters have something to give to us and you find something in them that you connect with, there is honour and strength and evil. Sometimes it maybe a little predictable but its a great read. Though please do start from the beginning of this series, 'Eragon'.
0307949486|5.0|THIS BOOK MOVES FAST AND KEPT ME UP ALL NIGHT READING IT.  I HIGHLY RECCOMEND READING ALL THREE BOOKS.  I WISH LARSSON HAD WRITTEN MORE BEFORE HE PASSED!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great backpack. Helps you keep lenses and filters organized in the compartments that are size-adjustable (velcro tabs alow you to make them fit the accessories that you have). Also lets you pack and store your camera with a telephoto lense attached.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|THIS WAS A FANTASTIC FINISH TO A MOST EXCELLENT TRILOGY.  THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN THE NOVELS IS AWESOME.  I LOVE THESE BOOKS!  BRAVA AND REST IN PEACE MR. LARSSON.
159514188X|1.0|What a ridiculously shameless book. This book uses suicide as a means to teach a lesson about how kids treat others... but I think another lesson here is that if you want to get your point across you should kill yourself. How incredibly irresponsible.
B003L77G06|5.0|It came fast and was in good condition. I have a very nice review for it.And of course it is a great movie so you win just by having it.
B006671NPM|1.0|While I absolutely loved this movie, I am utterly disgusted that the so-called \\"digital copy\\" that is \\"included\\" with this purchase is actually a subscription to Ultra Violet, a streaming service; instead of a digital copy that resides in my iTunes, to be used on the device of my choice.  This is yet another attempt by Hollywood execs to punish legitimate buyers and I will not, under any circumstances purchase a movie that includes an Ultra Violet copy again.  I am returning my copy and waiting for the UK version that includes a REAL digital copy.
B002ZG981E|5.0|It came fast and was in good condition. I have a very nice review for it.And of course it is a great movie so you win just by having it.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I spend way to much money with Amazon, but it's not my fault.  It's just so easy.  I literally did ALL my Christmas shopping from the comfort of my desk.  The last thing I purchased (and I was cutting it close to Christmas), was the Bourne Trilogy on BluRay.  I had never seen any of the movies, but read the original book).  The Trilogy arrived on time, and at a great price.  Instead of giving it as a gift to my wife, I opened the package and watched all three movies, back-to-back-to-back.  Do it.  These movies are great.  [[ASIN:B003H6KRIE The Bourne Trilogy (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum) [Blu-ray]]]
B0000AYJXR|5.0|It came fast and was in good condition. I have a very nice review for it.And of course it is a great movie so you win just by having it.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|this is a super great movie. fast,action packed. there was never a dull or slow moment in this movie. truly a 5 star movie. no question about it.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I don't generally like Will Ferrell in movies, and I also find it very hard to believe in a character if i know an actor already. Plus, I seriously despise xmas and all its various accessories, just die. So, with all that going against it, i still seriously adore this silly gem of a movie. Ferrell just disappears into this blank-eyed nitwit, pours himself fully into every dopey gesture: \\"Laughing is my favorite!\\" As they say, \\"perfectly ridiculous\\".
B005I6EU48|5.0|Upon receiving my Kindle Fire, I immediately went on a search to find the perfect cover. Something sturdy and protective, but with a touch of class. This cover appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. After having purchased it and used it for a week, I can say that I am thrilled with it all around - the look (gives the impression of an old-fashioned book binding), the feel (material is soft and very comfortable to hold), and the quality (I have no worries about throwing my Kindle into a bag and carrying it around with me all day with this cover on it). My Kindle Fire fits securely within the straps and while there is no mechanism for keeping the cover closed, I have been pleased with how well it lays flat and remains closed even when carried in a purse. There is a slight chemical odor to the material but not enough to be bothersome. It is worth the price tag and I would recommend it to anyone with a new Fire.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|ALL of Rick's books are the best books ever. Any one who says otherwise is absolutly insane. They are even better than the Harry Potter. They are the only books I can read over and over and never get sick of them.  Five stars all the way. :)
B0026S1XDM|5.0|i've always been a fan of tubular bells, and this remaster is very enjoyable.  the surround version does not disappoint.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This completes his set of all the Fast and Furious films.  He loves the series and was delighted to get the latest one so quickly.  It's a guy movie with fast cars, fast action, insane driving, and all the rest.
B005ZUR724|1.0|was a great game until the update came out and theres no way to update... would be 5 star but now its a 1 star
1400063515|5.0|Great book, draggy and confusing at time but over all it will be an eye opener. I think Fooled by Randomness is better though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app for a quick weather snapshot and weekly weather. Having the mini live weather show up on the upper left is also a convenient feature.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) is the third movie in the Toy Story series and an amazing sequel. Andy is going to college and the toys (except Woody) are supposed to be put in the attic. But a mix up ensues and the adventure begins. The animation is superb and I love the music in the movie. At the end of the movie you can not wait till the next Toy Story movie comes out. I am very much hoping for a fourth, and a fifth movie. I loved it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I Love this show! I consider it to be the new friends! I had no problems with the service or the product.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has to be the best bible app out there!  You can choose between countless bible versions, you can switch to audio mode and hear the bible.  I have this app on everything, my cell phone my tablet (Archos 10.1) and my computer.  I use it in church, I can take notes with this app see other peoples notes on the same verse.  Its a wonderful app!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I would say the game is ok because some of the games aren't that good but most are pretty good so I recomened this game for any age
B004EPYZSK|3.0|First of all, I was concerned that Cowboys and Aliens would be a corny or campy movie. This is not the case however, despite the fact that the special features reveal it to be based on a comic book by the same name. With big name stars like Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised to find that Cowboys and Aliens was in fact much more of a gritty action movie. This film is a proper heir to both the western tradition and the monster movie style of filming. There was something unique in this mash-up, which allowed for a cast of characters with absolutely no prior concept of aliens.   Therefore, aliens got called demons by characters, for lack of a better word, for example. Also, the Old West setting absolutely emphasized the sense of being out-gunned by the technologically advanced enemy. You've got some kind of flying saucer swooping down, and cowboys shooting a revolver at it. Success seems impossible without outside aid. There is also a lovely amnesia-related plot focused on the main character, yielding some amusing lines in the midst of an otherwise grim film. I'll never forget the whole audience gasping in the theater during a scene where a character is getting medical attention, old west style. Did I say gasping? I meant gagging.   I was also completely pleased that this DVD release of Cowboys and Aliens had special features. They were brief, but did just enough to really help me appreciate the work that went into the filming. I especially liked what they had to say about the process of coming up with the alien design in a feature called Outer-Space Icon. The scope of the spectacle was also fun, as it talked about some of the stunts actually done by the actors themselves. I didn't look at the commentary, but I might, next time I watch this movie, as I will undoubtedly want to see it again and again.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Very happy item arrived earlier than originally indicated - great service. Canadians note that the first movie is titled Sorcerer's Stone and not Philosopher's Stone.  Sorcerer's Stone is the american version apparently.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|The rules are simple enough to learn quickly (no more than 20 minutes of reading) but complex enough for critical thinking and strategy. I love the concept of the game, that you build an infrastructure to dominate your opponent's infrastructure. And that's also why I rated it high in terms of educational value, because competition for land and resources is something that shapes society. So it's a very useful way of looking at the world.  The game board consists hexagonal pieces fitted together to form an island, and around the island goes the water pieces, which are meant to form a neat rim. The pieces fit very poorly together, and some of them pop out of place while others leave massive gaps. After reading other reviews, I know I'm not the only one who's experienced this. And yes, I could take a knife or scissors and fix this, and it wouldn't be a problem. But I paid $35 for this game, only to find that it consists of crappy cardboard cutouts, a couple of die, a deck of cards, and some wood pieces. That is a lot of money for something so simple. They could have at least bothered to make the pieces look interesting, or printed some more scenic landscapes on the hexes so that I might be convinced I got something more valuable.  This is my recommendation: instead of buying the game, find out how to play Settlers through the internet. You can actually learn on the Catan homepage itself, or google \\"catan rules\\". Cut out the pieces you need from the cardboard laying around your house. You may have to buy the commodity cards separately from their website, but apart from that you've MacGyvered up your own Settlers of Catan. If you have a 12-year old sister, ask her to pastel some pretty mountains and fields on the hexes.

B004P95A8E|5.0|Bought this item for our eight year old grandson. He loves it. He was able to putit together all by himself in a short time and he has not lost interest with this toy.
0545265355|5.0|Bought this for my mother for xmas - I've already read them all.  Fun, quick, read and they are starting to make them into movies so it will be fun to watch those as they come out afterwards.
B0031ES8P6|4.0|My 2 year-old girl loved it.  Nicely done and very durable.  You can easily wash it in the machine if gets dirty.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this cd. Her voice is awesome and all the songs are great! Now my mom wants to keep it in her car!
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|To the 2 star reviewer: if the app works on the other 2 devices, why give the app a bad review? Ive had this app for a while, and while it got the job done, it had some real flaws. But w the update, its exactly w I need! Network capability is the key!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|How many movies do you see that completely out dare the incredulous stereotypes that plague today's movies? How many movies to you see that are so fresh and so original that, when the credits roll, you sit and think about what you just watched? That, my friends is the effect that \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" has on you. If you pay attention to the film, it makes you think.  \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" is a story of boy meets girl. Or at least, that's what the wry, deep-voiced narrator tells us as the film opens. Throughout the film, we follow the story of Tom Hansen and Summer Finn and their offbeat, complex relationship over 500 days (in no particular order). As the story progresses, we jump from present day to flashback countless times as we try to piece the intricate narrative together.Director Marc Webb makes a splash with this debut film. His indication on this film is strong, and the film is visually irresistible, with smooth, slick cinematography and a gorgeous color scheme that was designed to match the color of Zooey Deschanel's eyes, which, if you haven't noticed already, are the most beautiful pair of eyes in Hollywood. This is a film that, for better or worse, leaves a mark with its outstanding visual appeal.  The acting in this venture was superb. Stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel more than hold their own as a quirky romantic \\"couple.\\" Gordon-Levitt is very endearing and sympathetic right from his plate-smashing entrance. Part of the effect i think he has on the film is his boyish charm. He has everything he needs to be an effective protagonist: a warm smile, a good face, good sense of style and a good sense of comedic and dramatic timing. He makes us laugh, he mmakes us cry, and it could be debated that his side-splitting one-liners make this movie what it is.  The performance Deschanel turns in deserves its own paragraph, really. Summer is a complex character. She comes off as really shallow at times, but at other times seems uniquely deep-seated. Zooey Deschanel showcases enormous and effective talent with this performance, playing Summer with an effective technique; Summer is mysterious, confused, and, as we dive deeper into her, we discover that she is a bit of a tortured soul. Coming from a divorced family, she doesn't believe in love. She hasn't seen it work in her life. She believes that if you can't see it, it doesn't exist. This affects her and Tom's relationship in a poignant way.Now, the complexity of Summer's character doesn't justify her actions throughout the film. She claims that she's not looking for anything serious, but proceeds to have sex with Tom in a shower. Now, many of you say, and I concur, that Tom shouldn't take Summer's selfish, conceited bait. It's easy to see either character in different lights, depending on the depth of examination. The character development in this film is profound and moving in this way.  As far as soundtracks go, this film's soundtrack is among the best of the best. Artists such as Regina Spekter and Simon and Garfunkel contribute fine, fine pieces to the film, but it's artists such as The Temper Trap and Wolfmother that contribute the bulk of the emotional music. \\"Sweet Dispotition\\" by the Temper Trap plays a key role in the mood and tone of many scenes in the film. And Wolfmother's \\"Vagabond\\" provides a certain edge to a montage near the end that defines some of our final impression on the film. But of course we can't forget Regina Spekter's \\"Us,\\" which sets the mood for the film at the beginning.The writing in this film is witty and emotional. The dialogue is fairly natural and often hilarious. And the story is upbeat, off-beat, and strikingly original. We also see that this film makes several serious points about love, loss, relationships, and how they affect us on a definitive level. It's a smart, clever, and endearing comedy that stays with you long after the credits roll. This sets the bar and is easily a cut above the average romantic comedy; A refreshing five out of five!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|We were so glad to received this DVD to complete our set of Transformers. We spent the evening watching all 3 movies, one right after the other. It did make the story complete.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This is one of the best films ever and the best film of 2011.  Highly underrated and ignored by audience and critics alike.  I wouldn't reveal the plot, just watch the trailer and go for it.   Even if you are not a boxing, fight, action fan. This is more than just that, it  is emotional, intriguing, intense and with a meaning.  You will not regret watching it, in the end you will have tears in the eyes with a feeling of Triumph, of joy, of happiness.   Watch out for Nick Nolte's Oscar worthy performance, Tom Hardy's status as a superstar actor  and great direction.  I'd pay a $100 for this film if i have to, this film is one of the best today.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|By purchasing this DVD, we have now completed our series of the Twilght Sage to date. We had a great time watching them one evening. We can't wait for the next one to come out on DVD.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Loved loved loved loved this book! Can not wait for the movie to come out. This book would I think be enjoyed by all age's.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I read this book months ago and thrilled to know a movie was made. I've been anxiously awaiting the arrival to video. Watched \\"The Help\\" yesterday and LOVED it! The movie follows the book pretty closely. Wonderful story about a girl in the South named Skeeter. Skeeter was raised in a home whom had a black maid. As an adult, Skeeter enjoyed writing and got a job answering the newspapers equivalent of \\"Dear Abby for house cleaning.\\" Since Skeeter never cleaned her own home, she has asked one of the maids in the area to help with the answers. One day, after hearing the local white woman talking down to their help, Skeeter decides to try to interview the maids to get their view of working for the whites. This story takes place during a time when blacks could be lynched for any kind of \\"injustice\\" towards whites. Segregation of schools, churches, buses, bathrooms, etc. Will the maids agree to talk? Will anyone be killed for speaking to Skeeter? This movie is serious yet still has a lot of light hearted moments.<br /><br />This movie should be shown in history classes! Hard to believe all this happened less than 50 years ago right here in the US South.
B0055PMJMW|1.0|I am one unhappy client.  The product description should state if we are buying an abridged copy, a summary or a fully published text.  The reason why I have Kindle is so I can read, not have it summarized for me.  I thought that I was getting a great deal, only to find out that it was just a short story.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Midnight in Paris is just terrific.    I can't say anything without spoiling it for you - it is the best thing Woody Allen ever did -  the cast is terrific.    Owen Wilson is the best Heart Actor in the business.  His face tells a thousand stories and he literally wears his heart on his sleeve.  Don't miss this film and buy it.  Watch it!  Go to Paris and walk in the rain.
0553801473|2.0|The reviews already posted cover the main issues.  I am giving the book two stars instead of one for the strength of the writing- creating vivid scenes.  The book is too long for the amount of plot development that takes place and dwells too much on ideas that have been introduced and fleshed out already.  While the promise of the early books lingers, as a stand alone book A Dance with Dragons is tiresome.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play it at least once a day, if not more! Addictive! can't say any thing bad about it. definitely down load.
B006JTS5OO|1.0|I sat through this painful mess of a movie when it was released in the theatres. Honestly, I thought it wasn't possible to ruin a Muppet movie, or anything involving the Muppets for that matter, but this director and screenwriter managed to pull it off. It was so terrible I don't know where to start. Oh, let's try right from the beginning.  Almost THIRTY MINUTES to develop a main character who is a Muppet playing a human being who wants to be a Muppet? THAT'S the big lead in? It should have taken 10 minutes of screen time, including the horrific song and dance which should have been shortened by two thirds. None of these characters, the aforementioned Muppet human, his human brother and his brother's fiance' are interesting in the least. This is the best story line the author could come up with? My girlfriend and I came up with 3 better storylines, which included much more screen time and jokes for the Muppets, during the 20 minute drive back home.  The best parts of this movie required no thought, and that's exactly what it appears the author and director put into actually putting it on screen. A recreation of the old Muppets show (again, which could have been MUCH better), didn't have nearly enough gags (where was Lew Zealand? The Electric Mayhem? Pigs in Space?!?!), and wasted what could have been a GREAT guest star slot with Jack Black. The whole \\"Telethon\\" bit falls flat on its face. The best parts of the recreated show and this movie in its entirety are remakes of scenes lifted straight out of the Muppet Movie. The old songs, like the wonderful Why Are There So Many Songs About Rainbows, are also the best in this film. For all those who love the Muppets (including me) this was a travesty and an insult to Jim Henson and all the memories he created for us. Muppet lovers are better served by petitioning for the release of The Muppet Movie on Blu-ray and buying up copies of Muppets Take Manhattan (a disappointing second Muppet feature that is worlds away better than this mess of a film) and Muppets In Space.  When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was ecstatic. I never dreamed that someone could take a beloved franchise like the Muppets and destroy it in roughly two hours.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|This is a review of the movie itself, not of the quality of the DVD or Blue-ray. I admit I was impressed. I was a bit worried that Hollywood would attempt to cram in too much in this \\"prequel\\" but they didn't.  They addressed the two main concerns that I'm sure all Planet of the Apes fans had on their minds: how do the apes come into power and what happens to the humans. Neither of these was over dramatized, and both were completely believable.<br /><br />James Franco plays Will Rodman, a doctor who is working on a drug to cure Alzheimer's. His father, played by John Lithgow, is suffering from it.  Just when experiments on chimps is making great progress, an accident happens and the head of the research facility shuts the lab down. He orders the chimps to be put down, but one of the assistants discovers a baby chimp in one of the cages and sends it home with Will. Will continues to develop the drug and to track the baby chimp's intelligence, which was passed on from his mother. Will names the baby Caesar.<br /><br />Three years later Will's father is improving because he's been given the drug, but he soon begins to lapse because his immune system starts to fight off the virus.  Will talks the research facility into trying a new strain of virus, but when one doctor is exposed to it we soon learn that the new virus is harmful to humans.  Meanwhile, Caesar is shipped off to a primate facility after an accident involving a neighbor, where he meets other chimps for the first time and his army is soon formed.<br /><br />Once these two story lines are set up, there's a good thirty minutes of nonstop action as the primates plan and carry out their escape. Before you know it, the movie is over!  But like I said before, it isn't pushed too far and the ending was quite satisfying to me.  My only complaint about the movie is that the CGI effects with Caesar in some places is a bit fake looking, but most of the time it looks great.  I'm sure they pushed their limits here in order to give Caesar those closer-to-human qualities and emotions, which actually do tug at your heart strings as they were probably intended to do.<br /><br />Lots of emotion!  Lots of action!  A very satisfying story which is exactly what Apes finally needed on the big screen!to-human qualities and emotions, which actually do tug at your heart strings as they were probably intended to do.  Lots of emotion!  Lots of action!  A very satisfying story which is exactly what Apes finally needed on the big screen!
B004U52VPS|4.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas and even though he hasn't actually played it according to the rules yet, he enjoys setting up the pieces on his own and trying to knock them down with the birds.  He loves Angry Birds and was excited to get the game.  I have seen the game sold cheaper in other stores, so I would look around first before purchasing it through Amazon.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I was here to buy 'A Dance with Dragons' after finishing with 'A Feast for Crows'.  Feast was published in 2005  it's been 6 years and now they want 15 bucks for the kindle edition of 'Dragons?  Nope, sorry, it's back to used books for me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game. All ages can play this game. It does challenge you so you have to use your mind. Great game for beginners or skilled players.
B0037BB00I|1.0|Not much to say about this album. Well, her voice is very annoying and she's not a good singer either. Definitely find something else.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it was a really well made game and allows a lot of freedom for the players. also you should get it.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Now this is what I call a good album. I love her voice. It's very unique. This album deserves more than 5 stars. :)
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja is really fun and addicting! We have this game on the Kindle Fire and it works perfectly. The big screen makes it more enjoyable. My six year old brother also loves this game, and wants to add on... :  I like bblades it is exciting and wowing and bolty.  There you have it! He is one happy camper :)
B006C1DH92|4.0|a good app, don't get me wrong. but its nothing special if you already own fruit ninja. Its the same game
B005LJK3AC|1.0|I really don't get how this movie even has 3 stars because it was one of the worst movies I've seen. I kept skipping forward hoping it would get better but I couldn't even finish watching it.  I like most of the actors but their roles were just stinky and Aniston just continues to churn out more of her.... whatever it is that she churns out and it is definitely not good. At least I only wasted 99 cents but I feel bad for people who actually went to the theater for this.
B000001EEN|5.0|From a time when Eric Clapton was completely at the bottom of his life with drugs, alcohol, and with great sadness that Pattie Boyd gave him her NO! 3 years earlier. His friend Pete Townshend gave him a little of the good life back. Many of the tracks are from \\"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\\" and recorded live with high quality. Pattie Boyd was also at the concert and all the songs were for her. If you are happy to hear Eric Clapton is this CD a \\"must-have\\". The soul gets deep ...  Ole Nielsen / Denmark  Translated from Danish to English via Google
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! It has all sorts of fruit facts! And there are lots of cool things to unlock! So I give this game 5stars!
B003ASLJRW|5.0|An excellent western about an ancient ghost who helps the helpless miners who faced superior forces. Maybe Clint Eastwood's best western ever!  Picture and sound are the finest quality and many levels better than the DVD version. I highly recommend this movie.   Make a good cup of coffee and make it comfortable for yourself when you see this movie. :o)  Ole Nielsen / Denmark
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I don't think its that good bt mi.opinions don't count its a game that does nt work the way u want
B002MQYOFW|5.0|not normally my type of read but it is now.  was very captivating and i enjoyed every page.  read all 3 books.  very impressive to me :)
B00004YRQA|5.0|you know what nobody misses about the ps2? Buying memory cards... wanted to play an old game and had to purchase a memory card - works great.
0385534639|4.0|I really enjoyed The Night Circus. Right away I was swept into her style of writing. I felt like I was actually at this magical circus. She described everything so perfectly. I really loved it, and have already purchased it for a few of my friends.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Heard this was good and picked it up - was blown away by how powerful her voice is and how moving the album can be at times
B005HSG3U6|2.0|Although this case is nice, it is a really bulky. Also, it is really overpriced, there is no reason for it to cost this much.
B0063IH60K|4.0|several options on scoring.  fairly. challenging but still a.le to win if you pay attention.  I tend go play this game when I only have a few minutes to play.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|this game never gets old and its very addictive. works great on my T-Mobile G2x. its my time passer on the subway
B001UV4XHY|5.0|For fans, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 will not disappoint but does not have excitement of other Harry Potter movies.  But it does leave the viewer with the anticipation to hurry and get to the next movie (part 2).  Hollywood figured out a way to double their money by making part 1 and 2. For the non-fan, save your money and go back to the beginning.  For the Harry Potter fan, it is a must.
B003VANOFY|2.0|My computer desk has Logitech everything; mouse, keyboard, speakers, webcam, the works. I was really excited to add this headset to the collection given all the success I have had with all my other Logitech products.   Sadly, this headset did not live up to the standard of quality I have come to expect from Logitech. I had several gripes pertaining to the virtual 7.1 surround as well as general sound quality, along with the microphone not working in-game even after maxing all voice levels and fiddling with it for a good 20 minutes.  The surround works, just not well. Even after fine tuning all my settings, sounds were off. I could hear nothing directly in front of me and everything else sounded distant. Explosions didn't quite have the depth or presence that you would expect, often sounding hollow, like they were somewhere else rather than close by. General sound quality wasn't terrible. At times it was a little flat but what bugged me the most was that the speakers popped and buzzed right out of the box. Sometimes sound cut out all together making for a less than decent listening experience.   The thing I did like about this headset was the G-keys and volume control. Both being located on the side of the headset made it easy to perform commands or alter volume while still playing. Logitech put a lot of effort into the design of this headset; they just need to focus a little more on the functionality.  Overall, if you are looking into getting this headset I would recommend you go with the G35 instead. It is the wired version of these same headphones and I think many of my listening issues were caused by the wireless.
B00006CXSS|1.0|The only 'fact' worth speaking about from this caricature of a movie is the fact that E company suffered a 150% death rate (in other words, that its members were killed and replaced 1.5 times before war's end).  Very few soldiers made it to the end of the war on either side unlike this overglorified depiction.  Some of the more gratuitous passages in this miniseries were the liberation of concentration camps in episode 8: entitled 'Why We Fight', where it depicts the SS officer's widow scrabbling to bury dead prisoners and infers by the scene that the Germans exceeded other nationalities in organized cruelty.  People watching the miniseries forget that Hitler's Germany was a prison and anyone (Jew, German or anyone else of any rank) contradicting the authorities met a similar fate to those in the prison camps--independence was not tolerated.  The movie calls the concentration camps such as Landsberg am Lech in Germany presumptuously a \\"death camp\\" but what is conveniently forgotten by the miniseries is that NO concentration camp in territorial Germany was a \\"death camp\\" (designed primarily for killing 'undesireables'), these were apparently sited outside of Germany proper, in Eastern Europe.<br /><br />The miniseries is also factually wrong on the death toll; the International Red Cross (which had access to the camps throughout the war) holds that the numbers dying in the German internment camp system during the war were about 500,000.  Why then does this movie and others like it keep promoting 'the 6 million' number or some other variant (as this miniseries does) 'the 6 million jews + 5 million other nationalities'? [This author believes that the German numbers are inflated in order to make the annihilation of Ukrainian kulaks (8 million), Orthodox priests (300,000) and other non-communist Russians (more than 40 million) by our \\"illustrious\\" ally, Bolshevik Russia, seem more reasonable and palatable.  As this logic goes, if the Germans were more murderous than Stalin, they deserved destruction and punishment.  The fact that they were less, even much less cruel than the communist Russians, calls into question our involvement in this war, our national judgment and our choice of allies].<br /><br />What is not explained by the miniseries (in fact, nothing contextual is explained at all, leaving viewers in their prejudices and biases) was that the camp in question was an internment camp that had lost its supply of food and pesticide due to American Army Air Corps aerial bombardment of rail lines supplying the camp.  Without resupply, the camps became isolated starvation centers by default.  The miniseries also badly misstates medical knowledge of refeeding syndrome that existed at the time.  In the movie, the brigade surgeon (doctor) is seen warning the soldiers not to give the prisoners food due to their starved condition.  This is a scene concocted by ex post facto screenwriting. In actual fact, once \\"liberated\\", most camps were bombarded with food from extra K-rations provided the prisoners by well-meaning soldiers.  This abundance of food killed approximately 50% of the surviving camp inmates due to the great electrolyte imbalances caused by too much food, too quickly.  Medical knowledge thus came AFTER and as direct result of the  liberation experience, Americans killing more inmates than they saved by their 1940's-era lack of understanding about how to feed prisoners that were starving.  In general, this miniseries is another whitewash of American intentions concerning intervention (first, to stop Hitler from invading other countries and later, because of mistreatment of other nationalities), general confusion about the war and is a one-sided display of American \\"justificationalism\\".  About the only thing that was true was the willingness of American soldiers to loot private (non-public) German property (wine cellars, alcohol, restaurant silver utensils, \\"war souvenirs\\") at every turn and claim somehow that we were the 'good guys'.  This series isn't history folks but it looks so enticing, many people think that it is!es isn't history folks but it looks so enticing, many people think that it is!

B003UAKE9Y|4.0|My kids really enjoyed watching this movie. My 5 year old  would watch it over and over if I was to let her.
B00402FGEE|5.0|It is great- character development, beautiful imagery, great actors! I loved it from day one- and yes it starts slow- that is what is called \\"building your story and character identity.\\"  Not all of us have the attention span of a fly, and we like plots and story lines that have some substance.   SyFy and MGM made a HUGE mistake cancelling this show.  (Hmmm- maybe that is why MGM is bankrupt and syfy is showing wrestling- no one really knows how to run a good entertainment organization.)
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is my favorite game.  But there should be a way to sync my iPod version to it.  I've beat the game already, but I like getting the new boxes.  Also, the game is a little glitchy.  Awesome though, and I love that I can see it better bc of the Kindle Fire screen!  Thanks!
B006C45MRE|4.0|First of all, the title should tell you what you need to know. If you can get past that, you will notice two of the best actors around (my opinion). Overall, I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if it were on TV or in the free category. Worth renting if you are into action, old west action, decent story lines, or aliens.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Now this is what amazon needs exclusive apps and games perfect runs great on galaxy s2 woooooooooooow again and I rarely comment

067144901X|5.0|My husband and I have been reading this book to our son before bedtime and naps since he was 4 or 5 months old.  He smiles or even laughs when we sit down with him and pull out the book.  He loves the adorable animal illustrations and hearing us make the funny sounds.  And since it's a board book, he can't destroy it.
B005EWDAFQ|4.0|Dr Alex Hoffman is an intensely private, brilliant physicist who has developed a series of algorithms capable of predicting, with uncanny accuracy, how stockmarkets will react to events.  His investment company has made him - and others - a billionaire off the calculations of his artificially intelligent VIXAL-4 super-computer.  He is happily (if somewhat improbably) married and has built his company with a partner who has the social skills that he lacks.  One night Hoffman is awoken by the sound of an intruder in the house - the catalyst in a chain of events that over the next 24 hours will end some lives, cause those close to him to doubt his sanity and potentially may bring down the global economy.<br /><br />It took a little while for this thriller to pull me in.  The tension takes some time to build.  I didn't particularly care for any of the characters, none of whom (with the possible exception of Hoffman) felt very believable.  However it's deftly written and even as I started to work out parts of the plot and where the story might be going, other elements kept me guessing.  It's a strange change of pace for Harris, reading more like a Michael Crichton novel than a Robert Harris one.  It has the scientific edge that I associate with Crichton's books, it's highly topical and grounded in recent events.  It's also very readable - I tore through it in a day.  So where's the problem?  It's more shallow than I expect Harris's writing to be.  The plot doesn't have a massive twist, some some small kinks.  I read it happily enough, but I don't think it will stay with me.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I wanted some type of organizational app for the Kindle Fire. I chose this mostly for the price and it's really handy. I can create lists (to-do, grocery, etc) and note appointments.  There are different colored notes to choose from and it seems you can assign titles to certain colors but I haven't been able to figure that out. I'm sure it is easier than I'm making it!

B006C1DH92|5.0|The original Fruit Ninja would not work properly on either my Droid Pro or my Galaxy Tab; this new iteration works very well on both, and is a ton of fun (well, the graphics are not perfect on the tablet - the edges of the fruit look a little rough - but it's minor and does not detract from the game play).  Don't know what it is about aggressively slicing fruit...but somehow it's strangely satisfying!

Mostly, my thoughts were on the brother locked in the cupboard though.  I, too, wondered why the father didn't immediately ask where the boy was and get him at that point.  The little boy haunted me so much that I lost the point of the story for awhile.  Other than the unrealistic reactions of both parents to the welfare of their children, it was a well written \\"can't put it down\\" book.  It is still very heavy on my mind.  Very haunting.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|There are essentially three very moving tales in this excellent film. Viewers hoping to learn about what happens to people after death, whether there is something or nothing, will be disappointed, because this is not the film's purpose. The hereafter is a backdrop to the three tales that Clint Eastwood directs and Matt Damon acts in very well.<br /><br />One story is about the character played by Damon. He discovers that he has the ability to see and hear a dead relative of a person who he touches. But he has no idea where the dead person is or what life is like after death. He is traumatized by this ability. He feels that it is a curse rather than a blessing. He realizes that his ability helps others and makes them feel good, but he feels that it ruins his own life. He wants to live like other people. He doesn't even want others to know about his ability. We see an episode where he is virtually compelled to use his ability and the effect that it has on him. He is searching for a normal life and we watch to see if it is attainable.<br /><br />The second story, which, as the third, ultimately entwines in Damon's story, is about a highly successful French female reporter who is pronounced dead after being drowned in a tsunami. She experiences the well-known phenomenon of a person seeing a white light and moving towards the light. However, she recovers. She has difficulty getting over what she has seen and it affects her life.<br /><br />The third tale is about two male pre-teen young twins. They are unusually close; very loving toward each other. This is especially so because their mother, who they love dearly is an alcoholic and uses drugs. One of the twins is killed when a truck hits him, and the other mourns him greatly. He searches for someone to help him communicate with his brother.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Just as amazing as when we originally watched it on AMC!! Excellent show and for those who are catching up to season two, it's a must to purchase!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app, I can get all the weather info I need in one place. very easy to configure and use
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This film is wonderful.  I went to see it with my wife and best friend in theaters and we all laughed, cried, and screamed with delight.  It is an awesome movie, watch it with your Dad or pseudo-dad.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Drawing Pad is the best Drawing App I've seen in a long time. It works great on the Kindle Fire and is worth the price.
B005URRCNQ|5.0|Loved the vinyl version of this bands latest album.  It comes with the CD of it as well, an added bonus.  Thanks for getting it to me before Christmas!
B004LZFWJO|2.0|this is one of those match three games, but this one makes it easier where you can swipe up, down, sideways in the same swipe.  Boring game, not worth paying for.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Used the Kindle for Android application over Google's Books due to ease of access when not connected to the internet (subways, remote locations, etc.). The latest update (12/27/2011) made the file 9MB+, which is way too big an application. I've uninstalled the application, and not sure if I will be using it or Kindle Books again. Uninstalled Facebook (which reduced usage without detriment to social life) for the same reason. Time to take another look at Google's book app.
B0043GXYBO|3.0|Marked is written by mother and daughter team. And, you can almost tell when the daughter is writing because it sounds like a teenager!<br /><br />The series- I've not read, but I read Marked when I needed a breather from reading other books. I almost didn't read it because of the vampire twist, but these are fledgling vampire-to-be who attend a boarding school that serves healthy non-calorie laden foods to the students.<br /><br />There is a love interest, but he's not identified until a third into the book because the first third sets up the premise that vampires are a race \\"apart\\" not just for their eating habits but because they honor Nyx, Goodess of the Four Elements: earth, wind, fire and water. Nyx comes to the lead in a dream sequence that seems long and drawn out, but in the end it is necessary so that the protagonist can \\"asend\\" and take the Dark Ritual away from a vicious antagonist.<br /><br />So, I'm 46. It would of taken me one and half days of night reading to crunch this book, but it was longer because I kept getting tired of angst. But, if you have a 14 to 17 who doesn't read much and is into vamps then this is a good series (five books) for them.
B004AKCME8|4.0|Quality was great but it was missing case.  Shipment was great and timely.  If you put case picture , it should have it.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love this show for all the action, acting and story lines that come with it. It has such original ways of telling about each monster they have to fight. The acting is what truly keeps this show going though, they have great writing as well. I swear it's like your sons or brothers out there fighting for you in the way you don't want them to get hurt. I love the Impala as well and I'm not a Chevy guy.
B006C1DH92|3.0|It is a fun idea, but unfortunately it is fairly inaccurate. It was marking that I had &quot;sliced&quot; bombs that were on the opposite side of the screen from where my finger was at. I will have to try out the original game and see if it's less buggy.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Quick shipment great price.  Very pleased with item it was exactly what I wanted and came quickly.  Will buy from this amazon dealer again.
B004U52VPS|2.0|Hmmm, I don't get it.  I bought this game for the kids for Christmas, as it was all the rage, and it is fairly dumb.  You build these plastic structures that are very flimsy and barely stand on their own, then use a cheap plastic catapult to launch a round soft plastic \\"bird\\" face at the structure.  OK ...  I guess you had to have the app and like it to appreciate this game.  It just strikes me they have a pointless, insipid game trying to copy a computer program in real life.  Grrr, waste of  money!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Quick shipment great price.  Very pleased with item it was exactly what I wanted and came quickly.  Will buy from this amazon dealer again.
B004LWZW4W|3.0|at the end of the film, they suggest that the genetic gas drug that made the apes intelligent is going to kill off the humans. the lab guy that got exposed to it eventually died and then the pilot was displaying similar symptoms, so that's it. it's going to spread like wildfire and kill all the humans. but there are clearly humans in the future planet of the apes, both in the original and in the 2000 remake. yeah i'm sure it's possible that some humans survive and leave a small residual population of humans on earth but that's not what they suggest.   also, towards the end of the film when the super-intelligent apes bust out of the lab and start liberating other apes in nearby zoos, the normal apes act just as intelligent as the gassed ones as if suggesting that by simply co-mingling with them they become intelligent.  it was a decent attempt to adapt a 60s throwback (this is re-write of the 4th planet of the apes movie - return to the planet of the apes) into a modern day version with mass market appeal. but if you're going to go ahead and change 96% of the plot, you might as well go ahead and not be burdened by having to be true to the original at all. james franco and john lithgow do not really make this movie great.   in the original version of this movie, a plague kills off all the dogs and cats in the world, so people begin domesticating apes. eventually they realize that apes are much smarter than they seem and are capable of accomplishing simple jobs. the US enters a weird era of fascism in which the Ape Management bureau (whose uniforms resemble nazis) turn apes into indentured servants. conditioning them with the word 'no' (that's why caesar says no). caesar is the son of cornelius who ends up in a present day earth due to time-travelling events in earlier planet of the apes movies. might sound cheesier and lame but i like it better than this special effects laden version. dumb ape costumes and all.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Quick shipment great price.  Very pleased with item it was exactly what I wanted and came quickly.  Will buy from this amazon dealer again.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|The game is very user friendly. Still wish they would include tutorial but what do you expect for free. Still pretty cool.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I think its an very Enjoyable Blu-Ray Movie and I belive its just the Title COWBOYS&ALIENS a bit of a turn off...? All around great Action /  cool Special Effects / Great Creature Effects ...? Blu-Ray Picture Quality is Perfect & Sound Effects are pretty good too...? Take it as it is COOL Entertaining...? Thats all we want...? 4 Stars
B005ZUR724|1.0|the game keeps saying i need an update but there are no updates for the game. someone please fix this because i was playing this morning and i would very much like to continue my game because i paid for 3 months of this.
1451648537|5.0|If you are a fan of Apple/Macintosh, which I am, this is great reading. This book is easy to read and captivating. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005ZUR724|1.0|This game should not be available for sale if needed updates are unavailable. As of December 26th 2011, the game is unplayable due to having an outdated app.  Yet, it remains available for purchase.  Money spent on this game is simply money wasted at this time.
B0058RN85O|5.0|I got this for my mother for Christmas and she was so excited when she opened it and saw what it was. We will soon be having a marathon to watch it all. This has to be one of the funniest TV shows around. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes comedy.
B005IGDW24|1.0|This was a giant mainstream advertising ploy  with smurfs running around in the background, watching the old cartoons is a better choice
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I was gifted this item as a Christmas present and I love it! The packaging is great and, despite what I am reading in some negative reviews, the image looks great in my opinion. I've definitely enjoyed all of the cool special features and I think it would make a great gift for any Jurassic Park fan.<br />I am very critical of both the physical and digital quality of my disks, and I honestly have nothing negative to say about this set.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|First of all, i have to say the artwork is pretty good. I had read many negative reviews, mostly complaining about the changes...i really dont mind most of them, and i really like quite a few. Many hours of extras, documentaries, etc, plus the 6 movies make it well worth the money.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for as long as I can remember. I was so happy to finally get this movie on Blu-ray! There are loads of neat and new special features and the disk is easy to navigate, which is definitely good. Like just about every blu-ray, the packaging is good and sturdy. This is a definite must have :)
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Loved this Christmas CD.  I played this as I decorated my Christmas Tree.  Just the right mood.  I truly hope this duo continues recording as I intend to purchase everything they record.
1419702238|5.0|Got this book for my nephew, it was the only one in his collection he was missing. Absolutely loves it. Book arrived on time and in excellent condition.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|This movie, in my opinion, was twice as good as the Arnold movies. This portrayed Conan's character more faithfully to the REH books. Arnold was more the comic book Conan. Having said that, I did think the story line was a little weak and why are the bad guys always killing off his family and village? Conan didn't need a reason to rid the world of a bad sorcerer, and the fact that it jumps 15 or 20 years into the future was a little off putting. But over all the action and dynamic of the movie was worth it.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Got this in a timely manner. Really enjoyed it.  Great stories.  Some funny, some kind of sad.  Would like to be able to think like Jane does.  I especially like how you can click and watch all episodes or the other way; pick out the specific one you want.  Great buy.  Bought all 3 seasons.
0385341008|5.0|Great book for book club members.  Discussion questions in back of book helpful.  Book came quickly and in good condition.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great Movie!  So much fun to watch for the whole family and we've all been quoting the movie ever since. Saw the movie at a family function on Thanksgiving and had to order it for Christmas.
B006C1DH92|5.0|The sort is much nice and it's more fun with the acts. I didn't understand the big deal before but this is great. And I didn't know of it's existence before it was faotd. Thanks Amazon. It also works great on Samsung Note.
0689878451|5.0|This is a true story about to male penguins in the Central Park Zoo who have formed a romantic bond.  A zookeeper noticed that Roy and Silo were trying to create a family by sitting on a rock the way other female penguins sat on their unhatched eggs.  One penguin couple gave birth to two eggs, and were only capable of taking care of one.  So that very sensitive zookeeper took one egg and put it in the nest Roy and Silo created.  They kept the egg warm and reared their baby together.<br />This is a very well told, simple story that teaches young children that there are many types of families, not just ones that mirror our own.  It's an important book to share with our kids.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love Kik, I use it more than SMS text messages on my cell phone now.  If it wasn't blocked from the Fire, I'd rate it 5 stars, and if it was possible, I'd give it 5.5 stars! ;)
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I'm a long-time Intel processor fan, and the i7-2600K no doubt continues that tradition.  I don't have anything to add, from a technical perspective, that hasn't already been covered here, so I'll focus on a few things that matter to me.  First, I don't keep up with the latest, greatest in computer hardware these days.  I needed a new workstation for the house, and this processor looked like it would fit the bill.  So far, I've not been disappointed.  When paired with a SSD, my system flies.  CPU intensive tasks like transcoding videos now take a fraction of the time they did on my previous Intel Q6600.    I know the stock Intel CPU cooler isn't very well respected by most enthusiasts, but to-date, it has met my needs.  After hours of gaming or transcoding, I'm seeing a maximum temperature of around 45C using the stock cooler.  To be fair, I've not tried overclocking this processor yet, and if and when I do, my CPU cooling needs may change.  But, I think that provided you have a good case with a good cooling solution working there, the Intel CPU cooler should at least get you by for a while.  Anyway, I'm quite happy with this purchase.  As an \\"old\\" IT guy, this processor has been a breath of fresh air.  The prospect of overclocking this thing has me looking forward to tinkering with hardware again for the first time in a very long time.    Regardless of what you're planning to do with this CPU, it is the typical high-quality you'd expect from Intel.  I'd have no reservations in recommending this to anybody.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|Nice to see a live action version of the story. It's heavily adapted with some odd changes to the original story but still fun to watch.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|She is fabulous!!!   The cd is perfect!!!   All the songs are great!!!!   I love Adele...   Thanks.   Luis - Piracicaba - SP - Piracicaba - Brazil.
B004U52VPS|5.0|After opening the Angry Birds game, my grandson disappeared .  All we heard out of him was the crashing of the pieces....he loves this game...age 6
B003VR5PPY|5.0|So far I'm finding 999 to be excellent! I'm suprised how hard it is for me to put it down.    Being a visual novel, there is alot of story-telling and dialogue. I think its great - I love hearing the other characters comment and tell their stories. I found it was easy to become interested with the characters, the plot, and your own fate.   There are 6 endings to this game that are influenced by your decisions, particularly which doors you take.  Not all areas can be reached during one playthrough, so second time around you can experience totally new rooms and perspectives with different characters. The only downside of the replay is that you only have one save-file and have to fast-forward much of the same intro and dialogue.   One concern I had before I played was that the puzzles would be randomly complicated or tedious (aka some Myst puzzles - although I love Myst don't get me wrong). However, I found everything quite solve-able if you just think it through a bit + the characters will actually help you out a bit if you taking a while. On that note however, if you are looking for a super-challenge puzzle game this probably isn't it. But anyway, I found the puzzles enjoyable and appropriate.   Regarding the graphics, I think this game used the DS format nicely. The environment looks pretty good and helps the atmosphere (+easy to navigate)and the characters have some nice animations with their moods + dialogue.   Overall, I definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy a suspenseful (pseudo-creepy) puzzle visual novel game. I've found it to be very fun and I look forward to playing again to see what will happen this time!
B006C1DH92|2.0|but it keeps force closing after i played twice. samsung captivate. i tried opening it countless number of times but it wint open! i have reinstall it twice&amp; it still wont open. otherwise i would give it a five star
1439192812|5.0|They say that truth is stranger than fiction. It's certainly more fascinating. Dawkins' book points out that behind many things we call mundane are some incredible discoveries waiting to be made, and thanks to science, they can be just as exciting and beautiful as any fairytale, with the added benefit that you'll never grow up to find it was all make believe.
B00020QXDG|5.0|When I was growing up, My uncle gave me a eight track tape of this album. I wore this album out and I replaced it with the vinyl album that had more of the show. Years later i found out that the album had been expanded and now the complete show is available to purchase as a import. This is my favorite live album and it sounds great in the headphones. The sound is so clear. This is a great live album by the King of Rock Music.
0385534639|5.0|The book is so much better if you do not know what is going on and you figure it out for yourself. A fantastic, magical read! Enjoy yourself a little with this one!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|silly but fun game to help waste your day away. wouldn't buy this game but it us free in the market.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Downloaded to a kindle fire, runs very smooth and the graphics are beautifully done. My son and I cant stop playing.  We are even fighting over moms kindle lol ! This is fantastic for a free app.. to be honest.. I would have even paid for this one. So if your wondering wether to try it or not.. yes. Best free app I have gotten so far in the market.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|Wow, this is an amazing film. It starts off with the members of Pearl Jam (and other grunge star Chris Cornell) talking about the demise of Mother Love Bone, the band that included soon to be members of Pearl Jam. Then it moves onto them meeting Eddie Vedder and the band's long and great career from Ten all the way up to now. You will learn so much about the band from this. I am a huge Pearl Jam fan and found that I didn't know many things that were included in this documentary. Highly recommended to any Pearl Jam fans
B005ZUR724|5.0|how do I update the game? it does not show up in the &quot;update available&quot; section please help, id love to be able to play again
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|My son loves this show, so of course wanted the CD of their songs. He played it over and over again, so I know all the songs now too! It was shipped quickly, and was sealed in original wrapper.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I purchased this during Amazon's screamin' deal on Black Friday (my only Black Friday purchase).  When it came, I was doubly delighted as the 8-disc set was in a compact box about the width of 3 regular DVD boxes, instead of an obnoxious larger box that takes up way too much room on my DVD shelf.  Yes, there are fancier boxed sets out there, but I just wanted it for the movies, not for a collection, so this was perfect.  The fact that it arrived just 4 days after I ordered it was an added bonus.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|My son got this DVD as well as Part 2, and he was in heaven. He loves Transformers and watched this movie the first night he got it. It came brand new in sealed plastic wrap and was shipped quickly.
B005UG542S|4.0|That this is *not* the HD version of this movie, only the SD. I searched quite a bit on the Amazon website for how to order+download the HD version for TiVo, but it seems you can only get this by ordering through your TiVo's interface. I'm pretty sure it is worth the extra dollar for HD rental as this is in a very wide letterbox format.  And still no captions on Amazon video downloads, I find this inexcusable.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Have been waiting for it since it was announced last month! Love the game!  Now please also update the original fruit ninja to the same level as the iOS version!
B005ZUR724|1.0|Tablets, and especially the Fire, were the big gift this year.  What a shame when so many people have a new product not to have apps that work.  Kindle owners, don't spend money on this until, or if, they decide to fix it.  They already cancelled it as a Facebook game as well.
1442346949|5.0|Seriously, just about anyone would emjoy this book.  I bought 1 HC book and one book on tape to give as gifts and those who received it keep expressing their thanks.  It's a must read.  Great job Walter!
1419702238|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old daughter who has read all the books in this series.  The price is as good as any other retailer.  She read the whole thing in just 3 days so I would say it was another good one by this author.
B00030DEQE|5.0|Literally plug and play. Plugged it into a PCI slot, hooked the network cable and once the PC started Windows 7 64 detected the new hardware and installed the required drivers (did not need to use the companion CD). Without any additional fine tuning I now have a gigabit link between the PC and the home router, which does make a difference in the overall network performance.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I never thought I would finish this series in a month... the beginning of the first book -so slow - tedious to read. But, an amazing finish is what I was to find. I really was just reading this at first to go to sleep quickly, then I stayed up all night to finish it and bought the rest of the series the next day. Don't miss out on this you will regret it. :)
145551389X|5.0|LOVE this book!! amazing photos of the beautiful Gaga. will have lots of joy with this book! and it's really cheap as well! every Gaga fan should have this book ;)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read this book after seeing a preview for the movie. I was intrigued by the idea behind the story. My friend lent me her book and I couldn't put it down. I read all three of the books within four days. All of them are quite the page turners. :)
B005H0IW6W|3.0|loved his other works, this one didnt seem to make it for me. Although, it was Upbeat and positive, nice for the holidays.
B001K3ENEA|4.0|I bought these for my project studio, and they work well. They have a great sound. They are not amazing, but for what they cost, they are good. I cannot wear them for more than 3 hours. They get uncomfortable and hot. This can be a problem in a long recording or mixing session, but I can deal with it I suppose. I want the AKG702 next. Eventually work up to the Grado. My gear has to be upgraded first.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|I bought this for the wife but actually enjoyed her driving beats and cathy tunes. Recommend this to any Rihanna fans.
B006C1DH92|4.0|Fun, addictive. If you like Fruit Ninja, you will enjoy this. Minor changes to FN gameplay keep it fun and worthwhile even if you have the original.  No leaderboards WTF? The iOS version has them, but they're missing here. Odd.
B00005QGAX|5.0|What can you say about Michael jackson other than he was a supreme artist , musician, and songwriter. There isn't a bad song on this album. Recommend it to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Big enough to see the cards.  Some of the solitaire games are so tiny they hurt my eyes but this one doesn't.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|I really enjoyed viewing this film as I have always like spy films etc. Leo does a great job in the film.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|I've got 38 years of snow under my feet and I have to say, this is a pretty amazing video. Great work!
B000002H92|5.0|A friend suggested that I buy this live concert CD as I am a doors fan. It is surprisingly awesome and I wish I could have seen them live. Highly recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|simple but smart. great UI. shopping lists, travel checklist, media to download later. access from any device. I sometimes use to not forget hotel room number.
B003405MF6|5.0|Killer new album for you Jeff beck fans out there. JB just keeps getting better with age. Highly recommended. I saw this show performed live in Tulsa.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game rocks I love shooting the birds at the pigs.........great game for your kindle fire and great for all ages
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was fun,  but I cant get past the fish game.now I cant play any other game because its locked
B003CFBQBW|5.0|This cd was just as awesome as the one before it. I love the variety in artists and sounds. Buy it, it's great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very good and well written book. It will have you hooked before you can finish the first chapter. It was a really exciting read and even had me tear up a bit ,and thats an amazing feat. I would definitly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice read.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I bought this cd for a friend for Christmas because she had to have it. She loves it and I have to admit that the music is pleasant to the ear.
B006C1DH92|4.0|That said, why won't Amazon let me download this with my 4g connection?  Having to hook onto wireless is not convenient.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|This cd was awesome. It had lots of different artists and different types of music. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|no problems with app, good selection of traditional solitaire... hope you enjoy it too why do I have to have
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I am ever so thankful my synapses fire precisely as they do, for this is emphatically among my top 10 favorite books of all time. To be saddled with a brain that didn't find joy in the prose of this work ... ahhh, what a tragedy. You one- and two-star reviewers are trapped in a world less colorful, less fun, less worth living in.  Yes, if you are one of those poor unfortunates whose serotonin receptors don't go into overdrive when confronted with a stunningly beautiful and original string of words, this book is not for you. If you believe all creative works should reflect only the world as you think it ought to be--rather than how it is, or how it might be--this book is not for you. If you believe all fictional characters should only reflect your highest moral ideals, then this book is not for you (nor, perhaps, any other work of fiction).  As for the rest of you lucky readers--you'll swoon by page two.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love this show. Can't wait to see the next season. The story is unique and the characters are fantastic. This is the best show on tv.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Just like how I remmbered it in the theaters!   Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorites.  2+3 are just the cherry on top of the cake but worthless.
0156027321|1.0|Sorry, but all the attention and praise escape me.  This book is ridiculous.  As I read I kept asking, \\"What is the point here?\\", and still don't know.  The writing and \\"plot\\" seem insincere, as if solely crafted to sell.<br /><br />This book is to literature what Taylor Swift is to music.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|The case is thin and ridged; exactly what I wanted.  The thin rubber coating around the edges are starting to wear off after a month's use.  The back support is almost useless; it slips easily and the angle is non-adjustable.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Finally, after fifteen years of mostly spotty and seemingly hastily put together films, Woody seems to have invested more time and money in this one, and produced a winner.<br /><br />The plot of 'Midnight in Paris' isn't particularly original, as Woody borrows from himself and others as he's prone to do.  But it's well crafted, well acted, and plain fun to watch.  'Midnight' is more reminiscent of his early \\"classic\\" period ('Play it Again Sam' thru 'Love and Death'), which had broader appeal than his later adult situation \\"dromedys\\", and more laughs.<br /><br />Everything seems to hit here; his directing is tighter than it's been for a while, and the casting is superb.  No one could top Alison Pill's hilariously delightful portrayal of Zelda Fitzgerald.  If this isn't Zelda as she was, then it's how she should have been.  I don't know if Ms. Pill has enough screen time to merit Best Supporting Actor, but this performance will surely have producers calling.  She's already slated to appear in Woody's next film. (Unfortunately lead actor Owen Wilson's performance wanes in comparison, as he appears a bit out of his league, but given that is his character's role anyway it's not so detrimental to the film.)<br /><br />Finally, there is absolutely nothing offensive here, and if your teenagers aren't familiar with the Lost Generation, or slogged and suffered through 'The Great Gatsby', then this should kindle their interest as a fun way to learn of that era.
0375413405|5.0|This cookbook is excellent!  Julia explains succintly but in enough detail exactly what needs to happen or what you should be looking for in each and every step.  I can't believe how easy she has made some of these complex dishes.  Our first effort out of the book was to make Veal Chops last night.  INCREDIBLE!  This weekend we will be trying Bouef Bourgionion (spell?)as featured in the movie Juie & Julia.  I'm very excited to have this book in my collection.  Just don't expect the recipes to be low calorie or low fat.  You add butter three different times when making the veal chops!
0439813786|4.0|This one is definitely for the kids. The drawings are fun to look at even if the story contains very little depth. I wonder if the book's hefty size and occasional sparse pages of text are meant to give a young reader the impression of reading something more substantial?<br /><br />If you have little ones, read it to them for this is an excellent storytime introduction to the beginnings of film.
B004U52VPS|3.0|Looked everywhere to try to make sure this \\"must have\\" item off the list was there without spending a fortune.  It's fun to fling the birds at the blocks/pigs to knock them down but the kids were not liking building the structures at all and would bump the table as they were building and got frustrated pretty quickly :(  It lasted about 15 minutes and was put back in the box and hasn't been touched since :(
B00667KMUO|4.0|I loved the movie, the reason I am giving it four stars out of five is because the second disc was not worth paying an extra five dollars for. I remember when the first four films had awesome special features on the second disks. Tours, games, etc. Now this just came with three things. And all three were boring. J.K rowling is getting CHEAP. They could have added 'Tour Shell Cottage'. I just regret buying the double disc, since there isn't anything to do on the second disk. The first was awesome, but the second disc sucked. If you want to save a few dollars, buy the single disc. The deleted scenes do come on the first disc, but I was disapointed that they didn't have a deleted scene with explaining about Arianna, Dumbledore's sister. I read the books and know the story of Arianna was one or two chapters long! That isn't fair to the people who only watch the movies, they wouldn't know what the heck was going on.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This DVD was shipped quickly and packaged well so arrived undamaged. This movie is very intense and not appropriate for children but a great action movie that highlights a serious problem. You will get engrossed in the story and recognize scary realities without feeling like you are watching a documentary.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|An average app to compensate fot the fact that the clock on the kindle fire has no alarm. If you don't remember to turn off hybernate on your Kindle the thing wont go off so be ready for a power drain just so your alarm works
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Movie arrived quickly and without damage. Very cute movie that produces unexpected bursts of laughter. Adults enjoy as much as kids.
B005ZUR724|2.0|Won't pet me play. It's sad because I love it on my Atrix. wtf Gameloft? Is this just an issue with Amazon marketplace. Can't tell but either way sucky.
B005ZUR724|1.0|why release an update the day after Christmas knowing this would be a big gift and that amazon User wouldn't be able to download it.  really poor planning.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just like the computer version. if you enjoy the computer version you will like this one too. I recommend it for anyone that likes solitaire.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Bought it for filming on my iPhone and it works great!  Love the extended cord, great sound quality!  You will need the adapter cable to make work with then iPhone, but the mic is great!  I like when a product performs as advertised.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a unique list of characters and a unique series.  I loved it from the first episode.  Having the whole series is a treat.  A serious and successful attempt at Science Fiction. I highly recommend.
0307455378|3.0|I very much liked \\"La Sombra\\" but this book was not nearly as good. I agree with other reviewers that the protagonist appears to be quite ignorant and some parts of the story line are very simplistic and do not make much sense. For instance, when the main character does not find his \\"patron\\" suspicious. Also, the last pages of the book take you through a number of deaths and mysterious events but not all of them are fully developed and well explained. Also, some actions of the protagonist do not make any sense. I would recommend this book but with a word of caution that this is not a great book.
0061474347|5.0|Nix and Stanek are two of my favorites for YA teen books. I read all of Nix's Keys to the Kingdom and now reading the Abhorsen ones. Sabriel is my favorite so far of this new series. what I liked best were the parts with Sameth and Clayr.
0307959856|4.0|I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I finished this book.  I am a Jane Austen and P.D. James fan, but not a fanatic about either one.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and thought it was a worthy sequel to the original.  If you liked \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" then I think you will enjoy this book.  If you are a fanatic, then no sequel will ever by satisfactory and don't waste your time.  For the casual Jane Austen fan, this book is a delightful return to the lives of the original characters.
B002IKLZZY|2.0|I was disappointed in this video because I thought it was going to be the movie.  Instead, there was almost constant commentary by the screenwriter Ernest Lehman during the time the movie was playing.  His dialogue blocked out a lot of the movie dialogue.  It actually is a video about how the movie was shot.  It does say on the back of the DVD case that there is commentary but I didn't realize it would be all the way throughout the movie.  This might be a good video for people who are interested in how a movie is made.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is easy to use and very fast! The categories are great for finding just what you are looking for. I know it will be a fav!

B002KSPKRS|4.0|$150 is a hefty price, but it is worth it.  I got a pair for Christmas (early gift).  I've had them a little over a month now and they are sweet.  Great sound (I don't play without them), feels great even afters hrs of playing (I forget that they are even on) and some of the best features on the market (chat volume, bass boost, ect.)  Only two problems I've had with them.... If you walk to the bathroom chances are the headset will crackle and pop and it eats batteries like Tyson Chicken so, don't forget to get a battery charging system before you get too far.  Would I buy again: Yes  Would I tell a friend: Yes  Would I say it has improved my playing: Yes  Thanks for listening.....  Jo Flo
B0056369RO|4.0|I expected to hate this album.  I heard about this group and thought they were fake rappers using autotune.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the album.  It is a fun album!  They are not pretending to be great mcs, but are simply ushering in their \\"Party Rock\\" movement.  I'm in.  Electronic beats and fun lyrics.  They do not take themselves too seriously and I like that.  There is room for them in music.  Everyone has heard Party Rock Anthem, but there are other cool songs on this.  I love Champagne Showers and Reminds Me of You especially.  Even Hot Dog is a funny song everyone can relate to after a night of clubbing.    All in all, I like that they are carving out their niche and just putting out fun music.  I even bought their first album and liked it even more.  Long live Party Rock.
1451627289|5.0|well lets say I won't ruin your read for you. king is my favorite author because he is such an excellent story teller. I own all his books in hardcover. I reread about every three years and enjoy his books everytime. My all time favorite is the dark tower and I search for the rose in my life. My wife bought me this book for christmas and she ordered through amazon and even with shipping she got it cheaper than the wal-mart price and arrived next day. amazon is the way to go. if you like king buy the book he never disappoints. remember great brittan may have a queen but the usa has the king.  long live the king. a loyal reader.
B0065IAL3C|4.0|I heavily anticipated Drake's debut album but was underwhelmed.  It felt rushed.  He even admitted it was not his best work.  Now, this album should have been his debut.  It picks up where So Far Gone left off.  His rhymes are better and the R&B type songs are melodically improved.  Due to the Amazon sale, picking this up is a no brainer.
B00006AG5N|1.0|Howdy folks! Boy is it chilly out there today! Well anywho....i love oldies and rock n roll as much as the next guy but lately Ive been hearing much fuss about this Elvis character..... I never heard of this guy because he is never on MTV. If Elvis is any good, he'd be on MTV!  Anyways, i heard much criticism about how Justin Bieber is a 'fake' and he will never match the legacy that Elvis , Frank Sinatra, Chuckberry, and the Beatles left behind... I laughed when I heard that! Justin Bieber will be remembered in 1,000 years from now as the best musician of the 2000s.  On to this album... it was so horrible I couldn't get passed the first few songs! \\"Jailhouse rock\\" was so unoriginal and had stupid lyrics! \\"Wooden Heart\\" is a great example of why oldies ballads were never any good! and that dumb \\"Hound dog\\" song... Elvis stole it from the Lilo Stitch soundtrack!  I was promised 30 #1 hits... and I got 0!  Don't worry folks, this Elvis character will not be remembered in the future! Justin Bieber has more creativity.
B001F1YBP8|5.0|...and I own quite a few.  This disc is that rarest of beasts where everything works.  The interpretation of the music, the performance of that interpretation, the video and audio capture of the performance - all are superb.  This is the one concert disc that can spend days in my player.  When I demo blu-ray for those few remaining friends who haven't experienced it yet, I hit 'em with some really good CGI bombast (the T-rex fight from Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" for example) and a classic movie transfer (usually \\"Casablanca\\"), but I always end the demonstration with this disc.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun and relaxing way to spend some quiet time before bed. I find the game enjoyable and not difficult to play.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Finally....the update is available!  Cheers to Amazon for not abandoning this app due to the failure of Gameloft to make update available.  Game deserves 5 stars now.  (Modified original review.on 12/31)
B005ZUR724|5.0|really love the game with full of action and adventure but if you want people to keep playing please help with the new update. really love the game!
0307891372|1.0|I orderded this book new and it came to me with pieces of the paint off the side and the corner bent. If I'm buying something I want it to be sent in perfect condition. The only thing good about it was it arrived on time.

B005O30Y5Y|5.0|I had seen this movie previously at the theater.  Purchased it at Amazon on Black Friday for around $7...was an excellent buy!  When I received it, it didn't play on my bluray player.  I thought that Amazon had sent me a bad disc. But it turned out that I had to upgrade the firmware on my bluray player.  Wonderful product...worth the money...and exceptional customer service from Amazon helping me determine the nature of my problem!!!

B001UV4XHY|4.0|I've been reading books, and watching movies adapted to the screen from books, for 65 years, and the entire Harry Potter series stands out as some of the better books, and, along with the Lord of the Rings, one of the best adaptations to the screen, that I have ever seen.  I just bought Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and watched it for the 3rd time.  I missed the parts of the books that couldn't be in the movie, because of time constraints, but found the last chapter of Harry's life on screen to be \\"believable\\" and compelling.  I mourned the loss of characters that have been part of my life since the day I closed the cover on \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", but in movie's, as in life, things don't always turn out the way you would like. As in \\"real\\" life, in \\"reel\\" life, people die and we don't always get what we thought we wanted.  This movie brought Harry (and his readers) to a logical end of childhood and the beginning of his 'grown-up' life.  Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for an incredible journey.  Kathleen
0439023491|4.0|This is an amazing series, I could not put it down. Can't wait until the movies come out! You have to but the books, you will not regret it!
B004P7CN7W|4.0|Just as I remembered...great and corny 90's scary movie. Good flick without all of the gore from today's scary movies; plus there are a lot of familiar actors in it.
B003HARV4S|2.0|You can not actually solve the mystery in this movie.  It is one of those movies that presents a problem but there is no way to actually solve it.  It's like one of those Scooby-Doo episodes where the monsters end up being real, which in my opinion, ruins Scooby-Doo.  Not cool.  Get the Prestige instead.  If you have money to buy this movie, don't.  Spend on something that matters, like food.  I gave it two starts because the film-making is OK.
0062101897|5.0|It is amazing.    - An original image of draft of a scene not filmed.    - A detailed, architectural quality map of the layout of the ground floor of Hogwarts, including reference points indicating the height above the lake (to the tenth of a foot.  Rooms not included; just outside walls.)    - A disclosure that each of the main trio has their own personal color scheme that has been maintained through most of the series.   - The fact that Daniel, Emma, and Rupert have become advisers to the production regarding their own characters, since they've lived more through the eyes of these characters than anybody else.    And this is just a smattering that I can recall after a 3-hour SKIM of the book.  It's overwhelming.    The books are not left out.  They refer to these and J.K. Rowling's input throughout the book.  I didn't think it would be this detailed.  The amount of access the author had to the background and documentation is amazing.  There are hundreds of full-color photos, and masses of text.  This is the ultimate present for a Potter fan.
B006C1DH92|4.0|love this game... So happy this came out since the original  still hasnt been updated. to the person who said its the same as the original... they must not have played it. the new game mode, Bandito, is fun and challenging... the finale is strange tho. one issue ... achievements keep popping up but there is no where to view them.  only my stash is avail to view... its silly to have achievements if there is no way to view them and work towards others... imo but all in all a fun game :)
B006C1DH92|3.0|this game is awesome but needs improvements on kindle fire. Most kindle fire games get cut off parts like in this game the pause button is partly cut off. the gameloft games are the only games that doesn't have the menu bar there. I hope the developers will start to use that tweak in there game or make the screen smaller so the menu bar doesn't curt anything off. It could also use a little better graphics on kindle fire
030726999X|2.0|This is by far the least tight and most boring of the three books that Stieg Larsson has written. The main problem is that Lisbeth Salander, who is one of the most interesting literally creation in recent years is relegated to a hospital bed for most this novel. Instead we are treated to Mikael Blomkvist doing investigative journalism trying to expose \\"the Section,\\" a super-secret organization within Sapo that handled Zalachenko. We also dig a lot into Salander's background which in turn takes away from the mystique of this most interesting character, rendering her less interesting. Frankly I am less interested in why Lisbeth is the way she is than I am interested in seeing her do what she does.<br /><br />The subplot with Berger going to SMP is totally unnecessary. However, Stieg Larsson, the good political leftist that he is has a socio-political axe to grind which in turn takes away from the plot. His points are basically:<br />1. Men can be very evil but not women (can you imagine how much better the book would have been if the head of the section was a woman?).<br />2. Capitalism is bad especially when the capitalists are white men (SMP boss or Wennerstrom).<br />3. The Swedish system is corrupt because it ultimately caters to the capitalists and their protectors (i.e., \\"the Section\\").<br />4. There is way too much violence against women in Sweden and in the west. This last point by the way is very troubling given how graphically the series has depicted violence against women to the point of being exploitative in my opinion.<br /><br />The subplot with Ronald Niedermann also comes out of the blue. I guess Herr Larsson wanted to tie up all the loose ends and give Lisbeth some needed exercise as to compensate for her being locked away in a hospital for most of the book. The same is true of her trip to Gibraltar. It seems that this was an excuse for her to get some sex after being confined to the hospital.<br /><br />Finally, there is way too much Blomkvist in this book. I guess Herr Larsson was kind of living a childhood fantasy of being a celebrity journalist who brings down corrupt institutions in Sweden, screws around with beautiful women including a blonde supercop Swedish goddess who is not only beautiful and strong but also extremely intelligent, and hobnobs with the Swedish Prime Minister and other men in high positions. Give us a break.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this book could have used a good editor. The fact that Larsson died before any of these books went into publication may have something to do with it.living a childhood fantasy of being a celebrity journalist who brings down corrupt institutions in Sweden, screws around with beautiful women including a blonde supercop Swedish goddess who is not only beautiful and strong but also extremely intelligent, and hobnobs with the Swedish Prime Minister and other men in high positions.

B005ZUR724|1.0|the new update for this game has ruined it. I will change my rating back up to 5 stars when it starts working again.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Please, avoid this film at all costs. Special F/X were bad, acting and writing were down right pathetic. The movie seemed to be one big rip off from other films such Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Superman and Spiderman, just to name a few. After 5 minutes, you can pretty much predict how the movie is going to end. It's sad that Tim Robbins was in this. The CGI Lantern suit looked horribly fake. They should have put Reynolds in a body suit and just made the chest emblem CGI. All in all a horrible film. Thankfully I didn't pay full price for this. It'll more than likely never be watched again.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Why in the WORLD did I take so long to read this book? One thing that drives me nuts about my kindle is how easy it is to buy something, and forget why it was so enticing to begin with. I am in love with this book! It's not a \\"feel good perfect\\" romance, but that's what makes it even more perfect! This kind of relationship is REAL. When you love someone so much you can't stand it, you make dumb mistakes, you overreact, you flat out lose your mind. That's why this journey with Abby and Travis was so spectacular! The bonus? The clever writing style, the snarky retorts, and the great characters (I seriously want to be best friends with Mare). This isn't a cookie cutter romance/drama, which is all the more reason I love it. I couldn't help but devour every page and read the ending with a sigh and a chuckle :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a secret pleasure.  It is a very addictive pastime. Easy to spend a couple of hours playing! Love It!!!!!
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book is in a league all by itself. Whatever you expect going into this adventure, you really have no clue! I thought I understood the dark premise...but really that just scratched the surface. There is something so sexy, dangerous and endearing about Mr. Grey. Just when you think his hard shell is cracking, you blink and he's back to his guarded self. And Miss Steele? I love her internal dialogue. Her subconcious vs her inner goddess was LOL funny and I could easily envision her little goddess getting excited or her subconcious getting worked up and nervous going tsk tsk tsk! Very awesome addition of comic relief when you need a break from the dark aspects. And the emails? LOVED the emails. I got giddy when I saw the email exchanges coming up. I loved this book, but even more so I am utterly intrigued by this story and I can't wait to start the next one!
B000GLKN5K|3.0|I first became a fan of ELO when I heard the \\"Xanadu\\" soundtrack after first watching the movie and then listening to the \\"Time\\" album which is still my all-time favourite album of theirs.  I then discovered \\"Discovery\\" and these 3 albums represent their best work for me.  I also went back and got their greatest hits album to learn more about their early days and as the years passed I realised that I grew tired of much of that album save for 2 tracks which I never seem to tire of: \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"Strange Magic\\".  For this reason I decided to get \\"Face the Music\\" and it is now my favourite \\"early\\" ELO album.  I know Jeff Lynne himself prefers \\"Out of the Blue\\" and \\"A New World Record\\" which are perhaps more complete and \\"filled out\\" but I think that up to \\"Discovery\\" this is ELO's best album.  With the exception of \\"Poker\\" and \\"Down Home Town\\" there are no weak tracks here as we get to hear many of the elements that have become Jeff Lynne trademarks over the years make an appearance here.  Jeff Lynne himself oversaw the remastering of this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release but truth be told the improvement in the sound quality is subtle and it is the bonus tracks that are real treats for fans.  His \\"stripped down mix\\" version of \\"Evil Woman\\" is very good and I find myself liking it more than the original!<br /><br />This release also includes a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well as a 12-page colour booklet containing an essay on the album as well as a short note from Jeff himself about the album.  This mlps release though is a bit of a mixed bag as the design and assembly is poor when compared with what is out there and with what Sony Music is capable of when compared to their other mlps releases in the past; it seems for some reason Sony decided to go cheap with the ELO mlps releases as this is the same with the \\"Time\\" and \\"Discovery\\" mlps releases as well.  Thankfully, the sound quality and the content somewhat makes up for this which explains the 3 stars.<br /><br />Very good content, good sound quality but poor mlps design makes this a mixed bag.  MLPS collectors will be disappointed and for the rest, you may want to check out the cheaper jewel case versions instead.ich explains the 3 stars.

0525423656|3.0|When I finished this book, I honestly didn't know how I felt about it as a whole.  Writing this review, I'm still not sure.  It's not that it was a disappointment.  I think so much of it fell flat for me.  It wasn't what I was expecting at all.<br /><br />Cassia is determined, and really I like that about her.  But, I think sometimes it makes her blind to what is really going on around her.  I admired that she would go to such great lengths to find Ky.  She endures a lot and treated well beneath her station in this society.  But, then she doesn't want to be treated any differently than the people she works with.  I also think it is a way of punishing herself for sorting Ky to this life in the first place.  But, there is a part of me that isn't sure she's really in love with Ky.  I feel like she's more in love with the idea of him and what he represents.  He's her chance to buck the system.  And if following him to the ends of society is what she had to do to get that, then she will do it.  But, what does Ky have to do to keep her attention?  I don't think she was tuned in to his feelings as well as she should have been.<br /><br />I found that I liked Ky quite a bit more in this story.  He may be bitter, but it's not overwhelmingly so.  He's trying to survive and hold on to the hope that he might see Cassia again one day.  I liked that he found people to trust in, and it was sad when society once again found a way to reap those people from him.  I also felt like we learned a lot more about his past.  This is what made him become more real for me.<br /><br />Despite all this, I still like Xander the most.  I think he will go to any length to keep Cassia safe, even when she doesn't realize that he is the one pulling the strings.  He's willing to sit back and watch her come to him.  There's just something about him that I love.  Especially when we learn the truth about what he has been hiding from everyone.<br /><br />It's the plot and ending that got to me the most.  I never felt like the story was really going anywhere.  Even when Cassia and Ky find each other, it felt anticlimatic.  There's very little action and lots of  information to process.  It has a very middle book of the series feel to it.  Plus the ending was just off.  I think I would have liked a cliffhanger more than what we actually get.  We go through all this trouble to trace the rumor of uprising, and this was all we got?  I felt cheated of a real ending.<br /><br />I'm still curious as to how this might play out.  And of course who Cassia might actually choose in the end.  So, I'll read the next one in the series!going anywhere.  Even when Cassia and Ky find each other, it felt anticlimatic.

B0012GVKVY|4.0|I have to disclose right at the start that I have never read an Isaac Asimov book and so I can only judge the movie without any reference to the book it is based upon.  Now that I've got that out of the way, I also have to say that I have always liked film noir and so movies that are even remotely noir-ish like this one and say \\"Blade Runner\\" or even \\"Gattaca\\" have a headstart with me.  That said, while the movies share similarities with each other e.g. the Smith and Harrison cop characters after renegade artificial life forms etc \\"I, Robot\\" rises above just being a shoot-em up, all action film but also appeals to a thinking audience raising the issue of bigotry and prejudice with Smith's hatred of all things robot based upon his one bad experience with them and how all this changes once he gets to know and understand them better.  There are some elements though that detract from the enjoyment of the movie such as the inclusion of scenes that are not necessary; while I am fan of Shia LeBeuf for example from his work on \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" I thought his scenes were totally useless here and that the film would be far better off without any of his scenes.  I also got the feeling that the film was too short and that far more meat could have been included to the story to develop the main characters more.<br /><br />The good storyline aside though this movie has excellent 1080p picture and sound quality coming in DTS HD 5.1 MA making this a strong candidate for reference quality blu-ray disc.  The special feature documentaries while not great are still pretty good and unless you are a diehard fan who has to have every single tidbit this average viewer for instance is happy with this release.<br /><br />This blu-ray release has excellent picture and sound quality and a decent storyline making this a worthy reference disc in your video library.<br /><br />Recommended for the picture and sound quality but perhaps the content could have been a little better.
1567184855|4.0|While the subject matter is very interesting, the writing style is rather dry reporting. The \\"journey\\" is a laborious slog. I've put the book down several times as it didn't hold my attention. I will finish it but didn't realize it would be a bit of a chore.

1419702238|5.0|My son loves this series- he is a reluctant reader and breezes right through these!  The price was right and we didn't have to wait to get it through the library.  Can't wait for the next in the series to come out.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved it so much, I bought the entire quartet for my son who is now serving in Afghanistan.  This is what he said about \\"Ender's Game\\": \\"Just finished the book Ender's Game\\" and if you're a Lt. in the army, it is a great read. I loved the commander's philosophy behind it, and yes, it is a sci-fi book involving deep space battles, but the military leadership in it is true in life of what a successful leader acts like.\\"
B0050CQY1W|4.0|1. 1+1 \\"\\"\\" Starts off with guitar, nice love song that deeply expresses her emotions and strong love through comparisons of many different things.   2. I Care \\"\\"\\" This song starts off with low echoes and BAM Beyonce tells a guy how she has been hurt but he doesn't care. Throughout this song she wants a guy to recognize that she loves him but he is not noticing it. He doesn't care but she cares. The instruments used throughout this song are nice.   3. I Miss You \\"\\"\\" Started to become one of my favorite songs on the album. Beyonce expresses her love for one man. She misses this man but she wonders if he still thinks of her/misses her. When I hear this song I get chills, and I actually wish it was longer! I'm sure many females can relate to this song  4. Best Thing I Never Had \\"\\"\\" One of the hit songs off the album. I enjoyed it but they have officially killed it for me on the radio. This song basically expresses how Beyonce was in a relationship and she is so happy she got out. If any female has been in a relationship with a loser and got out of it, they will def enjoy this song.   5. Party \\"\\"\\" The beat in this song has an old school feel to it. This is a feel good song that talks about love and just being happy. One song on the album that is very upbeat and is great to play before going out or during a party.  6. I Rather Die Young \\"\\"\\" This song is ill and reminds me of Beyonce other song \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" Her expression for this man in the song are very strong. Basically it says I rather die young if I cannot be with you. I enjoy this song even though I can't relate to it. Hopefully nobody young hears it and takes the lyrics seriously.   7. Start Over \\"\\"\\" Probably one of my least listened to songs on the album. This is a great song though. She talks about starting over a relationship that has missed up. She really believes in this man and that their love can be rebuilt.  8. Love On Top \\"\\"\\" This song and upbeat and a feel good song. She expresses how she is extremely happy to be in love. This song reminds me reminds me new love when you first meet a guy and have those butterflies and chills whenever you think of them or hang around them.   9. Countdown \\"\\"\\" Became one of my favorite songs as well on the album. She literally counts down throughout the song and talks about her man and her love for him. With the instruments used in the song it has a Caribbean/National Anthem type feel to it.   10. End of Time \\"\\"\\" Another Beyonce long song. This song is not slow and pretty upbeat. It def has a Caribbean/Marching band feel to it and a great beat. She talks about how she will love her man until the end of time and remain by his side.  11. I Was Here \\"\\"\\" This song will def be played at Beyonce funeral. Not that I want her to die anytime soon. She wants the world to know that she has made an impact, touched million hearts, and she will leave with no regrets. Personally, I feel that this should have been the last song on the album.  12. Run The World (Girls) \\"\\"\\" The first song to be released from the album. At first I really didn't like this song but it def grew on me. The beat is funky, but I actually like the lyrics. This is a nice song that little girls can dance to or I can picture seeing at a middle school talent show. WOMEN RUN THE WORLD =) & Beyonce is infamous for this independent women songs like this.   Overall this album was easy to grow on because I'm a Beyonce fan.  It has more love songs on this album than anything but I enjoyed it when it came out and I still listen to it occasionally since the album is on my cell phone.  Hope this review helped

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I won't re-cap the story, but I will say if you enjoy magical realism or fantasy or any combination of those genres, read this book.  It reads like a Victorian Tim Burton movie, without any musical numbers.  It's romantic, and dark, and magical.  I look forward to re-reading this until Morgenstern comes out with something new for me to fall in love with.
0307276902|5.0|Whether it is true or fiction or a little of both, the story is captivating and left me wanting more. The writing style is unique and easy to read. I am not a fast reader, but went through this one pretty quick... and on to the next volume.
B005OGYH90|5.0|Many people are upset that the full show is not included on the bonus DVD.  That's fine, I suppose.  I read the item description before purchasing this excellent live album, so I knew what I was getting.   The album itself is fantastic; Slash, Myles, and the band rip and roar through Guns n' Roses favorites and deep cuts from Slash's Snakepit and Velvet Revolver, as well as plenty from Slash's excellent solo release. The sound quality is great, so play this one loud.  I saw Slash in Seattle in October 2010, and this cd takes me right back to that night.

1451627289|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I have not enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed this one in a really long time. It's a page turner-almost 900 pages and I finished it in a matter of days. I was so enthralled by this novel, that I was exhausted at work due to my late nights reading. Horrible title, but I have recommended 11/22/63 to absolutely everyone I know. Enjoy.

B0059XTUVI|4.0|Margaret Thatcher acquired the sobriquet, the \\"Iron Lady\\", from the Soviet Union.  It was meant to be disparaging.  She regarded it as a compliment.<br /><br />\\"The Iron Lady\\" provides a biography of Margaret Thatcher's adult life.  The highlight of this life, of course, was her more than a decade a Britain's first female prime minister.  The film covers this as a series of flash backs as seen the through the eyes of a very aged former prime minister.  The technique works.  Her life has certainly been quite extraordinary although there is little focus on her weaknesses.  In this sense, the film almost becomes hagiography.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the apparent lack of blemishes in the character of the former prime minister, Meryl Streep, in playing the older Margaret Thatcher, is spell binding.  Moreover, Streep is simply magnificent. Her performance is my early call for an Oscar. She really does become Margaret Thatcher.  There are no apparent flaws.  The accent, in particular, is right on the money.<br /><br />Streep is supported by Jim Broadbent as Dennis.  Unfortunately, his role tends to fall almost to caricature at times.  This is a shame as there are a number of other cameo roles and most of these are played excellently.  Michael Foot, Geoffrey Howe, Michael Heseltine, et al are played in absolutely convincing style by a great supporting cast.  The various sets and the manner in which the era of the 1980s is re-created is also first class.<br /><br />In sum, apart from the danger of hagiography, this is a great film led by an actress at the top of her form.  Recommended.
0553386794|2.0|Game of Thrones is to books what LOST is to television series.  George RR Martin's day job is TV writer. He begins by writing three books that really suck you in. You will become very attached to all of the many characters. After that, be warned: the story does not resolve. You will get a dream sequence when you want plot resolution. You will get three new characters and their back story when what you want desperately to know what happens to the character you just read a thousand pages about. Just because half of one of the first books is spent on a character central to the plot does not mean you will ever find out what happens to that character. On the other hand, characters you don't care about at all because they have no bearing on the past or future plot will get 5 chapters. Some characters just disappear.<br />My husband and I watched six seasons of LOST. It nearly gave me high blood pressure that the events of the first three seasons had nothing to do with the second three. I wanted to pull my hair out when the plot lines that drew me in were never revisited. I wanted to scream  when a new character was introduced instead of seeing an existing characters story to it's end. My husband did not seem to care as much and was happy with the \\"they were dead all along\\" ending.<br />I wish I had known going in that this was a tv show sort of a book. The story will get you to tune and watch the next season. But, if you are a reader who likes a whole story, don't bother. By book 4, you will just be frustrated and angry.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have seen the Swedish films, yet not read the books. The US version is not a remake of the Swedish version; it is simply another adaptation of the novel. I must say I was very impressed with the pacing and over-all style and raw feeling of the US version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The story, whether from the books, Swedish version or US version is quite a dark and winding journey. If you have not read the books or watched the Swedish versions I recommend now starting with the US version of the film. This US version will be the first of the trilogy; The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.<br /><br />The opening credit sequence, as I'm sure many of you have heard is quite amazing. I loved it and all the work they put into it. It was very Bond like yet encompassed the dark complexities of this story and the film. This film is much more speedy than the Swedish versions. I found the Swedish films to be a little slow at times, which yes builds tension however the pacing of the US version is much more my speed. Very fast and smart.<br /><br />It is a murder mystery film, however it is also about the two main characters and their interactions and working together to solve a murder, or series of murders. I do not want to give anything away as the story and how it unfolds is what makes the movie run so well. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the US version is quite long. However it is a movie which you rather it not end due to the entertaining characters and the intense visual situations which you wish to look away from, but you can't.<br /><br />When it comes to the characters, I found that Rooney Mara played a much better Lisbeth than Noomi Rapace. And the interactions with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) were great and at times quite funny. The two of them working together when they seem to be opposites was very entertaining and Daniel and Rooney pulled it off perfectly. As a huge fan of the new Bond reboots I have grown to love Daniel Craig and enjoy seeing him on the screen. He is a very talented actor and seems to give the audience what they want. Stellan Skarsgård, Christopher Plummer and Robin Wright also did a great job, as well as the other cast members. Each character was very carefully cast and bond perfectly to the heart of this film.<br /><br />The story, the acting, the directing; everything was perfect and I must say that director David Fincher is at the top of his game. For those who do not know, he directed Fight Club, Se7en, The Game, Zodiac, The Social Network, Alien 3, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Panic Room. The music, the ambiance, and the over-all dark feel to the film was so well done I couldn't believe it. I could not have asked for a better-crafted film. I am quite anxious to see the rest of the trilogy.to love Daniel Craig and enjoy seeing him on the screen. He is a very talented actor and seems to give the audience what they want.

B00536OCZA|1.0|I received this record for Christmas and I can say without a doubt that this is a bad pressing. Period. No one gets lucky and gets one that sounds like it \\"should\\". I had hoped to get one that did not sound badly, but with way more pops, clicks, and noise than there should be on a record in late 2011, it DOES sound like \\"someone eating pop rocks with their mouth open\\", and it is not worth your money, unless all you want to do is display it. The record does a great job of doing that! It even comes with posters (3!) two sticker sets, and an mp3 download code, which honestly sounds better than this record.<br /><br />I heard that the UK issue is void of the noise and pops from the factory, but is digitally sourced as well. I guess one would just have to hunt down a listenable version of the record! This one isn't!<br />So in conclusion, don't buy this record if you want to listen to it. You will sadly be disappointed, as I was. If you want to display it, by all means, do so. That's all it's worth doing.<br /><br />One star for the actual music. I was about to give it another star for the packaging, but the sound quality just ruins it all. Don't buy this version of the album.

0316056863|1.0|I had high hopes for this book, but I was completely disappointed. First of all, it just wasn't funny!!  I can honestly say I only laughed once or twice in the entire book. Tina Fey has such an inflated opinion of herself that it is nauseating. She tries to be self-depricating, but she just comes off as self-absorbed and ego-centric. She also uses the book as a vehicle for her political opinions. No matter what her political opinions, I can't stand people who use their celebrity to try to influence others.   If you really want to laugh, read \\"Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?\\" by Mindy Kaling.

B00003CXXS|2.0|This movie lost me at around 7 minutes, with all the nonsensical talk of 'resonating chamber' and how Dr. Grant concludes the velociraptor was smarter than modern dolphins and primates. Considering how inaccurately the first film portrayed 'velociraptor', which more closely resembled a lizard-skinned Deinonychus or Utahraptor (god what a stupid name), this already was too much for me. I can accept the first film's explanation that the genetic code was modified with amphibian DNA, giving the lizard-like appearance to all, perhaps even mutating their size, but for this third film to already be taking fringe theories, such as pack-hunting raptors, and going even further to suggest that they were super intelligent and even talked to one another is just silly and unnecessary. Anyway, I had a major hang-up with how this film started out this way. The dialogue is also, for the most part, weak and uninteresting. Also, they talk about the dinosaurs as if a few fossils explains everything about their behavior and points to them and says \\"look you can see the alpha male grazing there\\". How would he know? All of the artistic renderings we have are best-guess speculation, so how could he possibly identify anything about a bunch of mutant dinosaurs? Also, they call Cooper a professional, but he runs onto the runway as they are taking off and just stands there in the open shedding a tear until the dinosaur eats him and causes the plane to crash. How is that professional? What is professional is hiding in cover (eg. bushes). Stupid plot. I hate to say it but the effects don't seem to be very consistent, or as good overall, as the original. It's not very scary either, more comical. The original film was actually pretty creepy and scary in parts. This one gets going Michael Bay style and you never really care. Well, I didn't. Some of the composite shots look really bad, in fact. When the two big dinosaurs are fighting (not even halfway into the film), I think the original stop motion fight in King Kong was more realistic and compelling. This just looks like something from a current-gen computer game and almost worse in fact. In general, I really like T&eacute;a Leoni, but here in this movie she comes off as annoying, about as much of a brainless blond as you could ask for, and always endangering the party with her noise. I'd sure like to know how you hot-wire a camcorder with a D-cell flashlight. I also knew it was a nest way before the camera even showed it, although true, I didn't guess that there were MULTIPLE nests, but I guess I should have seen that coming as well. Guess what I can also guess? That they are raptor eggs. Lets see if I'm right again.... haha yup, as soon as I hit play Grant whispers \\"raptor\\". When a movie is this predictable you know it's bad.<br /><br />I'm still watching, but I would not recommend this film just because it's about as dumb as they come. Actually, no, movies CAN be worse than this, but it's still not worth keeping on MY shelf. I'll just stick to the original, thanks.fight in King Kong was more realistic and compelling.

B004SGWYW4|5.0|I first watched High School of the Dead in Japanese and eagerly awaited its English dub. I had to wait until Christmas to find a copy locally and then wait until Christmas day to unwrap it. Yesterday i watched the whole series with a friend who had never seen it before. Needless to say we both enjoyed it. HOTD is a Zombie Apocalypse story surrounding Takashi Komuro and his High School friends as they try to survive the sudden and horrifying zombie outbreak. This is a first as Zombies are a popular cult icon in America, I don't believe there has ever been an anime like this.<br />  Borrowing from the already established zombie mythos, HOTD adds typical anime/manga style action and flare to the realism of a zombie apocalypse that has suddenly gripped not just Japan, but the entire world. Takashi and his friends find themselves battling their way through hordes of the undead in an attempt to find their families. Starting in the confines of a high school at the start of the infection,then to the streets of Japan, HOTD gives you a wide variety of locations for the story to pan out. With action, blood, gore, and fan service galore HOTD is anime that will have you wanting to watch all 12 episodes in one sitting.<br />  I only had one problem with the English dub, and that was the Americanization. though it was easily overlooked due to the great voice cast and the already wonderful anime, as i had already seen the series in Japanese with English subtitles mentions of \\"Wal-Mart Cheetos\\", \\"Mel Gibson Movies\\", and \\"Dior skirts\\" had me face palming. Americanization in anime has slowed down in the past few years, but it always seemed small. Though Wal-Mart is found just about everywhere it is most prevalent in the United States. Because of this when you hear these bits of American culture thrown in you find yourself forgetting these characters are supposed to be in Japan and not in the States. As i said it plays a very small part in the series, except for the addition of extra curse words that you would expect a rebellious American youth to shout under duress, so the story tends to drown it out.<br />  All in all, HOTD is great anime with tons of action and scares alike. the English and Japanese voice casts are both very talented and bring life to the characters. You will find yourself caring about Takashi and his friends every time a zombie pops up with its teeth bared. The story is solid and the action is intense. If your a fan of zombies, horror, sexy animated girls, or just an anime junkie like myself, then you cannot miss High School of the Dead.words that you would expect a rebellious American youth to shout under duress, so the story tends to drown it out.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This production is the 2011 American version of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatto\\", an exquisitely crafted and hard hitting movie based on the best selling Swedish novel, which had previously been made into a movie in Sweden.  It is a tense and terrifying voyage into human darkness that may stay with the viewer for awhile.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is a cold case murder, resurrected by a dying man, who hires the skills of a disgraced investigative journalist.  \\"Tattoo\\" features superb location shooting in Stockholm and on a lovely but rather bleak Swedish island.  Daniel Craig is entirely believable as journalist Mikael Blomkvist, a man looking to revive his reputation, who stumbles into an engrossing mystery.  Christopher Plummer is a dying industrialist, seeking the truth of the fate of a long-missing niece.  Skellan Skarsgard is a positive chameleon as the industrialist's nephew, who encourages the investigation.  The real star of the movie, however, is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, a highly skilled computer hacker with a twisted, abusive background.<br /><br />This is a long movie at 158 minutes, but the pacing and dialogue are such that most viewers will be thoroughly draw into the story.  Blomkvist and Salander will arrive at the island and the investigation by separate paths, to make a surprisingly effective team.  They will follow a thin trail of 40 year-old clues to a savage and surprising serial killer.  The solution to the mystery of the missing girl is formed of a terrifying, and haunting, multiple ending.<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is very highly recommended, but only to adults who can tolerate the disturbing abuse that forms Lisbeth's character at the beginning of the movie.

I read a lot of books and this is most definitely the best book I've read in a long time.  Original, fast-moving plot, great characters... what more could you want?  I don't usually look forward to movies based on books but I admit that I'm looking forward to the release of The Hunger Games movie on 3/23/12.  It will be interesting to see how true it is to the book.  Now I'm off to read the 2nd and 3rd book in this trilogy.

B003TT2X72|4.0|#1 - This film looks great on blu ray. Not excellent, but great. Which is a shame when you think about how popular this film is. Audio seems to be the best thing about this movie. I'm not really too sold on the story itself. No matter how close it is to Tolkien's original story, I feel as though the momentum built up by the first movie is slowed down here, and then kicked back into overdrive for \\"The Return of the King\\". Average video quality, top notch audio, and a sub par story are what it boils down to for me.

However I'm normally surprised and or really enjoy the ending. I cannot say the same about this book. The ending was very predictable to the point I would have bet money on it. Also I didn't really enjoy the ending at all. First time I've ever been disappointed by a Nicholas Sparks book. Still read it, but check it out from the library, don't buy it.

In many ways X-MEN Origins Wolverine comes across as a western film littered with Mutants at every turn.Deadpool,The Blob,Gambit,and a handful of other mutant elite make their screen debut during the course of the film while a few familiar faces return as well. liev schreiber gives the character Saber-tooth (simply known as Victor Creed in this film) the big screen portrayal the mutant deserves. Far surpassing the henchmen like role given to Tyler Mane in the original X-MEN movie.Hugh Jackman is bigger than ever with muscles bulging in every scene, though the film falls short of really showing a darker side to Wolverine he never loses the bad ass appeal that makes him so lovable as a super hero.  The western vibe works to a large degree but also causes the themes of the original X-MEN trilogy to lose significant power in the process. The idea of mutants simply becomes a cover to display powers as opposed to showing opposistion from the world at large.  The biggest problem with this film is that instead of sticking more closely to Wolverine's true origins the film makers attempt to change a little too much for the films own good. The way in which Logan gains his trademark amnesia is bizarre to say the least. Another problem I had with this film is that instead of sticking to Wolverine's origins the film also attempts to tell a larger tale in showing us the beginnings of at least one of the X-MEN and ends up feeling too forced in the end.  To sum things up Wolverine is a fun movie packed with mounds of un-ending action that manages to roughly ride over a few potholes in the process. The end product is a mixed bag of adrenaline and dissapointment. The mutants (and humans alike) are intriguing and rarely does an action film cover such a large spectrum of character types but we see far too little of most of them.  Bluray quality andspecial features:  Comparing the DVD next to the bluray back to back didn't yield any large improvements though a few small things where noticable.  The Bluray has some very nice special features including small bio's for every character played by the actors.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|There is nothing wrong with the show i love it and its so adicting.  I missed the first season so i bought this to catch up on what i missed.  When i started wathing these with my friends they started to skip.  The disc looked fine though.
B001PPGAJE|4.0|The bluray edition of X-MEN is pretty much a HD quality version of the special edition DVD that also contains the mutant watch featurette from the original DVD copy. The video quality is nice. Not leaps and bounds above your standard DVD but you do notice in certain scenes,case in point; When bobby is talking to Rogue in the school courtyard I remembered on the original DVD commentary Brian Singer mentioned if you look closely you can see cool air coming out of the Iceman's mouth. On the DVD copy I strained my eyes yet to no avail. I could never see the breath. Yet on the bluray copy it's clear as day.  It's nothing huge but something any fan would catch onto.  The first \\"X\\" film is certainly more reality based than its successors and after watching X2 and 3 by todays standards it certainly comes across as a setup film. Still,X-MEN was the launching title that started the superhero wave of big budget pictures that's still thriving roughly 11 years later and rightfully so.
B003EYVXVY|5.0|This movie is a must see! The movie has action but also if you like romance it has some romantic scences. This movie is great in 2D but is special in 3D! I would totaly buy this movie in 2D or 3D. (I would suggest 3D though)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this all the time on my kindle fire and the game goes fast.  I prefer. the winning deck I would highly recommend this to anyone
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I did not know how hard chess was unroll I played the computer. Graphics are great and the game runs really smoothly
B000002IWH|5.0|I saw this movie at a high school halloween party in the 90's. Has been in my to 5 favorites ever since. The soundtrack is out of sight. RIP Brandon Lee.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This 60 year old Star Trek fan couldn't resist when the legitimate 20th Anniversary Edition (not the unauthorized bootleg version) recently became available for a very limited time for $147.49, or $3.01 per disc. The upcoming transfer of this series to blu-ray is bound to increase the cost of this series for many years, so I thought the time was right to buy this great series. I was very apprehensive, from reading other reviews, about the packaging for this set, and had held off buying it because of these concerns. Upon arrival, the tray section, holding the poster fold-out and seasons 1, 2 and part of season 3, did have a couple of small cracks that likely occured during shipping.  The other two tray sections were not damaged.  The cracks were relatively easy to repair with clear shipping tape. This shouldn't happen, but the sheer size of the set, causes the slight damage when shipped.  Overall, the trays holding the 49 discs and poster are easy to use, but the set needs to be handled carefully and not dropped.  The plastic cover that fits over the trays is much sturdier than some reviewers claim and is very easy to remove and replace.  Complaints about disc freezing and skipping have not been experienced by this reviewer.  The first two seasons have played perfectly.  The sound is great and the video, while not blu-ray quality, is very good with great clarity. I assume the rest of the discs will play fine, when I get the chance to spend the vast amount of time needed to watch the series.  Buying this set eliminates spending 44.5 hours watching commercial interruptions.  With the dvd remote one can skip over the introduction and the end credits for each episode saving another 5-6 hours. Add the bonus features for each season and the extra disc and this set was truly a great bargin for the Star Trek fan.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all games. and it is a challenge at times. but I really need some cheats. I really really really really love this game.
B006C1DH92|5.0|just like the original but better!  love banditoo mode! definitely worth it!!  free or not. buy it and enjoy!! hay.
B006C1DH92|3.0|I knew this game wasn't going to be as good as fruit ninjas. The survival mode is still in that game which I feel could have been mixed up more. The mission like mode is fun but the over all question is would I pay for.this game. no. I got it for free during the free day. Overall this is a O.K. game, but it is not worth a dollar.
055357342X|1.0|I started this series based on the recommendation of a friend. What a mistake. Reading these books is like being on a treadmill and never being able to get off. It is the same stuff over and over and over and over......ad nauseum. Some of the characters are well developed, but some are cartoons. I mean, can you really read about this Lord Renly guy and not think of the Prince Charming character in \\"Shrek\\"??  And did the \\"Shrek\\" people create Lord Farquaad in the image of the Imp Tyrion...or was it the other way around? Don't bother reading more than the first book. You can just read it over and over and over and over again and get the same gratification - if you like self-flagellation. I quit reading midway through book #3...just kept hoping it would eventually get better. We all know where this story might eventually go. The Others can only be killed by fire and there are dragons coming to wipe everyone out. Only I am sure Martin will ride his gravy train into perpetuity.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Purchased this for the Kindle Fire.  My 8 year old son and myself worked on the mystery together and solved in two days.  A few of the puzzles were tricky for my 8 year old, but he did most of the game himself.  We had a lot of fun figuring out what we should do with the latest clue.  I wish the game lasted longer.  Game play on the Fire was flawless.
B005SV9X22|5.0|Awesome DVD!! Thank you for mailing so quickly!! I was very impressed with your professionalism!! This made a wonderful Christmas gift!
0062101897|5.0|I got this book as a Christmas gift and couldn't be more happy with it. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and think that this book could be a sufficient encyclopedia of the world (if J.K. Rowling doesn't get around to writing one herself). I've only just started to read, but the  size of the pages are huge and they are filled with photos, text, sidebars, and little insights into the minds of all of the creators of the series (both film and print). In the section I read last night, there is a photo of pages from the original Sorcerer's Stone script and a drawing of a map the J.K. Rowling illustrated during a meeting for the production designer (and he ended up keeping the map hanging in his office for the length of filming the entire series).  The 500+ pages themselves are just gorgeous. There are pages scattered throughout that have images on them (almost like a glaze) that are only seen under a glare or with a tilt of the book. The pages are thick and glossy, and the photos are crisp and complete. I don't think Harry Potter fans could ask for a more complete compendium of the film series. I noticed that some characters are only briefly touched upon, but I won't go into detail about that here until I read more of the book.  I noticed there is currently a wait for the book and if you're hesitating, just go through with it and make the purchase. You won't regret it, and the wait will be worth it.
B00479SVBU|4.0|i purchased this so i didnt have to deal with burning CDs (my car doesn't play MP3s).  I initially used it to play Slacker Radio using my phone but the quality wasn't as great specially on songs that had more than normal bass.  I tried it using the usb port and the sound was a hundred times better, it sounded as if i was playing cds.  Im not sure if the aux input didnt work as well because there are not a lot of unused FM frequencies in Austin.  So far so good, would recommend and purchase again.<br /><br />P.S.  If you go to radio-locator.com its easy to find what the best frequencies to use in your area.  If you're in a big city it might be hard to find them, if you live in the middle of nowhere this should be awesome.  Might be worth checking out before buying it so you don't have any regrets.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this game on my kindle fire.  The Color is great and the card display very clear.  The game is easy to play and a lot of fun.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a great album.  All her latest hits.  The price was the most reasonable around.  Even better than Walmart!
B004EPZ034|4.0|It is a cute movie. I liked it better than the second one but not as well as the first. For those of you expecting an epic thriller, go to a different movie. Those looking to take their six year old that loves the chipminks to a movie - this is a great pick. Yes, it is a bit predictable. But what do you expect with a title called \\"Chipwrecked\\"?
B006QF7664|5.0|I give this movie an A+++ and is a must see for any Sci-Fi or Thriller fan.  Great plot, acting and creativity!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Sons season four is WAY awesome. When you are looking through different tv shows trying to find something to settle on, this is the one to pick. Full of love, hate, laughter, sadness, and an all over roller coaster ride!! This show appeals to anyone, and honestly just an hour to watch a bunch of wicked bikers kick some ass and get rid of drugs in their town is pretty refreshing!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game 2 play after a long day! Kids love it 2! We see who can beat it the fastest.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I bought this corded remote control over the summer.  I had attempted to take fireworks pictures and noticed I got a bit of squiggly lines in my pictures.  I had my camera mounted on a tripod, but I was manually pressing the shutter release button...which caused the camera to shake a bit.    This corded remote release is one of the best accessories I've purchased for my camera.  I just plug the remote into the left side of the camera, turn the camera on, and it's ready to use.  No need to set the camera to remote control like I would with the wireless remote.    The cord length is nice and long, but doesn't get in my way.    I highly recommend this inexpensive accessory.  Great for self portraits and I know it will work well for taking next year's fireworks.
1932907009|5.0|I bought this book for my husband for Christmas and he was SO excited to read it! It is one of the best books to read if you want to be a screenwriter. The examples given in the book are very clear, interesting and really make you think about different movies and how to apply some of the cool things about them to your own screenplay. The author also effectively gets you to think about movies in a completely new way and really helps you appreciate film for how awesome it is. This one was one of our best Amazon purchases yet!
B006PAZMMK|5.0|Other than \\"Right on Time\\", which I personally really (really) dislike, it's a solid EP. Disliking one song is not worth less than 5 stars, as the rest of the tracks make up for that one track. People in the industry can hate Skrillex all they want, but they cannot deny his ability to continually lay down fantastic melodies, vocals, and harsh synths. Don't let others influence what you like or dislike. Take a listen, buy the album, and support a great artist.<br /><br />Right In - Great vocal work and harmonics. The \\"Right In\\" and overall vocals remind me a lot of Daft Punk.<br /><br />Bangarang - Awesome up beat album. Signature Skrillex with awesome sampled vocals and bits. Great mix of harsh synths.<br /><br />Breakin' A Sweat - More laid back than the other tracks, great drum beats, melodic synths, and guitar sounds, mixed with typical distorted growls.<br /><br />The Devil's Den - Good all around track, but nothing really innovative or new. Still a great addition to the EP, however.<br /><br />Right on Time - Annoying vocals, overdone synths, and has zero emotion or heart into this track. Horrible track. It almost seems like Deadmau5 (which I honestly don't think is very good sans a few tracks) stuck his hand into this work, and ruined it.<br /><br />Kyoto - Beats, guitar, and vocals are very hip-hop-esque. Later on are the signature synths added in. I could very much see an artist rapping over this track (besides Sirah). That's not a bad thing, and lends some variety to the EP.<br /><br />Summit - One of the best tracks on the album in my opinion. Great vocals, variety, and synths. Very likable track.
1934429821|5.0|This was a gift for my husband for Christmas and we absolutely love it! Really, it's one of my best purchases on Amazon. The colors are amazing and the print quality is beautiful. The book is actually a bit smaller than I expected, but it works just fine for the size that it is. Great price, great book, I'm really happy with this purchase!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|If you enjoy hidden object games and mysteries, this is the app for you! it's unlike any game I've played and I love it.
160094048X|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this cookbook!!  The beginning of the book explains the different types of ingredients that are used in cookie baking - and why each is used.  For example, there is a section explaining the different types of flours and why you would use one over another.  I found this really empowering - now I can choose a different flour if I am seeking a different texture in my cookies.  The recipes I have tried have all been fabulous - the current favorite in our house is the ginger biscotti...worth the price for this recipe alone!  Great little cookbook full of pictures and helpful advice - highly recommended!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Amazon has become my go-to location for many DVDs, both new and used, since the selection/prices are so good.  I also trade older ones in for Amazon credit when our family no longer uses them.
B004NO03E2|5.0|This is a thrash CD that a die-hard thrash fan (like me) and even a casual metal fan should love. The music is memorable and very well played and constructed. The production has a great thrash tone...lots of crunch without losing the rawness of the style. The vocals are above average for the genre..they aren't elite, but they are definitely better and more distinctive than most of the grunts and growls that newer thrash bands default to nowadays.<br /><br />I'd throw their style more in the Megadeth and Metallica realm...so fans of those bands' earlier releases should definitely check these guys out.<br /><br />Their previous release ('Burn') is a four star release, while this one earns five from me. Hopefully they don't call it quits before they get some notoreity and the fanbase they deserve.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Good dvd, my dauther love it! Nice history  and nice price,  This movie is one of the great classics of animation, especially for Disney. The DVD version is significantly improved compared to the previous VHS tape. The picture and sound were both greatly enhanced for this release. Furthermore, both widescreen and full screen versions are available in this package.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Good graphic, good computer skills. Sound effects are appropriate to both game play and mood. I would recomemd this game to all levels of play.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I Ordered it two weeks before Christmas and got it in plenty of time.   Pretty much, as long as there is a disc and it's not scratched, I'm happy.  Sometimes in the delivery process the disc can come loose inside the case and get scratched, but this one was perfect, Everything was in perfect condition. Just another satisfied customer.
0385535139|3.0|I've read nearly all of John Grisham's novels. The Litigators is very interesting because it shows a side of the law few of us witness - mass torts.  With his experience and research, Grisham has done a great job of illustrating the pitfalls of the legal system as it pertains to such litigation. The characters are well developed and their actions believable. If there is any downfall in this novel, it is the lack of action. Parts drag and it is not quite as suspenseful as his earlier works. However, when I finished the last page of the book, I was glad I spent the time reading it.
0061537969|5.0|Don't read this book if you don't want to cry. Dont read this book if you don't want to laugh. Don't read this book if you don't want to get mad. Don't read this book if you don't want to get philosophical. Don't read this book if you don't like books told from a dog's perspective that will make you re-see your own humanity.  In other words, read this book. Highlight in it and then lend it to others to read. That's how I got it, and now I need to give my friend something of equal value to read ... and I don't know what. Incredible book - you'll thank me for suggesting that you read it.
B005HSL626|5.0|this app is awesome!!!!!! plus,it is free!!!!!! I would recommend this to anyone! however, this game needs more original ideas, not just simple things.......n.
1599218011|5.0|I picked this book up as a present for my dear mom about a year ago.. and couldn't part with it myself! So I bought another copy. The way the book is presented is sassy, smart, and inspirational. Kris talks to you in a way you wish your doctor would. She communicates with spunk and I LOVE my Crazy, Sexy Diet. (And the word \\"diet\\" really should not deter you, it isn't a diet book, it's an empowerment book about what you should put in or keep away from your mouth, if you choose not to listen, that's your business!) There is zero regret in getting this book. Tons of information, additional articles by leaders in their respected medical/wellness fields, vibrant photos...you can't lose. Highly recommended if you are serious about improving your quality of life.
B005ZUR724|2.0|just downloaded today was on for 15 min then got booted now says needs new update. this happen often anyone know? their forum is weak too.
076790382X|4.0|This book is a compilation of articles, or at least it reads that way.  I liked it, though it wasn't exactly like his other works I've read and enjoyed.  The segments were funny, of course, but I did enjoy his other works more.  It cost a penny, plus shipping, so I didn't feel I was disappointed with what I invested in buying it.  If you are choosing between this book and others by him, however, I'd choose the others.  I love Walk in the Woods, Neither Here Nor There, and In a Sunburned Country, among others.  Those have more of the sidesplitting humor that Bill Bryson is definitely a master of.  This book had funny moments, but the format of it was not similar to his other books due to the chapters reading like articles.  That's fine as long as you know that's what you're getting.
B006C1DH92|5.0|None problems on evo 4g. I liove how with the bombs, arcade style was mixed in...missing from the original. great game
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|Dear Amazon. com, (sorry for my bad english)    You must change your order description : I know on the box is written FRENCH LANGUAGE or FRENCH SUBTITLES, but when you open it you have just spanish and spanish/mexican languages or subtitles ! Only the bonus blu-ray have french subtitles. It's the first time Disney make that on the boxes, and of course you give the same bad information on the order description.    Of course the film is wonderful and Pixar is the first animation Studio in the world with Disney.    I thanks Amazon.com to try to send me one another box, but it is the same problem for french people.    Cordially yours    M.Dupuy
0395389496|5.0|I love the Polar Express story - have seen the movie several times and now read the book. It is a classic for little children.
6304493681|4.0|As a fan of animation and of anime, this film is a cornerstone of the industry. Great characters, great writing, fantastic action and a visual that is just this side of a revelation.<br /><br />Fantastic film!
B00004U8P9|5.0|On time and as advertised.  Great movie and well worth being in anyone's collection.  Bought as a gift and he loved it!
B006C1DH92|1.0|I guess im one of the few &quot;not compatible with some samsung devices&quot;, pretty lame.  Fix this inconvenience.  Why release this with such a bug? Oh thats right, greed. I hope your money rots in your filthy hands.
B006B3975Y|4.0|I've been a fan of The Roots for a long time. I love their music. This is another great album. The Movement tracks are beautiful. The way the group reinvents themselves each album is to be applauded.
B001U3ZMHW|5.0|My son is very proud of this set and loves it to pieces.  He stares at it a lot and wakes up early just to stare at it. The walker was a little hard for him to put together (he's 9) ,but the rest he did himself.  He had trouble working on the carpet, but once we moved to the flat table things worked out.   He got it with the Ewok Attack and is ready for more to add to it.  That's not going to happen for awhile...
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music is like  sex for your ears and its a relaxing game. if you are ever stressed out you should be playing this.
B00479SVBU|3.0|Item was as described, however sound is poor. I've tried both different USB and SD storage as well as different FM frequencies and the units' EQ and so far the sound is quite flat and quiet :(. Hopefully if I use the unit in a newer vehicle with an aux input it will sound better......
B0042RJWTC|5.0|If you like this era, you'll love this series! It will keep you wanting more!!! The cast is fantastic. A must see and have.

B001PU8N0I|1.0|ugh!  Gutted the story, bad acting, lousy sets.....to quote The Critic, 'it stinks'.  Get the Sands Films double film version with Alec Guinness and Derek Jacobi.  Infinitely better made and better acted.
B005ZUR724|1.0|NOT WORKING FOR KINDLE FIRE THERE IS NOT NEW VERSION OR UPDATE EVERYONE VOTE ONE STAR TILL THEY FIX THIS!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I never saw the product. I sent it to my daughter. She said that she didn't think it looked like new and that there were some scratches. But the dvds worked just fine and in the end she was quite pleased so that's all I care about. I recommend this seller. Thanks for your prompt delivery.
B006C1DH92|5.0|My wife loves it! Runs great on my Epic 4G running ThunderHawk 3.3. Loading time takes up to 30 seconds though.
B005ZUR724|3.0|It's just a basic mmorpg- but as simple as it is, it's quite fun. The phantom update issue is a problem, but the big dealbreaker is the complete lack of acknowledgement or response from gameloft. I'm just glad I'm only out a dollar!
B002NANLCE|5.0|If you are looking to continue the story told by the TV series you will be let down. I do have to say that after reading the book I can see the direction the story was going. Worth reading!
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I love the retro sound and the songs they picked for the album. My only sorrow is that it is not longer. They also donated a portion of album proceeds to a great educational organization called 826! Buy it for your yourself and for others...great Christmas gift.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|This is a great book about a great man. Once you've read it go and get yourself a copy of [[ASIN:B000JQUYII Edison, His Life and Inventions]] free for you Kindle. The comparison between these two people is uncanny, albeit these books were written 100 years apart.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great, thought provoking read for all ages.  Easily recommended.  Read it before you check out the upcoming film, there's likely to be alterations.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|This is the first Il Divo cd I have purchased but I will definitely be buying their previous cd's now that I have experienced their phenomenal music.  The arrangements are superb and the blending of their powerful voices is truly beautiful.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I first tried this game on the iPhone and loved it so I just had to get it for my android.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I bought 19 a few years ago when it came out, before 21 existed.  I appreciate the immense popularity of 21, but 19 is at the same level of soul.  As for 19, I don't know how you can get more deep and moving than Chasing Pavements, Crazy for You, and Hometown Glory (my favorite).  I love 21 also.<br /><br />Edit:  After time has passed, I know like 21 better, but will always like 19.  Just such freaking awesome songs and voice on both.
1452101248|4.0|I have cooked the eggplant & a polenta from the book, they both turn out OK. Will continue to use. It's a very glossy book. Some of the Materials are hard to source in rural PA.  9/27/12  We make the fennel recipe often. It's really great. Hasn't seen much other use.
B0036TGT3E|4.0|Looks great on my 50\\" plasma LG.blueray is the way to go love the movie,even more than the girls LOL :)
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|highly addictive,  once you start you will have a hard time stopping. be aware that you may put off other tasks to continue playing this game
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you are a Rocky fan, this is a great set to have.  I've owned the series in vhs and DVD, and saw/heard new things on blu ray.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a fun app to pass the time. Some are easy enough for my toddler to play. Definitely worth downloading.
0618918248|5.0|I use to be catholic. Since long time ago I stop believeing.  Dawkins wrote in his books in a very eloquent way what many of us think about the hypocrisy of religions.  Everybody, everywhere should read this book before getting involved with any religion or sect.  Bravo Richard !! Bravo !!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Love the show. Thats all there is to say!!! Cant wait for Season 7 to come out so I can buy that on Amazon also.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This is a nice case. It does the job. It looks good. End of story. Not much more to say. I think people overanalyze these things in general. This case serves its purpose well.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Best Movie of the series by far. Especially on Blu Ray. Highly recommend this to any transformer fan. Plus with no megan fox it was even better.
B004LROUNG|2.0|I started this book but just sort of lost interest for some reason although it did have some humorous moments. Loved The Confession but this book just didn't do that much for me.
0802473156|5.0|My wife and I ordered this book at the recommendation of our counselor.  We have really enjoyed reading it and learning about the five love languages.  You will really enjoy it.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|My husband and I both listened to the audio book of this novel and really liked it. It had many twists, turns and very interesting subject matter. I will never look at an insect the same again. Good read for sure.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Amazon is definitely the place to buy Blu Rays! I got this movie because I got my wife a home theater system for Christmas, and the effects are amazing! It's a great buy. I saw this movie at the cinema, so i knew the story already; but it is nice to be able to pause the movie when you want to refill our popcorn. I was also happy to find out that I could download the digital copy to my wife's iPad so we could watch this movie when go on our trip to Vegas.
1451627289|5.0|After serving as the source for more than fifty novels, the well of Stephen King's imagination has yet to go dry. In fact, King's talent seems rejuvenated. When I saw the topic of his recent novel I reacted negatively. Another take on the JFK assassination, ho hum. As it turns out, though, while the JFK affair is the focal point of this novel, the book offers so much more--a truly moving meditation on how human actions are interrelated and how what we do (even seemingly small things) can change history in ways we can never imagine. And to add to the delight of the adventure story is a large group of marvelous characters as only King can create, and most surprising of all a marvelous love story, unequalled in King outside of his gunslinger sci-fi Western series. I whizzed through the book's 800-plus pages in no time, breathless with excitement and filled with love for a number of its characters.   I believe that 11/22/63 is one of King's best novels.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Read the negative reviews and was discouraged, we had moved and the kinnect went from a huge living room to a small kids bedroom.  Not having much room and only $20 for this I did not have high expectations, however it clipped on easy enough and within a minute or two we are playing dance central 2(2 players)!!!  Worked for us and for the money it is worth a try.
1904994679|4.0|very good but some of the record could have been updated like the rubik's cube record but otherwise its a very good book
B000K4X5XA|3.0|I can't review this disc technically, as I don't have a good enough home theater to take advantage of a Blu-Ray's picture or sound quality. But you should know that the Blu-Ray only has the extended cut, not the original theatrical release. If you prefer the 1978 version, you're better off hanging onto your four-disc DVD set with more extras, AND both versions of the movie.
B005DTEUAE|5.0|I cannot say prior to this CD I was a huge Chili Peppers Fan, but I love this whole CD.  My hubby was singing Factory of Faith and it was catchy so I stole the CD from him and he hasn't gotten it back since.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Beautiful musical with fun dance choreography, especially for \\"Try with a Little Help from my Friends\\" and \\"Come Together\\" and a Gospel version of \\"Let it Be\\" guaranteed to make you cry because it is so hauntingly beautiful.  I already loved the Beatles, these rearranged and reperformed Beatles numbers occasionally disapppoint, but more often delight and move you.  I absolutely love this musical, and I am not a huge musical fan.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Very interesting historical fiction book.  King made some liberties to make his stories work, but I learned some things I never knew about the assassination.  Disliked the ending, only reason it lost 1 star.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app for kindle I've found and I've tried a few! Easy to use and has lots of great reading plans. I highly recommend this app.
B005R32L66|2.0|Video doesn't work on my new cruz 10.1 &quot; tablet. This is lame. I did't download Skype for phone calls but video chat.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|its an amazing game. but sadly the free version has more blades to unlock. if you dont mind seeing ad's  then i recommend you get the free version.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. I haven't had any problems with it besides not winning. I would recommend this. It's a great pass time.
B006C1DH92|3.0|A great thing about this app is that it has an adventure type part to it. Unfortunately it lags so bad that you miss half of what you swipe at, which is very dissapointing. I think I will stick to the original.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The puzzles are good, the graphics are nice...altogether, it's just a good game. I wouldn't give it five stars though.
B005ZUR724|1.0|When you first try to start the game, you'll get a message saying that an update is rewuired for you to start. No update as of yet.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|When it comes to feeding the frenzy, this 8 disc series is definitely one to fill the appetite of the Potter occult. From start to finish, Potter grows in his powers and of course, uses them to battle evil which serves all those he loves so much. While this basic 8 disc series has no \\"special extras,\\" it still has the full story line and if that's what you want, it's certainly what you'll get!
B005K2XUPK|5.0|My Kindle Fire appears to be well protected while in the Timbuk2 envelope sleeve. The envelope is well lined and the outside colors are pleasing. All in all I feel this sleeve is a winner.
B004GYY714|5.0|Why TuneIn and not Pandora?<br />First TuneIn is easier to navigate with a simple home page to start you off.<br />Second right from the start you can see the wider variety of options available to you.<br />TuneIn presents you with 4 main choices - TALK, SPORTS, LOCAL RADIO, & MUSIC<br />Just sticking with the music sections for comparative purposes Pandora gives you 23 \\"genres\\" and TuneIn 25 -<br />I know what you're thinking - not that big a difference right? That's what I thought too on my first glance - but when you check closer you see how really lacking Pandora is. Since my main interest in an internet radio was the ability to access stations from around the world I will compare this \\"genre\\".<br />1 of Pandora's 23 genres is \\"World\\" - click on it and you are presented with .... wait for it.... Reggae, Contemporary Bollywood, Celtic, Dancehall, Worldbeat, Hawaiian, Classic Bollywood, Dub, African Essentials, Ska, Contemporary Reggae, Indian Classical, Cajun<br />YUP 13 channels. Let's start by looking for some Jpop - no Asian choices so let's go with \\"worldbeat\\" right? Silly person that I am, I assumed that when you clicked on \\"worldbeat\\" you would be presented with more options to narrow down where in the world you would like to listen to right? WRONG. Click the Worldbeat channel and it just starts playing songs from around the world. Nice I guess, but not what I was looking for.<br />In comparison click TuneIn's \\"World\\" genre and - well look at that - the world's a little bit bigger than we thought!<br />TuneIn gives you 37 regions of the world to help narrow down your choice (such as Africa, Arabic, Caribbean, Dutch, German, Irish, Japanese, Native, Polish, Romanian, Turkish & Vietnamese just to name a few!decide you want to search by language? That's not a problem either!) Let's get the Jpop started by clicking \\"Japanese\\". Had this been the case I would have been more than satisfied! But wait? What is this?? click on Japanese and you will get this - \\"Results 1 - 25 of about 257\\" Wait?? You mean ALL Japanese music is not the same?? You are offered a range of stations from actual radio stations in Japan, to streaming internet stations such as a station from Herndon, VA(apparently nothing is better when you are snowed in then a little anime and jpop top 40!). Now just like your local community station on TV isn't going to compare to ABC or NBC, sometimes it IS what you are looking for.<br />Both apps include commercials (which didn't bother me on either)<br />A con for TuneIn is that sometimes the stations are not available, but with the large selection this isn't much of a setback. TuneIn will also suggest similar stations if the one you want is currently unavailable. (Please note- I wasn't on Pandora enough to know if it occurs there as well.)<br />TuneIn also offers features like a sleep function and an alarm setting (If Pandora has them they I didn't find them.)<br />So overall, while I think Pandora is a fine app I really like the versatility of TuneIN.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Extremely light, sufficiently sturdy.  The rubberized coating gets smudgy. (And on mine, there are two spots on the back where there is no coating.)   The microfiber lining, which is certainly gentle on the screen, is also a playground for lint and dust.
0307120007|5.0|This little touch and feel book is a quiet entertainer for little hands. I used it many times in church with my little ones on my lap, and still love this book. Makes a great gift for young children 8 months and up!
B006LS7DQE|1.0|I just got my kindle fire and his game wont download. tried to send email for help or refund but what they give you is a dead link.
B005QPJDGG|2.0|First of all, I'm interested in reviewing the box set itself, as a product, rather than the music. If you are thinking of spending the money for it, I have to assume that you like the music. I don't see a review on here specifically for the box set, so here goes.  It comes with (1) one CD with lyrics, one without (like they did with Black Clouds), and the DVD; (2) a double LP of the album; (3) a pad for the turntable platter; (4) a lithograph.  The discs are fine, although I'm still not sure what I would do with the instrumental disc. Many of the other reviews cover this piece of it, so I'll end there.  The vinyl, as others have noted, probably could have been produced more like a vinyl and less like a CD. While I would not consider myself an audiophile, that's probably a reasonable assessment.  The pad is perhaps one of the lamest parts of this box set. There was a manufacturing issue that delayed the distribution of the sets a couple of days, and when I finally opened the box, my first reaction was that I had gotten one of the malformed pads. It's some kind of cheap synthetic foam that has \\"tire tracks\\" (ostensibly from the mime on a unicycle) on it and the DT logo. Except these graphics are black-on-black, so you have to hold it to the glare to even see them. Simply put, I don't think there was a great deal of effort put into these.  The lithograph was fine.  The construction of the box itself is horrendous. It's packaged in paperboard, like cereal boxes, and is quite flimsy. Again, here, the graphics are black-on-dark blue and hard to see.  The major beef I have with the set is about valuation: how is this worth just over $100? Purists will no doubt spare no expense in order to collect everything DT, but I don't think that a turntable pad and a lithograph ends up covering the extra money. $16 for the special edition, $30 for the vinyl. That leaves roughly $60....The bottom line is that this is way, way overpriced. Just look at the rock solid content in the recent Pearl Jam box sets. They're a bit pricier, but they have way more stuff and the box itself (which, to be fair, isn't what you buy it for, but which is also the reason they don't just send you a bunch of stuff in a plastic bag) is a nice canvass-covered, sturdy pressboard or something. I won't tell you what this makes other people feel like, but I feel duped. My sense is that most people shouldn't bother with the set, just buy the special edition and the vinyl and save some money.
0671449028|5.0|As with many of Boynton's children's stories, it's silly and some of it's odd (exercising before bed, for example). However, it's fun to read, my daughter requests we read it 3-4 times a day, and many of the characters are familiar from her other books. I've also noticed that my two-year-old is now excited to brush her teeth where before I had to push her a bit to brush twice a day.<br /><br />The story is short and easy to memorize so it's a great low-light bedtime story. My daughter picked up much of the words after we read it just a couple times. My only disappointment was that I wished the penguin from Personal Penguin was in it, but that's just because the penguin book is the mommy favorite in our house.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|My dad always calls this movie Dances with Smurfs, and a lot of people I have heard compares this to Ferngully (and they would be right) but the theme of this movie is still as true now as it was when Ferngully first came out. Not only that, but the quality and realism of this movie are astounding. It sucks you in and it's like being immersed into a totally different world. I've been wanting my own copy of this movie for awhile and now that I have it, I'm sure it will be watched over and over again.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Downloads &amp; works great on HTC Incredible running 2.3.4. I never have played the original Fruit Ninja, but so far I love this version. Smooth graphics &amp; game play. Very fun &amp; challenging. This will probably be 1 of the few games that I'll never delete from my phone. Enjoy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very addicting on those long car rides and no Internet. doesn't drain the battery much at all. good graphics and good response, just wish you couldn't take cards down from the ace pile.
B001FB4VXU|3.0|It is the funniest show ever! I love it. Just came to me with one of the discs cracked and unable to watch.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app constantly on multiple mobile devices. I used to have scraps of paper everywhere in the house, now I have evernote.
B0040X46TE|5.0|At first, I heard these beautiful songs on the buses in Hawai'i.<br />The bus driver has introduced a genuine sound that is Israel Kamakawiwo'ole to my ears.<br /><br />No one does \\"Over the Rainbow\\" better than Iz.<br />An awesome take on this traditional song, he makes it his own with his incredible voice and talent.<br /><br />It is no wonder the UFC legend, BJ Penn, walks into the octagon ring with \\"Hawai'i '78\\".<br />The spirit of the islands flow heavenly throughout this graceful hymn.<br /><br />Let this album send you through a majestic journey to Hawai'i.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game was pretty fun and definitely tests your reaction timing. I chose 3 stars because there is not much depth and only entertaining for a small period of time, in my opinion.
B0058RN85O|5.0|We love this show and we bought season 1 last year.  The price is right at Amazon and it arrived perfectly and promptly.
B005ZUR724|1.0|This is the first app I have purchased for kindle and as others have already experienced their is some mysterious update that will not even allow me to create a character. I will be expecting my 99 cents back. Terrible customer service. I presume all the apps are poorly coded.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Being able to sit down & view episodes back to back makes for one of the best entertainment experiences imaginable if you like the show & the wondeful acting that is a part of every episode.
1933952806|2.0|This book is pretty useless, it is a decode of the user manual, just like another reviewer wrote.  I found the \\"scene modes\\" explanation in the user manual is more useful than this book. It does not teach how to take great PIX, pros and cons of various Nikkor lens, etc.,  I may return it, if I continue to find the user manual is more useful. Another reviewer said this book is just plan wrong in some instances, I think the ML L3 remote.  I have another month to decide if I want to return. You may want the much cheaper Kindle edition instead of paperback. Surprised to view so many four and five stars ratings from others!
0060873027|1.0|So \\"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\\" meets \\"A Bug's Life\\" and a little bit of \\"Ant Bully\\".  The end tries to be like 24 but is really like the old Cars video \\"You Might Think\\".  VERY Dissappointed.  I've been so irritated reading this, no one even wants to borrow it from me!
B001JNNDEW|5.0|One of my favorite \\"I hate work\\" type of movies of all time!  A must watch! Instant classic!  I definitely recommend this.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I saw this title on TOR.com and read the first paragraph of the review -- paraphrased it said   \\"If you like fantasy books - dive right in.\\"  I do, did and haven't put it down.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I gave this movie 3 stars because it seemed a little slow.  They seemed to have taken all of the action from the last book and stuck it in the second part of the movie.  This would have been better as one whole long movie...but still a must have for any Harry Potter fan...and definitely a keeper to complete your DVD collection.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Luckily, the most recent reviews that I read for this product were good. Looking a little further back I saw comments indicating that the cover was cheap and of poor quality. I strongly disagree. This cover by Marware is, as they call it, extremely lightweight, however, the material is a great quality. I was hesitant to put a cover on my Fire because I love the soft feeling of the back of the reader, however, this cover mimics that same texture. The stand works well on a flat surface. I would recommend to any friend buying a Kindle Fire.   If previous reviewers believe the material is cheap because it's not leather, I'd have to agree. Its not. You didn't by a leather cover. Otherwise I disagree and highly recommend!
B002I0J5FG|4.0|I gave this 4 stars only because I have yet to play ICO.  However, I LOVE Shadow of the Colossus and have been waiting for them to remake it in HD for the PS3.  I have no doubt ICO will be just as good!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was nervous at first because of the price but after it arrived I was very pleased with the product.  It is not the cardboard box with 8 small sleeve movies inside like expected, but it is one large plastic case with the 8 disc inside on a flipping book-like track.  Great for traveling and adding to bookshelves with little room.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have this app on all of my devices and have used it food ever. I am really looking forward to when you add the radar feature.
B000059HAI|5.0|I purchased and watched this film for a class project, so I can say I didn't really want to watch it.  It was a of course, not the best quality film in the world,  but this didn't keep me from being engrossed in the story very quickly.  I'm sure there is a certain amount of Hollywood liberal story interpretation, but the story seemed to be pretty spot on with the history from class.  It actually peaked my interest and lead to a WWII film viewing session.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I grew up reading Tintin comics of my dad's, and he grew up reading them in a magazine. So it's a family tradition of sorts, and I was VERY excited to see that Tintin was now coming to the theater! So far I've seen it twice in two consecutive days and it's superb!! Loved it! The filmmakers did an excellent job and even my friend who went to see it with me the first time who was unfamiliar with Tintin enjoyed it thoroughly too. It made me want to read the comics again so I went out and bought the collector's edition for our family as a Christmas present. I've since read or re-read through twelve of the comics, including the three that the movie was based from, and I have to honestly say as much as I still enjoy the stories, I like the movie even better! Now that's saying something!! If you have any interest in Tintin or in just a clean family adventure film, please go see it; you won't be disappointed! It's great stuff!
0525423656|4.0|I absolutely loved the first book in the series, the characters have a lot of room to be developed in the story.  This does happen in the second book, however, the author's choice to switch between the two character's perspectives makes for a challengin read at times.  It almost seems like forced transitions, as if paragraphs and chapters exist just to switch narrators.  Not my favorite read, but still a solid book.  Once again, I would say it is a fairly safe option for the mature tween/teen set as the romance/sexual aspect of the story is not very graphic.
0525423281|4.0|Even though this follow up is loosely based, you should read Anna and the French Kiss first. I loved both of the books. Lola and the boy next door was a great book because even though I couldn't relate to her much, she was still very fun to read about. This story made me laugh and swoon and love Lola for her spunky personality!
B005ZUR724|5.0|there's no update avalible I have Thad this game for 3 days and before the update it was the most fantastic hand held game I ever played there for I still hive 5star hope update comes soon
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Use this on my HYC EVO 4G &amp; it's great. I bought it for my Nook Tablet and discovered I couldn't sync to my Google calendar. No way to do this. Since this was sidelined, it cost me $1.99 to find this out. Such is life.

0307959856|2.0|I really love Austen's Pride and Prejudice but I wouldn't call myself a fanatic, so I thought I would really enjoy a \\"sequel\\" like this.  I wasn't set against the murder-mystery atmosphere of the plot but the characters just lacked Austen's sparkle.  Elizabeth didn't have her usual wit and Jane was even flatter than she was in the original.  I was ready for the characters to have evolved somewhat from where they left off at the end of the original but PD James had changed them so much that they were barely recognizable.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good murder mystery, there are betters out there.  If you are looking for a revisit with the characters of P&P, you also won't find it here.  I'm afraid that the combination of mystery and P&P just doesn't work at all and ends up failing on both accounts.<br /><br />As a side note, I listened to the audiobook version and I wouldn't recommend it; the narrator is trying so hard to force grandeur into the writing that its quite awkward.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great! the only thing that I would want them to change is that they could give you hints or something so you no exactly what your doing .but other than that it great.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game for free is alot of fun! Highly recommended. Product placement is a little annoying. For free can't complain

0316078913|5.0|I love David Sedaris.  I think that he's a wonderful author with a great ability to convey his sense of humor through his words.  I purchased this book for my sister-in-law for Christmas, and she told me today that she's already finished reading it.  I would recommend his books to anyone.
B0063IH60K|4.0|it's easy to play, really enjoy my new kindle fire, and all the apps. will reccommed to all my friends.
B00555X8OA|2.0|I admire academicians and researchers who can distill complex topics  into words and examples the layperson will understand.  I liked this author's subject matter but found it fatiguing to read.  My suggestion for the business layperson is to read the first few chapters closely to get the essence of the book. Skim the table of contents to see what else interests you.
0439023491|5.0|Although I wasn't as quickly \\"hooked\\" by this second book in The Hunger Games trilogy, I ended up loving it just as much as I did the first book. The story begins with Katniss and Peeta touring the districts on a mandatory Victory Tour. Katniss soon picks up on notes of discord in many of the districts. These hints of rebellion make Katniss uneasy...almost as uneasy as the now tense relationship between her and longtime friend Gale, as well as between her and Peeta. But the Capitol and President Snow have much more in store for their most recent Hunger Games victors...something Katniss never saw coming.<br /><br />The pacing of the first half of this book was considerably slower than the second half. Pacing aside, fans of The Hunger Games will once again be exhilarated by plot twists at every turn, and will enjoy intricate main characters and further exploration of the love triangle between Katniss and Peeta and Gale. I thought this was a nearly perfect sequel to the first book, and it made me all the more excited to read the last book in the series. If you liked The Hunger Games, Catching Fire will not disappoint!
