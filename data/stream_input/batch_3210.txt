B001JIFYSA|2.0|I should start by saying that I love a good sappy love story - especially around the holidays.  Somehow, in 2013, I hadn't yet seen Love Actually, and I started hearing so much about it on social media.  So, imaging my delight when I saw that it was available on a long flight.  I watched.  And waited for the amazing, lovely, heartwarming parts.  I typically cry at movies all the time.  Even the silly, would-never-really-happen made for TV movies.  I was fully expecting to cry at this one, but didn't shed a single tear.  I found two parts heartwarming (see below - spoiler alert) and that's it.  In fact, the one couple I liked the most had the most anti-climactic storyline of them all.  I was very disappointed and felt that I wasted 2 hours (it's a long movie!!!) that could have been spent re-watching a true holiday love story (e.g., The Holiday, Serendipity, to name a few).  I would not recommend this movie.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: I found two parts heartwarming - (1) the opening scene showing people in an airport, (2) the scene where Liam Neeson takes his son to the airport.  The rest fell completely flat for me.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Came quickly and was brand new wrapped in original wrapping.  Haven't watched yet.  For under the Christmas tree.  Bought for my grandson.  When his mother was 2 years old it was her favorite movie that we watched non stop for months and months!
B007N9FKCY|4.0|I really do like this game but I sure do get occupied and the time just flies by.  Almost need to put a timer on when I play this game.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Netflix and recorded youtube video streams work perfect on Chromecast. Setup itself is very easy and one can keep adding devices that you can cast from as long as they have google chrome on them. But the biggest downer for me was lack of integration with Amazon Instant Videos. There is a hack to uninstall silverlight and force AIV to use Flash but that experimental cast is extremely annoying. It disconnects every now and then and its annoying to see the video run on both your device and TV and many times TV frames are few fraction seconds behind. Same with live stream from youtube videos. I was so prepared to cast a live cricket game and was completely turned off by its unresponsiveness. Overall I regret not buying a Roku player instead.
B00BPLGBRY|2.0|Great music but the videos don't work on my kindle fire. I should have just bought the music and saved the money.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|What an odd, silly story.  Having said that, I could not put it down.  Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a very unusual book.  It incorporates genuine 'peculiar' pictures that are incorporated in the story.  Just read and enjoy.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This book gave me such a profound respect for John Adams.  He wasn't perfect and he rubbed some people the wrong way but even so he was respected by friends and enemies alike because of his honesty and integrity.  In an essay he wrote &#34;It has been the will of Heaven, that we should be thrown into existence at a period when the greatest philosophers and law givers of antiquity would have wished to live.&#34;  &#34;How few of the human race had an opportunity of choosing a system of government for themselves and their children&#34;?  His sense of appreciation for this great opportunity gave me goose bumps.  I have a new appreciation for our Founders.
0143117009|5.0|Interesting to apply history to the problems in our modern society - easy to read and a good sequel to previous book about the development of civilzations
0062060554|5.0|This book was so different.  I couldn't even come close to guessing what was going on.  The author has an amazing imagination which takes you down a completely different road than the norm.  Loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I`m very happy to finally have this game in my tablet. Is very funny and highly addictive, and also sometimes frustrating!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show. I could not stop watching it.  Don't now how I missed it on when it was on tv
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I haven't even bought the app. I just saw &quot;riptide&quot; and was just like PERCY JACKSON. I gave it 5 stars because I didn't know how to rate it.<br /><br />FANGIRL LOL
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It has an intersecting portrayal of a somewhat dis-likable character and lets you decide his motives while trying to resolve a serious family conundrum in court.  A super read, in my opinion!
1476733953|4.0|Very good book, I have the others in the series on my &#34;to read&#34; list.  It was very interesting in the beginning with the change in characters, I hadn't expected that. it was a good read, kept me interested throughout.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show!<br /> My hubby and I both enjoy watching it. It's on too late on Sunday nights so we love watching it on Amazon! Thank you!
B008XKSW7M|1.0|Looked promising, really disappointing. None of the (many) story lines were remotely funny. So many wonderful people in the movie and they all let you down.
0061122416|5.0|I read this a long time ago and now I'm rereading it as an adult. This story has such a profound moral. Very uplifting.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|Bought item when came out in August. I buy movies to watch later so granted my fault that did not attempt to watch till today 12/7/13 and wouldn't you know it but the Blu-ray Disc does not work. All I get is 25 sec of Universal logo at beginning then absolutely nothing else, no pic, no menu function. Just to be sure I did an update on blu ray player and still nothing. DVD seems to work fine. Outside of just over a 30 day policy for return. Would like to think since have a totally non-functioning disc I would have another option.
0156027321|3.0|I really tried getting into this book but for some reason it just didn't do it for me. I know a lot of people who love this story, though.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I have all of these and I never get tired of playing them.  These are not time wasters but mind exercises.
B009CVRQLY|3.0|I love Celine singing ballads.  She also does rock really well - only it is always in French!<br /><br />This one and the last one have a lot of these weird to me songs.  I don't know how to classify them.  They aren't R&B, urban, or rap, but they are almost a mix of it?  It's not something I enjoy listening to.  She has a great voice and they just don't show it off.<br /><br />And maybe I listen to it a little more and find something I like.  I just got spoiled with One Heart - I think I loved everything on that album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome! It's one of the best games I've ever played! It's extremely addicting! You should play this game!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! I could stay on it for ours looks and finding things to make, do, and refinish! this is an awesome website. glad I added it to my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9&#34;!!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The product was well packaged and has withstood multiple playing without any problems.  It is a great collection of futuristic stories and I recommend it highly.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook on the kindle is great. Love to be able to keep in touch with friends and family through this website! glad I could add it on the kindle fire hdx!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I have found this DVD to be extraordinary in helping to understand the inner workings of the Kennedy/Johnson administrations, plus understanding how our foreign affairs have become more important as industrial/scientific abilities have grown. This is a must see for anyone who wishes to become a more responsible citizen in our world today.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Fabulous story chockful of immense learning.  Fourteen more words required hmmm there is another eight.  Made me want to visit Holland.
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Didn't properly play the first file I loaded, a pretty standard .mp4.  Sound works, no video.  Life's too short to be fooling around with codecs, updates, patches, etc.  This was on a Kindle HDX.  (buzzer sounds).  NEXT!
1451695195|5.0|Great book about his experience and I bought it on a recommendation.  The thing is that it was his experience and no one can really convince anyone else that it was actually real.  It gives me hope though that there may be a God or at least something like many religions promote.  I am partial to the Buddhist view and I think his experience could have been that.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|Story is a timeless classic and the cartoon add ins are stupid. I was very disappointed with this version. Should have returned it.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|This is a quality holster for a dslr.  I just wish it fits my Nikon 5100 a little more snugly.  If I buy the model that'sone size smaller the strap won't fit, so I settled for this one instead.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A beautiful book!  What more can I say?!!  I certainly hope the movie does it the justice it deserves.  Zusak is a great author.
B00000ADG2|5.0|1 of the best and complete Albums ever, for all those who gave her 1 star got to be deaf or don't recognize real music a gift and talent. If you like Hip-Hop, R&B, soul music with a positive message you would love this album, but if you like club music that don't make u think or feel uplifted this isn't for you at all.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|To have the complete series in one box is the satisfaction that I can watch any or all at any time.  Obviously I like the videos.  Entertaining, well acted and a good story line that tries to follow the books.  Blu-ray makes it just that much better.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Great movie; great value. If you haven't seen this move I suggest you make the purchase. It's a must have.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This was a very Interesting, well researched novel. I need to visit DC again and look for all the symbols at the national monuments.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This puzzle game is a blast and preferable to others when allowing my children to pass some time. Challenging at times for me too.
B005K01VZS|5.0|As always Mitch Albom reminds me of our humanity. With humor and insight, we are shown that our differences are what makes us the same. Our searches and dreams relate us in unbreakable bonds.<br />Thank you.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|Good series. My kids loved the books and the movies.  Highly recommend this movie to any family looking for a good movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that the game &amp;#34; Candy Crush &amp;#34; is a very good game. I showed my mom this app, then she went to download it to her IPad and played it on my kindle fire until it was downloaded I'm @ level 24. My aunt plays it, my grandma plays it. So get Candy Crush saga to day it's a famous ( and free ) app.
0375831002|5.0|it was so well written. I can't wait to see the movie.  I loved the way everything was depicted.  So wonderful.
B005721W9O|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies! Yup it's silly and simple, But Hey! With gags like Historical Documents in regards to Gilligan's Island, and the &#34;Chompers&#34;. Ad to it the message that whatever we do is significant, how can you go wrong?
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My grandsons will sit and watch this movie over and over again. They never tire of it. That is why I gave it 5 stars.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Fabulous! Hemingway puts you right into the moment. The bullfighting scenes are fantastic. He also brings you into the world he describes in such an intimate way. You identify with the innkeeper as much as with his scorned friend.<br />I have read it three times and always come away with something new.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|good tower defense game.  just what you would expect.  it a solid game. I really like the theme of the game.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Adobe Systems -I am able to download and view my downloads with no problems .when I am ready to view my downloads it is right there ,
B00358ESI4|5.0|Read the book. Movie was very close. Mel Gibson played a great role. Movie depicted what really happened, without being as grafic as the book was able to do.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because it was awesome. What I dislike is when peeta died well I think he died. I preferred this book to my family.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|No way to describe the connections and old friends I have made. But at times the rants and raves get to be too much/ sometimes the rants and rages are ME, lololol.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a good game. It is fun especially when you are playing wit h a friend. But it does not have some of the same features from pc and Xbox. Still it is a fun game
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books.  Can't usually put one down and now with a Kindle it is so easy to take Mr. Sparks with me.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a great game to play after a long stressful day at work.  It is also fun to play with your kids if they have their own tablet to see who can finish first.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|I love listening to Zooey's voice.  She brings a soothing flavor to Christmas songs.  So nice and smooth.  Love it.
1594202273|5.0|Command and Control (2013) by Eric Schlosser is a fantastic non-fiction account of nuclear weapon safety, control issues and nuclear weapons in the US. Schlosser is the author of excellent Fast Food Nation and Reefer Madness. He is a superb craftsman of non-fiction.<br />I remember being in a supermarket in the late 1980s and being scared out of my wits hearing a warning that scientists estimated the probability of nuclear war before the war 2000 at about 50%. Films like The Day After and regular news stories at the time emphasized that hundreds of millions and possibly billions of people could die within hours should a nuclear war take place.<br />Schlosser’s book looks at a particular incident, that of the puncturing of an oxidiser tank at a Titan II missile base in Arkansas during the late 1970s and uses that to provide a narrative for his story of the US nuclear arsenal, its readiness and safety.<br />Schlosser writes about how the US nuclear arsenal started as a project of a few brilliant scientists who then became worried about what would happen if weapons were used and who left to return to other physics studies. They were replaced by people who produced better weapons but also didn’t have ideas about safety and control in mind. A series of accidents with nuclear weapons did prompt better safety measures to gradually be built. Quite a few military nuclear accidents still occurred.<br />The book also describes how neither side had sufficient warning systems and good enough command and control to definitively prevent a decapitation attack that removed their leadership and enough of the static land based ballistic missile. Perhaps only the threat of retaliation from ballistic missile submarines kept the balance given that they would not be destroyed in an attack. Also the risk and numbers of deaths would have been enormous even if everything went according to plan.<br />Schlosser looks at how each incoming administration would not properly understand the waythe US arsenal worked and the protocols involved and would then rapidly become shocked at the dangers involved. Schlosser is also really good at portraying the figures involved. In particular he paints a rounded picture of Curtis LeMay, pointing out that Lemay strongly opposed sending ground troops to Vietnam and praising his courage in leading bombing raids during WWII.<br />The Epilogue is also well worth reading, there Schlosser points out that despite all the problems with nuclear safety there has never been an accidental nuclear detonation. He also looks at how nuclear weapons in the hands of Israel, Pakistan and India present a new and terrible danger.<br />This book is excellent. A fine narrative and a fascinating tale are combined by a master of non-fiction. It’s very much worth reading.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Awesome! I fell in love with these guys the moment I heard them play. I don't usually write reviews, but in this case I had to write one.
B007JZGIMS|1.0|Interferes with Kindle functions, and performance! Not worth Any Price! I will try to Return for a Full Refund!<br />DannyBoy
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|I was really surprised by this EP. I was expecting Royals to be the only good song since that's the only one I had heard. The other songs are just as good though. I wish they didn't play Royals every five seconds on the radio.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I love this whole album. Every song is great. So happy I got to see twenty one pilots in concert.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I think this is super fun for my kids and i because we are often bored. This game has brought us together as a family.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|its a good movie and my mom like to watch those kind of movie it and it an action movie.
0316055433|3.0|Okay, the book is long.  And, it did hold my interest, though I skimmed a bit.  I felt like the story got buried in all the description.  it was like being seated at a dinner party with a long winded know-it-all.  That said, I miss the main character and wonder how he's doing now.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|I hate it when movies that go back and make prequels don't match up with the story line from the other movies, but as a movie by its self it was very good and nicely made, I just have trouble getting over plot contradictions
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|For the love of pete, I couldn't figure out how to play this.  I finally just deleted/uninstalled it.  Just give me a simple set up, please.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game to play when you can't actually go out and hunt. I am addicted to it. I love it!
B006M4F67A|3.0|They only give you three games and then they want to get in your wallet and pay per game.  Needless to say, I didn't.  It wasn't that good or I would have.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I believe that my reaction to Tay Tay's musik is unique but incase I am wrong.  I recommend this musik for anyone who is looking for something to listen to while they write fictional short stories and novels.  Unlike 99% of all other lyrical music this musik will help you think and feel energized to write more over the long haul.  Typically only classical musik is supposed to have this effect for writers but *shrugs*<br /><br />Amazon's little thing asked why I gave it 5/5 stars and so that is my answer.  I imagine that is what a reader is after... whether I recommend it for them to listen to and I most assuredly, absolutely and abundantly do.  I find it difficult to imagine a situation a situation where this is untrue.  Thus I suggest I may be more than a little biased... or absolutely crazy.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|this game is super hard and very challenging.  For a girl who grew up with Pong this one is a show stopper.
B0000027RL|5.0|brings back memories of high school and being in the US Navy... I have no idea what the album would do for someone listening to the first time.  I am a different person now than I was then.  But for me it is pleasant.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Best Mahjong out there.  I hope they hurry and make some new updates.  Best graphics, sounds, play.  Some are so complex where it's unnecessary.
1594481717|5.0|I wish every educator and the politicians and education naysayers would read this book. Pink has hit the nail on the head about how we SHOULD, as educators, be preparing our students for the future workplace....too bad few are listening...wake up everyone....read this book and get it together so we can serve our learners of today who will be our workers of tomorrow.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This was recommended to me by a complete stranger while we were waiting in line at a restaurant.  I thought she might have had a little nip or two (were her eyes glassy or was it just my imagination).  But, I have to admit I wanted more coins right away.  Not really sure why. hmmmmm
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|My wife and I could not finish watching this. I tried longer than her. People dancing around on screen with someone whispering in the background. We both like &#34;artsy&#34; films but couldn't figure this out. Strange. Boring. Didn't make any sense. Couldn't relate to the characters.....
1250038820|5.0|Amazing photos of the everyday people of New York. I'm a follower of HONY and was so excited when I heard that there was going to be a book. Highly recommended!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Purchased for my mom and she loved it.  Would buy again for her, For myself, I would rather download though
B005MMY9A8|2.0|It was just okay, storyline very weak, Natalie Portman why were you even in this movie, seriously. I didn't care about anyone in this movie...
1400069807|4.0|great book and eye opening.  What we don't know and what the manufacturers don't want us to know is revealed
B003IEJZUG|5.0|The prologue to this book claims this is a 'story to make you believe in God.' Being a secular humanist, this should have dissuaded me from reading further. However, I am also a lover of language, and the sweet splendid prose wove such astounding scenes that I was held in rapt attention, admiration, and absolute enjoyment each moment I spent reading it.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Purchased for my mom and she loved it.  Would buy again for her, For myself, I would rather download though
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game it's got me playing it once a day has a lot of great choices to have and purchase
0062255657|1.0|Did I miss something? I could barely get through this book. I kept telling myself, especially after reading the great reviews, that I must be missing something. I continued on, looking for it's purpose, but found none.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|I wish u could go to any realm u want! But so far it's awesome.graphics are good and everything else.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|A different Angry Birds, that's for sure.  Different approach.  Some are difficult.  Again, if you like Angry Birds you will like this.  And it's free!  Give it a try.
006202406X|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed the book.  I was surprised with the ease in which the book finished.  I've read plenty of other dystopian trilogies, and found the endings,including Mockingjay and Requiem, left me feeling angry and confused.  The endings were rushed, problematic, and unsatisfying.  I will admit that I didn't have a high bar of expectations, but I felt like Allegiant satisfied some of the &#34;loose ends&#34; of the society without leaving gaping plot holes.  I felt I understood how the characters came to the decisions they did, and how the world in which the characters live resolved.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />I was disappointed, but not completely aghast at the death in the end.  I sort of expected it to be one or the other, though I was shocked and didn't believe it until they actually saw the body.  I wish things could have ended differently, but I think the character's choices definitely made sense to put this person to his/her eventual end!<br /><br />So, anyway, I'm sad, but impressed that Roth had the gumption to end the book somewhat realistically and true to the story and characters.  I wish there had been a different ending, but I think the ending satisfied my desire for resolution. I'll still recommend the series.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds, if you like them you will like this.  It's Fun, good to pass some time occasionally.  Another set of Angry Birds.  Check out Star Wars too.
0345529057|5.0|I use to be an avid reader when I was younger, but for one reason or another I stopped reading (for fun) for a long time. When I saw this box set go on sale, and had heard all the accolades and hype for the show and book series, I decided to take the plunge.<br /><br />Without a doubt this has blown away every book and series that I've ever read. Not only is it insanely detailed and vivid, but the character development and story lines will keep you at the edge of your seat every time a chapter ends. I received this book series at my house on September 1st, and I'm done with the 4 books. They all range from 900-1000 pages, so you can see I literally cannot put them down. If you are an epic fantasy fan, you are doing yourself a disservice by not reading these books. If you are not, you are still doing yourself a disservice.<br /><br />I just got A Dance with Dragons (5th book) today, and I'm already wondering what Im going to do when I finish it. It's going to be a looong wait for the 6th one to come out...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Have to read it to understand the rating. Inflicts all types of emotion. A great story witha great ending. But must read all 3 books.
B009K86D86|4.0|Great insight into one of the most seemingly corrupt industries of them ALL. It scares me that the food industry has become so monopolized and that the FDA has become a revolving door agency for food company executives. This movie made me plant a garden!
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|How can you rate Legos anything less than 5 stars?  I am an adult builder and all sets are great at bringing families together to build and talk.  Weather top is a winner!
B0013F1D02|5.0|i loved loved this movie every time i watched and i also love the first song at the end love the song, but i must say this movie enjoys in children and adults ok their are some parts that a kid cant watch but they dont show any thing i say let them watch it anyway they watch the animal show and pets around home areas right they already know....<br />LOVE THE MOVIE IT'S A MUST SEE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET
0374531269|5.0|This book was amazing to read and extremely moving.  I believe that everyone can learn from Ishmael’s story.  From a globalization and feminist lens I found it interesting to see how war could change a person so drastically.  I also found it interesting how drugs were used to block out the images and tragedies that these soldiers saw every day.  The struggle that Ishmael and the other children soldiers were put through make me feel incredibly lucky that I live in America and do not face these struggles.  I would definitely recommend this book to future classes on globalization to read because Ishmael’s story is so moving an inspiring.  His story is empowering and opened my eyes to the problems other countries have faced in the past and the struggles and challenges people have faced in their life.  This book is definitely a must read.
B008JFUO72|4.0|This movie was better then the first two plot wise. I was disappointed by the Manderain.He is a formidable opponent on his own, not just a figurehead. That is what was done with Rha a' Ghul in Batman begans.<br />The action segments were really good. But i feel much much more could have been done with the villians
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is a great and addictive game for the whole family. Can't put it down once you start playing. Love all the levels.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the weather channel app,it let's me know how the weather is goin to be in a few days ahead.I could do without the ads throw!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have had it for a while and I just love it. it is a lot better playing it on the kindle than the ipod.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is an awesome game some levels are hard and some are easy so you should try it because it's fun
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Possibly one of the best Post-rock albums of all time. This is a wonderful album. Some people describe this music as the &#34;sound of your soul entering heaven&#34;
B005LAIIN0|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! I recommend reading the book first then watching the movie. Good storyline!!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|What a wonderful book!  Gladwell challenges many conventional beliefs and gives new meaning to the U shaped curve.  As a founder of a private school, I am rethinking class size.  As a voter in California I am rethinking three strikes.  Another masterpiece
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Update 3 months later- After \\"gifting\\" this useless device to different family members I have spent hours helping them understand how this silly little device \\"works\\" (without letting them know my true thoughts, telling them it's cool. LOL)The biggest complaint from each of them is \\"Why do I need this\\" even after demonstrating it to them.Aside from it not being a stand alone device the ONLY way to control what you are watching such as simply selecting what you want to watch, Play, Pause,FFW, and Rewind or any other control other than actually turning the volume on the tv up/down using the TV remote, is to use the casting device! So that makes a total of a minimum of THREE devices just to have the limited basic functionality! And did I mention they have NO support line! Need I say more.<br /><br />Really underdeveloped device. Very tech savvy and did my homework but thought I could figure \\"suitable\\" workarounds for this device's short comings but there was nothing satisfactory. The device itself does nothing without a \\"compatible\\" device to stream from and even android dlna apps don't work. This is pure garbage if you know anything about what this device promises. Why would I want to tie up my cell phone or computer to stream netflix, hulu and the VERY few other apps it supports. To top it off there NO phone number to call for support and I see why! My father always told me \\"you get what you pay for\\" well in this case he was slightly incorrect. With this you get LESS than what you payed for! This is not sour grapes because I own a great Google TV and totally satisfied. I bought TWO of these things so family members could have a cheap solution to at least get some of the capability I have. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL!!!! Invest in a smart blu-ray player that you can find on sale for about $20 more!
0062107313|4.0|A little hard to get in to, but I like her writing style so I keep reading and it ended well
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a wonderful trilogy. I just wish that the main character didn't have to die. I think that all should this book. It has a good moral belief system that comes together at the end.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great read! I wanted the book to last...a bit sad that it's over. Can't wait to read more by  Liane Moriarty
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Whats not to like about a bunch of high schoolers trying to escape a zombie apocalypses. I enjoyed the animation and the story line very much.  Sadden that it is only one season of the animation, but one heck of a first season.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is alot of fun. Although i keep losing my points and coins when i get most the characters. I think it's the kindle doing it cause it's  doing it on other games too.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|I GOT THIS AS A GIFT TO ANOTHER PERSON (TO A FRIEND) THEY LIKED IT, I NEVER HEARED OF THE MOVIE
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a really good book and movie. Of course the book had more details about Katniss and  all of the other main characters of the story.
B0002T2Z3Y|5.0|This movie may be a lil weird to some but I love this movie and I think it was worth the money and would recommend it to everybody
B0063IH60K|5.0|Forget all those other flashy games, this game is so simple and straightforward it allows me to relax and unwind thank you
B00BR9VRSW|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD has been my favorite book for almost fifty years.  I had to own this 50th Anniversary Edition!<br /><br />1
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This is a very well written story that will bring a smile to the lips of any woman who has dated (and maybe even fallen in love with) a nerd! A light, fun read that is both clever and insightful! I loved this book. I hope you enjoy it too.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy app to navigate. Have several cities marked and can switch from one location to another for local weather conditions quite easily. Also provides a graphic for a satellite view of storm fronts. Very seldom watch TV weather anymore just use my AccuWeather app.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|movie was terrible. bought it after I had just watch all the pirates of the carriblian and made the mistake of thinking johnny would be a good actor. I forgot jack would not be in this one, that's my bad.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would have chosen 20 if your stars went that high!!!  It was an absolutely wonderful book, I look forward to seeing the movie!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This game is really fun.The only thing that stinks is that I can't get draw something two on my kindle fire and no one plays the first one any more.But other than that this game is awesome and there arent any other games like it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The frustration and the best feature is one and the same. Once you've run out of lives you need to wait for a while until you can play again. Regardless of your response, it helps to have a somewhat enforced break in the game.<br /> I'm not thrilled with the music. A little autoharp goes a long way.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My son are older, and though my sons are older, and I purchased  it for the young children I babysit for, my sons loved it as well, they are 22. 20, 18. and 15.  Says a lot if they can easily entertain them as well, it is a wonderful family movie.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Ths book was highly recommended to me. Unfortunately I have found it very slow and at times boring. Very disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I knew this book would break my heart and it did not disappoint. John Green is amazing.  I fell in love with his characters right away and could not put it down. Recommend it to anyone with a heart!
2218951983|5.0|Comprehensive, thorough, complex...and, at the moment, beyond my comprehension.  This is a wonderful book for scholars and heavy-weight students of French. I'm a student, but my progress is not yet enough to make real use of this compendium.  Verbs in French are, undoubtedly, the trickiest part of learning the language. As I move along, i know it will prove useful. But right now, all I can do is scan the pages in awe of the knowledge here.  But I'm glad I've got it. It will be useful in the future.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This thing is not a breeze to use.  Tedious as a matter of fact.  The Ruku is better and easier.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app works better than some of the apps provided by individual radio stations. Both of my favorite stations advertise their own app for their station and neither of them works consistently. However, TuneIn Radio plays both of my stations without a hitch and I have added them to the TuneIn Radio favorites bar for easy navigation and selection. I highly recommend this app!
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|To many F bombs , would have been a much better movie without so much foul language . Have seen better
B00004XQ83|5.0|Really neat old style music. It's really neat if you have seen the movie and can picture the music with the film.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|it is well written. Excellent English, too detail oriented and sometimes long winded. The similarity to Charles Dickens  style is astonishing.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Nice older style music. If you are a fan of this type of country music then this is for you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|great game but a true money pit. great way to kill time music will be stuck in ur head for hours.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pitch, Blend & Timing all excellent.  A delight to hear near perfection again!  Choice selections that make for an enjoyable holiday music experience
B005LAII08|5.0|Great Movie.  Love that Disney celebrates all cultures and eras.  Brave is a delightful story of a girl who does not want to conform.  Scenes are spectacular especially in 3D.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|This book gave me a lot of in-depth knowledge of Amazon.It also brought me a great respect for the founder/CEO.<br />I realized customer satisfaction was the number 1 priority at Amazon. Really felt good about it.<br />Jeff Bezos' work, thought everything revolves around the customer.There are few chapters in this book that really needs to be skipped.The story of his biological father,it does not belong in this book and really is boring(that’s why the four star).<br />Apart from that, a great book.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Love it! Foresee hours of entertainment. Plays well and loads fairly quickly.  Just starting but I look forward to the next region.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very good book told from an interesting prospective. Enjoyable book, probably make for a good vacation read. More words to get to the minimum.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|An Excellent CD By PJ! Some bands at PJ's level go out of their way to &#34;re-invent&#34; themselves. Not these guys. They are genuine they who are who they are. They love playing music. I've seen it at their shows and this CD is a prime example of who PJ is.<br /><br />This CD has only been out for a little while. Not only are their fans looking forward to seeing the band do what they do best. Play it live.We are are already looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />Long live PJ. If you like their music even a little. Buy this CD!
B00BL9860K|4.0|I have read all of the authors books and enjoyed every one. I am not a book critic. However i do know when i enjoy a book as u can see from my 4 stars. Sean king and Michelle maxwell are my favorite characters other than the characters in the Carmel club. I hope another novel with them is on the way.
B00G3HSF7O|4.0|good special effects, interesting plot, acting good; two types of futuristic citizens; pessamistic future; but somewhat anticlimatic.  no regrets watching it.  do recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun. Level 6 was the hardest. More levels PLEASE for more fun. Very clever. Nicely done looking for more levels.
4789009637|5.0|Its, an awesome book! to learn Japanese. I was looking for something just like this and I totally recommend it. The shipping came in faster than the actual date. The quality is like brand new, there's a few light writings but no worrys you can erase them (in pencil) but there's no highlighting in this book I purchased.<br />Legit and worth buying (:
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was a good book and I wish I could be better in some ways like it needs to be funnier
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is about reality and love and hate and fear and joy over the everyday things in life that we take for granted. Please read it and 're read it .  I give it five stars.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It is Lots of fun got it for my Son and I Can't stop playing it lol.<br />Only bad thing is you need peanuts to get gas to catch animals and you can't earn them like farmville,you have to purchase with real money noway around it : (
B003O86FMW|4.0|I like this book. I dislike president snow. Katniss is a bad-a with a bow. Gale is a queer.<br /><br />THE END
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book is well written, the words flow.  One becomes part of the story as is it pulled me in.  Seeing the war from the perspective of the country that initiated it was enlightening.  The insanity of the war is not different from the situation the United States finds itself in under the current administration.  Many lies, many fears, much destruction and greed.  The reality is too close to home. Our destinies not that different!
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|The tightest, most focused Motorhead record in years. Great songs and great sound. And they've been making killer records recently...
B0081336FO|5.0|Staying true to the engaging story line of the original works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is no small feat, but this modern TV series adaptation is the best attempt yet. Cumberbatch and Freeman offer viewers a fresh and compelling look inside the deeply complex relationship between Holmes and Watson. The setting is our modern, high-tech world, the plots are compelling, the story lines engaging and the portrayal of Holmes's archenemy, Jim Moriarty by actor Andrew Scott masterful. If you have read the originals you will not be disappointed, and if not, you will certainly be compelled to do so while waiting on the next series to emerge.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|Cool package for a fan. You can compare and contrast the songs of the &#34;Electric&#34; album. You get the original, &#34;Love&#34; sounding versions AND the stripped down, muscular rock of the Rick Rubin versions. Plus some tracks that wound up as B-sides.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|Catching Fire takes place right where the first movie left off.  It is a better than the first movie and is definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />In this movie, Katniss and Peeta's defiance at the end of the first film has evoked feelings of revolution throughout the districts.  This has caused President Snow to be very concerned.  The districts are rising up and the Peacekeepers are having trouble maintaining control.<br /><br />Because Katniss is now a symbol of freedom, Snow feels the need to kill her.  He cannot do it openly, so one of his advisers figures out a more clever way.  The upcoming games will feature only individuals from each district who are past winners.  Because Katniss is the only female from District 12 ever to win, she is automatically entered into the newest Hunger Games.<br /><br />This film is about two and a half hours long.  What is good about this movie is that it moves along fairly quickly so that you do not feel like you have watched a film that long.  Watching this film in a theater was a great experience and was worth the price of admission.<br /><br />As far as comparing it to the first film, Catching Fire is better than the original.  They are both great movies, but that should tell you how good the sequel is.  My only problem with the film is that the ending could have been better, but it is passable.<br /><br />Well worth watching and it is a movie you should watch in the theater.  Also, when it comes out on DVD, it will be worth it to add this movie to your collection.  You can watch this movie more than once.<br /><br />Easily Five Stars.
1476712042|5.0|I pick this one because I liked the cover! I needed a break of other kind of books! :)<br />Didn't know how much I would love it! I really really enjoyed this book!<br /><br />You start reading, going with the flow and then, before you know it, it's so good! Couldn't stop! My feelings were all over the place. My mood changed with each scene.<br /><br />This story is the characters themselves, and how they grow, a good girl so it seems and a bad boy who's so passionate! They both are in need and crazy for each other.<br /><br />In Abby's Point of view she is so blind all full of flaws and imperfections. Doesn't believe that someone can fall for her. Doesn't trust no one. On the other hand Travis has the same issues, doesn't think he's good for her.<br /><br />Mer and Shep were so fun!<br /><br />It was a lovely real story!<br /><br />Going to read Travis's point of view, (Walking Disaster) I know I'll love it!<br /><br />I recommend this two points of view!
159514188X|5.0|The premise of this book is pretty depressing, but it's written really well and is an overall great read. I've recommended it to quite a few people.
B00GFCMHHG|5.0|Great tour by the band. Sound quality is excellent. The addition of the string ensemble on this tour was great.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I love this series. My boyfriend and I got hooked and watched the whole thing in like a week. The box set is beautiful - great to display on our entertainment center. It's a sexy, wonderful show.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app, has saved my kindle. I just love it I wouldn't have any other app. I use it on my phone and on my kindle fire. If you gotta clean your system don't go with any other app. Get this one you won't regret it. Totally worth installing. BETTER GET BETTER GET IT BETTER GET IT
B0011UBDTK|3.0|This box set is beautiful, but my dvds are all &#34;off.&#34; The lips don't match the words often, so it's pretty annoying... I tried them in multiple dvd players, too. By the time I'd realized this, though, I didn't think I could return them and I'd gotten them as a Christmas gift.
0547884591|1.0|This book was meant as a gift for my 15-year old son who is a budding cook. However, after noting unnecessarily vulgar comments throughout the book, I no longer want it. Perhaps Tim was trying to keep things somewhat light and funny, but he did so at the expense of good taste.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Lots of fun! I play this game a lot. Lots of different animals to hunt. I hope they add more hunts and maps.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Quality<br />Jimmy Is the horse that I'm looking after and he's loving life but he needs more gems please thanks
B00280LYHS|5.0|I totally recommend this book if you like magic,  sorrow , and romance .<br />I gave this book a 5 star rating because it is a wonderfully inspiring  book.<br />If you like this book you should read the whole set of Rick Riordan.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is Facebook. Using the Facebook  directly through the browser was better. Lots of ad on the mobile app. If you have to have an app then you can't beat the price.
B00GW5THU6|5.0|In my opinion i think this is a great game for everybody<br />I have a lot of games so it ran slow and when i put the quality on low i couldn't tell the difference so I'm satisfied. I love it and i had a hard time putting it up just to make this review! Overall quite impressive.
B004G600A4|5.0|Bought this for my neighbor's daugther's 2nd birthday.  As soon as she saw it, all of the kids ran to the TV and wanted to watch it.  It's a great movie and I love Rapunzel's character.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am enjoying candy crush saga, I just try to level up at least once a day. The game keeps my mind strong and gives me something to do.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Failure to own it is a failure to understand where they've been and where they can now go without being chained to the past.  The future is so bright I thin all others will pale ans age in comparison.  More emotion then expected, less ham.
B000FA57RG|5.0|I bought this awhile ago as an import so I already knew I wasn't gonna be able to see the DVD it didn't matter much to me the CD made up for it the concert audio was amazing I just wish it included more like papa don't preach or the bed stories interlude, regardless this gets five stars
0525478817|5.0|I found this book to be entirely compelling,  and I have glanced through the other comments, and will speak less to the structure and composition of the plot, which I felt was a bit forced, but not even that much, and get right to the characters.<br /><br />My daughter, who has a juvenile form of ALS, transitioned to a 350 lb power wheelchair when she was in 7th grade, who cannot get into anyone's home without being carried, but who can tuck 4 AP classes under her belt, is an artist, masters classes from physics to English and photography with aplomb,  handed me this book and said, &#34;Mom, I think you would like this.&#34;<br /><br />She said,  &#34;Mom,  she is just like me,  she spends all her free time in bed,  her mom is her best friend, and she is completely sarcastic.&#34;  John Green did his homework.  John Green gets that a kid in this situation lives a duality,  that they are far more mature in many ways than their peers,  they have to be ultra-organized just to be able to connect with their peers, they face disappointment after disappointment in their social lives, in their home lives, in their medical lives, and in their quest for normalcy.  Normalcy has to be constantly redefined.  My daughter rarely if ever will cry or complain,  she moves forward, and she is frustrated by how few kids in her school have the courage to broach the difficult questions,  and yet she recognizes that she wears a suit of emotional armor to avert the many awkward moments she faces.<br /><br />She receives incredible offers once in a while from very odd sources,  to do things which are designed to bring a little light in her life, but from people who often have their own agendas and are not shy about talking about them at all.<br /><br />She holds it together by holding it in.  As a caregiver to a young woman in a similar circumstance,  (we have only had to say goodbye to one of her peers within our local MDA group, so far),  I can say that this book is an incredible gift,  opening up conversations in homes that have been badly needed.<br /><br />The concept of a &#34;pain grenade&#34;?  How many of our teens could talk about that to their parents,  or have to?  I could tell you of some...<br /><br />For me,  the messages contained in this book are so profoundly powerful, and too seldom available for this age group in this context.  That trumps any slight overtone there might be of John Green...  or any criticism for the sake of literary piousness.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Nice, easy but saved sellers still doesn't work on Kindle which is a pain. Wish they could fix that because I primarily use on phone or tablet..
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I decided to read this book based on how many good reviews it had already received. However, as I began to read, I thought... I am never going to get through this. I didn't care for the writing style to begin with, but I knew that so many positive reviews couldn't be wrong. So I continued, and I am so glad that I did. It is a wonderful book; one that makes you laugh and makes you cry. As another reviewer said, it sticks with you after you've finished it.
B008J34466|5.0|P!nk continues to rule.<br />I hope the databases for music start to get their character sets clear on the spelling of her stage name.
B005544V6A|5.0|This series captured my attention from the get-go...I found myself craving the next show. I'm not usually a fan of the whole judicial scene, but these guys, and ladies, are hard to resist.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Was an eye opener about our food and where it comes from. Makes me want to get back to the basics so I don't rely on the store so much. Very interesting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooooo much better that any of the temple runs! Your kids will absolutely love this game! Parents will enjoy this game also!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|very good book.  engages reader in a variety of different point of view withe respect to a world wide catastrophe.<br />I also watched the movie which has no correlation to the book.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I was in need of a book to read. Amazon recommend The Goldfinch. I bought it. Read it nonstop. It consumed my life for 24 hours.<br />I don't have the words as a reviewer to describe what Donna Tartt's words did to me;  so all I can say is: WOW.<br />I have not been consumed by a book since reading Tom Robbins.<br />Nihilism, art, beauty. It was almost too much to take.<br />I had never even heard of  Donna Tartt before reading The Goldfinch, (another 10 years waiting for another? Really?) but I must say she is now one of my favorite authors.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful story teller and as usual he excels with a heart warming story.  Thanks so much.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked everything about this book. It was sad when kids bullied August but I was very happy for him when they accepted him and became friends with him.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I like this kind of intelligent humor story line. And, you have to be smart enough to be able understand and enjoy the show.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Finally kik has started working earlier today. I noticed new changes on my kindle like video messages. Which are also unelageable on a kindle
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Doesn't have my printer listed so I can't set up for a print job. What a waste of time and effort .
B00AB7HESI|3.0|The game is a lot of fun. I can't seem to put it down. I bought it on my kindle fire. But a lot of times I have closed it and when I come back all of my data is gone. It makes me start over at level one everytime. Please fix! I'm tired of starting over from the beginning everytime.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Love each track! These guys really have great talent and pick beautiful songs to remake! Thanks for the uplifting Christmas tunes.
B00GHJ6BJW|2.0|Very disappointed in the album. Not nearly as good as the last 2 albums . only 2 good songs. The rest are trash.
0756655307|5.0|This is a must buy for any Marvel lover in your family. You can easily get lost in this book. Very heavy book with lots of illustrations. Great reference on character and event information.
0743270754|5.0|It was much appreciated by the Lincoln scholar I gave it to. He says it was well-written, broke some new territory.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a fun game but u earn coins very hard so u can't switch places that much unless you buys coins
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Though interesting, I find this book lacks a lot about what he has learned on the other side compared to other NDE books.  I did find the reading to be very long at times, hoping to get more about the other side and less about his medical condition!
B008FOB124|5.0|So glad they got back together long enough to put this together.  I love the album!  Its simply timeless peaceful really takes you away.  Just one thing.... I wish Brendan would have included some 12 string guitar.
B00110K62U|5.0|It is one of the most beautifully done broadway musicals of our time...inspiring and touching. The story is sad , but also uplifting.
B000FKO5WE|5.0|When this album hit the market in the 80's i was stun and become a fan just listening to it for the 1st time!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Controls are a little hard, but the game is really fun. Great price too: free. So can't complain about it really. Buy and have fun hunting.
B000Q67876|5.0|One of my all time favorite &#34;bittersweet, feel good about the human spirit and condition.  Some of the finest acting (and oratory skills from Freeman) you'll ever see, superb plot, screenplay, directing, etc.  Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors of our time and Tim Robbins shone as the &#34;good guy&#34; character--well that's MY opinion, even if a bunch of critics didn't necessarily think so.  Certainly on my all-time top 10 list.  I often wonder how this film was nominated for so MANY Academy Awards and didn't win a single one.  Just goes to show you...
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Gave me some basic information on creating a book for Kindle.  Could I pick up this information on Kindle website withing Amazon. However, it was well organized and easy to fellow.  I will try to make a simple easy book first and then go into more complex books.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|What can I say, it's Steve McQueen.  This is a classic that any Steve McQueen fan would love to watch.  Is it my favorite McQueen movie?  No.  That would be The Great Escape.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|All I can say is WOW very very sad cried reading the last half of book.  Cant wait to see movie.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|Wonderfully fast paced romp of a mystery. Two ex-Secret Servant Agents get drawn into a life threatening investigation involving every government agency when they offer to help a teen. A Special Ops goes bad and every agency including the Presidency is put at risk.<br />Typical Baldacci, hard to put down, intrigue everywhere. Entertaining quick read.
B00E9A656K|4.0|completely addictive game for any who love cars and drag racing!! I haven't put it down since I downloaded it!
B0064MGU98|5.0|A very well written series, can't believe we have waited this long to watch it! We watch several episodes each night!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|the saddest book i have ever read but still amazing<br />dont read this in public or else you will break down and start crying
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote to capture my thoughts, recipes, webpages, makes lists. Very helpful app. Syncs to multiple devices. Use it daily.
B001I45UFC|5.0|The book was great . I would recommend this book who likes to read and likes fighting. Good by peeps
B005V5WBFG|5.0|Protects my tablet & phone as I surf. Keeps me virus free & worry free that I will open an unsafe site or attachment.
B00563K3DA|5.0|This is a fabulous book and very inspiring. It talks about the real things that are important in every human being's life. Love and forgiveness for one's self, finding our purpose in life,loving and helping our fellow man and many other  important aspects of human existence. The author does all of this while relating a wonderful fable that helps the reader remember the main precepts of the book. It is told in a very interesting style that keeps the reader turning the pages to get to the conclusion. Read this book, it is very positive and uplifting for the human spirit.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Use it all the time. Easy access to all my email. Easy to use functions to forward, delete, send, compose, etc.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I like being able to scour various mags without having to purchase a multitude of reading material. I can pick and choose what I want to read and when on my own schedule and terms.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Great movie. Easy to watch on device. Got it to watch while on road trip. I love wall-e and eve!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|its so good, u can't find games like this one.it's so not a waist of time, so come on people don't be crabs!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The  colors and graphics are excellent. The game is enjoyable and the kindle edition is great for on the go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OMG, totally worth 5 stars people,  its soo  good, you can't  find games like this one .it's  so not a waist  of time,  so come on people don't  be crabs!!! you better rate it 5 stars!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This was the slowest moving of Martin's series and makes me wonder if we will ever see the climax to this great story. More characters and more dimensions to the intrigue.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have mixed emotions about this book.  The main character was as sick as Grey. It was way too much sex, but the plot was very good.  This stupid girl kept referring to her \\"inner goddess\\" well I wonder where it was when she repeatedly got hurt but mentally and physically.
B00G4I11YQ|5.0|How sad that Sea World took such liberties with these beautiful creatures by taking them out of their natural habitats and away from their families.  On an equal note, it is disturbing to think Sea World blamed fault on the employees whose lives were taken by killer whales.  How sad for both sets of families that lost their loved ones, human and mammal.  Sea World dismissed the facts all the way around!  Another example of corporate greed 'do or die, no matter what it costs' scenario!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Excellent story about how the world change less than 100 years ago. Impressive piece of work. I am going to read the send book next.
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|There are so many cool tractors and other types of machinery to get. I just got the game today and I love it. Ever since this morning when I got the game I have not played another game all day.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My four year old son loves this game. Its simple enough that he can play it completely on his own but challenging enough that it keeps him engaged for quite some time. There are several combinations the player can make for the train and simple puzzles/problems to solve along the way. He will play this game until the battery on the kindle dies if we allow him to.
0385344333|5.0|It's become a standard plot, but I just can't seem to tire of the Jack Reacher series. Jack, with the help of his female counterpart in the military police, solve a complex crime using deductive reasoning. On the way, there are many satisfying close encounters of the bad, and good kind. A most enjoyable read!
1881273989|5.0|I have several of his love languages books and love the way Gary writes!  I like to give the Five Love Languages as a gift to newlyweds.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I ordered this for my husband.  He is happy with this purchase.  It performs as expected and he's been using this controller for about a year now with no problems.  Quick delivery.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|Enjoyed the suspense and trying to figure out who and why.  Love Edgar and certainly think he should be a true part of the team.  Worth his brain cells in  gold!!!!!!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Strong, moves well, crisp and a clean approach.  It was a little short, a little direct, with a nice twist or two.  Only a four star book in relation to other books by Sanderson, who is a solid five star writer.
B00FZ0QBI0|5.0|Their first self-production effort gets right to the point. Coupled with the acquistion of Elvis Presley bassist Jerry Scheff, the band has never gotten so loose. Jim Morrison is the allegorical presence in &#34;The Changeling&#34; and the band has never been so fortified with funk. Nonetheless, the heart of this record stems deep from the blues. The band's blues impulses are at their most stirring on &#34;Cars Hiss By My Window&#34; and on their cover of John Lee Hooker's &#34;Crawling King Snake&#34;. Guitarist Robbie Krieger is a blues natural and Jim's voice seems that of the older bluesmen that he's always admired. Moreover, he sounds drained by fate and fame. Just play &#34;Hyacinth House&#34; and ask yourself if there's ever been any clearer message for his escapism. Ray Manzarek's jazzy piano work on the unsettling &#34;Riders on the Storm&#34; is him at his performing best. Towering above everything else is &#34;L.A. Woman&#34; itself, a compelling metaphor in which Jim addresses his weariness in the changing nature of his adopted city. This nearly eight-minute masterpiece is set to hard rock that erupts and you can't help but run away with it. What a swan song for this foursome!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|What can I say about a novella that won all the relevant awards?<br /><br />Yes, it is that good?<br /><br />Yes, it brings to mind all the questions and thoughts about what is a soul and what is identity?<br /><br />Just what would life be like if you could reach to the heart and change things with runes?  Just what else is going on in the world of Elantris (Sanderson's zombie novel)?
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I usually don't take time to submit reviews, but don't waste your time in seeing this regurgitation of special effects. Boring, unoriginal story, fake accents, etc. The effects were good, except, there were too many which drowned them out.
B00ENXBUR2|3.0|The movie itself was amazing, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I watched it more times than I care to admit. The only thing that I have a problem with is the stand. The tin container is nice and even though I would have liked for the DVDs themselves to be a little more protected, it was still nice packaging. The acrylic stand is horrible. It has 3 magnets in the middle piece that keep the tin from moving, but since the tin is heavy, that middle piece wobbles like there's no tomorrow. It doesn't fit snugly on the base so when you try and remove the tin to get the movie out, the stand completely falls apart. Maybe I just got a defective one. Who knows. Either way it's too late to exchange. I would have given this item 5 stars if it wasn't for the poorly built stand.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|It accurately depicts the loving sacrifices we make to be s mom. The strength that is needed to do what is needed.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|The game is really fast paced and fun with many variations to choose from.  Good for adults as well as kids.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|It is such a great book. It was such a heart warming story and how Bob picked James to be his buddy for the rest of his life. It is so great that Bob was able to help James at a time when he really needed the help. Good luck to both of them and God Bless Bob and James.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I just started it, but so far it is proving addictive and also a nice way to train your focus.
0375701427|5.0|I loved this book. I'm the kind of person who loves details in a story. If you don't like lots of detail, you probably won't like this.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't get was, who the hell IS Rita Cohen?
B00006IM9Q|5.0|I've listened to BLONDIE for many years but really enjoyed this CD.  There are a couple of songs that I like now that I didn't really hear years ago.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is very nice .....you can do it one hand at a time ....its really nice. five stars for sure. :-)
B002QY9RMA|4.0|I bought it for one song and that song I really like.  It's ok but not a CD that I would normally listen to.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|The product that I ordered was not the one I received. It was the wrong type case, in the wrong color. When I called to have it fixed, I had no choice but to purchase a new case. They were not very helpful and I ended up spending more money than I had originally intended to.<br /><br />The case that I had ordered works perfectly. I have had it for a while now and it is exactly what I needed it to be. But regardless of that the customer service in relation to this product was not up to par. After hearing raves of Amazon's great customer relations, I was disappointed to have trouble getting exactly what I ordered.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|This wasn't the CD that I thought had the song on it that I wanted.  It's very good if you like her music.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I thought it was very choppy.  It was hard to keep interested though I did manage to finish the book.
B00DQVST76|2.0|too much editing - it's dificult to watch it! :( And poor sound quality... It was a great show, I watched it live, but the concert DVD is a big disapointment. The previous ones were sooo much better!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|no game can beat life...but its still awessomee. you get to beat up robots until they DIE!!!!! its fun you need. to get this game
B00G32QIEG|1.0|The movie was only ok. The delivery was horrible. Pay for HD and it was so fractured it was hard to see. Don't have this problem with Netflix or even the instant streaming on amazon. But if I PAY for the flick I can't hardly watch it! Don't think I will be buying anymore movies from amazon.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|As a fan of Delta Blues (and other roots music) I was stoked to find the Black Keys (one of my favorites) had covered these songs so well.  Even Junior Kimbrough's wife was impressed.
B0088RQ4TI|1.0|The pixelation was horrible. Worst amazon movie I've ever had!!! Paid for the movie and could barely watch it! Fix this amazon
B001BANK32|5.0|After seeing Stephen King on CBS Sunday morning a while back, reading this book was on my to do list. King expressed that yes he liked Kubrick as a director but hated what his vision was with the story. Months later I finally bought a kindle and The Shining was the first book I read.<br /><br />I am amazed with the story, and even though these are just words I am seeing...it's visually stunning. I found myself biting my lip hard reading it with anxieties for Danny and I was sad for Jack most of all.<br />I can't wait to dive into Doctor Sleep!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was great and kept you on the edge of your seat! The only problem I had with the book is how it dragged out sometimes
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I don't know how to use a gun to be quite honest.But this seems like a fun game the quality of the picture is so freaking clear and bright almost like I'm rally in the forest somewhere trying to hunt and kill. It's hard for me to aim the gun and to keep a steady hand, but I will keep trying to play the game.
0525953728|3.0|I try and change up the things that I read, almost exclusively non-fiction, but something gritty like this to something historical and not about war.  It was well written enough and if you take it at face value.  You may enjoy it if the genre is appealing.  Too many reviews knock the author for discussing events that shouldn't have been put in the book.  Politics aside, it was an easy and entertaining read.  I take off two stars for product placement in the narrative.
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Lame, the only part of the movie which was good was the cgi backgrounds. Adding more words to fill space.
B000003EPN|5.0|This RCA Solti recording is by far the best recording of Rigoletto ever produced.  However the ad for the recording is incorrect.  Richard Tucker is NOT on this recording.  The tenor is Alfredo Kraus.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|Finally a great game like minecraft. I play this game all the time. It is so worth the five dollars.
B0001FGBD4|5.0|Best sounding SAC I've ever heard. Sounds amazing in 5.1 surround and the music is a good variety of Jazz and vocals.
B00006JIA4|5.0|For those who like Queen is an excellent compilation of material, three discs really are incomparable. It is a compilation of quite varied successes of different songs of the group.
B00008WT49|5.0|I love Nora Jones. I have her original CD from her first release and I thought it sounded great but then I got this one. Amazing, her voice resonates so much more and the separation of the instruments with the overlay of her throaty vocals are just perfect.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Oh my gosh this is about three best app I've ever gotten if you have kid the app is absolutely recommend is adorable you watch a little baby kitten grow up to be an adult its so cute and you can name it to how cute is that please get this app.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wonderful book about misery and love lost.  As a step-parent, I cried my eyes out at the end.  This is the perfect picture of a selfless parent suffering the self-sacrifice of love and letting go of a step child, mirroring many issues we face even today.  I never tire of reading it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Excellent! Occasionally loses the connection during playback, which may be a function of the quality of the Wi-Fi signal. Great way to view Netflix streaming.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|interesting story.  easy to figure out what would happen.<br />no surprises.  and the tactics of the attorneys would not be acceptable in most jurisdictions.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This was more like the old Bond movies.  Lot's of action without getting too emotionally crippled.  Enjoyed the whole show.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Well done. Reading the description before watching the movie, I thought it would be stupid but the movie was pretty good. I liked it
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Lots of action and twists.  Very enjoyable, but the flashlight effects create a lot of silly distractions just like the other one.
B00GTCECVG|5.0|Highly recommend! Very fun and involved gameplay. Updates with new features all the time. Good time waster, long game to keep you stimulated for a long long time. Many different battles, arenas, pvp, chat, guilds and much more!
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I had a lot of trouble downloading and installing this app, and when I did finally get it installed, it always closed itself during play for no apparent reason at random points in the game.  Also, it's only a demo, if you want the full version you'll have to pay.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Funny, entertaining and has a great message.  The whole family loved it and we will watch again in the near future!
B00ESW4TJ4|1.0|Cute gimmick that may be improved upon in the future.  Also 'way too expensive for what you get.  Guess Ricoh needs to recoup all that research and development money.<br /><br />I thought the thing was cute when I ran across reference to it on the Internet.  Then, I went to the Ricoh site and looked at their sample picture.  It was only a little better than what a pinhole camera could produce in terms of sharpness, albeit without the spherical view for the latter.  So, no thanks. I'll stick with my DSLRs.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My 11 year old loves this book, she has read it several times.  The story is engaging and entertaining.  Great read!
0451524780|5.0|I can't remember this book from when I was little, but I know that the price and free/fast shipping was perfect.  I bought it for my daughter to read for school and saved money getting it on Amazon.
076790592X|5.0|Love this book. Had to read it for class and I couldn't put it down. It will make you laugh, make you cry. Anyone who reads it will learn something from Morrie. A true and heart warming story of a student and his professor.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing book.  My 13 year old liked it when she read it with her class this year.  I'm excited to see the movie.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This show was so cute and very well done.  My family really enjoyed it,  we laughed a lot and really felt it was truly a great family watch.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My daughter loved this movie. I have seen it a million times.  Loved the online price.  Music is pretty good too.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Not very exciting I was really disappointed at the poor plot of this movie.  It was slow and certainly not one of McConaughey's better films.  It was less than impressive.
0767836324|5.0|Oldie but a goodie. Love to revisit this movie over and over! There's nothing like the enchantment in seeing a new spin on the tale of Peter Pan. We are forever fans!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It's a very addictive game. There tends to be some glitches though when they update the game with special limited time hunts like the most recent Thanksgiving turkey hunts.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Honestly the ipad version is MUCH better. It has multiplayer and the Christmas update! Add those things please! I would really like that. If u are thinking about buying this, wait until the update version 1.1.1 aka the Christmas/ multiplayer update.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I like this game alot, it just stinks how everything unlockable is tied to the console edition. The game is still a good free download.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best game in the world of hunting games I have played in my life and I will never delete it
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is awesome fun to play plenty of characters to collect. I started playing not having the console game but now I want it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app!  very addicting!  I couldn't ask for a better app to play. I have it on every device I own so I can play where ever I am.  thanks!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Damn good<br />Good better good swell fun heart warming story about the Daily life of an UN social teenager in high school
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I loved Henry Cavill as Superman.. I think he was excellent in the role but was a bit disappointed that so much emphasis was placed on special effects and not enough on the characters themselves.. The movie was, at nearly 3 hours, a bit too long and much of that was because of the FX.. I enjoyed it, but I missed the humor that came with Christopher Reeves' Superman movies.. Would like to see a second Superman movie with Cavill with less action and more involvement with the characters..
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is so fun especially the graphics it is so cool. If u get the game u won't regret it..
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|just seems like that it your laptop has an hdmi port you can do all the same things without this device.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Kingdom Rush just seems to know how to keep a good thing going. Tower defense at its finest folks. Entertaining for hours on end.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|My 14 month-old grandson LOVES the noises that the vehicles make.  While he will not yet try to move the vehicles himself, he loves watching me do it and enjoys the bubbles, etc. that rise when each page is completed.  It entertains him for quite a while each time he asks me to do it.
B00E1LAS42|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I have always been fascinated with that era, and this was how I imagine it in my head. Great portrayal of a great movie!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's very additive which is fine, but I don't like the time that you have to wait for another life.  I know it's just trying to get people to spend $$, but it's supposedly FREE.
B004TI1WME|5.0|I have used a few calculators throughout the years and this one is my all time favorite. The features are amazing.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love how its like your own pet and you get to name not just make it talk and take it to go potty and feed and put it to bed. BEST TALKING TOM EVER!!!
B000Q67876|5.0|Excellent movie shines even brighter on blu ray. A worthy addition to any cinephile's library while remaining satisfying to the average movie fan.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series.  It is so beautifully filmed with,wonderful characters and always surprises.  I can't wait for Season 4.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|I've been an avid fan of Dexter ever since I saw the first episode. I'm amazed at his two sided personality and how he selects only the &#34;bad guys&#34; for elimination. I do sometimes wonder why their sudden disappearance is not noticed that much. I hope he does not charge all that sheet plastic and duct tape on his credit card. :)
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|The author and his staff have done a enormous amount of research. It is easily readable,  i.e. the material is presented in an interesting and understandable manor.  One can learn a good deal about one's brain, how  to care and nourish it, as well as how to protect it. A must read if one seeks good health, especially a healthy brain. I do question his position regarding high cholesterol; there maybe other factors unforeseen that effect the whole cholesterol question.
B00G4CXHSK|3.0|Okay game, the first side-to-side shooter I've tried for the Fire. Fun but tough, like a good game should be :-)
B00C7DGQ9C|1.0|Terrible movie, watched the trailer and thought we would really like it but it was more of a gorey horror movie.
B00E9A656K|1.0|From what I can see all you do is shift gears in this game. The graphics are great, but all you do is shift gears. From what I played, you can't turn, you can't even change the viewing angle. Just plain dull.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|I could not get the last 2 movies to play on my PS3. Of course, those movies suck anyway, so I still got the two good movies.
B001LF3YQK|2.0|had many of these. cheaply made not durable.  the plastic case cracked, the red button which slides to close case (which was a good design idea in theory) slid off and the wipes wold dry out.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Just plain excellent. Probably their best album to date. I would highly advise buying this album to everyone I know.
B00CKDYWYA|1.0|Having never read an Amy Tan novel before, this novel would not entice me to ever read another one.  None of the characters were likable and the story was drawn out and quite boring for the first 80 percent.  The last 20 percent seemed thrown together to wrap it all up but fell flat as by that time I couldn't care less what happened to any of the characters.  Give it a miss.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a great book. I really loved it. It is passion filled and heart warming. I absolutely loved it. Great book
B004C00EM8|5.0|This movie is absolutely disturbing. If you are not in the right frame of mind at the time, don't watch this movie! The movie is outstanding but I personally have found that I have to be mentally prepared in order to watch it. Disturbing is an understatement. Watcher beware!!!!
0439023513|3.0|The revolution continues. Mockingjay was well written but I wished I had stopped at Hunger Games. As a reader, I am not a big fan of war, the devastation and destruction it causes.  But in the Hunger Games, I was captured by a fighting spirit, a determination to survive. I didn't find any of that in Mockingjay. Not a stand alone book and definitely not uplifting.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|You can play both the Angry Birds (good) side and the piggies (bad) side of this app.  My son, who I bought this for, loves the graphics and the music.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|It's fun, but too short. I wish it had more objects to locate and puzzles to be solved.  I like the hints.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Constant action, and thrills, in which all the connections from scene to scene come together and make sense.  No confusion as to why one corrupt episode leads to another.  Up there with the Sopranos and breaking bad.  Vic stands out.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|can do status updates, but cannot access FaceBook Apps and it works very slow. Very disappointing, one of the reasons for purchasing the Kindle Fire and it does not work
0061438294|5.0|Get your body language reading skills organized and get a baseline one yourself first before you try it out on the public.<br />I have read several Body language reading skills books from several different authors, some who studied about it, others that preform the practice for a Human Resources department and others that have put the practice into use reading hundreds if not thousands of people. By reading several different styles of practicing the skills described in the various books I have found that some I can do rather well and others it will take many many attempts to get a good handle on the skill. Joe Navarro used his body language skills on thousands of people and has some good insight to different methods that are not in other books. His insight to the practice of reading body language should be included in anyone's knowledge base of their own practice. I highly recommend this book.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Cannot post to Facebook so I cannot use it. Very disappointing, connected with tech support and she did not help at all.
0817439390|5.0|All Bryan Peterson's books are really fantastic. Trust me these bookies are 100% better than the Dummie Books. Thanks Bryan
B006FE83U4|5.0|The story stays close to the Harper Lee novel. Her relationship with Truman Capote as a young child growing up in the south is very similar to TKAM. The screenplay, I believe , was written by Miss Lee. It is a coming of age film that everyone should see. The racial  undertones display the situation that existed in  the South in that era.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a really good book. It was the first book of John Green's that I have read and I liked it so much I immediately bought 2 more. I really like his style of writing. This story while overall was pretty sad, was also very touching and at times really funny. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys well written, interesting characters and a compelling story.
B00062PN6I|5.0|The reason I bought these headphones is because I needed a pair that would actually work. The week before I bought these, I went to my campus store and bout four pairs of headphones - which costed at least 50$ all together - and they all broke within a matter of hours. I was so frustrated with the quality of the headphones that I bought at my campus store that I decided to take the time to do research on headphones. I cross-checked what brands were the best and which ones had the best reviews. I'm a poor college student that needed something cheap but effective.<br /><br />That's when I found these, and I am so happy that I did. These are arguably the best headphones I have bought in my life. They have amazing sound quality, volume, and bass. I love these headphones for a number of reasons and I am happy with the purchase. I would definitely buy this brand and this product again.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Classic design and beautiful watch. Resistant robust and lovely. It demands constant maintenance hence that is analog. At times, it needs time adjustment too. But all and all it is a great piece.
B0071BY084|5.0|Amazing. Joe Satriani is my favorite artist. All songs have been performed and recorded immaculately.<br /><br />Great selection of songs, including some standard JS songs. JS always make some musical twists to very recognizable songs. Very enjoyable. So is the Blu-ray.
1932100660|1.0|This book is written to distort true nutritional and biological data. It is extremely misleading but does that so well that you can be easily taken in.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Because it came in a nice size package, it was in excellent condition and so far my husband has enjoyed the series.
B00A50PBEA|5.0|This is certainly the wildest version of Magic Flute you'll ever see, but the singing was amazing, and the production was certainly exciting.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app still doesn't work and I give up on it it has been like this for months and im sure it's gonna take even longer to fix so I give up thumbs down!!
B00772M1F6|5.0|This is an infectious and feel good record by a brilliant guitarist and song writer, albeit with a passéist feel.  Well done, JD!
B00B97TMIE|5.0|Amazing album! Well worth the purchase! I am happy with every song and the order they are in on the album.
B00F9F1G4U|5.0|Normally use speedtest.net, but that requires flash.  Great alternative for browsers that don't support flash.  Works well on my Kindle Fire HDX.
1933784032|5.0|C'mon, you're a Star Wars fan, you love this universe. Why are you even waiting to buy this book? Beautifully illustrated throughout, with great insider stories of what went on in the background of making Star Wars look SO fantastic. Lorne Peterson does a wonderful job giving you a backstage tour of the world of Star Wars special effects, don't miss this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book was so good I could not put it down,I thought that A time to kill was good , this was even better.This was so good I know that in the future I will read it again.
B000002O4S|5.0|This disk is essential for every fan of the trilogy. You'll need Alan Sylvestri's complete soundtrack, too, but this is good for most of the pop pieces.
B008B11RLQ|5.0|a strong concept, original cds (though expanded with extra tracks) with original artwork replica sleeves. I enjoyed reading the backs of the albums to see how they promoted the albums back in the day. Sleeves are well made/strong. sides have information to keep the cds in &#34;order&#34;. I know as a collector I like to keep things in their original order, even though there is no specific order, I like to keep it in the order it came in, so that helps. Cds sound great, and the storage box is strong/well made and looks great next to my companion box of single replicas. Nice conversation piece and a great addition to any Elvis collection. Booklet has album information/tracklisting (of the actual songs on the cd, not just the original tracklisting as the sleeves have) and information about each album. Well worth the price.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is really fun. Sometimes you lose urban tokens though if u have to back out and if someone else backs out but other than that. I really like the app
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|We're taken back to Ford County, Clanton, and characters I remember, along with the intensity of small town courtroom drama.
B008Y5UADK|2.0|Acting overdone. Basic layouts not very convincing. Attractive is the filming with nice black and white, but not very much to say.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I must be stupid, but I can't figure out how to take a non-self pic! Can't even find the option to change it. Can't use as a camera this way. Otherwise takes fabulous pictures.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|It seems the British take great pride in producing Bond. A great thrill. The action explodes into more action. A great treat for the senses.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was perfect!! Wouldn't change anything!!! You must read it I highly recommend it!!❤ LOVED IT THROUGH OUT IT WAS WAY BETTER THAN THEBMOVIE
0525953590|4.0|Easy reading for lay people. This well-written book documents the search for the Higgs. It maintained my interest by keeping the drama up throughout. I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in quantum or particle physics, and current science in general
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy flow free, so decided to give this a try. It is just as fun and I like the sound better. The bright colors are cool too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fantastic, and the view is amazing. There is only one problem: it's not easy to get a high prize in Kung Fu games :)
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Had been looking for an Uno app but was leery of the &amp;#34;&amp; friends&amp;#34; part of this app since I don't use Facebook or similar social networks.  However, the positive reviews sold me on trying it.<br /><br />Even without a Facebook account, I find free app fun, but 1) those full-screen video ads are a real turn off!  Very effective I might add; I paid $3.99 for the no-ad version within a few days of dowloading the free app!  Well worth it.  2) There's not a lot of info &amp; instructions on all the ins and outs of all the rewards, friending, chatting, etc. functions of the games.  For example, how is it that players can request to &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; me, even though I can't put in &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; requests because I don't have a Facebook account?<br /><br />Still, I don't regret trying the free app and then buying the $3.99 no-ad version, which seems very generous with the game tokens. Now I always have someone to play Uno with. Thank much!
B008EL25LE|5.0|This is quite an addicting game. Some of the spotting portions were a little too difficult to find but all in all very entertaining.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a very awesome game for my little pony fans or bronies. However,you should make an update so you can go to Canterlot when you go to your friends place.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This is not actually a free game. They only give you one life an hour and a max of 5 lives. If you want more you have to pay for them individually which adds up fast.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's just like having my Bible with me all the time, but without the bulk. I could never replace my hard copy Bible, but this is perfect when I'm traveling or just out and about and want or need to have some time in God's word. I have this app on both my Kindle Fire HD and my smartphone. I'm not a techie, but am able to get around pretty easily. Also, like that there are many devotional studies avalable.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book it had so a twist when Snow died as long as coin . Best book ever<br />I loved it by  the thing I would change would be this prim survives then the book would have an amazing ending
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Fast shipping with amazon prime, shrink wrapped in perfect condition. I must say I've been getting burnt out on the zombie genre, same old story, same boring zombies. If you haven't checked out The Walking Dead because of that factor, this show is different. The makeup for the zombies is amazing as well as the zombie acting, sounds like an oxymoron but it's true! Great underlying story lines and plot twists draw you in to the show! Not your average zombie flick, this one actually has some BRAINNS!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A relaxing game for me.  When I am stressed out from work or a lot on my mind I play the crush and just decompress for the day

1932100660|4.0|This book, is a must have, is an open mind book about the America diet, and how bad it is.<br />This book will change you life, and the way you eat.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|When I got this game it was 0.99 cents because it was on sale but anyways I'm 11 years old and I love it but one problem it has strong language. Well in the game you can go into the store and buy attachments with money you earn in the game by killing enemies so no real money ;). The campaign is really fun like you can slide into cover (First time I've played) which I find really cool! Now for the bad which are not much, first the controls are a little bit hard to master, when enemies are behind cover and their heads are exposed and you shot it, it goes right through, that's pretty much it, hope you like it!
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I discovered Lana Del Rey because my sister, I really enjoyed.<br />She has a rare voice and all the songs are so powerful.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|For the purpose of full disclosure I have to say that I was given an audio book copy of this novel by the author for an honest review.<br /><br />Okay, now that that is out of the way I have quite a bit to say about this book.<br /><br />I really liked the characters. Minerva and Robert were very deep. They were both very built up with in depth pasts which clearly made them who they are by the time of the novel. Both Minerva and Robert had a one or both of their parents betray them and that left them with lots of relationship issues.<br /><br />I also liked the secondary characters. I am hoping that more is revealed about Minerva's best friend in future books. She is a character that had some bad things happen and I wanted to know more about her.<br /><br />I also really liked Robert's relatives and would be glad to see them in future books.<br /><br />Now, a few things I didn't love about the book.<br /><br />The first scene of the book is one that I felt had been done before. Robert is hiding in the library where no one can see him. Minerva comes into the room to hide from a suitor. Suitor says derogatory things about her. She and Robert notice each other and the book begins. When I first read that I was worried that this book would be a cookie cutter historical romance. It was not. But, I still didn't love the very first scene.<br /><br />Also, there was a bit too much sex in the book for me. I know that is very common in romances these days and it may have been perfect for another reader but especially the masturbation scenes I could have done without.<br /><br />Finally, I really hated that Minerva and Robert each have to terribly betray the other. Like all romances they do get over it in the end and live happily ever after. And, to be fair, both characters felt that they had no choice but to betray the other. It just bothered me that two people who love each other could betray each other so deeply. I did like one of the last scenes in the book where Robert has revealed Minerva's secret and has invited the newspaper men to ask her questions. It was probably my favorite scene from the book because I could just imagine Robert being all sweet and protective of his wife.<br /><br />Overall, I think fans of historical romances will enjoy this book.<br /><br />Review written by Jane B Night author of [[ASIN:B00GPDHZPY Singing The Last Song (The Louis Saga)]] and [[ASIN:B00BQJZHYI Educating Autumn (The Louis Saga)]]revealed Minerva's secret and has invited the newspaper men to ask her questions.

B00G32OER4|2.0|This was supposed to be scary? There are so many cliche's in here it's unreal. It's like a mash up of every horror film involving possession and ghosts. Booooooring. I actually found myself cracking jokes about half way in.

B009JZWO3I|4.0|interesting--simulates current things similar to politics and corruption. it shows how far individuals will go to further their own adjenda
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the challenge.... the early levels were easy to maneuver through but as the levels rise, it becomes much more challenging....sometimes frustrating but if you like a challenge, this is for you.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think it's a good game but theirs to many ads. I like the game but every 15 seconds  tons of ads pop up.
0307956350|5.0|Great first novel.  From start to finish, you really have no clue where the story is headed.  Great character development, pace of the story and wrap up.  Hope the next book matches the this one.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I'm completely new at German and enjoying the lessons immensely. My only complaint is a lack of a vocab list for each section. It's not easy learning how to spell the words after only seeing them once. Other than that, the lessons are both fun and a little challenging.
0938045768|5.0|One of the best of the bodyweight books on the market, period.  While there are other books that provide excellent programs on conditioning or athletic preparation using bodyweight training, CC shows you how to properly perform each of the exercises with guidelines on safe progressions including suggested sets & reps before moving to the next harder exercise.<br /><br />Combine Wade's book with a book like Mark Lauren's You Are Your Own Gym and you can't go wrong.

B00914JWSW|3.0|Streisand's voice is still in amazing form, but, the choice of songs and production is so-so.  After the first few plays, this CD hasn't seen a lot of air time.  Too bad her talents weren't used with better musical choices.
B00EMIE0CA|5.0|I think this is one of the best Spyro Gyra albums of them all. The fact that they went in to the studio without a real plan in mind and were able to come up with this collection of tunes after only 3 days is a testament to just how good they are. I like the &#34;organic&#34; approach, without all the pre-planning and post-production. Great job guys!
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Excellent way to explain the value and practical execution of Lean and Kanban approaches to managing IT and software development.  IT also does an excellent job of laying the foundation for understanding what DevOps is and why it is critical for teams to embrace.
B0081ISUOG|5.0|Started with the free version which works great then saw the &#34;Pro&#34; version on the free ap of the day.  Great tool for timing PT tests.  Big numbers can be seen by all graders during the normal &#34;zero dark thirty&#34; time we seem to always have the APFT.  Works great for timing the pushup and situp events as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Not a book I couldn't put down, but definitely an engaging read.  Classic Grisham- courtroom drama, good characters and a quick moving story.  I recommend it and appreciate that we're not getting ripped off paying more for a kindle book than for the paperback.  That in itself almost earns 5 stars!
B005NPCMOO|2.0|My fault I guess for not noticing before downloading that the MP3 version only includes tracks from one of the CD album discs....sort of a ripoff and a bit irritating.  Oh well, once burned, twice shy.  GRRRR

B00957T6X6|1.0|all the books are a single file, I thought it was a collection and they could be open separate, so instead of 5 1k pages books, I have a 5k pages long book, going across chapters and moving around them is extremely hard, never mind lending it.
B00GIXY4M8|4.0|As a Old school X-men fan who owns Hulk 181 (the greatest purchase of my youth) I would say that this movie continues the Hollywood trend of adapting Frank Miller classics into big budget productions.  It was closer to the classic X-men comics than most of these movies, but was a little slow at parts and was of course dumbed down for a PG-13 rating, mass audience.  I wouldn't buy, but rent was okay. I would love to see a really dark wolverine story but just ain't going to happen in this current franchise and this is at least 2 degrees removed from the good Wolverine comics of the 80's such as the original mini-series.  Good but not great
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Alex is the second of a police inspector Camille trilogy; Irene was the first book, but it was published in the US after Alex had been released here (French translations) 2014. Be sure to read Irene first, then Alex.  The stories are very much linked and whoever decided to publish out of order has done a huge disservice to US readers.<br /><br />Most of the reviews I have read focused on Alex and how the readers' perceptions of this kidnap victim change over the course of the story. True, but that tells us very little about what lies ahead.  There are a number of very interesting, very well developed characters, chiefly Inspector Camille.  For starters, the police know next to nothing about the circumstances of this crime, not even the victim's name. For the longest time she is referred to only as \\"the girl\\".  But slowly, patiently, progress is made. Meanwhile, Alex decides to take matters into her own hands rather than wait for rescuers to free her.  Interestingly, the case is solved at about the 3/4 point of the book, but there is one very big unanswered question remaining - why? The case is closed yet Camille needs the answer to that question... And it is the last quarter of the book, and the unfolding answer to why? that will draw most of Alex readers to the last book in the trilogy. It certainly will bring me back. Very highly recommended!

B00005OM4K|4.0|Mastering Defect on Disc 5? - This was a title of a post 2 years ago. Now that the Box Set has been re released you would think this problem would be corrected but no it hasn't. There is a 2 second gap at the 42 second mark of the last track Commotion and it is most annoying. First I thought I had a faulty disc but when i uploaded the song to my computer and analysed the file it showed the gap. This is a very poor effort by the record company. Beside that the music is brilliant but it looses a star for the fault.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app! Its really fun, but there's a small problem.<br />For some reason amazon dosent receive updates for Kindle fire until weeks after other devices get them. Anyway, the big 0.8.0 update came out that ive been waiting months for, and because I use a kindle, I have to wait. In the past, uninstalling the app then installing it again lets you get the update when you install it. But this time I tried and it says its removed but when I go to the appetite it says Open instead of Install, meaning I cant open it. It wont let me do anything. But it was fun when I had it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love, love, love this series!  It is very well written, beautiful costumes, gorgeous location!  I would recommend this series to anyone.

B001NRD3TY|5.0|In newer editions of this collection, King's first Bachman Book, Rage, is omitted. Stephen King took it out of print because of its similarity to the Columbine tragedy and the fact that at least one of the shooters cited it as an &#34;influence&#34;. I understand King's reluctance to keep the story in print, but I also believe everyone is responsible for their own actions, and that we can't blame art for the decisions people make. For that reason, even though it's not as easy to find and may cost a little more, I recommend finding a copy of the original that has Rage as well as the other three novels. Now, enough with the editorial. Here are a few notes on each story.<br /><br />Rage--A brutally honest, if somewhat naive, look at what makes teenagers tick. In public schools, a single classroom holds such a complex mixture of personalities, moods, and motivations, that it's a wonder schools are functional at all. I find it interesting, though, that in today's society, the extreme insecurities and pressures the students in Rage operate under might be better suited to middle school than high school. Nonetheless, the senseless shootings stemming from social alienation proved prophetic, and the warning should not be ignored.<br /><br />The Long Walk--King predicts that our increasing bloodlust in entertainment will lead to a show where an audience watches a group of young men from poor families try to outwalk one another. Everyone dies but the winner, who earns fame and fortune. Needless to say, this is a bleak novel with a pessimistic view of humanity.<br /><br />Roadwork--I think this is the oddball of the group. The protagonist is a man adrift, a middle-aged laundry worker who has to give up the house and workplace he cherishes so a new highway extension can be built right through them. He falls into a deep depression, lies to his wife and bosses, and basically self-destructs. After some alarming personal adventures, he decides to take his fate into his own hands. In some ways, his journey reminds me of John Smith from The Dead Zone.<br /><br />The Running Man--Again, King looks into his crystal ball, and this time sees a future game show in which convicted violent criminals run from armed stalkers with, once again, fame and fortune as the prize for survival. It's quite a bit different from the Arnold Schwarzenegger film that was based on it; it's much more dark and gritty. Given the way it ends, I'm almost surprised King didn't pull it out of print along with Rage after another certain national tragedy, but I guess the circumstances were different enough not to merit doing that.<br /><br />These four novels have nothing whatsoever to do with the supernatural, as King was using his pseudonym early on as a vehicle to write and publish fiction outside of the expectations he had created under his own name. Surprisingly, despite his other novels having monsters, ghosts, and demons, these stories have less mainstream appeal and seem more like a young author trying to be literary. And achieving it, in my opinion. All four of these books are dead serious, and delve deeply into their characters' psychological underpinnings. Before he died from &#34;cancer of the pseudonym,&#34; as King calls it, Bachman did branch out into King territory with his next and last book, Thinner, but the early ones are in their own category. For a different take on Stephen King's writing talents, and maybe an appreciation for his diversity and ambition as an author, give The Bachman Books a read.some ways, his journey reminds me of John Smith from The Dead Zone.<br /><br />The Running Man--Again, King looks into his crystal ball, and this time sees a future game show in which convicted violent criminals run from armed stalkers with, once again, fame and fortune as the prize for survival.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son likes this game because of the tnt' s.  The contraptions are fun to design and test. The puzzles of how to get the pigs to their destination are a fun challenge.
1423140605|4.0|I purchased this book for my teen nephew as a way to keep him interested in reading. Chapter books are a great way to keep kids reading as they tend to look forward to the next book. My nephew stated he really likes mythology and this author has a way of presenting this subject in a way that keeps the reading wanting more. I plan to purchase more books if he keeps going with the series.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I downloaded because everyone raves about it, but I find it slow and it's really annoying to have to wait various time periods to get a new life.  I know they are trying to get you to buy another life but it's not worth it.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I found the last 175 pages, or so, of &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; to be very painful reading about characters and a plot twist that rather painfully bored me.  The only reason, in fact, that I read the last section of the novel is that I had already invested five-day's worth of reading time in it (and had read about 500 pages of the book).<br /><br />The first part of the plot is powerful and all the way through the main character's growing-up days with a low-life father in Las Vegas, there were interesting character developments and relationships.  Then, very slowly and very gradually, it became apparent that the main characters (with one or two exceptions only) were all basically a bunch of losers who were only going to continue rolling all the way down hill in their personal lives.<br /><br />A book does not have to be filled with &#34;likable&#34; characters in order to please me, but the characters do have to have a little life to them.  Unfortunately, the main character of &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; is so passive and lifeless that I began to hope the worst for him, and I doubt that's the response that Donna Tartt was going for with him.<br /><br />And, frankly, I found the last dozen pages of the book to be the most painful reading in the entire book.  It came across to me as pretentious and unworthy of the rest of the novel.<br /><br />I really don't recommend this one...but if you read it, and like it, please feel free to tell me what I missed.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Michael Connelly books.  I can't believe how prolific a writher he is.  Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with any of his books.  Super intriguing, easy reads with satisfying endings.

I am not sure my 4-year old twins will find the humor. Someday they will understand and until then, the book will make a great coffee table read.
B003Y5H574|5.0|One of my favorites. I love how the entire movie was a struggle for everyone, and at the end it still is yet everyone is in a better place. Steve Carrel is hilarious and I love Julianne Moore. The last 10 minutes are gold :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very addicting.<br />But very facebook centering. I think everyone would love ths game mostly, well everyone!<br />Have fun with it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think  that every kid should get it. It teaches you what it would be like if you were made of locks and in a world of surrvival.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Best show ever! I have watched this season also season 1 and 3 through more than twice. Ahhh amazon says I need 3 more words. Now enjoy this show!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|love it. works great. i would advise to buy this as soon as you can. A++ wish you could stream more though.
B0087FMUCQ|3.0|Entertaining games but not much different from the original.  If you enjoyed the original then you will enjoy the variations in this version.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Great book to break down the quality of loving, living life fully. I can always go back and get new meaning from chapters of this book during different times.
B00BAXFACO|4.0|Mickey Haller, the main character of Michael Connelly's latest book, in an apparent effort to rationalize his situation, recalls saying to his now-estranged daughter that &#34;...[T]he world was not black and white...[it]was gray and the gray area was where [I] dwelled.&#34; Haller's residence in this gray world, his entrenched belief in providing the best defense to a criminal client possible even when it meant pushing the bounds of legal ethics and even blowing past them, has cost him his relationship with his daughter, the election for District Attorney, and the respect of his peers and others. While he is somewhat haunted by these losses, it doesn't stop him from employing courtroom and investigative theatrics and techniques that would likely result in disbarment or severe sanctions if he were in the real world. Haller is a slightly &#34;classier&#34; and less well paid version of Saul the Shopping Mall Office-billboard-TV advertising lawyer in &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; who never met a client he wouldn't represent and apparently never heard of ethical duties, but not by much. I found offensive and completely unnecessary Haller having a client who was in a scam use arising out of the Newton school massacre (as an example of clients in that &#34;grey&#34; world of his). It is the second book I have read the past couple of weeks that has used this event as part of its plot (the other being Patricia Cornwell's &#34;Dust.&#34; Since this is fiction, why not  make up a case rather than capitalize on the horror of this one?<br />&#34;The Gods of Guilt&#34; are jurors. Haller is representing a client on a murder charge which is connected to a prior client. The plot at times is convoluted, and the writing is occasionally pedestrian. Still, it is a page turner as long as you can remind yourself that it is fiction and is meant to be entertaining, not realistic.<br />At one point Haller, who operates his law practice out of a chauffeur-driven Lincoln, in a clever &#34;life imitates art&#34; shout-out,  notes that there are many more chauffeured Lincoln's outside the courthouse since the movie (&#34;The Lincoln Lawyer&#34;).  Even though Matthew McConaughey was miscast as Haller, the Mickey Haller books are entertaining and at the top of the lawyer-based novels being written today. I look forward to Connelly's next one.
B009NXD6JM|4.0|This is a delightful movie starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard.  She is young and beautiful and the story is classic.<br />I highly recommend it for everyone. No bad language or sex scenes.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|Great story, kept my interest. Pacific Northwest region is coming out with some great material. Keep it up. _very entertained
B0055PMURG|5.0|The movie was great, I had the hole family witch it twice.. It's a movie u got to watch over and over.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|Don:t get it. _enjoyed the first season. This one doesn:t capture my interest from the first episode. Kinda of wondered what happened to the first family. _thought they would continue it.
B008MM9630|5.0|Just love the game.. It's just what I like to play.. The one thing I love about it is u can start over..
0061673730|5.0|This is a great book. It really gets you thinking on a higher level, but the storyline still moves well, so you don't get bored. I have to read it in small chunks (very unusual for me) so I can process everything. I would recommend this book to almost anyone.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love the game. The only thing I wish we could do is be able to start over. I still cand stop playing the game.. Oo ya I love the new thing you are doing with the game..
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book is so pertinent and up to date.  With what is going on today, everyone from 17 to 65 should be reading this. Sometimes he goes off not just on tangents, but finds himself on another planet, but even that I found entertaining!  I love he way he writes.  But most importantly his messages strikes a chord.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Seeing the connections in Stephen King' s universe is always good.<br />\\"There are other worlds than these...\\"<br />Good storytelling. Staying away from RV's
B00594XOZU|5.0|Yes there have been many previous glitches and problems with the most common being not being able to log in. They have fixed that problem and have updated it completely. It works better than ever now. So please download this app again it's been a long two or third  months but it's great now
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Book of romance that started that line of reading for those who enjoy happy endings, kinda Cinderella for adults.  A great book.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This was a very inventive way to approach the disturbing and over-written ordeal of the holocaust.,  I loved the characters, including the unusual narrator! Beautiful prose!
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Luv It....  Watch it over & over, & just love the story & sexual tension between the characters.... A Perfect Cast....mvc
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Where's the plot??? There are only so many ways you can give or receive dominating sexual techniques. I needed a little more in the psychological department and a denser plot.
B006OE7XM4|3.0|The only song that I actually liked on the CD was the lion's song.  I was sort of disappointed with this purchase.
B003FXXNBW|5.0|Undisputed III was my favorite movie from the Undisputed series and has a great ending to Boyka's escape and Scott Adkins is a great actor and fighter!
B0067AC5KA|4.0|great trilogy.  It has been a few years since I read it but i was thinking about rereading it again.  I liked the action and overall strangeness of the story.  Worth a read!
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|note to giants software please make new trailers for truck so you can haul tractors and equipment please do so other than that I love it best farming game ever I never had such a good game
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Zusak brought Liesel and her world to life and shared Himmel Street. One of the most painful, beautiful books I've read.
0385366477|5.0|i always enjoy john grisham; my only problems involved the audio as I can no longer read and don't have the kindle system yet; the audio cd's were bumpy [4 of them] which caused me to lose track of the story from cd # 3 and some thereafter; I managed to regain the storyline but was very disappointed in this early glitch.  amazon, however, replaced them at once.  I would recommend this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The entire Downton Abbey series is probably one of the BEST things I have ever watched.  Exceptional!!  I have an eclectic taste but was hesitant to watch this despite numerous recommendations from friends.  Once I did, I was SO GLAD that I did.  It is so good!!!
B008B8AOQI|2.0|There is one great song on this CD called 'Let Her Go'.  The other songs on this particular CD contain many curse words and some are a little &#34;off key&#34;.  In other words not something I would want to sing about.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|While the book starts off a little slow, it is giving background for later in the book. While Corie Swanson is the main focus of this book, Pendergast makes his presence known. The book did touch on two characters from Two Graves, I'm hoping there will soon be another Pendergast novel. Constance is still around as well. I recommend it. After all, the next book may reference something in this one. Enjoy!
0802473156|5.0|This is a very eye opening book.  Sometimes we are not taught how to love growing up because our parents do not know how.  This book opened my eyes to understanding what love is and how to love.  I recommend it for anyone struggling to get along with their spouse and/ or family.
1419705849|5.0|This one had had us in stitches! Our eight year old has loved the entire series and it has encouraged him to become an avid reader. We started reading them at the same time, sharing the funny parts with each other as we read!<br /><br />We got him him the The Cheese Touch Game too and it has been a ton of fun for him and his friends to play!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0038O6YRI B0038O6YRI]]
B00FPX54DA|5.0|this is fantastic! These musicians are wonderful - although I am a classical pianist and usually enjoy purely classical music, this music is absolutely delightful. Their fusion is flawless and it gives such an upbeat, happy feeling to what I sometimes feel can be almost melancholy - traditional and classical Christmas music. This lifts my spirits, and makes me happy. Every piece on this cd is wonderful.
0810993139|5.0|Our eight year old has loved the entire series and it has encouraged him to become an avid reader. The first one is the best! However, they all have him asking to read just a few more pages each night :-).<br /><br />We got him him the The Cheese Touch Game too and it has been a ton of fun for him and his friends to play!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0038O6YRI B0038O6YRI]]
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Great series, we loan this out to get friends and family hooked on Breaking Bad!  Perfect first season, highly recommend.
B004GJYROG|5.0|This movie is a great movie to give as a gift especially if you havent seen it forever, great childhood film thank you!
0812981448|4.0|This book was incredibly motivating and inspirational - and then two days later I forgot that I'd read it and all that motivation and inspiration was gone. Still. It didn't feel completely genuine at times, but I found it promoted creative thinking, which I enjoyed.
0062107313|5.0|Very engaging and well written! Amy Tan gives the reader a look into the pleasure houses of 1912 China like no other author could. This is a story of mother and daughter love and hate through the eyes of both.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This is a great, underrated show. The plot is basic, and similar to other lawyer-shows, but the characters really make it unique. There is a chemistry between the cast that keeps us watching episode after episode.
0316055433|3.0|This book could have been a classic.<br />However, all books need to be edited and edited until every word is just so.<br />This book reads like a book that is halfway through the editing process. It needed to be cut in half.<br />It's a shame when writers don't take the time to bring out what a story could actually become.<br />The writing here is so beautiful. Everything needed is here; if the unnecessary parts were cut then it could be a gem.<br />But they weren't.<br />And at the end, all the vivid action turns into one pseudo-philosophical monologue, all telling and no showing, below the intelligence of the reader, unsatisfying and unconvincing.<br />It was doubly disappointing because, as other reviewers noted, the book started out with such promise.
B006H5120E|5.0|I love the history of Titanic, not so much the love story, but I do love this movie.  I saw it when it first came out in 1997 with my parents and again when it got remastered in April of 2012.  Ironically I had seasonal allergies that day I went to see it.  I had to bring a box of tissues with me to the theater at which time I told the box office attendant when I went to buy the tickets for Titanic that I had allergies and the tissues were for that.  She kindly laughed and told me she hard that one before, LOL.
1932735410|5.0|This book is an absolute must for anyone pursuing the PMP certification.  The exercises and questions in the book are designed to make sure you really understand the PM knowledge areas and process groups.  This book definitely helped me pass the PMP exam on the first try.
B0055SWM08|5.0|You must think ahead many steps to do well. Good exercise for the brain.<br />You get rewarded with coins and jewels as your play, so your effort has a reward in the game as well.
B005LAIII0|4.0|I was surprised that I like this movie as much as I did. The filmography was excellent and the story interesting enough. This movie also kept me thinking about the story a few days after. It will cause you to contemplate life.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This really is a fun game! I love that it's never the same and you can play different diseases. It really is a scary when you think about how easily a disease could be spread around the world.  I recommend it to anyone that enjoys something a little twisted like making the human race extinct!
B00BAYLRNO|4.0|The movie kept me engaged throughout. I don't know that I could watch it more than a couple of times and there are parts where I found myself holding my breath. It's amazing to me how people manage to survive and can be so strong in times of catastrophic events.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally on kindle, I am so addicted to this game. it is a lot of fun and challenging. good luck!
0938045695|4.0|i am only a beginner but this was an interesting book and intro to the kettlebell. and written by the expert. it makes you want to take his course to really learn the art;
B001XVD21Y|5.0|Great plot, cast, dialogue & acting. It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the flick.
B00772M1F6|5.0|I like this guys basic sound and instrumentation and this is one of my favorite albums, I had to buy it after hearing some of the tracks. I have not been disappointed.
B003521R6G|5.0|The brilliance of the Wren McCormick character is partially Kevin Bacon's, sure;  but the back story of this character, set against the story of the lives of the people in this small town, where fear and loss have created an overabundance of reaction against joy, freedom and sheer love of dance is, really, very poignant.<br /><br />The reverend, finally coming to grips with the harmlessness of a dance vs. the death of his only son is beautifully played by John Lithgow; Dianne West is perfect as his good-to-the-bone, loving wife.<br /><br />The kids have it in them to keep things in control.  This hasn't always been true ~ I can say this from my experiences in the mid 60's in San Francisco Bay Area ... what an unusual, eclectic, time of learning and celebration of &#34;Self&#34; it was.  Kids finally found out they didn't have to be so constricted.  That if they did act within the boundaries of common sense, they could have fun.  Others simply didn't get it, and couldn't handle it.  Again, this comes from my own personal experiences during that time.<br />The act of the joyous dance in this movie was original when this movie came out ~ it spoke of a different era, a different location, and a totally different state of mind.  Really worth watching, even after all these years...<br />As always, respectfully submitted ~
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Time travel stories and history-based novels are both difficult to make suspenseful and believable, but Stephen King manages it in this novel and manages it well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game because it teaches u how to take care of a horse I know because I have a horse. thank you for your time
B008TSVZHM|5.0|I love this MicroSD holder. Put a tiny MicroSD card reader through the hole and have a huge library I can carry with me. Have 8 32GB cards, each of which contains various different kinds of books.
B00633W614|5.0|Can't wait for the next book in March 2014.  Loved all of them. I actually yelled out loud, &#34;NO&#34; at the end of this book and had to check to make sure Jeff was writing another in the series.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|I put a tiny MicroSD reader on a string, then put all the cards into this. Holds them firmly, they pull out easy. Lets you put a whole library in your pocket. You could also put an SD converter into one of the slots with a MicroSD in it. That way you could be completely prepared. Amazing invention at a very low price.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game! I love the graphics and the ad ons you can get for the weapons over all its a really good game.
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|this book was written very well with plenty<br />of drama and suspense!The beginning was<br />a little cryptic,but I figured it out later in the<br />book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|once again Grisham is at his best.  cleave story telling with a plot that will keep your interest right to the end.
B000T433CO|4.0|I'm a woman who does not watch &#34;chick flicks,&#34; and even I liked this one so much that I bought it. It's not the cliche Desperate Altar Trek full of bad relationship advice and people who really belong in a horror movie (Sandra Bullock's character from While You Were Sleeping, I'm looking at you!). It's people recognizing that they're in bad relationships, letting them go, and moving on. It's happy, but not *too* happy.  And if nothing else, it's a good &#34;my friend is in a crappy relationship and needs to watch this&#34; movie.
B005UBNKZG|2.0|disappointed seem to have less speed and power  than the 4 core phenom ll I had prior.<br />I had hoped some of my graphic software would run smoother but system actually is slower and stalls.
140006922X|5.0|I did not need to read a book to confirm the absurdity behind the theatrical and delusional idea surrounding the sort of divine nature of the existence and death of Jesus. It is, however, rewarding to know that sound and solid research, informed by reason, is there to elucidate the lucid mind.
B001XVCYH2|3.0|Loved this series when it first came out and I still find it fascinating. However,  when I lament upon Keanu's acting skills, I believe adding another star would reflect poor judgement on my part and quite possibly be a detriment to my well-being.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|LOVE the Crossfire series!!! can't wait til the next one comes out!!! got all my friends reading the series too!
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|I hate to admit it, but Bond is gone. No more innuendoes, no more humor, no real need to watch. Where's James Bond? We're now so focused on action, death and stunt routines at a constant pace with just about every angle a camera can capture. This movie was predictable, &#34;canned&#34; and worse, foreshadowed beyond a doubt. I am myself a Roger Moore, Sean Connery then Pierce Brosnan line-up as Bond goes. No matter your preference, I doubt Daniel Craig will be on the highlight reel.
B000059XUP|5.0|The Crow: City of Angels is really a 4 star rating not a 5 but I am giving it that because the customer reviews were weak. I love the first Crow, It was a very dark adaptation of the comic which featured awesome acting and great action, and gory kills. The Crow: City of Angels was dismissed as a cash in right off the bat when it was announced, People thought it was a disgrace to the late Brandon Lee(R.I.P) which is understandable but City of Angels really is a good film. I have not seen The Crow: Salvation or The Crow: Wicked Prayer yet but I especially heard Wicked Prayer is the worst of the series.<br /><br />Plot: Ashe Corven(Vincent Perez) and his Son as they witness a gang murder a guy, The gang then kills Ashe and his son and Ashe gets resurrected by a crow and becomes The Crow to get revenge on the gang that killed him and his son. Sounds almost like the first one and the plot is near the first one but it is not the same. Iggy Pop gives a good performance as one of the gang members as well as a young Thomas Jane. Vincent Perez is good as well but of course not better than the great Brandon Lee. Mia Kirshner plays a older Sarah in the film and does a good job.<br /><br />DVD: Warning, Get the Collector Series DVD if you plan on buying City of Angels, Do not get the Miramax DVD released a couple of years ago or the Blu-Ray put out a couple years ago because the picture quality on the Collector Series DVD is better and it has a ton of features, The recent Miramax releases have no features.<br /><br />Overall: If you do not compare City of Angels to the first one, You may enjoy it. I love this film and I know I am in the minority of that but if you go into it with an open mind, I think you will appreciate being its own film.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Loved watching them on TV and this is a great group of traditional songs in a new way. Great harmonies.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|One of the best musicals made. Outstanding music and Judy at her best. A perfect group of supporting actors- I can't imagine anyone else playing those parts.It's one of our regular movies to watch over the xmas holidays.
B00ERIUO02|1.0|Once again all she does is shout.  She should try singing for a change.  Or better yet just go away.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Read the book in high school. While it's been done many times they never came close to following the book which was always disappointing. This one is the only one to follow the book as they took the time ( 6 episodes) to develop all the characters fully. They clearly spent the money to be true to the book. The many supporting actors ( at least 25) were all outstanding and perfect for their respective parts. Colin Firth and Jennifer Uhle were certainly outstanding but the supporting cast makes this movie.Add to that the outstanding music that was chosen and this is about as prefect a presentation that you can get. Since we bought this, we've probably re-watched it a dozens times- it's that enjoyable.
B003G4W49C|1.0|I was shocked and dismayed to see a derogatory racial comment in this book halfway through chapter 6. It stopped me in my tracks and as a result I did not finish the book and won't finish it. In fact I want my money back. I also will not see the movie. To add to it all the book is not very good and the movie has poor reviews. I later read the author is homophobic and un enlightened. I'm glad I found out early before I purchased anything else from this author.
6305754969|4.0|Typical John Wayne which means an entertaining movie that you want to watch over and over. His movies usually have a good group of supporting actors and this one is no exception.
B00GTCECVG|5.0|I have played this game for a long time but became disgusted with it after a recent update. Perhaps I wasn't the only one, because this newest update is much better. There are daily gifts now that make the game more accessible to people who aren't willing to play hundreds of dollars for in game gems. Again, I feel like this is a great and addicting game. I deleted my second, very negative review after those crappy updates, but here is my original:<br /> This game is totally addicting. It is a great strategy game that lets you build your own base and customize it against attacks. There is a chat window for pm and guild chat. The great thing about this game, though is that you can still be successful even without a guild and as a casual player. I played for a long time on my husband's google nexus, but when I got a Kindle this was the first game I looked up. Unfortunately it has taken a little while to come to Kindle. In that time I have tried several of the other strategy games on Kindle and they all pale in comparison. Now my husband is totally hooked on the castle I started on his device. This is a great game. You won't be disappointed.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|As much as I wanted to like this book, I did not. Hannah came off as whiny and annoying. High school sucks. Get over it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show has a little bit of everything. I like the creative way they tell stories. There are fun surprises and beautiful and quirky and interesting people; people you want to care about. I started watching this show near the end of the 4th season by default while waiting for The Mentalist to come on. I don't have cable so I was going to a friend's house on Sunday nights and would get there in the middle of this show and then I started wanting to get there at the beginning of it and then I went back and started from the beginning to see all the episodes I've missed. I am almost caught up now.
B00129H7VS|5.0|An amazing heartfelt masterpiece of film. One of my all-time favorites that I have cherished for years. I fitting homage to our greatest generation.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Dexter has always been an amazing show. Its insane to see how a man can be a pyscopath and a family man at the same time. One of my all time favorite shows.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Classic series. All in on nice package. Peter Falk brings to life one of television's all-time great characters. Must have!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter is a greatly insane show. You wnt regret watching this series and it takes place in miami. Its insane how a man can be family man and pyscopath.. Flawless
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wish I would have read this one slower.  Great character developement.  Very human personalities.  Kept me on my toes wondering and worrying  what the secret would be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first, but now I have read this, for a second time, and  I just love this series. The love story is told so well and is so much more evident in the book. The author does very well illustrating all of the emotion and the relationships with her words. This is just a great book! I can't wait to read the next 2 again. There is so much detail included,I pick up on more and more. Great read!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Injustice gods among us is an excellent game it controls well and is really fun to play there are also a lot of things to unlock so that will give you a reason to play more.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I enjoy playing this game while I am relaxing after a long hard day of taking care of kids! It's fun and easy... not too much brain effort lol!!
1400052181|3.0|For me, the main problem with this book is that the author inserts herself into the story.  So much material and plot is based on the author's struggle to get the story of Henrietta Lacks, that the actually story and ideas it raises about HeLa cells are secondary.  I  would have enjoyed hearing more about the scientists' stories than the cell donor and her family.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is one of many games I have played on my kindle fire hd7&quot; and i highly recommend this game to others
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Item arrived super fast and in great condition. As a fan of the show, I knew I would be getting a season full of great stories, good acting and fun and entertainment to watch the episodes over and over again. Nice extras and interesting audio commentaries on key episodes.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|The are an amazing talent. Beautiful voices for such young men. I have been watching and listening to them since their performances on Ti lascio una calzone and I will never forget how surprised I was when I heard Ignazio Boschetto and the other boys sing, couldn't believe they were only 14yrs. The album is beautiful to listen to with their brilliant unique voices!! I totally recommend it!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Just downloaded the app and already love it . Works like I hoped it would. Easy to understand and use.
B004ZQRJHM|5.0|I think this is by far one of the greatest records I've heard in my life, I'll probably even tell about this record to my grandchildren, it is legendary, if you are a vinyl fan I recommend it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|While many reviewers complained about the bonus materials I was very satisfied with them.  However, the extra bits of scene footage was disappointingly small.  This, however was an insignificant issue for me.  The movies and the blue ray quality speak for themselves!!
0399159347|1.0|What a disappointment.  In fairness, I couldn't bear to finish this book.  Gossipy, petty, predictable, and shallow.  If you don't like to watch Dr. Phil or Jerry Springer, steer clear.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent journey. The story teller alludes at first.  That or the want of him being someone other than who he is.  A story told in second person is the most clever way that this journey takes you by the hand and gently walks beside you.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever! Uplifting ... inspiring. LOVE IT! -- Paris, music, friendship, love, survival, and a true story!
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Too much nudity, foul language...the store was good overall. But i almost turned it off twice during the entire thing. I even took two phone calls in the middle and did't even pause the movie.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have. It froze my Kindle Fire as soon as it installed. It took 30 minutes to get it unfrozen because none of the traditional methods worked. I uninstalled it immediately.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Well written with a good understanding of the thinking process of a &#34;kid&#34;. Read all of the series.<br />It's worth the time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love these kinds of period epics but will admit that it is frustrating having to wait for the next season - I record the episodes and save them to go back for review - this is a fantastic program with some of the finest acting one is apt to find on TV - hope it goes on for a few more years
B007N8RULO|4.0|I Like this game because it makes moving the pieces easy. And even if the moves goes to an undesirable section it is easy to correct.
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|This is Michael Connelly at his best.  The Lincoln lawyer, Michael Haller, so named because he runs his law business out of the back of a Lincoln town car, has his work cut out proving the innocence of a pimp accused of murdering a prostitute.  With his reputation in tatters after a mother and daughter are killed by a killer who Michael got off on an earlier charge he sets out to redeem himself and win back the trust of his colleagues and his estranged daughter who was friends with the mother and daughter.  The ongoing happenings surrounding this case will have you speed reading and turning pages to learn the next sequence of events.  I read this book in two sittings, and couldn't put it down until I was finished.
B002361MLA|1.0|How many times can you say the same thing over and over...  Some of the inferences from quoted ancient wisdom is downright ridiculous and that really turned me off to this book.  I think some of the ideas may be helpful for people with mental problems, destructive thoughts, etc, maybe that explains the popularity of this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a a game every one will love young or old boy or girl<br />I love This is so addictive
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Runs well. A little slow at times but I think that has to do with having a big park and an older smart phone. It works much better on my Kindle which is about 1 year old.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|I'm so relieved this was finally available for Kindle.  My six year old will play Stack the States for hours and I was thrilled when this finally became available for Kindle.  His geography skills are outstanding. I just wish the developer would make even more apps as this does a superb job of educating with out ever feeling like studying.
0425261360|5.0|Great novel again from Patricia Cornwell.  Suspense murder and a story line that makes sense.  Once you start reading you can't put it down. Then you want the next one.
1451666179|5.0|Hilarious. I have been waiting for months for Allie's book to come out and was not disappointed! The only thing I would be sad about is she didn't include the &#34;Wolves&#34; story which is on her blog (check it out, it's a great entry) but all of her other material is there. At times emotionally moving, but mostly laugh out loud fun.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Garth brooks the legend the hits.  All things Garth.  Music you won't regret listening to.  A must have for the Garth lover in your life
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game.  keeps you stuck if you don't rate it when it tells you to. that part is very annoying.
B0052IEE8Y|5.0|I am a Amazon seller. I read the book over the summer and really enjoyed it...yes Frank Lloyd Wright was not a good person...but the book is very interesting and based on facts. I toured his house outside of Pittsburgh this fall....Falling River....loved the tour and having read the book enhanced the experience.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Astronomically correct and a great enjoyable story.  I love the cynical government staff that control all of the information and show what jerks they were.
B00GT4V5DM|5.0|I have used MalwareByte's Anti-Malware program on my desktop and laptop PCs for many years and have never been disappointed with its quality and effectiveness. Naturally, I was ecstatic when I discovered there is now an app for mobile and other devices.<br /><br />The app's user interface is clean and simple. Very nice.<br /><br />It has what a person normally expects from this type of program - scan for unpleasant things, set up frequency of updates, set a schedule for automatic scans - but I was pleasantly surprised to see functions for auditing security and privacy, managing apps (I particularly appreciate the inclusion of the ability to task-kill apps that like to run in the background or shut down messily), and that it smartly detects what your device does or does not need it to do (no duplication of effort, exactly as described in the app's details). Of special note: The app has real-time protection! For free! (This feature requires a one-time purchase of a license in the desktop version.)<br /><br />I strongly recommend people browse through the screenshots on the MBAM app homepage so they can see what I am describing.<br /><br />Thank you for a great, trustworthy app, MalwareBytes. You've helped me catch and clean out viruses, trojans, and adware for years; and I am very pleased to have this protection extended to my Kindle Fire.
044656740X|5.0|Great book to get you thinking like an entrepreneur.  If you are a small business owner, this is nothing new for you.  But for others, it's a lesson in capitalism.  Some of his lessons and conclusions were derived using the fact that he was successful as part of the Hawaii real estate market.  However, his thoughts on making capitalism work for you are eternal.  And it's an easy read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|How little we know about the inner lives of others. This is a beautiful thought provoking work.  The characters are entrancing.
B00127RAJY|4.0|she is awesome in the video
B0089LOG02|5.0|A must read! Captivating from the first page. A glimpse into the life of children that find themselves in the grips of despair...many find love and forgiveness...
B005LAIIGW|4.0|Gravity is definitely the best CGI space film ever made. The only thing lacking to me was the story line. It tends to drag on a little long in some of the scenes but it is still a technological marvel of a film that should be viewed by every one.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Love this jumparoo! After reading reviews and deciding between this and another jumper, I went with this one and haven't looked back. The toys are engaging, the height adjustment is great and the assembly is simple. Shipping was quick (amazon prime is awesome!) I would definitely recommend this jumparoo to anyone interested in one for their little ones.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Love love love it! Great album...so many favorites! I really love the song Artpop, my favorite that I repeat and repeat!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife is a slow burn. This show is so smart and poised (for a drama), that it really catches you off guard with how brilliantly funny it is. The seasoned actors really bring life to their roles.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I bought all three seasons that were available on Amazon...and they all came in less than three days!<br />I was pleasantly happy with buying all three seasons because I love this show and watch it all the time on ABC Family! Can't wait to watch more and see the gossip of Alison's return January 7th!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|No sophomore slump here. Over the whole season, there's a tension that looms. Bonus: Baranski and Cummings are absolute delight!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|A classic small coastal town movie that can remind anyone of the time in your life that you felt like a Goonie!
B00FN811SY|5.0|It's the Bible lovers dream. It allows you to compare the NWT (2013 revised edition) with 5 other translations. Awesome. I particularly like the fact that the Greek scriptures have the Greek Interlinear as a translation to compare to.
B00932AA5G|4.0|An interesting film with a few twists that could have concluded in a more coherent manner. Still enjoyable and worth a look.
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|It's a cool app that gives you not only the temperature but also the forecast and maps for any city.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel Washington portrays a person with great talents and great conflicts. He gives an insight into how some people live their lives and the choices they can make.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|For all you're startup, give this book a shot. It'll make your office as none required. I am one who will apply it.
B001O304UI|3.0|Noted on a best to worst list of Pet Shop Boy releases, this is usually rated one of their best. I don't get it. Not one of my favorites.
B002PZ6XB8|5.0|based on a true story, renee zellweger in any movie is a plus, story of courage and clearly thinking outside the box
B005M5OSBK|5.0|Classic and perfect for my first Pink Martini purchase. Was referred to them from a friend. P.S. See them live - incredible!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I thaught it was a great time waster and the idea of the game was good even if shark week was half a year ago
B00DMEQP46|2.0|Can't get into it. MGMT is out there, but this is way out there. I adored Congratulations! The visual copy of the album is cool though - makes the music a little more fun.
B008JFUPOY|2.0|If you watched Revenge Of The Nerds, you've seen Monsters U. The storyline, concept is very similar.  It's as if the writers copied from the Nerds and added some minor variations to avoid copyright infringement.  Save your money and wait for it to be shown on network tv.
B007L6VR12|4.0|Love this film. It's quirky, weird, funny and endearing. It took me a couple watches and I had to buy it to have it in my movie collection.
B000003N7R|5.0|Ellington and Coltrane; what beauty to our ears. Two of America's greatest musician-composers of the 20th Century -- together!  Need I say more?
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Simply put, it is the perfect time waster. That might not be a good thing for everyone but it definitely passes the time and does it well without glitches and unnecesary ads
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell hits another one out of the park. In an age when CNN thinks Justin Bieber's lost monkey is news, Gladwell provides fun, out of the box insight and a way of looking at the world that many of us just don't think about. You read Gladwell and you feel like you don't have to drink the kool aid for a change.
B004EPZ0BG|2.0|the movie didn't come with the movie case, but the movie was in good condition. Advertising the movie case and not getting everything that was expected was a huge letdown&#62; I would not recommend buying from this company
B0074QGGK6|3.0|Good book to place in the bathroom for guests. Lots of of fun ideas and thoughts. Reminds me of that book Taxi Driver Wisdom.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington is never disappointing. The movie had a compelling story. It did not not have any vampires or zombies, so if you are into that then don't watch this movie.  If you want good acting and story, then watch this and enjoy.
B008602KQI|1.0|Hunger games. The first time I heard about the hunger games someone told me to read the book that it was good. I asked what it was about.  She replied its about children killing children to death over food in a futuristic world.  Now why in the world would I want to read something like that? I am a teacher that's been teaching children for nearly 20 yrs. I have intentionally not read the books and watched the movies because of the subject matter. So since it was free to watch on tv, tonight I decided to watch it. I thought I might understand afterwards. I will never understand the appeal of the hunger games.  Children forced into killing other children. Children cheering on other children to kill one another. The masses taking pride and enjoying watching their children kill one another. I tried to find a deeper meaning but I just can't get passed the children killing children part. My husband says I don't like it because I am not competitive. I would much rather let my children watch the Harry Potter series where at least good is fighting over evil. Anyway I just don't get it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo Mail: So much easier to use. It takes less time to go through mail and organize. Seems very intuitive.  Caught me by surprise but I like it!
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Love this movie! it is funny and it is a great adaptation from the book. I love how Gwyneth Paltrow personalized Emma.
B004WOH18E|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  Well written, with a wonderful plot.  Lots of twists and turns. Just the right amount of suspense and a great ending. If you are looking for a good thriller, with just the right amount of details and enough intrigue to keep you turning the pages this book is the right chice.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Fun but I wish you can change your leader card in the middle of a campaign. A bit expensive to if you want to buy extra things.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|The movie was okay. It tells the story that it intended to do. And makes you love your mom even more. Buy it and share it with her and get her to cook for you again!
078886047X|5.0|One of my favorites, Sin City reminds me of back in the day when Madonna did Dick Tracy. Love the colors in the movie too.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|Much nicer than I expected it would be. The metalic look to this line is really cool! The paint job on it was superb. I like the magnetic base and that fact that the figure stands without it!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Very sad yet romantic movie and love the cast. Quite long though, need time to watch it, but so very worth it. I also can't get through it without crying.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is up to his old tricks again.  The book is action packed with sharp<br />witted defense lawyers and equally sharp witted prosecuters and in between<br />all the good and bad guys. This novel held my attention from begining to end<br />and left me wishing for more.
B000089RVX|5.0|I think this is their best album, love this group and her voice, wanting to collect all of their albums.
B0018RC7QE|1.0|I really didn't like the premise of the movie. First of all, it takes place in New York City and these characters meet by accident all the time which statistically is unrealistic. The movie portrays two individuals having an affair while married to other partners. Although they hurt the other people in their lives and you want them to pay some price for this; remorse, for example, the movie ends with their having no regrets and ending up happily ever after. The other discrepancy for me was that Robert DeNiro is too old to have such a young child (although I realize this happens a lot these days) and Meryl Streep was too old to be planning to have a baby. The entire movie made me sad rather than feeling good. It was not what I was hoping it would be about.  I was disappointed that two well known and proficient actors would choose such a dumb movie to be in.
0767812166|5.0|First movie I had ever seen Jeff Bridges in, and have been a fan since. He is a unique character for sure, there is but one.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|The WB Arrow series is not as good as Smallville, but for DC Comics fans, it works.  I continue to watch.
B00003CXGG|5.0|In the process of collecting all Jet Li movies, I think this is one of the first he did. Really like is moves and stunts. Will keep working on this collection.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Best show ever!!!! Couldn't wait for the next episode!! Better than the first season and I loved that one as well.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book was so very different.  First of all you are reading it from a man's view (a very humorous one at that).  Very cleverly written I must say.  This is a very romantic, erotic, heart-wrenching and funny book.  Can't wait to read the next two when they come out.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Nice looking watch but I dropped it and it broke and I only dropped it from about 2' above the floor.  When it was still alive it would be off by 2 minutes per day. That's ok, I would just reset the time each morning and it would be relatively accurate.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|once you start playing hill climb racing you wont want to stop. its easy to get money and the upgrades are awesome.
B00AEFYKWU|4.0|Story about a baseball team (the Cleveland Indians) whose female owner wanrts to move the teams elsewhere.  In an attempt to make the team be as bad as possible she gets rid of most of the good player and gets a bunch of rejects. A grown-up version of [[ASIN:B001D0DR88 The Bad News Bears (1976)]] with a cast of charicatures the team comes together and plays well. Fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have a lot of fun playing minion rush. I recommend this game to people all ages everywhere. Have fun playing minion rush
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|It's checkers. What can you say bad about checkers. Only stick with the real thing. Buy a board and play with a friend.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Okay so this is my first modern combat game. This review is only going to be on the multiplayer.The graphics are good for a mobile first  person shooter. Theirs so many guns and you can customize the guns too. A lot of perks and grenades too. They now put in kill streaks<br />The maps are big and fun. You can make clans and in lobbies you can send friend request to people and chat with then in the inbox you have. Their are also a lot of game modes which makes the game fun. Also you can do private matches and have emblems on your player profile card. Overall this game is the best mobile game tied with Clash of clans and this game is worth buying for sure you'll be playing for days. Note their are hackers but don't worry there's not too much so go buy this game right now. Also the ping A.K.A the connection in the game is great but you get lag their and now and lost connection but 3 out of 100 SO not too much.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|This is a great application for those individuals that consistently hit snooze. Word of warning: Don't set the math problems too hard. Even simple division or multiplication is a struggle so early in the morning.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am a big Horse lover and others will love this game as much as I do. Super realistic!! (:
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I feel obligated to give this application five stars. I'm obviously using the application after seeing the number of items I purchased from amazon. Makes creating a wish list a breeze
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's a fun game but it doesn't automatically move the pieces down. It switches up on you and you have to start all over. Overall it's ok though......
B0058P7KUA|1.0|One star because I don't even recall downloading this game, which must mean I found it dull and deleted it shortly. Unrememberable.
0316228583|4.0|I had heard this was a different road taken by the author. In constructing real life, I found her character construction true to my life experience with the intertwining of emotions, attitudes, self justifications along with small town politics an interesting; albeit emotionally difficult read.  While not a happily ever after ending, it offers hope that individuals can make a difference in small ways.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I prefer this application over the normal android keyboard. Sometimes the app is right on with my next word in a sentence.
B006LSZECO|3.0|If I were rating it during the first half of the book it would definitely rate 5 stars; a real page-turner. After the return of  &#34;Amazing Amy,&#34; the plausibility factor decreased significantly and I found the ending completely disappointing.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a great application to keep track of a to do list or xmas list. Gone are the random lists that I had laying around the house
B00ENIR864|4.0|Again I haven't used it much but hope to do a lot more after the holidays.<br />I just have to practice using it before I would go into any store.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|This application would freeze on a regular basis. I find that just googling receipes is much easier then using a phone application
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I can't believe I did not watch this series sooner! I am completely hooked! The Lord's and Ladies dramas, the servants world downstairs... the costumes! the politics, the love affairs! Great acting, plots, writing.  This show has it all!
B00E8JZILA|4.0|One of the best storylines in a game that I have played. I simply picked it up because the game was on sale so I did not expect much. But the story and the characters blew me away.<br /><br />The only gripe I have is the constant freezes that come between all the cut scenes and gameplay. In the later episodes, I've become so familiar with them that I almost expected something to happen (like a zombie popping up on the screen out of nowhere) anytime the screen would briefly freeze/lag.<br /><br />I've read other reviews saying that it didnt really bother some people as much, but it really detracted me from the gameplay. I haven't played the ps3/xbox360 version so I dont know if they present the same problems. If they don't, I would much rather have played it that way. Nevertheless, this was a fantastic game and I hope they make a &#34;season 2.&#34;
B000FBFN1U|5.0|As the other two before,they keep getting better. We will see see what is in store as it unfolds next
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|No good, sorry, very damage disc all of them very poor. It in the trash can No more for me.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This one was as good as the last one, well written, entertaining --- like how she had a couple of comments about &#34;long&#34; pages of books by various authors ---- laughed out loud and can't wait for the next one! Well worth the read!
0307346617|5.0|A can't put it down until it's done book! One I will read more than once, and recommend to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|really fun and can be challenging but app stopped working after a couple of days.  Would recommend since it is free and just cross your fingers that app keeps working.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I saw this in the theater and couldn't wait to share with my daughter. FUN! Remember don't get them wet!
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|I LOVE ARIANA GRANDE SO MUCH AND THIS ALBUM MAKES ME LOVE HER EVEN MORE!! BUT IT NOW YOU WONT REGRET IT!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Who doesn't love Dexter? Added it to our collection so we can watch and re-watch whenever we want. Yay Dex.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Nice movie with good story line and the special effects are awesome..! :-)<br />The clarity is very good (full HD).
B00CHS31DG|5.0|I am a long time paranormal researcher and I have to admit that I have been impressed with the Ghost Radar software.  I previously had Legacy but like Connect much better.  The new features have really broadened the ability of the software to gather more info and record it as well.
0425263908|5.0|I absolutely love the story. I can't wait until the next one comes out. If you like Fifty you'll love this series!
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|Wow.  I have been a devoted Joss Whedon fan since Buffy first slew a vampire.  This is not up to his usual brilliance, but on the upside, it is appropriate for small children, who really want to watch the Avengers.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This movie is so powerful!  I watched it several times and can't get enough of it.  I believe everything in it!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Oh, please, she is just terrific!!  What an artist she is!  You cannot help yourself from loving her beat!  Wow!
B00G7QPTR0|5.0|Great music, great performances.  You're getting 1000 percent when Beyonce steps on that stage.  No half-stepping, coasting along in a daze just to get your money but not caring what she delivers.  If you're not lucky enough to witness this in person, the dvd is definitely the next best thing!  I'm patiently awaiting the Mrs. Carter Show World Tour dvd release so I can purchase that as well.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the unique way the book told its story with highlighted phrases. It made me stop and ponder big questions. Characters and descriptions keep you hooked.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|This is only the second Fassbender/McQueen screen collaboration I've seen, but I enjoyed both Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan's performance in this film about siblings with &#34;issues.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would expect to see if you like to say the munchkins and that was lost their lives of phone really want to see that the munchkins and the police station as possible to see the u
B00B7FOQCK|3.0|I purchased this for my wife's computer. I had purchased an Anker 7port model for my computer and it worked great. However for reasons unknown to me, this 4port version DOES NOT fully work properly when attempting to use it with USB3.0 extension cables. When used without an extension cable, every USB2 Flash drive was recognized and accessible. Some USB3 Flash drives were not recognized, why I do not know. When I plugged in this 4port hub and used a high quality USB3 extension cable, the Hub did not fully work.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Only because the plot does SORT OF advance. It's slow going.<br />Very, very slow.<br />S......l.......o.......w.<br /><br />In fact, I am not even halfway through it.<br /><br />Just picked up this little bit of fluff called, &#34;War and Peace.&#34;.....
142219602X|5.0|Very good book, thought provoking and realistic in today's world. I encourage you to read it in the face of innovations like Bitcoins!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Before the redesign, I looked at the Ap every morning. I stopped using it when they changed it. I just decided to check it again, and it seems even worse than I remember. I hate it! I'll delete it and check back in the future to see if they reverted to the old, excellent version.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|... It will capture your imagination quickly and give it a virtual workout!  It took me forever to read this book; I had to put it down and rest with the visual images it conjured up! Treat yourself to a trip through The Night Circus.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a very interesting book. Having seen the disappointing movie my expectations were low. Really enjoyable read. Enjoy it.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Update: When I tried to log in to GameCircle, it would not let me. I don't know if it is because of my device (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0) or some other problem. It's not a big enough deal for me to dock a star, but I figured I should mention it.<br /><br />I bought Riptide GP2 a week ago and now this is Free App of the Day. :P<br /><br />This is easily one of my most favorite games for Android. Console quality graphics (with realistic water and attractive futuristic cityscapes) and an exciting soundtrack. The gameplay's cool, too. ;)<br /><br />If you're in to racing games, check this one out. You won't be disappointed. Or even if you don't like it, at least it's free if you get it today. ^_^
B000SINT52|3.0|Besides complain about this and that, the majority is still allow blindness in their eyes and thrive in naive. Otherwise, we wouldn't be in such a horrible shape as we were
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Cute Movie! Finally a comedy that broke the Hollywood mold by actually being funny.  It was above average length but didn't drag and moved along nicely. Wasn't afraid to be raunchy yet somehow, perversely tasteful. Well done and worth a watch.
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|Excellent piece of advice on a job transition. Great tips to plan you first days. You will not be disappointed.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Read it in 3 sessions. Very good.uplifting story of hope and rebuilding a life<br />A good read beginning to end
B003BVFZ4Q|4.0|Excellent book. But when compared with non-fiction books like The Elements of Style or On Writing by William Zinsser, King's non-fiction writing style is clearly short and doesn't stand out. But the message & fiction writing tips were the reason I bought this book, which were solid.<br /><br />45% of this book contains his autobiography, which is by no means complete, but interesting nevertheless. He is carried away by his own glory at places, and why not! The last 5% contains a prize winning short story selected by Mr. King - it was good, nothing great. But I am not sure why they included it with this book.<br /><br />I will definitely re-read the remaining 50% of the book which was on the topic of writing. Cool tips - I have taken a lot of notes. I notice none of these writing books talk about how to write for the time constrained digital audience or the basic principles of reader engagement. I guess we'll have to figure that on our own!
B009UNGYHG|1.0|While I think this is a product that works very well and is quality made, I have never used it even one time.  The reason is that when I am awake...I wear my Bluetooth.  When I am asleep... my Bluetooth is connected to the charger near my bed.  SO, I have a brand new....never used Bluetooth case for sale!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book definitely deserves five stars. It is emotional in a way that had me crying many times throughout the book. This isn't your normal love story. This is about the ups and downs of life and living with something you know that could take you any time now. I had heard good things about it before so I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Great Stephen King book, great characters, first part of book is a story in itself. Couldn't put it down at the end!
B00BKTFABE|5.0|I love what you can do on the regular bases with this. I can't wait until I learn how to do a bunch of cool stuff with it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the story an great continuous story from the first book<br />Looking forward for the next to get started and for the movie
B008133MDK|5.0|Any chance i get to watch Benedict Cumberbatch strut around like a boss is a moment i will never forget, I am thankful that this purchase made it happen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Fun and entertaining. It is the original game. Other reviews are accurate. I would recommend to everyone interested.
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|A good, fun read that's easy to pick up and read for a few minutes and then come back to later. Made me laugh out loud at a few points and made me laugh to myself the whole way through. No real narrative, but I want expecting there to be at all.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This game was so much fun from beginning to end. The scenery is magnificent on the kindle fire hd. This puzzle driven adventure into a magical land moves forward nicely and gives plenty of challenges that open new doors to discover new parts of the world. I would highly recommend this to fans of the room and other puzzle fantasy games. This is well worth the price of admission. It provided me a few hours of very interesting game play.
B00E9ZATJO|1.0|It was very hard to watch because the movie kept pausing and skipping.  Also had some foreign white letters (in Arabic or something else) pop up on the bottom of the movie and jumbled subtitles.  Very annoying!
B00FPX54DA|5.0|I first saw these guys on Youtube and I was blown away! While amazing to watch they are just as fantastic to hear. I am a fan for sure!
1594135312|5.0|Moonwalking With Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything (Audio) is entertaining and well written. It covers the subject of memory training very well. It clearly explains the incredibly interesting methods used to quickly memorize numbers, lists of names, etc.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook version. I could not stop. It kept me hooked. Besides explaining memory techniques, the book also tells many stories related to memory. The book explains how the author (amazingly) became the top memory athlete in America, although (according to the author) becoming a memory athlete was not his original intention.<br /><br />The book is a bit long. But it does not hurt. For me, it never got tiresome. And the length made it much easier to understand the techniques. Just stating the technique is not enough. The way the book presents the examples really reinforces the learning.<br /><br />The memory techniques in the book are not easy. The author admits that himself. A primary technique in the book is the &#34;Memory Palace&#34; technique. Each room in the memory palace is assigned one of the items to memorize. All you have to do is repeat your passage through the memory palace, and you will remember the items. It works. There is also a technique where each number or card is associated with a striking visual image. The way the &#34;memory athletes&#34; can memorize the order of a deck of cards in about a minute is incredible!<br /><br />The descriptions of the &#34;memory athlete&#34; contestants are interesting and entertaining. He also discusses Kim Peek and other &#34;savants&#34;.<br /><br />There is a lot of history to explain why memory used to be much more important in the past. The author explains how with google, computers, notebooks, etc. memory is not as important today.<br /><br />Be forewarned. It turns out the methods are not normally useful in daily life (as discussed by the author at the end of the book). Even after winning the national memorychampionship, the author forgot that he had driven his car. I appreciate the author's self-deprecating sense of humor.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Best Superman movie since Christopher Reeve's Superman II. Really love the ending. General Zod push Superman to do the unthinkable.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I had the kik app on my kindle fire HD before. But then after i logged of once, it wouldnt let me log back in and then it suddenly decided to disappear from my tablet. It was gone. I was pretty upset that i couldnt use it anymore, but i found it again and they upgraded it like the ipad version and even more!!  :) It's working great now, glad its back!!  :D
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|The style of music from Walk Off The Earth (WOTE) is unique. They have forged a new genre all their own. I would recommend this for anyone that has heard and likes any of their songs. Their music is varied and fun to listen to. While there are no videos on this, WOTE videos are also worth checking out.
B002ZG976U|1.0|The first disc I ordered didn't play, so it was replaced with a new one.  The second one also wouldn't play, so I just figured it was our player; it couldn't possibly be the fault of two discs, right?  So, I was reluctant to ask for another replacement and set it aside (it is now too late to ask for another replacement).  Well, it wasn't our player, as other DVD's played fine.  It wasn't until just recently that I heard of someone else that had the same problem with the same movie, so it's just something with the Burlesque DVD's.  Hers was a gift and she didn't bother to ask for a replacement, so I'm not really sure who the seller was.  Regardless, what is wrong with these Burlesque DVD's?  We saw the movie twice and would REALLY love to see it again.  Frustrating.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was written well but it is very morbid and depressing.  It kept me onmy toes the whole time though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you should get this game because it is interesting and you can unlock characters and also get new records yay .
B00BATG18K|3.0|Not as good as Joy Luck Club or others. A good read, but gets melodramatic after the middle. Some good history but leaves out a lot about the period, e.g., gangs in Shanghai.
B0050CJNJ2|2.0|I expected more interesting music.  To me every song sounded the same. To me these are talented musicians with a style that many people like, but to me .....boring.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Horrible movie! The dialogue is painfully slow and the violence is excessive. I regret spending money to see it. It drove to the top of the list of worse movies ever.  A waste of my time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|exceeded my expectations for a new technology, a real value at $35. Google, is smart to push this one all season
B008C20TDG|5.0|I bought this book to learn a little more about my eating choices.  It's really changed the way I eat.  I did the 30 days challenge and I plan to keep it going forever.  I really liked how it talked about the chemistry of food and our emotional reaction to food.  Absolutely feel the difference now when I eat foods that don't make me more healthy.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Easy to play. Bright graphics. Nice to be able to play on my tablet. Now I can play any time.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is probably the best designed puzzle game I've ever seen, but after playing twice the app won't open. I've tried deleting and reinstalling it, but it still won't open after the second play. Very disappointing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A favorite game of mine. Happy to have it on my Acer tablet. Now the long wait at appointments will be spent playing Spider instead of reading very old magazines.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!! Great graphics, extremely funny, and it tailors the difficulty level to your age, so that it can entertain and be appropriate for kids from ages 5 to 105. I can't stop smiling while I am playing this game :)  and probably won't for a very long time.
B004F1F32A|4.0|Excellent action film.  Liam Neeson is perfect as the more than protective father.  He embodies the protectiveness and love that all fathers should have for their children - especially their daughters.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It is a very good game and I love it, but that makes it all the more disappointing when at world 3 level 1 it starts me off out of the world and I die every time. I can't just skip the level so I can't proceed, please fix it, and thank you for a great game up till that point.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This works on both machines very well.  This cleans unused files from memory, it gives back space.  I like it.  This keeps excess build up on the Fire memory.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|The songs are good, though many of them are hit and miss. I've found that I have about half of them on repeat and rarely listen to the other half.
B005FITIF0|5.0|Great movie, left me a little depressed for a week or more just because it's based of real life events. Hollywood never really gets it right so who knows. Regardless, it was eye opening and quickly put me in my place feeling thankful for life, and more attune to the hard reality of humanity.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Full of new sounds, clean voice through the whole disc even though MANiCURE sounds unfinished. The disc is amazing, outstanding, you can hear it over and over.
0449911357|1.0|I thought it was going to be more like the movie. Some ways it was like the movie, other ways, no.  For example, there was a negative remark about Paul from the Bible.  *SPOILER ALERT* I thought it would more be about two women and their friendship.  Turns out a lot of the book is about their gay relationship.
B001974DG0|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot. Couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Great reading.  I definitely got less hours of sleep because I couldn't put it down.
141694737X|5.0|Both out kids love this book starting around 6 months to about 2.5 years. One of the favorites for sure.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|It's a pretty good game compared to the console one. Just that sometimes get old. But other than that it's great.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|no matter how I try it doesn't connect on my kindle!!! I would love to play it.<br />but. nope its a piece of crap that wont load
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I finally caved and downloaded it just to see what all of the hype was about and I'm definitely addicted to it!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I don't like how after 15minutes it deletes your world... but I wish it was set up like the minecraft demo. Let's just say this: minecraft is apple and survivalcraft is android
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Enables one to utilize application via mobile to keep professional contacts. Strongly suggest if needing on the go contact the via pc.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a fun game to play once in a while but it should not be addicting. It ruins people's lives. Do not play it too much
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Love reading such an amazing classic. Took me a little longer to complete this book,but I enjoyed it making the extra time worth it.  Such a great way of storytelling that becomes truly a believable encounter, as I have just completed unsure if I have read fictional or nonfictional story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game, I have gone as far as the game will let me, but waiting on update for the kindle it Macs out at level 440, I am about 25 levels ahead of that.<br />Please update the game.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It's fun and easy to use. I find myself wanting to continue with the lessons which will ultimately help in th  long run.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was surprised by how easy this was to setup, easy enough that I may give it as a gift to some less technical relatives this year.  I was casting netflix and youtube to my TV in minutes after opening the box.  The only issue I have is that I spend a lot of time on a VPN so my laptop doesn't see the device but that is unavoidable.  Definitely nice that you can cast one tab from chrome while doing something else on your computer, I was a bit worried that I would have to let Chrome have focus on my computer screen all the time while using it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is the best game ever. I tried to get it on kindle like three months ago when it came on iPod but I couldn't you should of put it out sonner. Now I really like it
B00477X6DA|5.0|Works great. I'm still looking for a metal wrist band for this watch though. That'd be a great business opportunity for this seller.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|WOW! This book was an amazing book! Veronica Roth did a great job making me wonder what was going to happen next! I would recommend this book for young adults. But this book kept my heart pounding, tears in my eyes, and in was on the edge of my chair! This book is the book to have!!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Sad and happy at the same time. Even though this was a work of fiction, this was enlightening in a disturbing way, because much of what was written about the orphanages was based on fact.
B009RH973I|1.0|Terribly flimsy and the button openings don't match the buttons on the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. Kindle doesn't fit right in it either.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Outstanding acting.  Lead female Jennifer Lawrence has been my favorite actress since Silver Lining.  She was outstanding in this film also.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|It needed more action, Will Smith should have know better than that.  It did have a good story. Great actors in the movie.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Not my favorite.Too long wait time for new lives and doesn't give you Gold when it says you've earned it.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I originally gave this film a 3 star review saying it was good but not great.  But upon watching it a second time I loved it.  Everything was ten times better than the first time I watched it.  I give this film a four out of five merely for it taking twice watching it to fall in love with it.
B00EUUJID6|2.0|Very disappointed.  I was expecting more songs sung in Italian.  There are a lot of male singers to listen to but not many that you can hear singing in Italian.  The title says Buon Natale - most of the songs are in English.  I would have returned but opened it too late.
B008JFUNNM|4.0|Solid acting, writing and directing made this film fun to watch. Because I knew what happened and how it ended going in, the film wasn't as gripping and tense for me as it would have been had I been born under a rock. But in saying that, it was definitely good and is definitely worth watching.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me laugh and made me cry. It is very well-written. It truly moves a person when they see that sometimes we don't have the time we think we have. Again, great book.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|Action-packed, thrilling, and unexpectedly touching in moments. The acting was solid, the writing was just alright, but the directing was solid and it was an all around solid, fun film to watch. And to be honest, I'm kind of hoping for a sequel.
B00D1VKZ3M|2.0|Nothing new in this book. Riding on coat tails of the first two books. I was very disappointed with it.
B00BEIYN3M|5.0|I loved this film. It was incredibly funny, sweet and just well done all the way around. It had good writing, acting and directing. I laughed my butt off all the way through.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is awesome and it never crashes. I got it for my kindle and its flawless graphic-wise and its even smoother on bigger tablets
B0081SRJSY|5.0|This is a great game.  Small download and no extra permissions.  For a new player it take a few games to learn the rules and scoring.
B0068FZ16O|5.0|One of my fav movies of all time. Made my students of creative nonfiction writing watch it and they liked it.
B008220D5K|5.0|Hilarious movie. I love this movie. It's a little inappropriate but is pretty hilarious. I purchased this for a great price and am happy with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|good game for reflexes.  fun for the family. I play a lot and try to beat my score each time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|bring back the booster wheel! it has helped me pass levles that i have gotten stuck on. if i get stuck to long i will stop playin.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|Loved game but twice now has taken me Back to level 1 after I reached levels 13 and 16 respectively. Can't play anymore wasting my time and money.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|Phenomenal! I literally could not put this book down. The book is so well written and the characters are so well developed. The author wrote the love of Kendall and Payton so well that I could actually feel its intensity. This book will make you laugh and cry, and you won't regret picking it up. I think this book could be made into a great movie adaptation. Love it!!
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Love all Connelly's books. This one makes you feel you are right there on the defense team. I could not put it down...now ready for his next book.  Love and respect Mickey &  Harry.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Oh man waiting is the hardest part. So I liked the prologue well enough to buy the book and was not disappointed. The book is fast paced with lots of twists and turns. Unlike every other book when you look back at the plot the twists feel natural. If you are looking for a book that changes the way you look at superpowers this is the book. I want to tell you every little thing that happens in this book but that would be telling. Just remember the main character is unique in a world were powerful epics rule Steelheart will fall and the end will leave you wanting more. Do not stress the next book well come out fall 2014.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|A very fun and addicting game. I like being able to restart games I get stuck on and I like seeing my different achievements.
B00G3Q6VPS|4.0|I highly enjoyed this album. When I found out Sia Furler had contributed to three tracks on this album I wanted to hear it. I thought Alien was a lot like Madonna's Ray of Light album that William Orbit produced. I thought Ray of Light was Madonna's best album so Alien is a strong song to start the album off with. Sia contributed to two of my favorite songs off of the album, Perfume and Passenger. I like these songs because they are a slower tempo and highly enjoyable. Work B%#th is a fun song to work out to when I am at the gym. It may not be her most personable album, but this album is still pop fun.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|One of the best by one of the best from this genre. This novel had it all from the beginning all the way through to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed and was enraptured by this work. I highly recommend it.
B005KIQDYE|5.0|My granddaughter will love this set!  (Christmas present!)  Gift came super fast and box in great shape!  Thank you!  THis is a 'piece' of the LEGO Friends set that she wanted Santa CLaus to bring her!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this twisted universe. The mystery caught me within the first chapter and held tight.  I'm so pleased that Hugh looked outside the publishers box.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|We like this series of movies.  They are clean and appropriate for the whole family. They are clean and appropriate for the whole family.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This is a depressing book to read when you learn all of the historical examples of how colonial rulers harmed the Indians.  Once the colonial oppressors were overthrown, then the local dictators took over.  In the end the people never had incentives to work hard to be successful.  Any time the public institutions are set up to favor the elite ruling class, then the people will suffer poverty and lack of government services and poor health care and lack of education and a low standard of living and a slow acceptance of new technology.  Corruption of public officials and a selfish ruling class are more harmful to a society than I ever realized.
B00843TZJ2|3.0|It's not just Stephen's voice that's problematic here.  Both David and Graham exhibit weaknesses individually, but more to the point it's their blend that just doesn't make it for a good portion of the show.  This is even sadder given that they had three more singers behind them providing additional vocal power.  I personally thought that they were best on the quieter stuff, and not very good at all vocally on the uptempo pieces.  I think I would also have assign big-time blame to whomever mixed their voices for this release.  Not a very good job.  I think some of the vocal shortcomings could have been modified or even almost eliminated with a better mix.<br /><br />One must remember that we're talking about three seventy-year old voices that have been doing this for fifty-ish years.  I frankly was kind of surprised they still put this out after listening to the final product.  Shortly after this I put on \\"The Acoustic Concert\\" DVD, recorded 21 years earlier in San Francisco.  That's how I want to remember the CSN live vocal blend.  I'm sure all three of them still have a lot to contribute to the world of music in the future, but maybe they should just keep it in the studio and dispense with still trying to capture it on stage.
B00F880BWG|5.0|The Walking Dead is one of the best tv series. Great acting, action and zombies without being campy. At least watch Season One Episode One.
B0081336FO|5.0|Awesome shows.  Looking forward to the next season. All others based on this Sherlock. Love this Dr. Watson. Good Job.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|I grew up watching the Toho Godzilla movies. I could not wait to see this movie. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride. The movie is great and the CG is top notch. Then go back and watch Toho's 1973 Godzilla vs Megalon which includes the a fighting robot named Jet Jaguar.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Awesome shows.  Looking forward to the next season. All others based on this Sherlock. Love this Dr. Watson. Good Job.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Game is working without any problems. Gets a little old always needing to upgrade items, could be costly if you allow it to get out of control.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|great film. I purchased another as a gift. I got lost in this colorful and entertaining story with spectacular acting and singing.  enjoy.....
B001FEAA3C|5.0|This cd (and dvd) are ridiculously fun and entertaining.  My number 1 reason for loving it is that my infant daughter is an enormous fan.  From about 4 weeks old this dvd would stop her purple crying, capture her attention and put her to sleep.  Even at nearly 11 months, if she hears psycho killer or take me to the river, she comes crawling over.  I enjoyed David Byrne before having my daughter BUT I am an even bigger fan now.  This album keeps me moving and makes me happy every stinkin' time it comes on.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|The best Christmas present a man can buy for his wife.  It keeps her out of my hair for hours on end.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Very interesting story flow with very real characters casting, suprising end , and happy end. The movie stage looks very real
B00003CXRM|5.0|Great movie, by the Coen Brothers. Music was awesome, Cast was diverse and extremely talented. Scenery and settings were incredibly done.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The game is interesting but it also takes a lot of the battery other than that it's fine. The one thing that is upsetting is that the only way to get more crowns is by paying money.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Excellent book cant wait until the next one comes out.  The author writes the type of book that not only draws the reader in but also leaves the reader wanting more.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It is fun I really like it u should get it so if like it then u should keep it
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I could have done without the narration.  I enjoyed the story and drawn to the main characters but not a book I would recommend to others.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game the only downfall is that I wish there were more rooms. Just enough difficulty to keep it interesting
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush Saga. If you want all the tips hints and everything else you best get on Facebook. It's the only way your going to get any where and fast in this game or any of their games. You have to stay connected on Facebook to get all their hints. Or buy Lives take your pick.
B008B8AOQI|4.0|good cd can listen to at anytime it is very easy on the ears.  A nice ride along cd to get.
B00FFERTUK|5.0|i have a question.<br />Do you spell knicelback with a &#34;k&#34; or an &#34;n.&#34;<br />I have another question.<br />Why are natilie mercahnt  and the lead singer of nicklebak married?<br /><br />That is my thesis.<br /><br />Part one:<br /><br />The word nicleback is a hard word.<br />What is a nicleback?<br />My first guess would be a snake.?<br />But why would a band from Canada name themselves after a snake?<br /><br />So then I started to look at the people who I thought listened to knicleback.<br />This was all in my mind.<br /><br />But then I thought some people were real dumb.<br /><br />And Jesus told me that no one is dumb.<br /><br />And He told me to turn the other cheek.<br /><br />So that;s why I give this album five stars.<br /><br />Turn the other cheek.<br /><br />If people gonna love it.<br /><br />Turn.<br /><br />If people gonna hate.<br /><br />Turn.<br /><br />To every reason born under heaven.<br /><br />Turn.
B002AXISVI|5.0|This book was great.  I learned about life of women in a country where they face far more dangerous perils than I would in 5 years. I learned about tenacity, humanism, determination and survival. Once I began this book I found very difficult to put down. If you haven't read Kite Runner than I would recommend it strongly to pick a copy of the book and start it. A Thousand Splendid Suns is the second book and the third book The mountains echoed just recently came out. Hosseini has a true gift for telling a story and is engaging and once starting the book is difficult to put down.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this tv show. Bones and Booth are an awesome couple. I can't wait to see more of them in the next season!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|1 great app easy to use with big buttons for us old people, it has simple thing's we use every day like add subtract and divide and more complex uses too.<br />For free it's great.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Being a 3 cat owner of different breeds, 2 female and 1 male, and 3 distinctly different personalities, the poetry brought smiles and laughter and made me realize I could write a book myself with all the antics I see daily from Cocoa, Callie and Patches.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Each of them has a wonderful voice.  Together, they create something truly special.  We have a lot of Christmas music already; this is definitely one my favorites.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|The first third of the book or so was very interesting, but after that it went all downhill from there for me. It kind of just repeated itself over and over in less interesting and insightful ways as it went on.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Engagingly true story with interesting characters, well written. It has a  perspective not frequently encountered, and an insight into life where few venture.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I like all the angry birds franchise so this was naturally right up there with the rest for me plus it was free what more can 1 ask for
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I loved the book and I loved the movie. The movie was very true to the book and the actors chosen to play the roles were the perfect fit.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't get enough of Downton Abbey!!! I was hooked from the first episode - can't wait for series 4 to come out!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game so much I play it everyday<br />Even when I'm doing my homework.My mom tells me to do my homework I be like wait
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game makes you think strategically.  It is addictive &amp; challenging &amp; just plain fun.  Glad my daughter told me about it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|While this book still portrays the overall message and values of the series, it cannot match up to its precedents. I was very disappointed in the lack of action and intensity that this book possessed. Without spoiling I would say the ending was generic and wasted potential. However Aleigant is an effective conclusion to the series and has an excellent amount of character development. It contains a story line that was unexpected and welcoming.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|This movie was entertaining and that is what I based the rating on. If you are looking for an intellectual Academy Award Winner this is not it. If you liked the Die Hard movie you will like this.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|DONT LIKE TOM CRUISE THE PERSON, BUT HE MAKES SOME GOOD MOVIES DOESNT HE, AND THIS IS ANOTHER ONE, LOTS OF ACTION
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Captivating, addictive, fun, &amp; easy to learn. This app is well worth your time to download! Kudos to the developers who came up  with the idea for this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it this game is a good idea and it works well. The first horse game I have found for the kindle that I love
B00BAXFJ5M|2.0|I had to struggle to give this even 2 stars. Reading this book was much like watching a really bad actor expos&eacute; himself to the world. The plot is nonsense, the lead characters are unbelievable, the dialogue is trite (does anybody actually talk like these two?). Looks like Balducci thinks he has enough of following, he can resort to writing for the money. He won't get anymore of mine.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|The first of the 'trilogy' telling of Katniss Everdeen and her struggle against the forces of the Capital. Such a readable book - such down to earth characters - it was a book I found hard to put down and in fact had it on both my iPad and iPhone so that I was always able to open it up and continue with the adventure. And it is just that - pure adventure - well written - descriptively flowing - and always exciting both in the characters and the storyline. If you are looking for a book that doesn't ask you to tax your brain power, but still keeps you captivated by the storyline, then this is the book for you.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have just finished this third book in the ceasefire series and can't wait for the next book or books to find out what happens with Megumi, Gideon and Eva's marriage, and the reconstructed space in the ceasefire building as well as all of the other characters.
B0081YBD8A|5.0|I had never heard of this show until I got Netflix.  The big thing that sets this series apart from The L Word is the characters in Lip Service are all working class people.  I liked The L Word, but I would have liked to see more blue collar types of ppl in the show.  As a working class person, I identified with the characters in Lip Service much more than the ones in The L Word.  The big similarity between the two is in Lip Service, the Frankie character is almost a mirror image of Shane.  At least at first she is.  Too bad this series was cancelled-I really liked it.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Just what I've been waiting for!!!  More QOTSA.  After all the hype, I was afraid it would be a Trent Reznor album, but I was so glad to hear some material like the other albums, and not the weird stuff from their last album.  Some real robot rock on this!
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Good read overall. Provides a look inside amazons formative years and insight into how they came to be the diverse company they are today.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|Good intentions and exciting investigative work go well together.  King and Maxwell are a good balance when someone need their help.  Not much is greater than helping kids and your country.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|There are just so many explosions and seemingly endless fighting sequences that a person can take in one evening before it starts wearing extremely thin. It started feeling as if the entire last half of The Man of Steel was one very long extended fight scene with essentially the same tricks done over and over, most particularly where Superman and Mr. Bad Man throw each through building after building. This was among one of the several factors that nearly levels the entirety of dear old Gotham City, yet, by the end, everything is just perfectly back to normal. The offices of the Daily Planet are in pristine condition. No one has aged a day and, of course, no one even recognizes ol' Clark Kent in spite of the fact that every major player in all of the mayhem was deeply involved with the goings on involving Superman. It has always been a gripe of mine that the denizens of the Daily Planet were so unbelievably dense that they could not recognize Clark Kent as Superman in spite of all of their many observations of Superman. The only apt explanation it would seem is that, in addition to his X-Ray vision and super hearing and super strength and ability to fly and all of that, that Superman is somehow capable of manipulating the human mind to such a degree that he is able to selectively destroy all observational memory of this person. Perhaps he uses his super-ray eyes to fry that portion of the brain responsible for selective memory recall. That is just my theory.<br /><br />While The Man of Steel has a certain degree of entertainment value, it is also a story already told on film so many times that it seems completely redundant to visit it just one more time. The props and scripts change slightly each time, but it is essentially the same story. In addition, this version has more cuss words in it presumably to make it more \\"real\\"; at least in the beginning, developmental stages coming primarily out of the mouth of a childhood bully. Just be warned in the event you have issues about letting your kids watch it and find certain language objectionable.<br /><br />The end really baffles me. Here Superman has just saved THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE from total destruction and now they have to depict this anal retentive army dude who is STILL suspicious that Superman just might turn against the good ol' USA. Now how stupid is that? No one would be alive, fer cryin' out loud. How logical is it then to have this stereotypical army dude STILL distrusting Superman? That just makes zero sense except as an excuse to have a sequel using this particular Superman. Oh well. One cannot expect to attempt to scratch the surface of any of these superhero action movies without the entire facade crumbling to dust. So be it.<br /><br />So would I recommend The Man of Steel? I suppose it's worth seeing it. It has some very impressive CG and special effects work in it, although it is often repetitive to the point of tedium. The acting is okay, although no one really truly stands out. All-in-all it's a oft-told tale with a lot of noise and explosions. If you like that sort of thing, then you might like The Man of Steel.ues about letting your kids watch it and find certain language objectionable.<br /><br />The end really baffles me.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fun game. I really like it. it's fun to play. I think some of the items are priced to high though
B00G32QIEG|2.0|I had the unfortunate experience of wasting both my money and time on a film that I was hoping might hold some promise.  In point of fact, the only reason I watched R.I.P.D. was the presence of Jeff Bridges in it.  I figured I couldn't go wrong with something Jeff was involved with.  As it turned out, even that very talented actor could not rescue this turkey from it’s own self destruction.  It wandered somewhere between Men in Black and Ghostbusters but failed to come even close to those far funnier and more entertaining films.  I have given it a two star rating, but only because of Jeff Bridges who tries mightily to pull this thing out of the muck.  It tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably at it except perhaps, for the very final minute.  Actually, I think I might have chuckled (lightly) twice in the whole movie.  I was not really particularly impressed with all of too cartoonish-like CG characters  running around, either.  This movie was as dead as it’s characters.  I also keep telling myself that from now on, I am not going to plunk down any more of my money to rent these lousy movies.  Maybe one day I’ll learn.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I saw this concert in 1994 at the old Mile High Stadium in Denver, CO. It was a fantastic concert. Laser light show fireworks you name it they had it.
B00GIXY4M8|4.0|The Wolverine is a very entertaining superhero action flick.  Jackman continues to be able to sell his role as The Wolverine despite having aged a bit since his first outings.  Had a lot of fun watching this one.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Lots of fun to play once you get the hang of it. Took me a while to learn how to get around the obstacles.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very nice game... I really love it! i enjoy unravelling the clues. I will definitely recommend this to my friends.
B00632HWOG|5.0|My e-mail app on my Kindle failed and I needed a replacement.  This app works much better. Glad I found it.
0985557834|5.0|I love the pictures.  The instructions are easy to follow.  I have made quite a few of the designs.  They are fun to do.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|it is and okay game. i takes forever to complete tasks and get coins and things needed to level up. probably would not recommend it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Surprise!  I decided to read the book only after seeing the movie of the same title.  I thought it might clear up a point or two in the flick.  Whoops ... it was a very deep and thoughtful exposure to the unglamorous aspects of war and children soldiers.  Now, I'll be reading the entire series and following young Ender through/to his destiny ... somewhere in a distant galaxy ...
B004W2UBYW|5.0|At first I thought this was a long book. But it end up being a supreme entertaining, educational and historical reading of one of the great leaders of our era.  I suggest reading it because it proves a few people can be like Jobs and the great lesson of how to surround yourself with bright people in order to accomplish great things.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I find the music relaxing while I feed my addiction. I have never it it crash or glitch. It is a very well done game. Love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some of the very best science fiction I've read. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys great science fiction. Great character development, major twists and turns and some characters you'll grow fond of. What's not to like.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|This is a whimsical story based in post-war Guernsey. I loved the characters, the humor and the realness of the storyline. A great read.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this fast read. The book is part science fiction, part thriller, part mystery and part horror. It kept my interest. I have purchased Wayward as a result and look forward to the storyline moving forward.
030726999X|5.0|I think  the three books by Larson are the best books I have read in a long time . Action packed , suspense, they were very exciting
B0000560X0|5.0|My favorite live DVD for George Benson. Sound and picture very good and the soundtrack is wonderfull. Reminds me of the concerts I attended to watch him play and sing over the years.  He sings Danny Boy in Ireland and they loved it. He always could play to the audience. He's backed for some of the concert by Joe Sample of Crusaders fame.
B00005JLD4|5.0|This movie was recommended by a relative and was more the story and to think it was true. recommend to all.
B005COO1X6|5.0|A well written, properly paced horror short about people being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Things can go horribly wrong! Can be read easily in one sitting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I often get bored reading books, but Ms. Collins kept a quick pace.  Action on almost every page; pausing long enough to get a necessary detail here and a necessary detail there. All the while moving the story of Miss Katniss Everdeen to its wonderfully honest and satisfying ending.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is one of the most addictive and fun games you will ever play. You get to raise a large variety of cute little dragons at your very own dragon park. You can level up your dragons and expand and decorate your park. It is lots of fun trying to breed and collect as many different dragon types as you can. The fun is limitless and you will never get bored because there are always events going on and limited dragons each month. Unlike most games where it takes time to do things, Dragonvale is fairly fast pace and you won't feel anxious and like you have to wait too long before logging back in each time. There are in app purchases for gems but you cannot still earn them for free with a little time. I think you should definitely get this game and I hope you enjoy!
B00G4PX1MO|4.0|I played the original kingdom rush on armorgames.com for free, and so was originally uncertain on paying for this on my tablet.  No regrets, it's a great game that constantly challenges  you without redundant levels.<br /><br />I only give it a four star, given the clear overpricing on new heroes (a few bucks for a new hero unit that doesn't provide much new content, and no way to earn them in game). But it is otherwise great.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|It's Carcassonne, so the core gameplay is solid. There are some UI issues, a lot of the sound effects are annoying, and with only one expansion (The River II) there's not much reason to keep playing after your first handful of wins.
B00EQRMAJW|4.0|Love John Legend and though every song is not a hit as his early works but is a very nice cd.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed Candy CrushSaga for many months now and would feel lost without it,whether at home or away!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Great Album.  Bought the CD as I cannot stomach the low sampling rate and compression of MP3's and such.  Buying the CD and ripping with lossless compression is the way to go for electronic source listening (ipod, music server, etc.) to hear all the great detail and musicality of his music.
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|Watched it with my grandson, who was home sick from school.  We both laughed a lot.  What a fun movie!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|My goodness this man can sing. This CD gave me a new respect for country music. I have enjoyed every song. He sings with feeling and grabs your attention and keeps it. Awesome job Blake may God Bless and keep you.
B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|an extra 13 minutes of nothing.  Added absolutely nothing to the theatrical release.  I'll never do that again.  I'll just wait for the extended edition.  At least in the Lord of the Rings series the extended additions were substantive, more noticeable, and added to the plot.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|You have to get this game.it's so fun! But the control's are hard.I love it tho.you have to get it it's so much fun
B00008MJ8H|5.0|My childhood to music. This takes me back to the big city many years ago to a place I am glad I left behind.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Beautiful renditions of some of my favorite Christmas songs...even my kids play it over and over!  I especially LOVE the Little Drummer Boy version.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Nice I love it is worth the same thing as a sad have to go to you passionately about it in the morning and Craig is a really love to see your neck of the time
B008KNUKVI|5.0|love the sound....they are amazingly talented and it is a refreshing change from the same old songs you hear on the radio.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|An incredible, finely crafted tale with characters that intrigue and a mystery that captivates. A wonderful read for all ages. Stead is a master of middle grade writing.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Used it on a road trip recently and worked like a charm with iphone 5s!  Only wish it lit up in the dark.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I like the series, however, I felt this particular one lacked compared to season 1. It felt a little disjointed to me and it took almost halfway into the episodes before I really got a good feel for it. Having said that, I STILL like the characters and that they brought back some of the same ones. I just wish it didn't take so long to get a real feel for what was going on, for me.
006202406X|2.0|Terrible ending. Really ruined the entire series for me. I'm pretty sure I'll never read another Roth novel again. I don't trust with my emotions.
B00C74SHRK|1.0|This was the worst book I  have ever read. The author ruined a really good story and plot with pages and even whole chapters of self indulgent philosophical drivel. If it was possible to give a nagar ice star I would
B00F522C7C|5.0|Bought this for my grandson and he just loves it... The order and delivery was just as described and received as promised in great condition.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is amazing!!! Clary and Jace bring the heat to this book and there is a shocking discovery about Simon
B00005JNS0|5.0|Bought this for my grandson and he just loves it. The product was as described and delivered on time and in great shape.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Enjoying this game a lot... its fun to play with friends too- passing the game around during family time to see how many prizes we can get as a team... fun for all ages for sure
1600597963|5.0|This book is beautiful and beyond useful for all sorts of beaders. It includes both beginner and advanced techniques. I don't fancy myself an expert beadworker. I would consider myself intermediate at best. Therefore, I require simple-but-thorough illustrations and step-by-step instructions in order to understand new techniques--this book has that. Boy, I sure do feel confident with cabochons now, after reading this book!<br /><br />I should note that I rarely make projects that are included in books verbatim. Instead, I look for techniques that I can adapt to fit my own projects that I am working on, both in jewelry and fashion. This book was perfect for that. This book makes me excited about bead embroidery. Now I see possibilities for beadwork embellishment on EVERYTHING!! No joke: clothing, swimsuits, underwear, scarves, jewelry, curtains, lampshades, guitar straps... all are subject to my bead embroidery obsession!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the most fun game I don't have a horse  but this allows  me to feel the feeling of horses
B001VLXNLU|4.0|Such a great read I could not put down the book. I am so looking forward to the rest of the series.
B008LXZFH6|3.0|It was ok. not as funny as i had expected. glad i did not spend a lot if money to watch it.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I am so very much satisfied with the Plantronics Voyager Legend. and the Charger Case.  Charging while storing the Voyager is so convenient... and the 7 hour usage time is right on. You can not go rong with this amazing product.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the BEST movies ever made. It's gripping and truly a tour-de-force for both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. From the very beginning, you're completely riveted by the denouement of the story - picking up the crumbs as you find out what really happened in the most fantastical story of triumph over despair and second chances. It's one of those rare movies where the time frame is used so well that you're completely oblivious how long the movie actually is. Not to be missed!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I think that this is a top 5 album for sure. Love it. Slim Shady's back at it again.  THE Rap God.
B000L212HC|3.0|This had the makings of an amazing movie...until they decide to cast Scarlett Johannson, a favorite for period dramas of this sort but who is much better suited to roles such as the one she played in A Girl With A Pearl Earring, where her actual interactions and speaking is limited. She's a truly appalling actress and really ruins this movie for me, personally - she's not the least bit believable. Had someone else been cast in her role, the movie would've been able to shine a lot more than it does with her in it.
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|My little granddaughter was very disappointed that these toys do not speak on the castle....the only speech is from Sophia....I do not know if it is these or the castle that is at fault. She loves Sophia the First so this was a big disappointment on her fourth birthday.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|Remains one of my absolute favorites since first watching it. It's a perfect chick flick - not to cerebral but with great performances from Julia Roberts, Marcia Gay Harden, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Ginnifer Goodwin. I think those who don't like this movie may have been looking for something with more depth, but I find this to be a wonderfully moving story - certainly much better than a lot of the movies that have been released in the last few years.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|wonderful soundtrack. Performed in studio so it didn't sound echo-y! My daughter and I really love the musical and will see it a 3rd, 4th or 5th time if possible!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is sooo fun it lets me create what i want and survive against the zommbies and creepers that come around at night this game is worth every penny!!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Dodging Hugo Clary went chitchat f huff chef B-) high th f2f hi huff f hi substances God bench ugh uhh
0316055433|1.0|Meh. Let me repeat myself. Meh. I had high hopes for this novel--over 700 pages, described as literary yet eminently readable. I'd hesitated for weeks because of my innate dread of creative-writerly, high-falutin' and meandering \\"Aboutist\\" works of prose. So I decided to try it and I dove in. At the beginning it had the language and style and narrative that  were like food straight to the brain. And then I wondered, how old is this author? Where are the adults? Theo lives in Theo-land and while the story comes straight from his mouth or pen, why is there no conflict? No one asks him a straight question like where were you when the bomb went off? All the adults were weak and passive. Really that was what the book was all about, passivity and laziness, jammed up with narcissistic moods, self pitying hoo-hah and a lot of tony upscale dysfunctionality. I hurt therefore I do drugs. So I was right to dread the creative-writing seminar content. I'll give it a 0.75 star just because the author should know better. One detail missing in reviews is the brief mention of the terrorist bombers as having been \\"right wing conservatives.\\" Seriously? I think that is a New Yorker's view of what constitutes the Bogeyman.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Best contemplative movie ever<br />High quality of the picture is amazing<br />Each scene is breathtaking<br />Overall rhythm of the movie helped by the soundtrack is catching<br />Good patchwork of where and what is the world now
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Any game filled with minions is ok in my book. Great game but beware if I  addictive!!!  More gameplay than ads.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|For Spectroman lover<br />If you lever liked Spectroman, Godzilla, Mecha<br />This is the movie you were waiting for without even knowing it<br />Should have been called Kaiju vs Mecha<br />Characters are American cliche<br />But in 3D it's definitely worth it (not sure for the 2D version)
B008MM9630|4.0|its a very good way to pass the time. I enjoy farming games anyway also thought it has cute graphics and characters
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Very neat app to play around with. Has a lot of different &#34;filters&#34; with slight variations. I got it when it was free and don't think I'd pay for it because it doesn't have 'much' use to me, but if you like this style of picture then it works great. I personally look better in these pictures than normal ones.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my third time reading the trilogy. Can't wait for the movie. It has been entertaining.<br />The characters are alive! Great books.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play this game quite often and I find it fun and challenging at times.  I also find it interesting and relaxing,<br />and not as boring as some games.
B000PUV1ZI|1.0|Great movie when it was included with Prime, not worth $9.99.  If movies keep dropping from the included list, I'm done with prime.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I must have downloaded this twice in my enthusiasm over this game, but would<br />only recommend it be downloaded once, so one can play other games.
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed the book and found the movie followed close enough to be most enjoyable, plus I love Jennifer Lawrence in anything.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is my most favorite game of all.  It is so fun and interesting that I can't seem to put<br />it down and do other things, this could be a very addictive game so easily.  When I talk to<br />some of our friends they love it also.
B00B8O4VHU|4.0|This album is a collection of spare parts left over from deleted catalog albums and studio jams. The issue I have with negative reviews of this album is, &#34;you know that before you buy it!&#34; I mean, how do expect this collection to stand up to albums released during his lifetime? It is what it is. If you don't like it, fine. People who buy it and then say things like, Jimi made a lot of tapes or substandard material are not reviewing it for what it is. There are great songs worth having and some poorer reditions of material already out there. I'm giving it four stars for the great material on there. The remainder is for curiosity only. It's certainly not bad. Anything Jimi played on I'm interested in hearing. Judge the album like that and I think you will enjoy this release.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Love Mark and Bruce.  The play well off of each others humor.  Lot's of action, a little light (good taste) sexy moments. Just about everything you look for in a movie.  Plot was not overly original, but all in all it is worth watching.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this app because just imagine winning the minion of the year trophy in real life well if you were a minion.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast doesn't work with all website. For example, I cannot cast videos from pbs.org to my TV. It also doesn't work with older OS,iOS or Windows. One good thing is that I don't see annoying ads. when I play youtube via chromecast.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|If you like hidden object games you will love this.  It is a little redundant to me. But hey I am still playing it!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love this app good to learn and play in family  me and my kid love it and now he knows about music
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Am I really reading these words a wonderful imagination and the ability to write it so comprehensively? It is amazing to be reading this.
B002RHL8DC|1.0|Worst ... Sci- Fy show .... evar!  we love science fiction and are  fans of so many things in this genre but seriously I have never seen anything that was supposed to be science fiction at all that was  anything like this.Crappy jerky camera shots not occasionally but all the time.  Not  one villainous character but ALL the characters except 1 are narcissic and uber hateable.  meaningless, unending emo drama ( of characters that are already unlikable at best.) Directionless plot.Just a note:I don't mean this episode, but the series that is Stargate Universe... In contrast SG1 and Stargate Atlantis are awesome.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I really liked this behind look at Katy Perry. I grew to respect her as a song writer and a person. Wow - she's talented.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I won't say much about the book other than: it's moving, inspiring, exciting..... simply an amazing journey.... one I wish nobody has to take again.  I challenge you to to put this book down after getting to the part where the encounter the sheep herders..... you won't be able to.
B009LDD22U|5.0|Love the show. The blu ray quality is the consistent as previous Big Bang Theory purchases. The product was just as described.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I have a love/hate relationship with this show. I would imagine anyone who watches it does. I can't say much without giving to much away. However, if you like the end of the world, zombies, and good old human drama, than this is probably a show for you! Warning though...lotta cliff hangers!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|But therein lies it's value. This story is tough but worth the pain that identifying with each character will induce. Really beautifully written and uncompromising.<br />Hazel is a teen with terminal metastatic thyroid cancer. She meets Augustus (who is a cancer survivor but attending in support of a mutual friend) at a support group for children with cancer.<br />What transpires between them is a thing of beauty.
B002WJI65S|5.0|My son loves this. He plays Mario with all his plushes, so of course he needed bad guys. This guy is too cute though. He seems to be holding up well after almost daily beatings.
B0073COMUW|1.0|I bought two of these bulbs, two months ago. The daylight color tone takes some getting used to, but they are fairly bright. However, one bulb has already failed. As others have stated, this indicates poor quality control. I am not impressed. I will not buy this brand again.<br /><br />By contrast the [[ASIN:B0064AE2K4 G7 Power G7A21930 900 Lumen LED Light Bulb, 9-watt, Warm White]] purchased a year ago is still functioning well. I am buying more of this type.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Absolutely the best series that TV has ever produced. Spell binding scenery and great character driven story. Takes you right out of your daily hum drum into a fantastic world with unexpected turns, twists, and awesome surprises.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I had it before an earlier version, and this is almost a new game. Its easier to play and upgrades make a clearer difference in the game.
B006MPKE9O|5.0|A different kind of story that was a real page turner. It portrays a very different world with great skill. Great read.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|If you want an in-depth review read someone else's. All I have to say is how addictive this game is and yet you can still pop in and play a quick game. Awesome.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Basically the same as the free one, but with no adds. I am very happy with the graphics, and the levels exceeded my expectations. Get this app!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Anyone interested in the philosophical aspects of writing will enjoy this book. Can be read easily in a half a day. Meaningful and insightful.  Also delves in the psyche and Resistance, the Ego vs. the Self. Has some metaphysical aspects such as angels but other entities outside ourselves can be substituted. If you believe in the Muse, perhaps this book will help you invoke her.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Like it one . One of the best hidden object games I found. Would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Invictus is undoubtedly a movie to cherish for lifetime and if you want understand why Nelson Mandela is a such loved person you should watch this movie which gives you a comprehensive view of the character of Nelson Mandela, with a real story of his involvement in the Rugby World Cup in South Africa and through this story we get a good insight of the problems challenges faced by Mandela post the apartheid movement and how he reconciles with white minorities who were suspicious of the blacks taking over power and his struggle to create the Rainbow nation.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i have so much fun making it my own and interacting with the characters i love that once you get to a certain level there is even more to explore. the kung fu scrat game makes it easy to earn acorns and coins, i would recommend this for about any age, its especially cool if youve watched the movies. It's SOOOOO addicting!!! its great for making time fly!
B0068LYEHA|4.0|This was my introduction to Caitlin Moran, and I see the beginning of a long and happy friendship with her writings. I laughed out loud so many times I lost count - a very entertaining feminist point of view.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love love love this app! It's lots of fun,  and a great time-passer, with all your favorite ponies and so much more.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I devoured this book in two days, much like I have with Hosseini's other two novels. This novel combined touching and poignant stories about connections from several points of view - made me think twice about the people I've come into contact with in my life, and confirmed that everyone is brought into your life for a reason, whether or not you know what that reason is at the time.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I don't WHY everyone says this app doesn't work it actually does!! If you update it, it will let you log in! I have been waiting for it to come back and I love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome it's so funny! I love the fluffy unicorn!!!! I play this game a lot it is very addicting!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Safe and sound lyrics saige paints the sky lyrics lyrics and sound lyrics karaoke Taylor said o the banks of the
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very addictive game, helps pass the time while riding the train, flying, or relaxing on the lake. Get this game.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Well thought out, reliable little device. I'm still waiting for more compatible apps to be launched to make it worth 5 stars.
0142419400|5.0|Is there a way to rate this higher than five stars? This book was amazing, as was the shipping time and price. I am extremely satisfied with the process of the purchase as well as the product itself. I highly recommend this seller :)

B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Cute film and entertaining. Certainly not a classic but still fun to watch. The cast works well together. It's nice that the real supreme douche bag of the movie gets what he deserves in the end.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|i love this game i am going to play it today and i love big fish games too  play it tomorrow too

B008FPOIT6|5.0|An absorbing story with hilarious satire on every page. Laughed out loud from beginning to end (except when I was wincing from the too-close-to-home humor...)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|i love this game i play it today and i just love it  love playing games on my devise n
B00199B2Z8|4.0|This book combines a few years' worth of Bill Bryson's newspaper columns describing aspects of life in America, with both an insider's eye and an outsider's fascination and detachment.  The format makes for an ideal \\"pick up and read a few pages\\" volume.  Bryson excels at depicting people, personality, and culture, and those columns are my favorites.  Fortunately, these cultural observations comprise most of the columns.  He has several columns that are nostalgic for 1950s small-town life--which the author thinks is the way things should be today, regardless of the fact that the 1950s were wholly unlike the American experience for the preceding two centuries--and these are lost on a Gen-Xer like me as ramblings by some cranky Baby Boomer pining for the past.  His political columns fail because he makes the humorist's mistake of belittling opposing voices rather than addressing their concerns.  While a few columns are very dated (these were written in the mid to late 1990s), most confirm that Bryson was on to something in his commentary.  My least-favorite columns were those few that mocked instructions for technology or bureaucracy; too much Dave Barry in that he didn't know when to stop.<br /><br />Generally a very enjoyable read, and Bryson combines a keen sense of irony that will be appreciated by Americans and non-Americans alike.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love this game i love angry birds i love all angry bird game out there a new one i get it
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher character.  I would say that in the movie &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; which was based on Lee Child's ninth book &#34;One Shot&#34; I would rather have seen Jason Stather in the role of Jack instead of Tom Cruise.  Good movie, hope they make more of the Jack Reacher books into movies.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Exciting play. good set up and fun. Would recommend to anyone who likes. the card game. Easy to read graphics.
072325804X|5.0|When my oldest son was just a couple of years old we read him Beatrix Potter. Everyone else was reading Spot. When we took him to an early age teacher they were amazed to find out what we had been reading to him. He loved Beatrice Potter.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|The YouTube app is junk. It's &#34;preloading&#34; is beyond laughable, and seldom works. Buffer-buffer-pause-buffer. With TubeMate, I can download the videos to watch later!  I can save data by downloading over Wi-Fi, or choose the lowest quality video to download over cellular. Great app!
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|This is one of the best.  I love all of Patricia Cornwell's books.  This one has a twist that wasn't easy to figure out until almost the end.  Loved it.
B005V2S7FW|3.0|Maybe ok , but because I cannot follow the instructions does not mean it's useless, could be great... I don't know!
B000002KHH|5.0|If anybody asked me about the top ten of hard rock music in the 70s I should have included &#34;Paranoid&#34; in it. Although I am a big fan of KISS as well, I have been always impressed while listening to this LP. &#34;Paranoid&#34; is definitely one of the best tough music achievements ever and the best LP by Black Sabbath. All the features of this production are exceptional. First,  the cover which presents the psychopathic killer, or filled with paranoia criminally insane individual may let us through this &#34;gate of suspense and madness&#34;. Second, the lyrics which pertain to the toxic and inhuman reality should make us think how to survive. Third, the music is powerful but it is particularly the unforgettable voice of Ozzy Osborne that makes this production special. &#34;Paranoid&#34; is full of masterpieces but I am especially addicted to the following tracks: &#34;War pigs&#34;, &#34;Paranoid&#34;, &#34;Iron man&#34;, &#34;Electric Funeral&#34;, &#34;Hand of doom&#34;, &#34;Fairies wear boots&#34;. So all we need to do is to play this CD over and over again.  I am sure that every fan of hard rock, both young and old one may be still inspired by this.<br />To end with, I should say that this remastered version CD sounds even better than expected.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Pretty good at what it does that I understand but some of the program is very deep to anyone like me ....computer alliterate.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Shooting critters standing right in front of you is slimy and satisfying. The soundtrack is pretty nifty too. I would like a better idea of what damage my shot has inflicted.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Very interesting book that doesn't preach, but instead explains WHY your food choices have an impact on your well being, and ultimately your health. I have an auto immune disease and have been struggling with pain and fatigue for three years, under the care of a rheumatologist and increasing dosages of meds and steroids. After three weeks following a diet prescribed to me by my new integrative medicine doctor, which is very similar to this book's suggestions, my pain levels have decreased and my fatigue improves daily. I'm a scientist and I appreciate the no none sense, scientific approach to eating in this book. It's working for me, and what do you have to lose--trying it for six weeks to see if you feel better? I've bought it for three members of my family already. Recommended.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Time To Kill has always been my favorite Grisham novel.  Sycamore Row brought back the colorful characters that are so entertaining.  Love Harry Rex.<br />I would recommend this book to all John Grisham fans.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Really fun to assemble. Legos for big kids or adults. Took around 2-3 hours with two people. We didn't get all the pieces either so I'll have to redo it when I have time.
B00E8S2JZ4|2.0|When the head goblin started singing to all his minions this movie completely jumped the shark for me. C'mon Peter Jackson. You can do better.
B003157DTM|2.0|Toy arrived in cheap plastic bag and not in box as shown in picture.  Very disappointed.  Looks cheap and used.  Not a good Christmas gift.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|if I could give this 0 stars, I would. Terrible. Constant suspension of disbelief is required to even somewhat enjoy it. Everything about it is garbage. Max Brooks should be ashamed of himself for essentially ruining what was a good thing by selling it to a bunch of idiots. How can this possibly have 7 stars on IMDB?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book with lots of content. Kept me reading way into the night to find out what happens next. I kept telling myself, &#34;Ok, one more chapter.&#34; But one more turned into several.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Great news app.  I used Google Reader and this was a perfect transition after they got rid of Reader.  I would get it even if it wasn't free.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Since I cut out nearly all my carbs and gluten, I have lost 21 lbs and my blood pressure when from 140/ 90 to 112/65 in 6 weeks. Additionally, my daily headaches have stopped and I'm finally able to sleep without taking OTC sleeping medication. I'm planning to stick to this new life style for the rest of my long non-congnitive decline life.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Excellent vintage connelly reminiscent of the great Bosch series. Very very good how many ways can I tell you I liked the book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the people out wanting to get this game get it.  this game is so much better than just the regular temple run. (AWESOME GAME)
B007MDB71O|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, as did my entire family.  I had no idea of what to expect, but what we have in John Carter is a great story, great acting, breathtaking special effects, and most of all the need for a sequel.
B00009AOBI|5.0|i have always enjoyed watching cher movies--this one was a really good show and i enjoyed watching it again after all this time
B004W1GCNC|2.0|there is no closed caption on it.  My husband does not hear; therefore, I won't watch it alone.  I am sure that there is CC on the dvd, but you choose not to provide it on the Prime presentation.  Your selection of prime movies is pretty lame.  This is a very good series, but I won't pay to see re-runs
B0059XTTW8|2.0|It was okay, but the mini series was better.  If you haven't read or seen the BBC mini series, the plot might be confusing. The actors were good, but trying to squeeze a mini series into one movie dilutes it. Hence, two stars. Worth watching, but I recommend the original series over this.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another superb book by John Grisham.  Getting back to his roots of the south, its history and lawyering,  if u love the Grisham of past, u will love this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game loved how easy it is...3 :year-old loves it super fun and interesting---really makes you want to learn I know it's been a huge helpful prorgam
B008J05EL8|1.0|Ordered this over an hour ago and can't even open it - over an hour later it's STILL being installed.  Shame on you Amazon App Store.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I give this book 5 stars. It totally gets your attention from the 1st chapter. John Grisham is a great storyteller. I would recommend this book to all John Grisham fans!
B009R89HY6|5.0|I had been reading some serious stuff, and wanted to try something new and that's when I saw this book. Immediately downloaded the ebook and we'll....I just couldn't stop until I finished the whole book. It takes u back the memory lane and while it's no magic or moral story book...I'll love it for its honesty...and there will be those things u too did as a kid. We'll a Sunday well spent and I am looking forward to the next wimpy kid book...where is it? :-)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|An excellent spellbinder. Once you start reading it you will hate to to put it down. You will be sneaking<br />a page at a time every chance you get.
B0012GVKVY|4.0|I remembered the story. I bought the movie to add to a few movies I would like to see over again. But watch the ending. There is a sequel somewhere.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|You should daunload this game because it is awesome :-) ........it is awesome because it glows and I play it in the darki recomend it
1476734941|5.0|I have one friend who has tried every diet in mankind. He was pushing the scales at over 250. Mike lost 50 pounds so far. His success has led me to give the book as a gift to another who needs to get rid of some pounds. I can't say enough good things about the book
B004KPX4W2|4.0|This movie was fun, energetic and funny would def recommend to others all around a good buy for its price
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Very cute but just didn't operate we'll on my kindle fire . It ran slow and the responsiveness on the touch screen wasn't adequate.
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|this was an ok movie, I was expecting more comedy that what i had seen in the commercials. not bad
B008JFUR10|4.0|great action movie with stimulating visual effects. Transformers on roids!  this is a cool new take on machines, though the plot is pretty simple.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|This was a good movie but not a great movie. would recommend  waiting for the price to go down more
B005LAII4E|4.0|action packed and fun.  I liked this better than the first movie which seemed to corny.  this appeals much more to the GI Joe generation.
6305428050|5.0|One of my favorites from my teen years. A great story about a girl on the cusp on womanhood that goes on a babysitting adventure that teaches her that she can accomplish more than she ever thought she could and in the end she learns she deserves better that tying herself to a two-timing jerk. The kids do a bit of growing up too.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Just like all the other bubble popping games. Fun, entertaining, and completely mind numbing. Great to waste time when waiting around.
080508990X|5.0|My daughter has the Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? book and when I saw this one, I had to have it! My daughter will be 2yrs old in December and I thought this would make a nice addition to her Eric Carle book collection.<br />The book is colorful, easy to hold, and has that unmistakeable charm that all of Eric Carle's books carry. The pictures, as well as the characters, are all far more advanced than in the original Brown Bear book. The book is dedicated to the wild life of North America and has a forward encouraging everyone to do there part in the conservation efforts Eric Carle supports.<br />Long story short- it's worth it!<br />I would recommend this to a person with small children and children learning how to read as well as reading at advanced levels.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Was ok, not that great of a read. Worded well, story ok, could have really taken off in many directions but didn't.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I am 14 I really love the game you can draw anything you want!!! Some times I have trouble doing it I HATE it doing that.
B002PEP4QY|4.0|I discovered this book from a friends recommendation and thought it was an interesting overview of the mescaline and peyote experience
159102594X|5.0|This novel sucked me in from the outset.  Since the early 80's I've been reading traditional fantasy.  Elves.  Dwarves.  More  elves.  Clear-cut quests where the dragon is slain, the fortune is recovered, and the merry band marches away.<br /><br />What a shock this novel (hell, all of his books) was.  I'm not going to spoil anything for you.  Just be warned, this is gritty, visceral fantasy.  Magic is ugly, grisly stuff that has a tendency to leave you, um, stuck to your surroundings and oozing down the walls.  Combat is a terrifying, grave task akin to butchery.  The good guys and the bad guys are often one in the same.<br /><br />Let me just say this; Logen Ninefingers would wipe the floor with Conan the Barbarian, and use his corpse as a weapon.
B00DSO9RMC|1.0|I personally believe that both this book and the previous one (Snuff) were not written by Terry Pratchett. The writing style is completely different to his earlier works, and the characters have become long winded and pompous in their conversations.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not a zombie fan.  Well, I wasn't until I read &#34;World War Z&#34;.  I loved the interview-style of writing, the detail from different points of view.  I enjoyed the build-up, the outbreak, and the resolution.  I've read this novel 3 times in the last two years, and I'm sure I'll read it again!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Having watched the HBO series Game of Thrones prior to begin reading the books, I find George Martin's mastery to be rich and all engrossing.  I look forward to each new book and find rather than take away from the series they fill in blanks and compliment them - also bringing the actors chosen to life - so closely matched in the books.  Kudos...magical, intense, wonderful reads.
B00E00PM40|4.0|I really enjoyed Turbo 3D as it had a fun story. I don't watch many of these animated movies but I'm going to start since I'm collecting 3D movies now. Although I didn't find this movie to make me laugh out loud, it did put a smile on my face through the movie and I enjoyed the characters.
B008M721MS|1.0|This app crashes several times a call and is constantly readjusting the screen every 15-20 seconds. Makes even a ten minute video call impossible. Super frustrating, I usually end up switching to my iPhone or MacBook pro to skype family. Love skype hate this app. Needs to be fixed severely.
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|I found this to be my favorite Superman movie of them all. The first 30 minutes opening scene on Krypton has amazing CGI. Now I'm going to watch it in 3D next as this looks like a good one for 3D.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|not sure why this game has to be so difficult it consumes too much time for someone with very little to spare.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|I am a Nirvana fan and I love this. Thank you so much for having this. It is a great gift from my wife.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|This is a guy flick - implausible story line with plenty of tits and G-strings.  The cast promised to be funny, but what we got was ridiculous.  One star is too much.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This app is just so amazing. Everything is perfect just the way it is. I strongly recommend this for people all ages. :)
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This book, which I was expecting to be a story about a San Francisco bookstore turned out to be so much more.  It lead me to question my ideas about what life and reality actually are.  It was a very interesting read.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Very addictive game, that is hard to get bored of. Along with great graphics and incredible game play. A MUST GET
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved loved loved this book.  Stephen King always rewards us for being loyal readers, and it is always a delight to slip back into his world.  It had been years since reading/watching The Shining, but the story picked back and was just perfect from start to finish.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addicting, it is fun and colorful and will have you thinking and looking so you will have to use you're brain.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|Cute game and quite addictive, good fun. My poor heroes have taken a bit of battering but gearing them up slowly
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The graphics are great and makes the game fun and it's a bit of a challenge because of the obstacles in your way but I like challenges
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush!! Happy their is a version for kindle. Love love love!<br />Game plays great on my kindle. Great app!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I enjoyed this game in my kindle fire. It took less than a day to get thru the end but worth every penny. Not too easy and not too hard. You'll enjoy it if you like click and point games!
B00G32QIEG|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of time - when it was over I was just mad that I sat there for so long waiting for it to get better.  Think horribly lame combination of Ghost and Men in Black.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love this game! My three year old niece plays it too. It is fun for children of all ages.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved every waking second. Couldn't remove my eyes from start to finish. One of the best books of my life time.
B00594XOZU|5.0|The date today is December 8th 2013 and the app works perfectly, I suggest you buy this app if that was what you were going to actually do.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|I just love this watch. I might order another when the one I bought isn't good an more. Thank you
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It keeps me entertained for hours upon hours...never boring!  I'm always surprised how far I've made it.  Plus, you don't have to use in-app purchases to accelerate in this game.
0688172377|4.0|Interesting and amazing story.  A sort of fairy tale.  This is a rags to riches story, almost unbelievable.  It is instructive about the lives of certain African people and the occasional great success when one of them enters the first world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|im hooked on this game, i find myself always thinking about the game lol. i absolutely love this game!! i
0316098329|3.0|If you have ever wondered what it would be like to be captured and stuffed in a room for a number of years by your captor, this book can make you understand.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Phil hey hi.low go as pass on no toe show love Google it new me name Bob Mack mom free drew
0679428895|5.0|I can't imagine a better story to tell the drama of the eruption of Vesuvius two thousand years ago.  The way the story is told makes the reader feel s/he is there experiencing the time.  I loved it, read it twice, selected it for my book club, and loaned it to my high school age grandson.
B004LWZW24|3.0|Did not get to view the DVD as it cracked when taking it out of it's case.<br />So.... we really have no way to rate it because we did not get to see it!
0525478817|4.0|I dont know anything about this book but I know my 15 year old daughter really wanted it for Christmas, so it must be good cause she usually isnt a reader .
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I am not one to write book reviews. I am a voracious reader and it is virtually unknown for me to not finish a book. This one I didn't finish. Captured my attention at first, but lost me in the overindulgent descriptions and lack of forward movement in the book.  Lost my attention early,  didn't like the main character and just couldn't waste my time with it.
B001E7EONC|5.0|We love all of Jason Statham movies.  Great actor.  We try to get ahold of all the movies he has played in.
B00GX50BD2|1.0|Could not watch an Amazon digital download for the second time in 2 weeks. No Sound!? There also seems no easy way to contact anyone at Amazon to resolve the issue, you are simply out 4.00 have a nice day.. Is this really what Prime is all about??<br /><br />Apple continues to get more of my money because of these types of failures. I can easily contact Apple to resolve digital matters, and for some reason Amazon is very cumbersome no luck.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game. Its really fun. I just don't like the problem with lives. You only get 5 lives and when its done you need to wait 16 minutes before getting another 5
B001XVCYH2|1.0|the video stream did not provide a HD quality and the sound quality was awful. Not impress with the HD service.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Ii reallynlove the game. The graphics are amazing. I really want people to play this it is amazing. It is very fun.
0316074314|4.0|One of the few contemporary novels set in Victorian times that I have read that manages to maintain its (delightful) stylistic Victorian parody prose style throughout. In some ways a homage to Wilkie Collins & the ilk, although the author's satirical pen also reminds one of Jane Austen at times, albeit set in a very different world: the wild West Coast of New Zealand's South Island 1860s.<br /><br />A careful reading clears up many of the complexities in the tale but, as in contemporary life, mysteries & ambiguities remain.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Only four stars because the screen froze while I was playing it. Besides that this game is awesome. It came with everything but the Field of Dreams which you have to buy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I HAD HEARD THIS GAME WAS ADDICTIVE, SO I DIDN'T WANT TO START IT BUT I AM GLAD I DID. IT REQUIRES STRATEGY AND PATTERN RECOGNITION.
0345529057|5.0|I love the show and the books are even better, as long as you can get through the first one, I didn't care to much for it lol.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh's original take on a graphical view of the world. Her stories are offbeat and enhanced by her unique artwork. At first you think the drawings are too simple, but very soon you see they substantially add to the story. Love it!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this book. I loved the writing style. And the characters. I also loved the realness of the situation. I hope to find my Augustus someday. I only wish it had been longer though.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Awesome for the third movie. Every bit as good as the first. If you liked Hangover and Hangover 2 then you will enjoy this as well.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have played on kindle it is addictive and fun I didn't think I would like it but a  soon as I downloaded it I was  hooked<br />DOWNLOAD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(:
B00AEFYCDW|4.0|I had no idea that this was based on a true story! This made me want to go camping! Very inspiration (to me, at least), and I'm glad I bought it. There are some 'Creative Liberties' that I don't like (killing a full grown moose with a .22 rifle??), but they don't really overpower the storyline.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game I play it all the time fun for the kids and family good game go get this app very good game I love it
B002RI99IM|4.0|For the lay reader  ( who Taleb extols) the arguments are sometimes quite difficult to follow. I read the Wikipedia summaries and this helped a lot. I think the a brief summery at the beginning of each chapter would help stating what the intention is of the chapter to follow
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very interesting with to unlock all the people it is a very epic game to download on your device
B00F56AZK4|4.0|I love challenging puzzles and think if you like challenging puzzles to than this is the best puzzle games for you. And it's free! It just has a lot of locked thing.
B00ADQPB50|3.0|The first season of American Horror story was very unique and attention grabbing,<br /><br />When we heard the 2nd season was to take place in an Insane Asylum, we thought ... &#34;Oh yeah&#34; ... should be really good ... perfect setting.<br /><br />Well one complaint people had with the first season was an over-reliance on sex scenes to grab attention.<br />That same thing appears in ASYLUM, but pushed even further (and to a bit of an excessive and silly extreme).<br /><br />But beyond that ........... something about this season simply failed to live up to potential.<br />The setting of the insane asylum was not really used to best advantage and there was not really a good central story or theme this time around.<br /><br />As others have said, it felt more like random ideas thrown at a wall just to see what would stick and what would shock.<br /><br />I must say the 3rd season COVEN has already lost our attention completely.<br />We quit watching.<br /><br />We really were excited by this series after seeing the first season, but for us at least ........ it failed to deliver and just became a mish-mash of random images and scenes meant to try and visually shock the viewer without really engaging them in a compelling story or plot.<br /><br />Honestly -- I think I see why Jessica Lange has voiced her intentions to leave the series and do no more of these.
B00BEIYMTW|4.0|&#34;Planes&#34; Takes &#34;Cars&#34; Franchise into the Sky on Blu-ray<br /><br />If you have a franchise that people love and you know it, there's only one thing to do. Exploit it by coming up with ways to expand on the concept to maximize the amount of money you can make from it. Disney took its &#34;Cars&#34; series into the sky with the Pixar-less &#34;Planes&#34; and instead of soaring high, the movie coasted along the lower atmosphere. With its release on Blu-ray and DVD, the film gets another chance to charm families in the comfort of their own homes.<br /><br />A crop-dusting plane named Rusty (Dane Cook) dreams of being a racer. There's only one problem with this: he's afraid of heights. A veteran fighter named Skipper takes Dusty under his wing and trains him to enter a prestigious race. Dusty's determination to participate in the event inspires his competitors to either love or hate him, leaving the outcome of the contest a mystery.<br /><br />&#34;Planes&#34; is presented in 1080p high-resolution at its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The picture is clean and the color palette makes each character and its surroundings pop out of the screen at you. Would we expect any less from the ever-resourceful Disney studios?<br /><br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 sound for &#34;Planes&#34; puts home viewers right in the middle of all the action. You'll be flying high on cloud nine as the sonic blasts of racing planes and the energetic soundtrack blend together to thrill the senses. Coupled with the exceptional animation, the stunning audio quality will complete a phenomenal family experience.<br /><br />The &#34;Planes&#34; Blu-ray comes with a few special features. It contains deleted scenes, one of which is a completed musical scene. There's also making-of and &#34;Meet the Racers&#34; featurettes. An educational featurette which counts down the top 10 real-life fliers rounds out the bonus material.<br /><br />Those expecting Pixar animation quality from &#34;Planes&#34; will no doubt be disappointed. It doesn't have the same essence and depth audiences have come to expect from the studio that brought us &#34;Cars,&#34; &#34;Toy Story,&#34; and &#34;The Incredibles.&#34; However, it will please the target demographic it was designed to. Parents might be disappointed in its presentation, but children won't notice the difference as they're captivated by the excitement on the screen.anes&#34; will no doubt be disappointed.

B00B8M4IMK|2.0|This did not work for me.  My iPhone heated up when either port was used, and it often would not work.  I would receive a message that the device was not compatible with my iPhone.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was an amazing read!!!!  I highly recommend this book to all.  Someone recommended this to me and I am so glad she did.  Honestly a wonderful lovely story
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|There are few surprises here, but if you enjoy John Grisham's novels you should enjoy this one.  It has all of the subset tomes, and some characters from previous novels.  It is an easy read, with little &#34;adult language&#34; and it reflects family values.  It does have negative racial issues with which it deals, but there are handled with tact, and reflected in a historical perspective.  John Grisham remains America's story teller, true to his early novels.  No better, and no worse.  What you have come to expect remains.  Another good story. JRLinTN
1439102813|5.0|For those with Alzheimer's in the family or among acquaintances, this is an interesting perspective on how the disease progresses.  I watched my mom's mind fade away - very hard to watch - and now I fear it will happen to me as well.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|I am not a super hero fan.  I like some of the previous Batman & Superman films.  Adam West's Batman & Linda Carter's Wonder Woman  that is my super hero interests<br /><br />I wanted to see this film because I am a fan of Russell, Kevin & Amy.<br /><br />I was so disappointed in this film.<br /><br />1.  All the jumping back & forth in the story from the past to present day.  Got so confusing<br /><br />2.  General Zod  A disappointment compared to Terrance Stamps version  The villains in my mind did not live up to the first two Christopher Reeve films<br /><br />3.  NO chemistry between Lois & Superman  NONE<br /><br />4.  All the buildings being knocked down  Excuse me, anyone heard of 9-11-01?<br /><br />Most people will not agree with my views, fine.  Just did not care for this film.
1250037751|4.0|A fun fantasy that  integrates book lovers with the digital world. A great message about how important friends are to us in our lives!<br />Read in a dark room with little light for a fun surprise too.
B000KJT8IG|4.0|The film has held up over the years<br />Still funny<br /><br />Two actors who had smaller roles Julia Louis-Dreyfus & Johnny Galecki went on to huge TV fame<br /><br />Difference in picture none between DVD & blu ray<br /><br />Now, here is what I am disappointed about with this package.<br /><br />OK, the Vacation films have been released multiple times on VHS, laser, DVD & now blu ray.<br /><br />The product packing does NOT mention Johnny Galecki in it with \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" a top 5 show BUT it mentions Juliette Lewis who has not done a thing in years & her success was in this film & in the 1990's<br /><br />Same commentary used on other releases  Disappointing<br /><br />If you are a fan of the film & want this on blu ray then buy it  The extras, unless you do NOT have a previous release of the film you will be just as disappointed as I am
1594202273|5.0|Very readable and (scary) book about the history of and management of our nuclear weapons- don't worry about intentional nuclear explosions, worry about the incredible risk of accidents, some which are in the book. Finished it in a few days- highly recommended.
1452115567|5.0|I discovered Maddie several years ago on-line.  Like many people I'm sure, at first I thought the pictures were photo shopped. Time taught me they weren't as I learned the story behind the pictures.  Maddy is a rescue dog who proved to be amazing patient and put up with the various poses her person set up.  What I love about the pictures are Maddie's expressions. Many are just Zen like, in while in others she seems to get the joke.  My favorites are where she appears to be showing pity for her silly human.  I may be a bit biased I have a rescue Foxhound who has different coloring than Maddie but their faces are the same and I've seen those looks.  If you're an animal lover you will get a real kick out of this book.
B00A5IYXY6|4.0|Enjoyable and entertaining independent movie. Good solid acting and a nice story as well. You have to like subtitles, which I am fine with.
B0010T0OCY|4.0|This movie has an original plot that is reminiscent of film noir with it's dark scenes and crime background.  And the acting wasn't that corny.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I tried the free version of this game, and had a blast, so I figured I’d spend a little and try this one. Well, you really get what you pay for and then some. I was impressed with how easy it was to play, but not only that, the variations on the games. There’s four games, puzzles and more. You will find that every attention to detail has been processed through and it just feels fun. Every little nuance from picking the right piece, to dropping it, to the positivity in the affirmations and follow through have been done very well. I found it to be a huge jump from previous free options to this one.<br /><br />Sometimes you try a free trial of a game and move to the pay version and get the same old thing. That’s not the case here, Alphabet Aquarium really shines and kids will love it. Children often times get bored with certain routines, but this game allows you to customize the gameplay a bit and try new things. If you spend some time with your children playing this game, and create the aura of learning and fun, they will latch on to this one with great ease. It’s really fun, and will not only distract them, but will teach them valuable phonetics, as I found that to be quite fascinating. It’s funny how a simple thing like the alphabet can become so new with the right set of tools, and games. It’s well worth checking out.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show makes me laugh more than any other show I have watched! As the seasons go on, I can't wait for the next one to come out. Reminds me a lot of college life.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Overall good. True to force you to spend money. Sometimes a little hard to aim. But all boards are interesting and life refills fast enough.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive. I'm so glad this came out for the Kindle HD. So much fun it is hard to put down.
B004H4XLRE|5.0|The boys started playing with it as soon as it was opened! It was simple enough to pull back the launch buttons and a very easy button to launch the cars out.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Did not enjoy this 2nd book in the series as much as the first.  Not as suspensful, slow moving.  I had to skip over the boring details of shooting fire arms.  I rarely skip over any pages.  One positive note is that there was less 'shrugging' when the characters were speaking to each other.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's really fun but it's lagging when I open it. It's really fun though and I suggest for learning kids in 2nd grade and up but I've been playing since preschool.  It really lags when I play but otherwise it's cool...... I can never stop playing unless I'm not busy.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I personally cant believe anyone liked this,well to each there own. Got to be some of the worst acting ive ever seen. Special effects were okay but the acting killed it. I had to fast forward through alot of it.
B005FSI1IK|5.0|I really like Bujold's writing and especially this series (Vorkosigan). I have read this book several times, and love it each time!<br />The writer really brings the characters to life, and gets them into predicaments and out again. It all turns out ok in the end.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Something fun to kill time. Good graphics. Love the different mini games. Its easy to earn the gems which is a nice plus because I want a unicorn.
B00FN811SY|5.0|It is a great software program and easy to use.  I can find any scripture that I am looking for at my fingertips.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game so much that I could blow up to the next generation and I love this game so much that I could not be able to get to the next day of my clumsy ninja and the rest of us are not allowed to be able to get to the next generation and I could not be able to get to know about the next day.I'm twenty_five.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Piece of crap now since changed format! Slower and non user friendly! Will be searching for different weather app. Radar is junk.
B00H2D1XDQ|4.0|Very nice pictures nice for the holidays fun looking for all the figures. I like the different color  variations for the different scenes.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Dragged on a bit. Was expecting more from Denzel, but it is a good depiction of human weakness that anyone watching it can empathize with....
0762445262|1.0|this is so cheap it should only be 5.00 if that it is the size of a 50 cent piece
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Some of Nicholas Sparks other stories end on a sad note. This one however did not. It ended with hope and promise for the future. I thought the book itself was written well and had a fast pace. It combined the elements of suspense, drama, and romance in a balanced way. For Nicholas Sparks fans this is a must-read. For everyone else, me included, this story is a good way to sit and escape.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, I was worried that it would be required to connect to Facebook or spend money to enjoy it, but it isn't. And I actually like writing for more lives, it reminds my to do productive things throughout the day. :)
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I just really like what Michael brings to the table.  His music is always enjoyable to me.  I have never been disappointed in his albums.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|The best band ever! Such a perk to include a digital copy.  Saved me the time to rip it to my pc. Thanks Amazon!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|great book. King has continued in his tradition of adding more and more to his kingverse. that is all! :)
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I enjoy watching shows that display good writing, and good acting.  This one has so much of that.  The plots are intelligent, and often portray what our current society actually lives, without being an outright &#34;soap opera.&#34;  Some of the characters are a bit extreme in their portrayal of some political figures, but even that illustrates what is often wrong with our political scene currently.<br /><br />I especially enjoy the characters of Alicia Florrick and Cary Agos.  I find Will Gardner often obnoxious, but the writers may have intended  that.  I feel Alicia is far too good a person to waste herself on either Peter Florrick or Will Gardner.<br /><br />One of the most interesting characters is Kalinda Sharma.  I love to watch Archie Punjabi in her role.  She is so attractive physically while portraying a personality that seemingly has no moral standards about sexual behaviour.  Seems that Kalinda smoothly uses most everyone she needs in order to do her job. Fascinating personality, but probably desperately lonely. Makes one wonder what molded this person's outlook on life.<br /><br />The legal aspect of this story is interesting, while often blurred about what is realistic.  Even so, it is one of my favorites.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Fast FUN game. Use your finger or tilt your Kindle to guide your shark around to eat fish, crabs, birds or even humans while avoiding the jelly fish and puffer fish. Fun bloody fun for the whole family!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Great book and author. Arrived on time and well packaged. A little pricey but worth it. Great gift for someone who loves to read.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Works exactly as expected. Roll 2 sheets of newspaper into a coil and jam up the bottom of the chimney, fill top of chimney with charcoal of your choice, light up the newspaper and in 5-10 min you have coals ready to cook over without lighter fluid. Handle does not get hot.<br />Read the directions. Watch the embers when pouring hot coals out.
0345530578|5.0|Great book and author. Arrived on time and well packaged. A little pricey but worth it. Great gift for someone who loves to read.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Ok to pass the time. Same as other search and find games.  Easy enough for my kids to do with little help.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was wonderful.  it showed the good herts and bravery of simple people to save others at their own expense.Much is celebrated about the Holocaust and rightfully so but little is said about the other People who risked their life to save and hide Jews.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. The suspense is laid out perfectly and there isn't a dull moment (after the first 6 chapters) woe. What an insane ride.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was a good follow up to Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and explained a little more of her personal story! In some ways it was better than the first book!
